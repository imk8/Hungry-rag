The umami and creamy sea urchin balanced with the sweetness of the shrimp and slight saltiness of the caviar to produce a full flavour profile with each mouthful. Loved the perfectly (teppanyaki) seared abalone with risoni and the A5 Kobe wagyu dipped in the egg yolk (it was so silky, tender and flavourful from the marbling). Service was excellent as well; they were jovial and attentive and made the experience delightful.\n","                        Review 2: This is a late review. I came here during valentines weekend. Both my friend and I had food poisoning and I was bed ridden for three days.

This meal of 3 fish cause only $80+.\n","\n","                        They also have some pretty affordable lunch set.\n","                        Review 2: Five stars for everything (except maybe the receptionist that received us.. kind of rude). The chefs were super friendly (sat at the counter), and I had nice small talk with them while eating.\n","                        Review 3: Excellent upscale Japanese restaurant great for a date.\n","                        Lobster uni maki was out of this world. Amazing flavours and textures in a single mouthful.\n","\n","                        Option: 3:\n","                        Name: KOMA Singapore\n","                        Address: 2 Bayfront Ave, # B1 - 67, Singapore 018972\n","\n","                        Price Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\n","                        Rating: 4.3\n","                        Review 1: Really nice restaurant with great food and perfect service. The atmosphere can get quite uncomfortable because it is always packed. Prices are reasonable for quality and location. Very recommended for date nights.\n","                        Review 2: Obviously, the main attraction would be the interior lighting. Can't deny the entire place makes a great backdrop for IG-worthy photos.\n","                        Review 3: Celebrated my wife birthday there recently, was a very nice place. Food was truly amazing and the staffs were very friendly and helpful in many ways.\n","                  Answer:\n","                  1. Sen of Japan is the best choice as it has serves sushi ('Lobster uni maki'), on top of that it has the highest rating of 4.3 out of the other options. Lastly, it was 'great for a date' as mentioned in the review. It is also open till 22:00 as needed.\n","                  2. A close scond would be KOMA Singapore. It has a great great interior lighting for a romantic atmospher and quality food. It also has a good rating of 4.3 but did not explicitly mention if sushi is served.\n","                  3. Waku Ghin is the third choice as it is more expensive than the other choices. It is 'totally not worth it even tho the food was great' as quoted from a review.\n","                \n","                  ________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n","                  ACTUAL:\n","                  Question:\n","                  {query[\"question\"]}\n","                  Requirements:\n","                  {query[\"requirements\"]}\n","                  Context:\n","                  {str(query[\"context\"])}\n","                  Answer:\n","                  \"\"\"\n","        input = self.tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors='pt')\n","        input_ids = input[\"input_ids\"].to(\"cuda\")\n","        temperature=0.8\n","        with torch.no_grad():\n","            generation_output = self.model.generate(\n","                input_ids=input_ids,\n","                temperature=temperature,\n","                top_p = 1.0,\n","                do_sample=True,\n","                return_dict_in_generate=True,\n","                max_new_tokens=200,\n","              )\n","        s = generation_output.sequences[0][len(input_ids[0]):]\n","        query[\"generated_answer\"]= self.tokenizer.decode(s)\n","        \n","        del s\n","        del input\n","        del input_ids\n","        torch.cuda.empty_cache()\n","        \n","        print(f'\\n____GENERATED ANSWER:____\\n{query[\"generated_answer\"]}\\n\\n')\n","        return query, \"output_1\"\n","\n","    def run_batch(self, queries):\n","        #
