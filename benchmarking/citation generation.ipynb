There was the familiar sweetness and soy although it tasted a little less garlicky than it used to be! However  with that, the chewy toppoki and crunchy sweet potato was great.\\nLast time what made this chicken dish heavenly was a small bowl of spicy sauce on the side.

The platter was beautifully presented with the inviting melted cheese on the side\\n- Ice lemon tea was very good\\n\\nChir chir has interesting drinks. Amongst others ...\\nPassion Yellow Tok! Tok!  A pale yellow Jug of mocktail. Today it was not available.\\nBlue lemonade: By the time the blue jug with greenish and yellow hue came on the adjacent table we had ordered our ice lemon tea. but it was very tempting\\n\\nIt was a lot of food already but i still missed the Topokki and Cheese.

Chir Chir used to be one of my go to place for korean fried chicken fix but after today experience, i will not want to go back. A few of the dishes that we would like to order was unavailable. Not sure if it is because we reached at 8pm or it is always unavailable. The honey butter chicken is the worst dish ever!!! I DO NOT RECOMMEND The Honey Butter Chicken. It used to be quite tasty with real honey and butter now it is replaced with some honey flavoured powder which smell and taste AWFUL.

following task, you are to determine whether the LLM's output is relevant to the provided context. Two examples are given to illustrate how to assess relevance. Carefully compare the LLM's output with the given context, and then state whether the output is supported by the context.\n    EXAMPLE 1:\n    LLM Output:\n        1. Sen of Japan is the best choice as it serves sushi ('Lobster uni maki'), and it has the highest rating of 4.3 out of the other options. Additionally, it was described as 'great for a date' in a review and is open until 22:00.\n        2. A close second is KOMA Singapore. It has excellent interior lighting for a romantic atmosphere and quality food. It also has a rating of 4.3 but doesn't explicitly mention serving sushi.\n        3. Waku Ghin is the third choice as it is more expensive than the others. A review stated it was 'totally not worth it even though the food was great'.\n\n    Context for Example 1: \n        Name: KOMA Singapore\n        Address: 2 Bayfront Ave, # B1 - 67, Singapore 018972\n        Price Level: None / 4\n        Rating: 4.3\n        Review 1: Really nice restaurant with great food and perfect service. The atmosphere can get quite uncomfortable because it is always packed. Prices are reasonable for quality and location. Very recommended for date nights.\n        Review 2: Obviously, the main attraction would be the interior lighting. Can't deny the entire place makes a great backdrop for IG-worthy photos.\n        Review 3: Celebrated my wife's birthday there recently, was a very nice place. Food was truly amazing and the staffs were very friendly and helpful in many ways.\n\n    Is the LLM Output Supported by the Context for Example 1?\n    Answer: Yes, it is relevant.\n\n    EXAMPLE 2:\n    LLM Output:\n        1. Sen of Japan is the best choice as it serves sushi ('Lobster uni maki'), and it has the highest rating of 4.3 out of the other options. Additionally, it was described as 'great for a date' in a review and is open until 22:00.\n        2. A close second is KOMA Singapore.

Waku Ghin is the third choice as it is more expensive than the others. A review stated it was 'totally not worth it even though the food was great'.\n\n    Context for Example 2: \n        Name: Saizerya\n        Address: 3 Changi City Ave, Singapore 890233\n        Price Level: 3 / 4\n        Rating: 2.3\n        Review 1: Terrible restaurant with bad service, food is bad.\n        Review 2: Pasta was delicious and was really cheap. Enjoyed the food.\n        Review 3: Had a medium time at Saizerya.
