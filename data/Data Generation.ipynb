Basically we can only order 1 waffle, it’s too many people, the person sitting beside be kept accidentally elbow me and apologies, but we all know it’s not her fault, simply because we sit too closely. Almost right after we finished the food, the staff cleared out place and told us there are people outside waiting. I believe the staff are well trained but the customer flow was dissatisfied, I can’t even be border to check out the ice cream because there’s too many people.

Couldn't get her name, the skinny and slim one. Her service was excellent and friendly. She recommended us the desserts promptly when we just sat down and provided us with excellent service throughout.\n","\n","Had the mochi waffle (which was recommended) with a salted caramel and Hokkaido lavender ice cream. Was thoroughly disappointed😔🥺😓. And it cost $19.25😮‍💨The mochi waffle had a really strong egg taste, which did not complement the sweetness of the ice cream flavours. In addition, the ice cream were a little too sweet and had a tinge of an artificial taste. +1 for the presentation and ambience -3 for the cost, taste and standard.\n","\n","Was early and the store just opened. Ordered through online and entering the credit card details was tough without my glasses. The waffle was nice with caramel and Speculous ice cream and marshmallows.

But probably not worth the price sadly but other then that would recommend. It gets rather crowded coming to 8~9pm\n","\n","Desert First is a beacon of sweet indulgence.

If you crave sweet dessert then you should definitely go here. The menu we tried (butter milk waffle with strawberry cheese cake scoop and cookies and cream scoop, chocolate cookie drink and mocha frappe) were nice.  Additionally, The cafe wasn’t crowded and the mood was great !\n","\n","However, maybe because we went a bit late (we went after dinner), some of menu we wanted originally were sold out.\n","\n","Cosy cafe serving mainly ice cream. Nice place to chill after dinner.\n","\n","We enjoyed the Buttermilk waffles — it was nice and crispy on the outside. The Biscoff and Milo and Salted Caramel ice cream were creamy and flavourful 👍\n","\n","The cheesy nachos were nothing to shout about, but still acceptable.\n","\n","I visited Lola Faye cafe along Hamilton road on a bustling Friday evening around 10. Parking was a bit of a challenge due to limited street-side options, but I found a solution by using the multi-story parking at the Jalan Besar Sports Complex down the road, just a short 2-minute walk away. The cafe's location near the main road is convenient.\n","\n","Upon entering, I was greeted by a visually pleasing interior. However, my initial impression was marred when I was seated at a table with a significant piece of laminate hanging from its side. Not the best start.\n","\n","I opted for a waffle with two scoops of ice cream. The dark chocolate ice cream was a highlight, but the bubble gum/cotton candy flavor left much to be desired. They added some colorful crunchy cereal bits, which was a nice touch.\n","\n","One downside was their policy of not serving tap water and suggesting bottled water instead. We requested room temperature water but received a chilled bottle, which was a bit frustrating.\n","\n","I also attempted to order a lychee-flavored fizzy float, but they were out of stock. So, I settled for the peachy peach flavor, which turned out to be excessively sweet, exacerbated by the addition of a scoop of ice cream. The peach flavor was hardly discernible beneath the overwhelming sweetness.\n","\n","On the positive side, the prices were reasonable, and the staff were polite. While Lola Faye cafe may not be at the top of my list for a revisit, its late closing time of 2 am could make it an option for those seeking a late-night dessert fix.\n","\n","Reasonably priced drinks and items, and the vibe was good. Even though they said 60 mins dining time, because there wasn’t any customers, we chatted in store for about 2 hours or so hahah\n","\n","The waffle was a little “batter-y”, like it’s not fully cooked but it’s still okay. Also they claimed the special menu nacho and chicken (?) is already 20% off even though the  receipt didn’t state it, but to give the benefit of the doubt then. The fizzy float was good, cant go wrong. Nothing special about the ice cream but it was filling. Overall just a good vibe\n","\n","Tried the ayam merah wrap, it was superb, i was surprised that it came with a set of nachos. Unfortunately didnt manage to try their specialty satay wrap. The waffle was soft and buttery. I tried with Milo and Cookie nd cream gelato, with maple sauce. It is on point.\n","\n","The drinks are nice. Esp their strawberry milkshake, it has a refreshing taste. The double chocolate ice float was good. And the caramel cookie chip frappe was excellent, more to a coffee flavoured drink.\n","\n","The ambience was cozy and not crowded.

I was so disappointed to be served a half-filled plastic cup of matcha latte for $7 and the picture attached below is literally how it looked like when it was served. And the waffles was def not worth the price. It is extremely small and nothing special at all. The only commendable thing is the range of ice cream choices but do note that most of them are “GOLD” flavours so means you have to top up more $$ to pay for it and thus limits your flavour options if you’re going for the basic flavours (which imo is still expensive lol)!!\n","\n","When you get best of both world at the same place.

The service was hospitable and genuine, no pretense despite being a Michelin-starred restaurant. Alex and Kim were friendly and was impeccable in their service. Food was amazing with unique combinations of fresh ingredients. Chef also came over to each table to interact which we felt was an awesome touch. Strongly recommended!\\nReview 2: Well deserved Michelin Restaurants.\\nThe bread is so crispy on the outside and so so so soft on the inside. Pairing with the bordier butter, it is really exceptional.\\nEvery dish of the food is amazing.\\n\\nThe service is so good. When the table is full of crumbs, the waiter will clean it up to sweep away the crumbs. The waiter are also friendly and knowledgeable about the dishes.\\nWhen we found a bone in the fish and the chef came out to apologize. Felt the service was so good.\\n\\nThe atmosphere in the round room felt great too.\\nReview 3: One of the best fine dining places I’ve ever been to! I can’t keep track of what was being served because there was just so many different courses, but each course was really tasty 🥰 I don’t think I’m a small eater but I was so full by the last few courses, I don’t think I ate any at all. Remember to pace yourself. I’m most impressed by their bakes; their toasty black sesame bread was literally the best bread I’ve ever had in my life.\\n\\nOption: 2:\\nName: Burnt Ends\\nAddress: 7 Dempsey Rd, #01-02, Singapore 249671\\nPhone: 6224 3933\\nDelivery Available: Yes\\nDine-In Available: Yes\\nOpening Hours:\\nMonday: Closed\\nTuesday: 6:00\\u2009–\\u200911:00\\u202fPM\\nWednesday: 6:00\\u2009–\\u200911:00\\u202fPM\\nThursday: 12:00\\u2009–\\u20092:30\\u202fPM, 6:00\\u2009–\\u200911:00\\u202fPM\\nFriday: 12:00\\u2009–\\u20092:30\\u202fPM, 6:00\\u2009–\\u200911:00\\u202fPM\\nSaturday: 12:00\\u2009–\\u20092:30\\u202fPM, 6:00\\u2009–\\u200911:00\\u202fPM\\nSunday: Closed\\n\\nPrice Level: 3 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\\nRating: 4.5\\nReview 1: Super fun, super yummy, super people, burnt ends is such a lovely place to dine at and worthy of their Michelin star! This is a place that focuses on flavour bombs and not looking pretentious at all. Love the touch of fire and smoke in all their dishes that add a beautiful layer of complexity of flavour. Special thank you to the team for looking after my friend who doesn’t eat beef by replacing it with something equally delicious, small touches like this show that this is a restaurant that really cares for its diners. Don’t miss out on burnt ends!\\nReview 2: We went for the chef selection.\\nThe portions was small so can try many things.\\n\\nTaste wise are beyond average, but not to the extend of giving a lot of excitement\\nThe dessert was great. Wines was great.\\n\\nDefinitely nice environment for sure\\nVery good service.\\nReview 3: Tried the chef’s menu where the head chef Vincent prepared for us highlights of Burnt ends plus some new items.\\n\\nReally enjoyed the dinner. Firstly, the service was exceptional. One person on my table doesn’t eat raw food or beef and Vincent prepared a menu that catered to that for her.\\n\\nThe food was also mind blowing. The food really made use of amazing fresh ingredients that are cooked to perfection. The beef steak at the end had a nice char to the crust. The uni on the crab toast was mouth wateringly good. The marmalade beef on toast was also so soft and delicious.\\n\\nOverall, a superb dinner. The cocktails and wine selection were also amazing, and I highly recommend ordering.\\n\\nOption: 3:\\nName: Braci\\nAddress: 52 Boat Quay, #05-01/ #06-01, Singapore 049841\\nPhone: 6866 1933\\nDelivery Available: No\\nDine-In Available: Yes\\nOpening Hours:\\nMonday: 12:00\\u2009–\\u20091:30\\u202fPM, 6:00\\u2009–\\u200911:00\\u202fPM\\nTuesday: 12:00\\u2009–\\u20091:30\\u202fPM, 6:00\\u2009–\\u200911:00\\u202fPM\\nWednesday: 12:00\\u2009–\\u20091:30\\u202fPM, 6:00\\u2009–\\u200911:00\\u202fPM\\nThursday: 12:00\\u2009–\\u20091:30\\u202fPM, 6:00\\u2009–\\u200911:00\\u202fPM\\nFriday: 12:00\\u2009–\\u20091:30\\u202fPM, 6:00\\u2009–\\u200911:00\\u202fPM\\nSaturday: 12:00\\u2009–\\u20091:30\\u202fPM, 6:00\\u2009–\\u200911:00\\u202fPM\\nSunday: 12:00\\u2009–\\u20091:30\\u202fPM, 6:00\\u2009–\\u200911:00\\u202fPM\\n\\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\\nRating: 4.5\\nReview 1: Our experience at Braci was probably one of our most memorable meals and the food served was truly deserving of its Michelin star. Would highly recommend getting the seven course menu as there were so many more elements in our dinner incorporated that made it all the more special. Flavours were all very well balanced and overall we left feeling very satisfied.\\nReview 2: Visited in Sep 2023\\n\\nBraci was on my list of restaurants to visit for over 4 years and I must say that it was worth the wait. It is no surprise that Braci has retained its Michelin 1 star for 6 consecutive years. The menu was a progressive one which is definitely inspired by Chef Mattie’s Italian roots. There are 2 choices for people (5 course and 7 course). I would suggest people to go for the 7 course as the additional dishes in the 7 course meal are worth it. One of my favourite parts of the experience was trying out the 100 yr old balsamic vinegar.\\n\\nIf you’re not taking the wine pairing, I would strongly recommend folks to try out a few of their cocktails, esp. their Negroni (one of the most unique ones I’ve had)\\n\\nService was good. The restaurant is able to cater to some food allergies (like my shellfish allergy).\\n\\nA definite recommendation for fine dining lovers.\\nReview 3: Amazing time at Braci for a birthday celebration for my husband. The Italian food was superb with beautiful floral aesthetic to each dishes. Staff is polite and friendly too! Special thanks to Chef Matteo who is very engaging and make the day extra special! Love the black truffle \"hide and seek\" dish which is one of the highlights of all dishes! It so savoury and unforgettable….\\n\\nOption: 4:\\nName: Nouri\\nAddress: 72 Amoy St, Singapore 069891\\nPhone: 9230 2477\\nDelivery Available: Information Not Available\\nDine-In Available: Yes\\nOpening Hours:\\nMonday: Closed\\nTuesday: Closed\\nWednesday: 12:00\\u2009–\\u20092:30\\u202fPM, 6:00\\u202fPM\\u2009–\\u200912:00\\u202fAM\\nThursday: 12:00\\u2009–\\u20092:30\\u202fPM, 6:00\\u202fPM\\u2009–\\u200912:00\\u202fAM\\nFriday: 12:00\\u2009–\\u20092:30\\u202fPM, 6:00\\u202fPM\\u2009–\\u200912:00\\u202fAM\\nSaturday: 6:00\\u202fPM\\u2009–\\u200912:00\\u202fAM\\nSunday: 12:00\\u2009–\\u20092:30\\u202fPM, 6:00\\u202fPM\\u2009–\\u200912:00\\u202fAM\\n\\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\\nRating: 4.6\\nReview 1: An exceptional experience, very fortunate to have visited this unique restaurant last night. These folks have real flair, making the visit enjoyable from the moment we arrived. I think that I can relate to the chefs “cross roads” concept, an amazing set menu with elements from across the globe. Great wine pairing, loved hearing the story lines.  Loved the casual, relaxed atmosphere. Everything presented with confidence and fun.  Well deserving of its Michelin status.  Each course was remarkable, but I was particularly taken with the chocolate fish ball!\\nReview 2: I recently visited Nouri and I must say, the experience was outstanding. The food was absolutely delicious, with a unique blend of cross-cultural flavors that truly impressed my taste buds. From start to finish, every dish was beautifully presented and expertly prepared.\\n\\nThe renovated space is also fantastic, with a modern yet elegant atmosphere that adds to the overall dining experience. There is also a renewed chef table.\\n\\nThe service was top-notch and the staff was incredibly attentive. I highly recommend Nouri to anyone looking for an exceptional dining experience in Singapore.\\n\\nThank you, Nouri, for an unforgettable evening!\\nReview 3: The owner did a wonderful service. We went in for lunch before our flight and the service was prompt and the food came out in a nice pace for lunch. The food was ok and this is my second time here. It has been consistent during the years. This is a nice spot to bring business guest for lunch as it is usually quiet during lunch in the area where most of the comparable restaurants may only open for dinner.  Yes, it is quite pricey.\\n\\nOption: 5:\\nName: Lolla\\nAddress: 22 Ann Siang Rd, Singapore 069702\\nPhone: 6423 1228\\nDelivery Available: Yes\\nDine-In Available: Yes\\nOpening Hours:\\nMonday: 12:00\\u2009–\\u20092:30\\u202fPM, 6:00\\u2009–\\u200911:00\\u202fPM\\nTuesday: 12:00\\u2009–\\u20092:30\\u202fPM, 6:00\\u2009–\\u200911:00\\u202fPM\\nWednesday: 12:00\\u2009–\\u20092:30\\u202fPM, 6:00\\u2009–\\u200911:00\\u202fPM\\nThursday: 12:00\\u2009–\\u20092:30\\u202fPM, 6:00\\u2009–\\u200911:00\\u202fPM\\nFriday: 6:00\\u2009–\\u200911:00\\u202fPM\\nSaturday: 12:00\\u2009–\\u20092:30\\u202fPM, 6:00\\u2009–\\u200911:00\\u202fPM\\nSunday: Closed\\n\\nPrice Level: 3 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\\nRating: 4.4\\nReview 1: Absolutely loved the food here. The sea urchin is terrific - we had the 1/2 portion with the pudding and it\\'s more than enough as it\\'s quite rich. The quail is a must order, so tender & juicy. Service is top notch. Although I will say that the cheesecake was just so so. Will definitely return soon. Easy to make reservations online\\nReview 2: all the chef standing there when preparing food are very friendly willing to talk to customers probably is close to all the chef at the counter seat , feeling very close and cozy, when enjoying food there.  floor staff are also friendly, since self pampering with friends there every tue , is like a canteen for us.  Expensive for a quick lunch, we always go back there for uni pudding & salad, is a place that food won’t goes wrong have a stable quality.  All chef there not much break 3-5pm still need to prep for dinner.  Maybe not the food attract us but are the chef n waiter waitress we enjoy chitchat with them during our lunch very warm.\\nReview 3: This restaurant is hands down one of the best, if not the best restaurant we have eaten at. The food was exquisite, the quality of the food was just incredible. The staff were lovely, chef Jo even come out to check on how the food was. Cannot recommend this place enough. My 9 year old even had her own 3 course menu just for her. Will definitely return when we are back in Singapore! Thank you to the team at Lolla 🙏😍\\n\\nOption: 6:\\nName: Cure\\nAddress: 21 Keong Saik Rd., Singapore 089128\\nPhone: 9338 4207\\nDelivery Available: No\\nDine-In Available: Yes\\nOpening Hours:\\nMonday: Closed\\nTuesday: 6:00\\u2009–\\u200910:00\\u202fPM\\nWednesday: 6:00\\u2009–\\u200910:00\\u202fPM\\nThursday: 12:00\\u2009–\\u20092:00\\u202fPM, 6:00\\u2009–\\u200910:00\\u202fPM\\nFriday: 12:00\\u2009–\\u20092:00\\u202fPM, 6:00\\u2009–\\u200910:00\\u202fPM\\nSaturday: 12:00\\u2009–\\u20092:00\\u202fPM, 6:00\\u2009–\\u200910:00\\u202fPM\\nSunday: Closed\\n\\nPrice Level: 3 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\\nRating: 4.6\\nReview 1: The food was really good and quite surprising. Everything was really original and tasty. Special mention for the main courses which were amazing, espacially the Mussels one. I was also quite surprised, in a good way, by the wines. The only thing I can say is that it was a little too cold in the room for me. Thank you very much for the experience.\\nReview 2: The dining experience was very enjoyable. I thought the overall ambience and plating / presentation were 10/10. What stood out most was the hospitality. The staff noted it was my husband’s birthday and gave a little something which was thoughtful and useful - a little goodie bag comprising samplers of Irish cream, the very same bacon butter that came with the soda bread in the menu, and a useful fridge magnet with the recipe of the said bread. Such a nice way to remember the meal by!\\nReview 3: Visited in Oct 2023 as part of the SG Restaurant Week\\n\\nGood starters where my favourite was the treacle bread. The foie gras brûlée was also decent. Among the mains I really liked the beef preparation and also the fish & squid laksa. The meal rounded off with a couple of very nice dessert items. The “Irish Cloud” dessert was particularly good.\\n\\nAll in all, Cure is a very solid restaurant and should be on your F&B places to visit in SG.\\n\\nOption: 7:\\nName: Shinji by Kanesaka\\nAddress: 29 Tanglin Rd, Singapore 247911\\nPhone: 6884 8239\\nDelivery Available: Yes\\nDine-In Available: Yes\\nOpening Hours:\\nMonday: 12:00\\u2009–\\u20093:00\\u202fPM, 6:00\\u2009–\\u200910:30\\u202fPM\\nTuesday: 12:00\\u2009–\\u20093:00\\u202fPM, 6:00\\u2009–\\u200910:30\\u202fPM\\nWednesday: 12:00\\u2009–\\u20093:00\\u202fPM, 6:00\\u2009–\\u200910:30\\u202fPM\\nThursday: 12:00\\u2009–\\u20093:00\\u202fPM, 6:00\\u2009–\\u200910:30\\u202fPM\\nFriday: 12:00\\u2009–\\u20093:00\\u202fPM, 6:00\\u2009–\\u200910:30\\u202fPM\\nSaturday: 12:00\\u2009–\\u20093:00\\u202fPM, 6:00\\u2009–\\u200910:30\\u202fPM\\nSunday: Closed\\n\\nPrice Level: 4 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\\nRating: 4.6\\nReview 1: I have been in shinji two times but my previous visit was excellent! we had long omakase. the sequence were balance, materials are fresh and excellent quality of freshness. two kind of uni were also still firm (not watery). I think that would be better if some “aburi” are added, that would give some equisite medley on the whole omakase. special sake for shinji was well presented with balance, elegant body and fruity. well served by the chef that can speak little indonesian that made us even relax, the waiter is very attentive. thank you for an excellent gourmet and services.\\nReview 2: Had the 15 course sushi and enjoyed it very much. Highlights for me were the Chutoro, Aji, Shiro ebi and Uni. The Chef and staff were very hospitable and I look forward to my next visit!\\nReview 3: Amazing omakase experience with fresh ingredients.

We are dining in the chapel and drinking at bar under the leaded glass window at the dark of the night. So yeah, whatever suits you, it is unusual but  also the venue was nicely done. It is very dimmed and atmospheric (no, it is not Halloween kind).\\n\\nThe service was lovely - it was warm, friendly, prompt  and every proper. In comparison to restaurants in its class,  Claudine shone that night.\\n\\nThe menu changes every now and then. Although I could not get the uni pasta, the food did not disappoint. The menu was short but well-thought of. The wine offering was appropriate for the food. and the cocktails were  tasty and well-balanced. This restaurant may well be slightly pricier than their peer across the street but each has their unique point.\\n\\nWe were happy with the experience and would love to come back.\\nReview 2: A beautiful lunch at Claudine. Set in a restored church with beautiful stained glass, the meal is equally just as holy.\\n\\nThe sea bream carpaccio with blood orange to start was beautifully fresh, accompanied with great bread and butter for the table. For mains, the brown mushroom and morel ravioli was scrumptious, vol-au-vent soul-warming, and the Hokkaido scallops perfectly cooked and complimented well with the hazelnuts. With a side of french beans and finished with the most delectable apple tart, we were in heaven!\\nReview 3: Outstanding venue, from the moment we stepped in it was like the outside world faded away. 1 star less on food as the mussels is rather small. The steak is a must, loved the prep in front of you and the sauce is too good. Will probably be back just for the steak. The chocolate souffle is wonderful. Molten, fluffy dices with sea salt. Highly recommend this place 👍\\n\\nOption: 9:\\nName: Lawry\\'s The Prime Rib Singapore\\nAddress: 333A Orchard Rd, #04 - 01 / 31, Singapore 238897\\nPhone: 6836 3333\\nDelivery Available: Yes\\nDine-In Available: Yes\\nOpening Hours:\\nMonday: 11:30\\u202fAM\\u2009–\\u200910:00\\u202fPM\\nTuesday: 11:30\\u202fAM\\u2009–\\u200910:00\\u202fPM\\nWednesday: 11:30\\u202fAM\\u2009–\\u200910:00\\u202fPM\\nThursday: 11:30\\u202fAM\\u2009–\\u200910:00\\u202fPM\\nFriday: 11:30\\u202fAM\\u2009–\\u200910:30\\u202fPM\\nSaturday: 11:30\\u202fAM\\u2009–\\u200910:30\\u202fPM\\nSunday: 11:30\\u202fAM\\u2009–\\u200910:00\\u202fPM\\n\\nPrice Level: 4 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\\nRating: 4.4\\nReview 1: It is a high-class environment, evoking an upscale atmosphere. While the setting exuded elegance, there\\'s room for improvement in the service department. We did find ourselves waiting a considerable amount of time to place our order.\\n\\nThe restaurant offers a unique amenity: photo-taking services with free prints. However, we encountered a slight hiccup when our photo wasn\\'t promptly printed. A bit of a delay ensued before we finally received our printed photo.\\n\\nOpting for the anniversary 4-course meal set, which comprised a starter, appetizer, main, dessert, and beverage, we were treated to a mix of flavors. The standout was undoubtedly the signature prime rib, a delectable dish that is an absolute must-try. On the other hand, the braised beef rib fell slightly short of expectations, with the sauce impressing more than the somewhat dry meat.\\n\\nWe indulged in the chocolate cake and strawberry trifle for dessert. While the chocolate cake delighted our taste buds, the strawberry flavor of the trifle didn\\'t quite resonate with our preferences.\\n\\nAdding to the thoughtful experience, complimentary drinking water was a nice touch, as was the complimentary cake for those celebrating birthdays.\\nReview 2: Great ambience, great service.\\n\\nOnly issue is the tenderloin which is too dry. Love their prime steak which is carved for us directly, and love the lobster tail. Salad that comes with each beef dish is magnificently tossed! The pudding is great too\\n\\nUsed the Amex love card and got 35% off for 3\\nPax, if not the price can be rather hefty.\\nReview 3: I would say the experience in Lawry’s is the best-ever service I have in Singapore. No matter before, during or after the wedding private function, they are keeping their standard very thoughtful, helpful, friendly and even more than I expected. The staff are very considerate and the signature dishes quality are excellent. It is value-for-money to book their restaurant as private function and enjoying the high ceiling with the natural daylight came into the room, which made the event photos came out nicely. Thank you the team who help us out with the background music and the room decoration.
