Alex and Kim were friendly and was impeccable in their service. Food was amazing with unique combinations of fresh ingredients. Chef also came over to each table to interact which we felt was an awesome touch. Strongly recommended!\n\nWell deserved Michelin Restaurants.\nThe bread is so crispy on the outside and so so so soft on the inside. Pairing with the bordier butter, it is really exceptional.\nEvery dish of the food is amazing.\n\nThe service is so good. When the table is full of crumbs, the waiter will clean it up to sweep away the crumbs. The waiter are also friendly and knowledgeable about the dishes.\nWhen we found a bone in the fish and the chef came out to apologize. Felt the service was so good.\n\nThe atmosphere in the round room felt great too.\n\nOne of the best fine dining places I\u2019ve ever been to! I can\u2019t keep track of what was being served because there was just so many different courses, but each course was really tasty \ud83e\udd70 I don\u2019t think I\u2019m a small eater but I was so full by the last few courses, I don\u2019t think I ate any at all. Remember to pace yourself. I\u2019m most impressed by their bakes; their toasty black sesame bread was literally the best bread I\u2019ve ever had in my life.\n\nWhite Grass is a hidden gem, providing a distinctive dining venture with its fusion of Japanese and European flavors.\n\nEach dish is delectable, especially the bread, pastries, and desserts rank the finest that I ever tasted.\n\nThe real flower centerpiece adds a pleasant fragrance, and the stylish decor contributes to the overall charm, making it an excellent option for couples and hosting friends.\n\nOn my second visit, I can confidently say they consistently exceed my expectations.\n\nVery good ambience and attentive service. The bread is crispy outside and moist inside. Sesame bread is delicious too. Abalone is well done combined with the sauce and texture. The lobster meat is too soft for our liking. Everything is fine but no distinctive wow factor.\n",

The ambiance felt like a page out of a Parisian romance novel, with soft lights and a melody of enchanting tunes. The menu, a poetic composition of flavors, offered a dance of taste that left me in awe. The waitstaff, dressed in elegant attire, choreographed a dining experience that was nothing short of a culinary ballet. Each dish, a masterpiece plated with precision, tasted like a symphony of harmonious ingredients. If you're yearning for a dining escapade that feels like a rendezvous with gourmet dreams, Les Amis is the destination to indulge your palate in a poetic feast!\n\nOrdered the dark chocolate cake and it was so delicious! The cake is placed on top of a tart shell which is very special. Almonds are super fragrant too.\nHope that delivery service can be included in the future and handwriting on the chocolate could be better \ud83d\ude05\n\nHad a very pleasant dining experience at Les Amis. Patrick, our server, was very friendly, attentive, and entertaining. He suggested a perfect wine to have with the steak. He also patiently explained every dish to us. The amuse bouche tartalette with bacon and mushrooms was a good introduction to the meal. Notable food from our dinner are the French egg, crab souffl\u00e9, simmered celery root, salted brioche, herb sorbet, and poached pears. The caviar that was thoughtfully used in some of the dishes is an interesting addition of a complex salt flavor; it did not overwhelm the taste of the other ingredients. The wagyu was tender but I expected a bit more flavor and it lacked a bit of surprise. The herb sorbet is most interestingly a refreshing palate cleanser. Overall, it was a memorable and pleasant gastronomic experience.\n\nTruly Michelin 3 stars! Excellent food with great creativity,  best service, excellent wine pairing, and the deserts are the best.  Not cheap but it is worth it!\n\nEverything was impeccable, the food was great and the portions were generous, great wine pairings and amazing service.\nToni and the team were very kind and took genuine care of us.\nThe Blu Lobster appetizer, their sour dough, the riz de veu and the cheese course were divine.\nHighly recommended.\n",

Would highly recommend getting the seven course menu as there were so many more elements in our dinner incorporated that made it all the more special. Flavours were all very well balanced and overall we left feeling very satisfied.\n\nVisited in Sep 2023\n\nBraci was on my list of restaurants to visit for over 4 years and I must say that it was worth the wait. It is no surprise that Braci has retained its Michelin 1 star for 6 consecutive years. The menu was a progressive one which is definitely inspired by Chef Mattie\u2019s Italian roots. There are 2 choices for people (5 course and 7 course). I would suggest people to go for the 7 course as the additional dishes in the 7 course meal are worth it. One of my favourite parts of the experience was trying out the 100 yr old balsamic vinegar.\n\nIf you\u2019re not taking the wine pairing, I would strongly recommend folks to try out a few of their cocktails, esp. their Negroni (one of the most unique ones I\u2019ve had)\n\nService was good. The restaurant is able to cater to some food allergies (like my shellfish allergy).\n\nA definite recommendation for fine dining lovers.\n\nLocation was not to my liking.\nGreat staff very welcoming and accomodating to our strict dietary restrictions.\nThey had to make a menu from scratch for us which gives them bonus points.\nFood quality was amazing and the ingredients exquisite.\nHowever, the taste of the food was confusing and frankly bland at times.\nBut i cannot judge the restaurant fairly as i did not try the actual menu items.\n\nAmazing time at Braci for a birthday celebration for my husband. The Italian food was superb with beautiful floral aesthetic to each dishes. Staff is polite and friendly too! Special thanks to Chef Matteo who is very engaging and make the day extra special! Love the black truffle \"hide and seek\" dish which is one of the highlights of all dishes! It so savoury and unforgettable\u2026.\n\nnice food nice atmosphere. i tot the service could be more positive. but i still enjoy the experience especially on a chill night in the rooftop. overall quite an expensive experience but they were very nice to add an additional anniversary dessert for us:)\n",

The quail is a must order, so tender & juicy. Service is top notch. Although I will say that the cheesecake was just so so. Will definitely return soon. Easy to make reservations online\n\nall the chef standing there when preparing food are very friendly willing to talk to customers probably is close to all the chef at the counter seat , feeling very close and cozy, when enjoying food there.  floor staff are also friendly, since self pampering with friends there every tue , is like a canteen for us.  Expensive for a quick lunch, we always go back there for uni pudding & salad, is a place that food won\u2019t goes wrong have a stable quality.  All chef there not much break 3-5pm still need to prep for dinner.  Maybe not the food attract us but are the chef n waiter waitress we enjoy chitchat with them during our lunch very warm.\n\nThis restaurant is hands down one of the best, if not the best restaurant we have eaten at. The food was exquisite, the quality of the food was just incredible. The staff were lovely, chef Jo even come out to check on how the food was. Cannot recommend this place enough. My 9 year old even had her own 3 course menu just for her. Will definitely return when we are back in Singapore! Thank you to the team at Lolla \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude0d\n\nFood - good but for the price I\u2019d expect better quality. It\u2019s way too salty. That being said, nobody comes here for a healthy meal, perhaps\nService - five stars, attentive but not overdoing\nAtmosphere - need improvement on music choice, too loud and cannot hear conversation well\n\nThe course was very good. I particularly love the prawns and the potato bread. The mushroom with the broth was executed perfectly!  The chairs at the basement was uncomfortable and the room was a bit warm. Service was better when another senior staff took over the table.\n",

Food was good - subtle flavours that meshed really well together, and beautiful presentation. The lamb in particular was executed perfectly. I also loved the mignardises and that the kitchen was open but calm and not chaotic.\n\nHere for birthday lunch, cosy setting but nothing much to shout about for the interior. Had the lunch menu, food is good but nothing really outstanding that I can remember. Hmm maybe Cherry Gazpacho is quite special. Perhaps its a normal lunch menu, maybe should come back again for special collaborations when they have one.\n\nSome changes to the menu itself. Menu is very refreshing, akin like the Spring season. As always, hostess & chef hospitality are the best. To us, their food, restaurant atmosphere, relationships between staffs & us are what made us being their regulars.\n\nA very nice ambiance intimate dining room that caters to about 6 pax capacity and some counter seats for perhaps, Omakase? Set menus are definitely French and heavy on seafood.\n\nThe service was nicely paced, dishes was explained, and professional. Their wine recommendation was good as well.\n\nThe presentation of each dish is where the star is. The taste is ok, balanced.\n\nRecommended for date night, probably not the best suit for big  groups or business dinner unless you reserve private room.\n\nWe booked the restaurant to celebrate our 25th year wedding anniversary.\nWe took the $268 set dinner and added on foie gras ($20) for one of our dinner set, and changed one of the dessert to cheese truffle.\nAll the dishes are wonderfully made, and even the bread basket (uniquely in a cloth pouch) is warm and hot, with specially made bread spread.\nThe service is amazing and special mentioned to Louis who has made our experience really enjoyable.\nWe also had Yamanaka-san who personally served us for one of the dishes.\nThe downside for the place is that it is a small restaurant and seatings are quite closed to one another. It's no issue for us and we mingled with other patrons.\nHighly recommended.\n",

We did find ourselves waiting a considerable amount of time to place our order.\n\nThe restaurant offers a unique amenity: photo-taking services with free prints. However, we encountered a slight hiccup when our photo wasn't promptly printed. A bit of a delay ensued before we finally received our printed photo.\n\nOpting for the anniversary 4-course meal set, which comprised a starter, appetizer, main, dessert, and beverage, we were treated to a mix of flavors. The standout was undoubtedly the signature prime rib, a delectable dish that is an absolute must-try. On the other hand, the braised beef rib fell slightly short of expectations, with the sauce impressing more than the somewhat dry meat.\n\nWe indulged in the chocolate cake and strawberry trifle for dessert. While the chocolate cake delighted our taste buds, the strawberry flavor of the trifle didn't quite resonate with our preferences.\n\nAdding to the thoughtful experience, complimentary drinking water was a nice touch, as was the complimentary cake for those celebrating birthdays.\n\nGreat ambience, great service.\n\nOnly issue is the tenderloin which is too dry. Love their prime steak which is carved for us directly, and love the lobster tail. Salad that comes with each beef dish is magnificently tossed! The pudding is great too\n\nUsed the Amex love card and got 35% off for 3\nPax, if not the price can be rather hefty.\n\nI would say the experience in Lawry\u2019s is the best-ever service I have in Singapore. No matter before, during or after the wedding private function, they are keeping their standard very thoughtful, helpful, friendly and even more than I expected. The staff are very considerate and the signature dishes quality are excellent. It is value-for-money to book their restaurant as private function and enjoying the high ceiling with the natural daylight came into the room, which made the event photos came out nicely. Thank you the team who help us out with the background music and the room decoration. We are more than happy to come back again.\n\nLawry's is the epitome of old school.  From the colossal table-side serving carts to the waitress' uniforms, there is nothing at all modern about the experience.  Luckily for Lawry's , they pull it off where others don't.  How?  The decor, while dated, is clean and presentable.  The waitresses look like they belong in a 1950s TV show, but the service is friendly and impeccable.  So this is a case where old school is retro and kind of fun.  The food is decent, not as spectacular as the prices suggest they should be, but decent.  The spinning salad is a trademark and is excellent.  The Yorkshire puddings were just barely average... they definitely needed seasoning. If you are looking for a slab of beef in a throwback setting, and money is not a problem, this is the place for you.\n\nCelebrated my birthday here and I can say, the foods we ordered were nice! Of course we tried their prime rib which is the star of the night! Will recommend!\n",

Highlights for me were the Chutoro, Aji, Shiro ebi and Uni. The Chef and staff were very hospitable and I look forward to my next visit!\n\nAmazing omakase experience with fresh ingredients. It's one of the best i have in singapore so far (and I've had a lot!). The uni is to die for.\n\nThat's the Japan standard you should be talking about in Singapore. The price tag matches with the quality they delivered. I have never tasted such refined Japanese foods in Singapore before. Shinji may be able to go up against some of the best sushi restaurants in Japan. Chefs are well trained and able to converse in English fluently.\n\nThey even surprised me with the desserts in the Omakase menu which usually people don't pay attention to. I would definitely visit again soon.\n\nInadequate service staff. Turned amazing gourmet experience into a very bad experience! I suggest everyone who goes there CHECK YOUR BILL!\n\nI went for lunch Omakase chef special. The waitress only mentioned to me, it will be $350 and plus. I said it is ok. But she never mentioned where this plus comes from. Automatically everyone in SG would understand it as service charge.\n\nIn the end I received a bill of $400++, which got me very confused. And first waitress explained to me the price is decided by chef. Second one came to me, said, I told you, it is going to be more than $350.\n\nWell I only said ok to $350 but not $400. On the menu it says \u201cplease specify a cap if you wish.\u201d Instead apologies for her miss communication, she started pointing finger at me arguing it was my mistake not mentioning the cap. She told me \u201cI SAID, it will be more than $350, everywhere in singapore it is PLUS PLUS so \u201cA PLUS\u201d means chef decides how much you pay.\u201d\n\nWhoever would go to a $350 and more lunch would never care about $50 more, however her attitude of justifying her mistake and miscommunication, push the responsibility to customer is definitely revolting.\n\nThe argument waitress had with me was ugly, not only an embarrassment to me but also an embarrassment to the chef, and to other customers who were still eating!\n\nI left the counter to the reception with my dignity not to continue the embarrassment.\n\nIn the end the accountant charge me $350, which wasn\u2019t the best solution. She should have removed the service charge of the waitress.\n\nNo one who goes to this kind of restaurant care about paying more, $350 or $400 aren\u2019t much different. But it has to be properly explained, not by how much restaurant wishing to charge!\n\nFood was great, in the end I left without chef\u2019s gratitude. It wasn\u2019t a complete meal, and service doesn\u2019t qualify as Omakase.\n\nSuggestion to the restaurant:\n1. Notify customer how much more it will be, be clear in advance!\n2. When the miscommunication happens, it\u2019s definitely the waiting staff\u2019s responsibility! Don\u2019t blame the customer! Especially not at Sushi counter!\n",

The beef carpaccio course was also brilliant. The restaurant doesn\u2019t have a non-alcoholic pairing and that\u2019s probably a small area where they can improve their \u2018value proposition\u2019.\n\nService was top notch.\n\nA definite recommendation for a classy dinner experience\n\nWonderful culinary experience from the start till the end. The location and ambiance is welcoming and cosy, the staff is friendly and took great care of us, the food is delicious, high attention to details and wonderful ingredients from all over the globe. The chef is very talented and creative. The sommelier chose some amazing wines and champagne to pair the dishes with. Amazing experience.\n\nA sensational lunch which well exceeds its price point of $178++ per pax. The only criticism would be that the bread course was uninspiring, but who cares? It\u2019s free anyway. Canap\u00e9s started with their signature playful tomato soup. Using trompe l\u2019oeil to make it look like tomatoes it\u2019s actually a soft shell with tomato gazpacho encased within. The scallop tartare with avocado and tomato jelly was wonderfully light with all the elements working in harmony. The cod mousse taco was nice but overshadowed by its two counterparts. The first course started with a bang, yellowtail finished table side with a horseradish snow. Light, refreshing and full of flavour with an added air of theatricality for good measure. The second course was Mozambique langoustine which was the highlight of the menu. Sitting on top of a creamy anchovy sauce. The sweetness of the langoustine was a perfect complement to the (not-too) salty sauce. While the gem lettuce added some crunch to contrast with the soft and plump shellfish. This course was pure delight from start to finish! The pasta course was an elevated carbonara which utilised cured egg yolk. It was not too heavy which was a pleasant surprise. The main was veal with white asparagus coated in sabayon in a moscato sauce. The veal was cooked to perfection and the kitchen, once again, demonstrate their attention to detail by ensuring that each dish consists of an equal balance of flavours and textures. The palate cleanser was finished table side with a prickly pear granita, highly refreshing after two somewhat heavier courses. The dessert was the chef\u2019s take on semifreddo using Marsala grapes, dessert wine sauce and clotted cream. Wonderful and I loved the bitterness of the grapes and wine sauce. Overall a spectacular meal, one of the best michelin-starred lunches one can grab in Singapore that showcases high quality ingredients, inventiveness while also not ripping a gigantic hole in one\u2019s pocket. The setting of the restaurant is intimate and perfect for a date or a more private business meeting. Staff are warm, attentive and knowledgeable (and also take good photos). Definitely worth a visit.\n\nModern Italian restaurant serving interestingly innovative dishes especially the amuse bouches. Wine pairing was generous and well thought out - always a nice way to find new wines if a restaurant gets it right! Service was good. Small but well spaced and clean relaxed ambience.\n\n1st time at their restaurant for dinner. Nice colonial place. Restaurant itself felt inviting. Staffs were all smiling when greeted & warmed when serving food.\n\nFood were great. Wine pairing was generous.\n\nRecommended.\n",

Our waiter took special care to ensure that we had really nice pictures for the \"birthday cake shot\".\n\nThe food was nice, but nothing too special.\n\nI would go back for the service and ambience alone.\n\nWent there for lunch for the first time. We had orchid lunch set. Especially love the soup, the smoked duck and the lobster rice/fish noodles. We didn't get to take any photo so just find some photos online to show some of the best dishes we had.\nYes it's pricey, but it's worth the money.\n\nGreat food and good service. There were just 2 of us and the restaurant was able to adjust the dim sum portion to 2 pieces each so that we could try more variety. Love that flexibility!\n\nGood ambiance with impressive crockery that have beautiful black brush ink paintings of flowers. Each diner was served your individual bowl of fried cashew nuts as appetisers instead of communal serving in most Chinese restaurants. Nice touch!\n\nWe had steamed live prawns that were served with very fine strips of ginger, scallions and chilli in a light sauce for dipping. A silver finger bowl with a lemon slice was provided. Nice touch!\n\nIngredients used in Sze Chuan Styled Stewed Sea Cucumber Fish Maw and Braised Bean Curd Bamboo Pith were fresh and good quality. However the flavours of both were not memorable and the gravy for the beancurd had too much cornstarch.\n\nFried Rice Crab Meat with Dried Scallops was full of \"wok hei\". The only dish that left a good impression.\n\nGood hospitality for there is no charge for warm water.\n\nI was here on a weekday afternoon (prior reservation is recommended). The place quickly got crowded at around 1pm, mostly with business folks who presumably were there for lunch meetings.\n\nExcellent place for dim sum. The food isn't cheap here, but what you get in return is high-quality food, in fact the best dim sums in town, and excellent service.\n",

The menu had a great selection, especially if you are with a group of mixed Food preferences! Our food was just perfect, tasty and good portions. The staff that served us tonight were so friendly and helpful.  Is a more peaceful part of the River to dine - Was one of our best meals on our Singapore trip.\n\nLove the nice, modern Mediterranean vibe & the cozy atmosphere. Food was delicious and the portions were great for sharing. We ordered the Father\u2019s Day Promotion which was a king version of the Beast Burger which came with fries & a glass of half-pint Tiger beef for only $35! That was a delicious but really messy affair. \ud83d\ude02 The Kurobuta Pork Belly Claypot Rice was surprisingly good, Baby Back Ribs were tender, juicy & succulent & Crispy Pork Knuckle had a crispy, crackling skin but tender meat! \ud83d\ude0b Everyone enjoyed the food immensely.\n\nEffort was put into the desserts but they were a bit of a let down. Service from Armando & Rose were excellent\u2026they were friendly, professional & took care of us well from start to end.\n\nOverall, very happy we decided to try Beast & Butterflies for our Father\u2019s Day Celebration! What made it even better was that signing up for the Ala Carte rewards membership entitled us to 10% off our total bill, $10 voucher which we could redeem plus a complimentary bottle of M wine worth $68 to bring home!\n\nBrought my hubby out for his birthday late lunch. The food was only ok tasting but very pricey for such a ok tasting food. A bit disappointed with their plating. The salad beside the main dish (Rocket leaves) were so plain. Not a mixed salad.... So boring with presentation.\n\nAt Beast & Butterflies \u2014 the culinary experience is nothing short of exceptional. The crispy pork knuckles, scrumptious burgers, and tender pork ribs are just a few highlights from their extensive menu. The chefs' attention to detail and commitment to quality shine through in every dish.\n\nWas delighted to dine here. All of my friends kept praising their food especially the crispy pork knuckle! Definitely must try when you dine there. Great modern Mediterranean setting and cozy ambiance. Food came faster than expected even they are having a full house during our time of visit. Shall come back again to try other food.\n",

Food was excellent. Was graciously given a few bottles of free corkage on requests, but the wine list looks interesting. Would like to try next time.\n\nThe setting is a rustic cottage. So it\u2019s a nice, quaint and quiet place to catch up with friends. But that\u2019s about it. We had the Noodle Lunch Set for S$38++ around mid September 2023. We paid more than S$50 per pax but what we got was a single oyster and an insipid bowl of Korean inspired beef noodles with dry and tough beef. Did they say it was 4 days slow roasted? Ermm\u2026. The single oyster tasted OK. So, in short, it\u2019s not value for money, either based on food quantity or taste. The Dempsey area is not short of atmospheric restaurants with better food and pricing.\n\nWhat a nice hidden gem in Dempsey. It\u2019s quite easy to miss \u2013 just look out for a lil shack with barn doors, and you know you\u2019re in the right place.\n\nWent here for dinner, and had such a great time. The staff were very friendly and courteous. That alone will make me want to come back.\n\nThe food was wonderful too. Oysters and trout tartare were great starters. They had to substitute ingredients for our pidan dumplings, but it was flavourful just the same. Really loved the sauce on that one. Only thing that didn\u2019t hit the spot 100% was the sakura chicken thigh mac and cheese, but we\u2019ll chuck it to taste preferences and not to the quality of the dish. Would have preferred the mac to be a little more saucy, but the chicken was perfection.\n\nNoodle of the week was some assam laksa rice noodle, and it hit all the right spots for us. Loved how tender the baby squid was, and the best part about that dish was the homemade prawn ball. Lamb dish paired perfectly with the garlic mash too.\n\nAll in all, a great experience and will be back again.\n\nWhat you see in the pictures was what I had for dessert at Morsels in Dempsey Road. I\u2019m not a foodie.  I definitely don\u2019t have a sweet tooth.  Yet, The dessert started with the Tiramisu cake - what you see on the right.  After about 15 minutes, the Tiramisu cake had disappeared completely, leaving behind only the dust of Milo powder. What does this tell you about the Tiramisu?  It\u2019s disappearance advertised for itself.  The way it melted in my mouth, and then slipped down my esophagus to my stomach.  Thank you, John, for this unexpected treat.\n\nIt's really a hidden gem. Need to walk past another restaurant to find the location. The food is unique fusion with really nice presentation and palatable. Even the kids age 6 and 8 say Yummy. It's a great opportunity to taste many dishes on the menu. You won't waste your calories on carbs as the menu is designed as such. Very nice service from the staff! Thank you Morsel for leaving us such a wonderful and memorable dining experience.\n",

There are 3 options/dining experiences you can choose from. I went for the most comprehensive one - 3 starters, 1 main with chef\u2019s premium ingredient and 1 dessert.\n\nWhile I can see how Rhubarb has been able to maintain its 1 star for so many years, I struggled a bit to find some key differentiating factor versus other French contemporary Michelin places. Good food nonetheless.\n\nService was really good. The dishes kept coming fast and I was done with my entire dinner in an hour.\n\nAll in all a very good dining place. If you haven\u2019t been there, it is definitely worth going.\n\nThe 4-course lunch Omakase was very very satisfying, with interesting notes and flavours that I\u2019m pleasantly surprised by. I also really enjoyed my chat with Joseph as a solo diner, so that my lunch was a little livelier. I had an absolutely lovely time and would return again.\n\nDecided to go last min as I suddenly met a long time friend. She said she didn\u2019t want to eat something too heavy. The starters were mainly seafood and fruits, which opened up her appetite after a full day of hard stress work. The main was a tender slowed cooked beef. Dessert was a coconut sorbet I think (?). Accompanied the meal with a Riesling. We quite enjoyed the night.\nFunny note, one of the appetisers is a mix of fruits and seafood, I confused the apple with an olive. The taste was good though. Please don\u2019t change the dish because of my comment.\n\nFood are all tastefully plated and delicious. They were kind to ask me if I have dietary restrictions and I told them I would like to have all cooked food. So they made changes for me to replace the lightly torched scallops to cooked crab stick for appetiser. Really appreciate it:) every dishes were all well explained and executed.\n\nOutstanding food, worth its Michelin star. Service is friendly. The atmosphere is a little bit let down by the lighting and impersonal musical background. Overall a very nice place to have an amazing meal. Prices very reasonable.\n",

The steak was served dry and raw which when we complained was taken back, warmed and served back. 18$ truffle fries were soggy and salty. We paid like 250$ for 3 dishes and dessert.\n\nA romantic place for lovers. Surrounded by nature and good food. There's nothing to not like here.\nAmidst lush greenery and pristine forest air, it's truly \"Love's in the air\".\nYou can't help falling in love after this.\nFinish the meal with a kiss \ud83d\udc8b to seal in the memories. \u2764\ufe0f.\nBy the way, menu is also halal.. \ud83d\ude0a\n\nThe place is great. Not noisy on a weekday. Staff were excellent. Food options was good. Pricing felts a little on the high side. Restaurant has kids menu option - one of the pasta choice didnt taste great. Serving portion is good.\n\nIt was a work dinner where we pre ordered the items of the set menus. I had the Wagyu rump steak which was really good, no gamey taste and very juicy. Dessert was Valrhona chocolate tart which was so sinfully good, very chocolatey. The Halia also served complimentary matcha and banana chocolate macaroons.\n\nThe place was very nice, covered with greenery.\nService was great, staffs were attentive and food was served timely spaced out.\nNot a place that\u2019s very accessible unless you drive or take a hired ride. If you don\u2019t drive, it\u2019s a little hard to get a ride out.\n\nThe food here is fantastic. They are masters with flavour and use of herbs. It\u2019s so in line with the whole experience of dining in the Botanical Gardens. For starters, the Octopus and duck are a must try. For Mains, get the scallops (they come with Barramundi). Both are great and served with beautiful balsamic vinegar (not the supermarket kind).\n",

We ordered the 2 course lunch with an add on of extra serving of potato bread & steak.\n\nWe enjoyed the potato bread that we ordered a extra serving. The steak was also yummy and cooked to medium rare. The steak came with oyster mushroom was also cooked to perfection. Special shout-out to to the beef tartare(lovely presentation!)& pork steak(burst of flavour!!)!\n\nThe duck breast was slightly too rare for our liking.\n\nThe service was lovely and friendly and they also surprised me with a apple tart for my birthday.\n\nA lovely place where we spent our anniversary lunch. Food was YUM. A mix of different cuisines rolled into something I'd call contemporary European. Presentation of dishes was spectacular with the beef tartar showcased in a delightfully unusual way!\n\nThis is a five-star experience all the way - Alma has a Michelin star in the guide that just came out for Singapore, and deservedly so. They were happy to accommodate vegetarian food for the prix fixe menu, which is great value. The signature tofu with black truffle was sublime, as were the Japanese tomatoes with tomato sorbet. The amuse bouche of tomato with a sour plum film was another delight.\n\nIt's a nice space too, with a beautifully designed interior and a superb selection of wines and in particular rare whiskies.\n\nThis one's going on our repeat visit list for sure!\n\nA lovely fine dining restaurant with great service and friendly people. Food was very unique and tasteful. Looks like they have many years of being a 1-star Michelin restaurant. Well deserved!\n",

We were treated to the most wonderful waiter in Arvin whose wine knowledge and food explanations were the highlight of the day. He answered all our questions and was forthcoming and generous in sharing his food knowledge. All the dishes were fantastic and very flavoursome. I can\u2019t wait to come back again! We had the amekase menu.\n\nHaving dined at this Peranakan restaurant upon a family member's recommendation, we were eager to experience its Michelin-acclaimed cuisine. Opting for the tasting menu, we were treated to an exceptional culinary journey. As someone with Southeast Asian roots, I might be a bit biased, but I must say this restaurant truly stood out. It exceeded my expectations and proved deserving of its Michelin accolade.\n\nHad this slightly less than a year back. Food was delicious, staff were attentive to all our requests. Restaurant was nicely located at Dempsey with free parking. Knowing that we were celebrating a birthday, they gave us a small dessert (kinda) which I felt was very thoughtful of them. The staff were also patient in taking countless number of picture for us. Definitely deserving of the one Michelin star. Will definitely be back again in future!\n\nI believe this brings the best of Peranakan fine dinner to the guest. Dishes are true to the original flavors yet giving a refreshing new twist. Great place to bring visitors to try our local delights but elevated.\n\nFantastic experience. The food was both friendly and approachable, given these were ingredients I've never tried before. Think elevated family meals cooked perfectly. Patrick and the rest of the staff were professional and genuinely proud of the food. Dessert stole the show.\n",

Air- conditioning is way too cold and freezes everyone. Any warm dish turns cold too quickly. Dessert was also a star and did not let down the entire course of dinner. Felt the staff could have been more confident in introducing each course.\n\nCame here to celebrate our anniversary, a surprise dinner planned by my husband for us. The restaurant is intimate with only a few tables available, so you get undivided attention from the staff. It is also an open kitchen concept which I love so you can see the chefs hard at working preparing their masterpieces for us. I enjoyed pretty much every single dish, the abalone wellington was definitely unique and one of a kind. Overall had a really good experience here.\n\nOne - starred Michelin restaurant located within Voco Hotel (previously known as Hilton Orchard), serving Modern-Contemporary cuisine,established by Restaurateur-Sommelier Ignatius Chan in 2004. There is heavy influence of japanese ingredients used in the menu and served in the European way. Opt for the menu with two main courses for a wholesome dining experience. Food presentation is beautiful and tastefully presented, and what's good to look at is also good to eat.\n\nHad our belated anniversary lunch at Iggy\u2019s as we were having a staycation at Hilton. A lovely resturant with friendly and helpful crew. Love the fact that we are able to view how the chef and his team prepared our meals to the kitchen.\n\nAs the husband and I do not take raw fish, the chef was able to customize to our taste by searing the fish, love how the raw yolk enhances the overall taste of the dish. They did an interesting take on the sponge gourd which brought the vegetable to another level. The linguine was average. The roast beef has charred edges which was a nice touch. Overall we enjoyed the 5 course meal at $150++ per pax.\n\nCame here for lunch with 2 overseas guests who would like to taste a Michelin restaurant.  Decided to bring them to Iggy's as the restaurant has been one that has been keeping their reputation for years. Food was great as you can see in pictures.. perhaps ..some touch up to the interior may make the place feel warm and friendly.\nDamage : $200 (lunch)/pax\n",

They serve the best salad, octopus, sea bream, lamb chop and even chicken. Their dips and pita bread are also to die for. Service isn't as good as it used to be anymore but oh well.\n\nCelebrated a friend birthday here and the staff was quite helpful. We were introduced to a good spread. Wasn\u2019t expecting the food to be good in this type of cafe but was pleasantly surprised of the meat quality and portion. Slightly on the salty side but acceptable. Overall, would come back again.\n\nLoved having dinner here. Food, service, atmosphere all fantastic. Wayne was a great server who recommended some signature dishes - codfish roe was my fav. Octopus was well cooked and kebab was also unique but perfectly cooked.\n\nCame here multiple times including the one at the old location. Also recommended and brought my friends, colleagues here many times! Loved the food, ambience and service! Just so good! This time my friends and I came here to celebrate birthday and the bar manager treated us to complimentary alcohol and gave a small bottle of olive oil (we also purchased a big one!). Their olive oil tastes so gooooooood! The dessert was complimentary as well. I love the fish, octopus and vegetables the best!\n\nFood is fantastic. Price is reasonable as well, total damage is about $50/pax. (We ordered like 7-8 dishes).\nService is pretty prompt. The ambience is good & cozy for gathering & chit-chatting.\n",

                  "reviews": "\n\nGood restaurant, French cuisine, more like traditional or family style restaurant .\nRecommendation\n1. French onion soup\n2. escargots\n3.duck\n\nThis is our 2nd visit. We love the food and the fact that it's a non pretentious place. We've felt really comfortable on both our visits. For starters we had the escargot and bone marrow. It was really good. We ordered 2 rib-eye with bearnaise sauce and a ravioli for mains.\n\nThe only thing we were not really comfortable with was how close the table next to us was. Overall we had a lovely time.\n\nStepping inside Brasserie Gavroche, it had a nice old rustic charm to it, with the vintage looking wooden furnitures and 50s style hanging lights. Not a typical fine dinning setting but more of a simple sit down dinning for a close group of friends to meet up and chat over a hearty meal.\n\nThe restaurant serves some of the more classical French dishes such as foil gras and escargot, with choices of either cold or warm appetisers dishes. It seems the white asparagus is in season now and we ordered 1/2 dozen of escargots and the foie gras (served with toasted country bread) to go with it for our starters.\n\nThe escargot was baked with parsley and garlic butter. Classical proven dish that couldn\u2019t really go wrong, but nothing outstanding either. Felt that the escargots was a tad over baked for me as the meat was slightly tough. Overall the taste was rich and flavourful, and the leftover butter oil makes great dip for the bread. 3/5\n\nThe white asparagus was served with Parma ham, Benedict eggs and hollandaise sauce. The asparagus was crunchy and juicy, and would have paired perfectly with the savoury ham, if not for the lingering bitter vegetal aftertaste coming from the asparagus. Not sure what the Benedict egg and hollandaise sauce bring to the dish, didn\u2019t think the sauce went well with the dish. 3/5\n\nThe foie gras serving was generous! Some of the inferior foie gras I tasted had a powdery and crumbly texture with a strong metallic iron aftertaste lingering. But the foie gras served here was of a much higher quality. Smooth and buttery with a right proportion of fat; lighter in taste but yet flavourful (from the meat) and rich without being too overpowering. It left you wanting to try more as it didn\u2019t have the saturating greasy feeling. The yellow portion of the foie gras in the picture was actually solidified fat and simply pure decadent! I would strongly encourage everyone to at least try a small bit of it to savour the slow melting of pure animal fat essence in your mouth! The reddish condiment at the side was some sort of dried fruit puree and the slight sweet-sourness went very well with the savoury foie gras. The only disappointment I had with the dish was the hard country bread, but otherwise excellent dish. 4.5/5\n\nWe ordered 3 mains for sharing:  lamb tongue (not in regular menu), beef tartare and ribeye steak\n\nPersonally I prefer my lamb to be grilled for that rich \u201cmuttony\u201d favour. This lamb tongue was stewed and served on top of potato mash. I chose this main as lamb tongue was an interesting cut I had not tried before despite the cooking style. The meat was tender with a bit of chewiness to it. Taste was delicately light and I hardly get any \u2018muttony\u2019 favour in it. This was a very nice dish albeit it didn\u2019t suit my personal taste preference. 3.5/5, only because of personal taste preference, otherwise the dish deserved a 4.\n\nThe beef tartare was disappointing. I loved the Angus beef for its \u2018sashimi freshness quality\u2019 with a slight chewy texture. But the condiment was a tad overpowering from the pungent shedded onion and the overly tangy dressing. I felt that the taste was off balanced in the mouth, skewing more towards the condiment. Texture was good, chewiness of the meat went well with the onion crunchiness. The bread was disappointing hard. 3/5\n\nSaving the best for the last, the ribeye was the highlight of the meal for us. Perfectly grilled to medium rare with a pinkish tender center (an expected standard for any high end restaurant) and a slight crusty charred exterior. Decent fat content and the juice of the meat was well sealed during the cooking. Every mouthful was a fine balance of favour and texture. Tenderness of the meat interspersed with crispy charred parts, full bodied and juicy meat favour elevated by the light seasoning. It also went very well with the B\u00e9arnaise sauce as it presented a different taste profile. Just to show you don\u2019t need super expensive beef cut or A5 wagyu to enjoy a premium quality steak. 5/5\n\nWent for dinner\nOrdered the onion soup, lamb rack and mussels\nHad an amazing time wining and dining\nThe soup was delicious and fragrant\nLamb was very flavorful\nMussels was very fresh and tasty\n\nA Belgian in a French Brasserie\u2026 what could possibly go wrong.\n\nNothing actually. Superb business lunch. Relaxing atmosphere, warm traditional interior, capable and attentive staff, and the food - oh man - the food!!\n\nTried the morel mushroom soup and the evergreen Angus Beef tartare. Sublime! Just the way I\u2019d expect it in the best restaurant in Paris, or Brussels. And even the fries are \u201cBelgian Approved\u201d.\n\nThanks guys\n",

It seems that every dish others ordered also looked so good. They even surprised us with a complimentary dessert for our anniversary. Will definitely be back for more!\n\nTh staff are attentive and know thier menu well...the ambience is nothing to talk about...quite simple and mediocre .food is excellent  but a bit overly priced  steaks at 150 and over ..I could go to a 5 star hotel buffet with wider variety. But they must be doing something  right as many guests on a weekday we visited.\n\nMy family of four has attended the Wagyu Omakase, and the recently promoted Hida Wagyu Omakase as well. We have also ordered a la carte dishes like their popular wagyu donburi and sandwich, and enjoyed their steaks. Yes, a meal at Fat Cow certainly doesn\u2019t come cheap. However, we feel that we are paying for quality food and service, and we had repeated visits because we genuinely love the food and appreciate the service accorded to us.\nA special shout out to Chef Leon, who was heading the Hida wagyu Omakase while Chef Shingo was out of town. He held his own pretty well and we appreciated his kind gesture in preparing a Hida specialty for my daughter. Just as my family values good food, we regard customer service and the overall dining experience highly when we decide where to dine out for our special family occasions. On that note, I need to compliment server Vijaya for her dedicated, observant and  professional, yet personable service. We have shared with the chefs that we shall continue to patronise Fat Cow, but we look forward to an adventurous and interesting take on their next change to the Wagyu Omakase menu.\nI would highly recommend a visit to Fat Cow if you love Wagyu beef and hold an interest in trying different cooking styles and marrying tastes.\n\nIt was such a lovely experience dining here! Very nice Japanese steak house with such a contemporary twist - very delicious tempura and amazing wagyu. Each bite just felt like it melted in your mouth, and I haven\u2019t had beef that was THAT good in a while! They also gave us complimentary dessert, which was a nice way to top off the meal. Last but not least, service was impeccable and staff here took really good care of us. While it\u2019s without a doubt on the pricey side, rest assured you are getting your money\u2019s worth for the experience. Overall we had a fantastic time and would highly recommend this place for anyone that loves steak and/or is looking for a different yet unique dining experience in SG.\n\nI was looking for a nice fine steak in Singapore and after reviewing most of the reviews, decided to give it a try\nAnd, it was a really good one indeed!\n\nIt is a fine Japanese steak house with a scrumptious and super amazing wagyu I\u2019ve ever tasted. Each bite just felt like it melted in your mouth, and for me it was really a good quality wagyu.\n\nAll items were delish. I enjoyed every bite of my order. Including my drinks.\n\nI also got a complimentary dessert, as it was my birthday.\n\nThe service was impeccable. The staffs are friendly and did their best to take a really good care of us.\n\nIt\u2019s indeed pricey, but for me it is worthy.\n\nI had a fantastic time at Fat Cow and when in Singapore will absolutely come again to try their Matsusaka wagyu.\n\nAnd as a snob eater, I definitely recommend this place.\n",

Had the set lunch and it was a sumptuous dim sum and Cantonese style dishes. Great layback ambience. Very good attentive service\n\nQuite disappointed with the flavour or the food. Quality is good, like the prawns were juicy and fresh, but the flavour was meh. Salmon skin was incredibly crunchy though. Sure we were there for an event but expected a lot more flavour wise. Surprisingly enjoyed the black sesame ice cream.\n\nTook the sharing 70$ tasting menu and the food was delicious , so as the view from the inside and outdoors.\nLoved the deep friend salmon skin and shrimp soup. Maybe the only disappointing dish was the Empress rice but the rest was great. Good for dates and celebrations\n\n\ud83d\udcf8 Empress, one of our favourite wedding venues to capture cherished moments! \ud83d\udc8d\u2728 Not only does it boast Michelin Guide recommended cuisine (a hit with wedding guests!), but its enchanting ambiance along the scenic Singapore River is simply irresistible! \ud83c\udf03\u2728 When night falls, the venue comes alive with stunning lighting, creating a magical atmosphere. \ud83c\udf1f Also, the unique sliding doors on the exterior offer an unforgettable march-in experience for couples. \ud83d\udc70\ud83e\udd35 We highly recommend Empress to all wedding couples searching for an unforgettable venue! \ud83c\udf89\n\nUnderwhelming set lunch. Portion of second course main dish was really small, the fried rice was served in a very small bowl. I'm not a big eater but I did not feel full after the three courses, not to mention my male colleagues. Not value for money. Waited quite long in between courses.\n",

Our guests were very impressed by the size and freshness of the crabs. They also enjoyed the prawns.\n\nI personally loved the herbal soup that the prawns came in. I also ladled the yummy gravy from the chilli crab dish into my fried rice and polished off 2 bowls in that fashion.\n\nThere was also a particularly yummy toufu & vegetable dish that I enjoyed. I would certainly order that again.\n\nWhilst we were there I ran into other friends who were also hosting their overseas visitors so I guess this is the place to be in these situations. A really big draw is the wonderful view right outside the restaurant and opportunity to walk along One Fullerton after the heavy meal!\n\nTo  Ms  May\nThe taste was good, but the male staff was the worst. Don't talk about JCB behind your back among floor staff. They will serve you beer without permission, and if you ask for extra towels, it will cost you $1.60, but is that okay? Please feel free to make fun of me.\n\nActually it was my third or fourth time visit . Perfect location, fresh seafood and great service . We visited for company dinner we took one of our colleagues from Japan during their short business trip. They were all happy and we enjoyed a lot . Since the place is big, I noticed some service (like beverage service) were little slow however they tried and gave us great services from bottom of their heart . Especially one of the service staff Ms. WanYi helped us a lot. She tried her best whenever  we needed their assistance and I liked her sincere warm service . Thank you all team and Ms.WanYi for your great service and I\u2019ll see you again.\n\nThis was my first experience with Chilli crab and black pepper crab. Overall food was good, service, atmosphere, and location are outstanding.  Very busy and popular area, great photo opportunities.  Crab was good, we had 2 very large crabs, and side dishes were all good.\n\nVery good dishes and good services.  Pretty good Chili Crab and Black pepper crab.  Fried rice noodles are pretty good also.  View of the Sands Hotel and casino across the bay is beautiful.\n",

Brought my own cake, thanks for the decoration, very cute.\n\nThe mild Cajun sauce is tasty. Super delicious!!!! Staff friendly and excellent service! We loved it and would come again\uff01\n\nThis was highly recommended by a local as they offer a good variety of shellfish dishes. We ordered black pepper crab, crab cakes, chili crab with rice cakes, fried mushroom, and my personal favourite the rice with lobster bisque. It was a lovely take on Chinese congee but westernized. We ordered way too much food in advance and it will be better for the restaurant to advice if the food is too much for 7 pax proactively vs us over ordering. Overall the team had fun indulging the food.\n\nDine for 3 pax for dinner. Ordered the mixed w crab, prawns, oyster, etc. in cajun sauce, too spicy.  We also add the crispy octopus (not crispy at all). Bill close to $150 w UOB card we got $20 discount. Overall, it's a good place if your craving for crab & seafood.\n\nWe went here after getting the 50% off from Chope. The prices here are expensive so worth trying if got discount 'coz they serve really nice bag of seafood. The bag is good for 2-3 pax and have a lot of ingredients. The sauce or seasoning was right on spicy and very flavorful. Really enjoyed eating with the hand to licking the sauce off you fingers. It was so good.\n\nThe staff are also very friendly and attentive. They give you utensils if you need them while eating.\n",

Good sauces.\nThe individual fish plates looked like it was more worth it than the whole fish when we ordered which came in this long wooden serving board.\n\nWe went on a weekend and it was very busy.\nIf you're looking for a romantic cozy intimate vibe, this is not it. We saw a few families with kids, people celebrating birthdays, etc.\nVibe is casual and crowded.\nStaff were friendly.\n\nSet in a lovely ambience in a relaxed housing estate, the place underwent some renovations since the last visit years ago.\nStill retains a charm from the old establishment.\nThey offer to combine the orders into beautiful large format fish platters if you pick 3 mains.\nDecided to keep it simple with a clam chowder, John dory fish and chips and grilled turbot.\nFish and chips were alright, personally expected better though it was served in tiny chunks which felt like eating battered fish fingers.\nGrilled turbot was seasoned nicely and had an interesting hint of cumin in the rub.\nOysters were the highlight, there were plenty to pick from. The ones we had were large and fresh with just the right salinity but pretty pricey at 9 bucks a pop pre taxes.\nIt's more of a spot with a nice cosy vibe that serves platters worthy of feasting for the eyes.\n\nThis could be my new favourite place to eat seafood. Highly recommend the chargrilled salmon done medium rare. But don't skip on the Mediterranean squid too. Fish and chips was good but nothing too special. But surprisingly the Angus burger was quite enjoyable too. Overall this place is really good but service can be a little slow. But when the food is so good I don't really care about that. When I was eating I was already thinking about the next time Ill be back.\n\nFresh seafood with friendly and knowledgeable service staff. It\u2019s our first time here and we were unsure what to order, but Robin was very helpful and informed us of a few items for us to consider. We ordered the Madai fillet with a pepper sauce and Beef. Fish had a delicious, flaky tender flesh and came in a good portion size. Beef had an uneven cook throughout but still rather enjoyable, retaining the juicy and succulent meat.\n\nWe were given a cozy booth table and spend a lovely evening chatting. The service staff was very courteous. The place does feel a little smoky and could do with some better ventilation but still would recommend.\n\nReally long queue so expect a waiting time, loved that you can pick almost any fish available and style to cook it in, lots of choices for the fish and oyster. I went for fish and chips, calamari and fresh oyster, all ingredients was crazy fresh, however wished the fish and chip was a little more crispy. My favourite dish was the calamari\n",

I really liked the house made sauces which went great with the fresh seafood. The crab with the butter garlic is a must try. And the Boston lobster tastes fresh and sweet just steamed. Our waitress (I forgot her name) was very friendly and attentive and took care to provide us with recommendations, which was very useful for people like us who always got puzzled with the menus.\n\nDecided to come here based on the location to the hotel so we were pleasantly surprised. The Boiler is definitely worth its salt and deserving of its accolades. Served by the friendly Gabrielle, she offered great advice on the menu without being pushy. She was thoughtful, opportunistically entertaining our little one whilst we devoured our meal. We went for the duo combo with the raging hot sauce and good old fish and chips for the little one. The aroma in the restaurant is the first tell tale that the food is going to be good and it definitely delivered! Was cooked perfectly and delicious! Will definitely be back before the holiday is over\ud83d\udc4c\n\nAmazing service by Lee for my husband\u2019s birthday, we even got a free Boston lobster which is a great addition! Love the bottomless ice lemon tea too which Lee very nicely refilled promptly for us. Lee made our dinner so much more enjoyable, he also offered to help us take photos when he saw us struggling to take one. Thanks for the amazing time!\n\nThere is a reason this place is so highly rated. The seafood was so fresh and flavourful, I just wish I could have tried more. Loved the clams especially but I should have gone for the spicy sauce!\n\nSimply a must try but I would add that they should add potatoes to the boil too!\n\nWe just had our family birthday dinner at The Boiler Esplanade Restaurant, and I can't say enough good things about it. Their crab seafood is mouthwatering - fresh, flavorful, and cooked to perfection. What's more, during your birthday month, they offer a complimentary lobster, which was an unexpected and delightful surprise.\n\nThe icing on the cake was the friendly service. The staff made us feel right at home, and their recommendations were spot on.\n\nOverall, The Boiler Restaurant is a gem. If you're a seafood lover and want a fantastic dining experience with a bonus lobster during your birthday month, this place is a must-visit. I'll definitely be back!\n",

The $838 set dinner is great enough for ten people to eat and enjoy.\n\nReasonable tze char prices at comfortable setting. Also have appropriate posters on wall, very suitable for birthday dinners with family. More options for crabs if you are in bigger group. Crab meat is fresh and sweet, liked all the dishes that we ordered, even forgotten to take 2 more photos for another 2 dishes cos busy eating \ud83e\udd2dThanks the patient staff for help clearing tables and making space for birthday \ud83c\udf82\n\nWill definitely come back again. Worth the price! 2 crabs for $38. Huge portion, just nice for 2 people. We also ordered the fried squid, $14 for small size. Be careful not to enter the wrong one, there's a seafood restaurant with the same advertising as this place!\n\nThe crabs were quite value for money but the meat could have been better. The salted egg gravy was too sweet. Chilli sauce was too spicy. Guinness pork ribs were too small in portion, too sweet and fatty. Salad ice plant was rather pricey. Service was good though.\n\nReally really well-priced crabs and yummy tze char dishes!\n\nThe chilli crab wasn't too sweet which I liked and the vermicelli version soaked up the crab juices well though it may come off slightly bland to some, but nothing a little chilli can't rectify\n\nSpecial mention for the guinness pork which I had zero expectations for as I usually don't like proteins tossed in sauce but their pork has a 1:1 ratio of meat and fat which was right up my alley\n\nRecommend making a reservation before heading down as the space is small!\n",

The food overall was good and it came out fast with the exception of the last main dish- Irish roast duck- After waiting a long time we asked about it and it was discovered our duck was served to another table. It was reordered again for us.\nThe black pepper flavour was too much black pepper and spicy for my taste. It was like too much black pepper on your food. Perhaps it would be more balanced if the crab was served with the fried rice instead of after.\nPortions are fairly small.\nIt should be noted that at the restaurant, you are charged for the peanuts (tidbits on the bill) given to you upon seating and also for cold tap water.\nIt seems to be a common occurrence to be charged for tap after at restaurants in Singapore\n\nhave been coming here since i was a kid. the service is great. recommend the white\npepper crab and the dong bo pork ribs. (you must specifically ask for the ribs as it\u2019s not on the menu).\nit can smell quite fishy sitting near the live seafood but it\u2019s all part of the experience, seeing alaskan crabs try to climb their way out \ud83e\udd23\nthe garlic broccoli dish was $30 for one floret, please have your fill of veg before coming..\n\nnot great for wheelchair users. so many steps and sharp corners. service to serve food is quick. ordered pepper and curry crab. they are okay. no depth in the sauce. the rest are nice.\n\nExpatriates hotspot. Atmospheric location. Food is very tasty but also only for people with deep pockets. Multiple options for crab types and flavours. The chili crabs that I ordered come with huge arms. Their mango dessert is great too. Reservations strongly recommended, touristy restaurant too. Parking is free but limited during peak hours.\n\nWe had the pepper crab and the spicy chili shrimp, some green vegetables and fried rice and a bottle of sake.\n\nTHE PERFECT MEAL\uff01\n\nLoved the room, with a whole wall of aquariums full of fresh crabs and lobsters.\n\nI\u2019ll go back for sure!\n",

The meat was really fresh and the food was served very quickly.\nEverything is expensive in Singapore, so I\u2019m not even going to comment on that \ud83d\ude02 but definitely worth the experience!\n\nWell, you can do 2 things here, be a tourist and enjoy the food, or be a local and enjoy the food. I'm doing the local / expat thing, and if you look through the higher pricing and the fact that it's a touristy palce, you will enjoy the vibe and the good food. Some of the staff could be a bit more friendly and less pushy, but we like coming here. Again we like the food and it's just a matter of attitude. We are regulars and keep coming back.\n\nVery good and nice restaurant in the heart of China town a lot tourist are making a stop in this place , and three different are available to eat local food speciality\n\nIf you love sea food then this is the best place to eat and enjoy drinks. So wonderful crowd, food tastes awesome and very good service.\n\nPretty atrocious food. In the heart of Chinatown, the yellow seat restaurant might make it because of its unique location and decor. But the food is definitely sub-par. Ordered dumplings and Singapore vermicelli (bee hoon) and both were tasteless and without enough spice or protein. Don\u2019t expect authentic Singaporean food here / there are better options in Chinatown.\n",

But I am glad the service and service recovery were pretty commendable.\n\nWe booked a private room today for a small event.\nOrdered 4 crabs with 3 ways of cooking styles.\nThe chili crab was great as usual.\nSalted egg crabs were less tasty and underwhelming\nThe steamed crab was not fresh and smelled bit stale. Told the service staff and he brought it back to the chef and was told it\u2019s the wine used. I eaten this before and I am sure the stale smell is definitely not because of the wine. It\u2019s just not fresh. I don\u2019t pay $100+ for a crab with a funny taste and risk food poisoning my guests. Was given a refund for that item immediately which is a great way out of the unhappy experience.\n\nNonetheless, the coffee pork ribs were very delicious.\nSteamed razor clams were awesome too.\nThe lamb ribs were tender and taste good.\n\nAsparagus with scallops and the signature spinach tofu were pretty blend and so so.\n\nI think the chefs today are not in their usual standards.\n\nExcellent service and food. Must order chilli and black pepper crabs. This outlet never fail to impress, the quality has been consistently top tier. Wang Li Xin has been really attentive - my mum requested for quieter corner table instead of at the entrance, and she immediately change it for us.\n\nThe seafood here is really fresh and juicy. Had their famous crabs. This time we had the salted egg ones. Ordered the set for 2. Value for money. Service is good also.\n\nDim sum is also good.\n\nGood to make a reservation as it gets really crowded on weekends.\n\nAmazing dinner here. Always consistent quality of the crab. They took extra time to ensure that the fish was presented fully. Innovative yam scallop rings. Overall nice dinner with birthday celebration. Walked in.\n\nIt was worth to visit this restaurant. It was so easy for the branch in Ion. The crab was very delicious and not expensive when compared to the quality. The stirred fry vegetable was so good. I recommended to order seafood fried rice. It was good to eat with the crab. Please reserve the table in advance.\n",

Staff are friendly and the dining atmosphere is very cozy. Even on a crowded weekend food comes out at a decent pace. Best make a reservation before going down. A couple of the dishes we ordered could be better but generally food is all over average.\n\nDecided to try Toto last night for early dinner. We ate around 6pm. The food was surprisingly good! And the place is so nice and pet friendly. I love their chilli especially when eaten with the beef horfun. My furkid truly enjoyed going out with us\n\nI always see this restaurant, but it gave me an impression the price will be high so we didnt try out till now.\n\nInfact, the price of the dishes was really not the economical price range.\n\nHowever, I appreciate the boss to offer to did a small dishes. FYI, the price on the menu are meant for medium size.\n\nThe San Lao Bee Hoon is good, it taste like the Char Kuey tiao but bee hoon version but it wasnt really that crispy. It still has the wok hey for this dish.\n\nThe kailan veg as shown in the picture wasnt badly presented.\n\nThe recommended chicken wasnt did not taste great. It did not give the crispy with sauce coated.\n\nThe soup taste great. One of the best dishes.\n\nToufu - as we dine with kid so the boss offer to change the sauce to no spicy to custom for little kid.\n\nButter prawn - good! One of the best dishes among what we ordered.\n\nNgor Hiang - OK only.\n\nOverall ok but not worth the price we paid. Service was ok, nothing Ex ordinary.\n\nEnjoyed myself totally with my furbaby. Good food and super pet friendly place. Rare to see a tze char place that is pet friendly. I reckon all the waiting staff are dog lovers too. Free parking but spaces are limited. I will be back again in no time! Always like to include a receipt for clarity.\n\nFirst time having dinner at TOTO Seafood after my niece search for a pet friendly restaurant to celebrate Father's Day and My Birthday.\nAt this moment I will give the food 4 Star, the missing star goes to the bowl of rice. The bowl is small and we find it difficult to eat from the bowl. Using plate with fork and spoon is better, however if your culture is serving rice in bowl, I would suggest using a bigger bowl, it will be more comfortable and I hope the rice can be improved also.\nNext, the service and staffs are excellent, friendly, smiles and responsive. Lastly I like the ambient and definitely will come again and bring back the 5th star.\n",

It was such a sweet gesture and we are very grateful.\n\nGood variety of seafood - Dungeoness crabs, squid, prawns, Boston Lobster, clams etc - all prepared and comes in a bag for communal sharing. You have gloves and aprons to dig in and get your hands dirty to enjoy your food. Birthdays get a large sharing set and get a free Lobster.\n\nDrinks are decently priced for beers and whiskey highball.\n\nHaving dined in before was a good experience. So decide to do take away. Do note the take away option when you add 1 corn, is 1 part of a corn as show in pic. 1 x sausage you get a whole sausage.\n",

Seems like nothing much have changed in terms of the services etc. maybe just the environment.\n\nThe food taste good and never too salty. Some would say it\u2019s blend but healthier. Prices here are reasonable and you can check on their weekly specials on their fresh seafood.\n\nI was surprised that the place was so packed on a Saturday. It looked to be almost full house even in the private rooms. The food were good but the chilli crab sauce was kinda disappointing. The fish was really good. We had dinner set and add on. The servers were quick on their feet and super hardworking with a lot of teamwork.\n\nDefinitely an historic place. Super old and so is the vibe. Last time dining the area before it will close down and move to peach garden area. Heard a lot of good memories created over here, generation by generation.\n\nWill miss this place\n\nWas there for dinner. The servers are busy but attentive enough. I like the Peking duck is served with a egg based wrap instead of the usual dough wrap. We requested to be duck meat served as it is, and it\u2019s still tasty and soft. The sweet and sour pork is tasty, tender and not tough like others. We will be go back again.\n\nAlmost exactly the same as turf city, many staff the same, food taste the same, price similar.\n\nOnly difference is need to pay carpark (slightly expensive) and main dining hall is enclosed with no natural lighting.\n",

My family enjoyed their other popular dish, Steven Chicken and Soon Hock was cooked really well and tender. Had their Green Dragon Vegetables with Scallops, the portion was pretty generous and yummy. Overall, the dishes were all served quite promptly and staff were very attentive too. A great place for gatherings and celebrations!\n\nLove Australia lobster porridge was nice & fresh. Steven chicken taste good too. Personal recommend this 2 dishes. Price is at the high side, environment is quite noisy. Service is not bad, friendly staff. But staff serving food & cleaner wear same glove to serve food, exchange tableware, clean up table. It was kind of unhygienic to do so.\n\nThe restaurant was bright and clean. Very spacious. Seafood was fresh! Food was delicious. Nice lobster porridge and Alaskan king crab :)\n\nBeing a Singaporean, live seafood is a classic! And I am glad somewhere like Orchid Live is still around!\n\nThe portion is fairly large and the taste of their dishes were great! I really like the pricing and promos they have from time to time! Their Alaskan king crab, Australia lobster, and lobster porridge is a must! A definitive order is their signature Steven Chicken, this dish is my favourite!\n\nOverall this place is a great alternative to some of the other well-known brands in SG. If you live in the north area then this is surely the place to go!\n\nWill definitely go back to visit whenever I have to chance to go up north in Sg.\n\nGreat place!\nWe ordered the $199 package, it is definitely value for money!\nThe lobster is fresh, the porridge is infused with sweetness from the lobster. The portion is large as there are 4 of us and we are very full after eating the porridge and barely touched the chicken and streamed fish.\nIf you are nearby and craving for some great lobster porridge, this is the place to be.\n",

Tried both kind of chili crab with and without eggs, it was different and nice not so ketchup taste n less starchy. We had the fried fish with Thai mango sauce, good! Crispy US duck was good, tender n skin was crispy.\n\nSuperb dinner and seafood experience with the work team. Everything was done excellently. Deep fried baby squid, duck, Cereal prawns, fish and crabs. Amazing. Will want to come back again with family.\n\n16 Jul 2023: back here to celebrate mum BD. Nice food, firm meaty crabs and excellent service. Tried the curry fish head as it was birthday girl's favourite.\n\nI love the old school vibes here! Traditional Chinese restaurant set in the 80s! This place has been around since 1956, and the food is great! Service is also good! Love the chilli crab here and they are apparently the creators of this iconic dish! We had Buddha jump over the wall soup, baby kailan, chilli crab with mantou, and a fried mee sua. What a memorable and amazing experience! Will definitely be back again soon! We also got to say hi and bye to the friendly founder and owner on our way out!\n\nNice food n great service. The boss is always friendly n welcoming. My gal loves the Chili Crab n it\u2019s always a must have dish on the table for her when she goes to Roland Restaurant.\n\nOne of the old school Chinese restaurants that the entire extended family goes to over the years during special occasions. Has nice Tim sum and Chinese cuisine. 5 stars for sentimental value and nostalgia. Good to know that the restaurant is still around after all these years.\n\nFamily had a 10 course meal to celebrate a few birthdays.\n\nCold dish was so so. Would prefer sliced lobster with mayonnaise to lobster balls among other things.\nLotus paste bun was ok, but it is always fun to have it styled as longevity peaches which are linked to Chinese mythical stories.\nBuddha jumps over the wall was nice, but every individual soup pot ingredients are non-uniform. You never know what your going to get till you open the lid. \ud83d\ude02\nSuckling pig was awesome! Crispy! \ud83d\ude0b\nRazor/Bamboo clams were delicious.\nAsparagus was decent.\nDrunken prawns were ok.\nChilli crab is the signature dish with fried Mantou buns which are a childhood favourite. \ud83e\udd29\nSteamed pomfret was good.\nUS duck was yummy.\n",

The place is cosy and quiet enough for good conversations as well.\n\nWe ordered a few things that were off the menu so I can't remember the dish names, but I was very satisfied with the lobster, uni on toast, and monkfish liver claypot rice thingy.\n\nWe over-ordered for 2 pax but everything was delish! Scallop tart, octopus, samegarei fish and donabe. Also had 2 desserts: chendol and bingka ubi. All in all really solid feed. Seafood is crazy tasty and fresh, asian flavours. Not the cheapest but a great spot for catch ups with friends. Going again for dinner this week so will see if the standards hold up. Can\u2019t wait!\n\nFirst time visiting, and i must say the dishes were all outstanding and the perfect example of less is more in terms of cooking methods and seasoning. They were definitely delectable overall. Shout out to Catherine and the team for their warm hospitality and great recommendations. Particularly enjoyed the wild-caught Steenstrup's bay squid and the samegarei! highly recommended.\n\nA refreshing new seafood-only experience.

I was worried about coming alone, but my waitress made great recommendations and the food was amazing. Cindy went out of the way to teach me how to pick my 800g crab correctly (lol said just eat like you would eat at home, it\u2019s the best) and made sure that I got the deep fried man tou to dip with the soup (amazing).\n",

It was good. High quality dim sum and dishes. Do remember there is a 90 mins time limit during weekend as told by the captain. The service was good, all staff were very attentive to us. It was an enjoyable meal. Will come back next time.\n\nThere are a lot of prawn dishes. All were good but just a bit tired of eating prawns haha. The traditional dim sum like custard bun, siu Mai , Har kao were good and authentic. There were some selection of the menu was only one time order. But it\u2019s good enough to taste almost all the items from the menu.\n\nThe crabs were big, superb and succulent. The place opens after 530pm. Be prepared for very steep prices (up to 88 bucks per kilogram). You are given all the necessary tools to get every single morsel out. Plus make sure to order fried buns. They go so well with the sauce!\n\nGood balance of a fancy and traditional. They Do buffet and ala carte and free flow :)\nFood and service was good and ambience here was good. Not all traditional dishes but most play a few house specials. For two, we didn't do the buffet for lunch cause we usually don't eat that much but prices range .

You will be need to select from the variety of live seafood options by Unique Seafood, before instructing your preferred cooking style.\n\nI highly recommend the HK steamed soon hock, black pepper crab and bamboo clams. The bamboo clams were generous with both fried and steamed garlic, it was delicious. The black pepper crab was extremely flavourful while the chilli one is really spicy.\n\nThe other dishes seen on the images were fine and they were in the small portion. Overall, value for money with the live seafood selection experience and food taste. Service wise was alright, feels quite understaffed as I have difficulty getting attention at times.\n\nGood selection of fresh & live seafood, been here a few times in the past & decided to leave review.\nReasonable priced seafood with some great discount & deals going on.\n\nBest service and price. Everything was cooked perfectly and tasted delicious. Would definitely come back when in Singapore.\n\nAll bad except being overpriced ..  Can give ZERO star to upload this ... we'll do so.\n\nThe place is cold after requests to rectify, over priced vegetable  & seafood overcooked. Crispy skin piglet (1/2) is cold  & served under 15 mins despite staff said it's freshly done (too fast to be true)\n\nA live seafood restaurant- the seafood here is always super fresh. Service can be a little slow sometimes as they seemed to be understaffed, but still always polite and you can tell they really try.\n\nWould recommend the bamboo clams, drunken prawn, steamed fish and black pepper crab! \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb\n\nGood for a special occasion super seafood indulgence!\n",

The former version was the better choice as it brought out the best taste of the crab; the latter  could had been served better (they did eventually give us a plate to hold the sauce). The lobster porridge was tasty as well.\n\nEasily 10/10 experience dinning here.\nThe quality & freshness of the ingredients is top notch.\nWould definitely recommend my friends back here again! \ud83e\udd29\n\nRevisiting Orchid Live Seafood after a long time, when they were still at Sembawang. The concept and menu has changed, now mainly selling the set with lobster porridge and seafood bag. Lesser number of dishes available on the menu.\n\nThe lobster porridge is still excellent. The staff promoted to upgrade the 800g lobster in the 4 pax set to 1kg Australian lobster. Liked the succulent and thick lobster meat.\n\nOverall prices are now on the high side, but it's quite uncommon now to see your seafood literally scooped out of the tanks.\n\nThe best chilli crab in Singapore.\nFresh lobster and crab from the tank with every bite you with the taste of freshness. Thick chunky meat is guaranteed.\n\nStart with the lobster porridge - omg the soup will knock you off the table. It's sweetness from the lobster and fragrance of the fried onions.\n\n2 best sauce types :- chilli crab and salty egg crab\n\n1st came the chilli crab heehee our normal ask for more spicy it came out so tasty and does not taste tomotoey at all. Chef\"s spiciness not from chilli padi as you see none and the taste was infused by the sweetness from all the seafood in the bag. We could not stop at 36 manitou which came out piping hot. Added another plate of their signature fried rice \ud83c\udf5a it's so satisfying and brings you to heaven when you add a spoon of the chilli crab sauce to it.\n\nSalted egg crab was even better than the chilli crab it's not fake and the taste is so good we can just say OMG - gosh so shiok.\nEven the potatoes they use are so good it soaks up all the sauces.\n\nOverall the whole experience was heightened by the great service of the staff they are so accommodating when we ask for more sauce and always serve us with great patience and smile\nWe will definitely be back for the fresh seafood, tasty sauces and great service.\n\nFood is fresh, and portion is huge! One crusty bag is more than enough gor my family of four. The Steven chicken is tasty too.\n",

However, we do tend to take our friends visiting from overseas here for the location and the water view.\n\nIt\u2019s not the cheapest place to get chilly crab but the taste is quite easy for most people, even for foreigners.\n\nThe service level could be below the bar as they often don\u2019t have enough staff or have staff who don\u2019t speak good English.\n\nReservations are recommended for this location.\n\nI have given up on jumbo after 2 failed experiences at East Coast branch and once Dempsey but because a friend came in from Shanghai so brought him here to try again as its like the icon of Singapore. This time, the crab was so fresh and nice. Ordered chilli and black pepper crab (1.2kg & 1.3kg). Feels like the Jumbo standard is back this time.  Nice\n\nFood is good! Seafood fresh and succulent. Tasty and delicious. Ordered mocha pork ribs, Alaskan crabs cooked chilli style and Chinese wine steamed, bamboo clams, lamb ribs etc. There is also a 50% discount for Alaskan crabs.\n\nService is fast and prompt\n\nAmbience wise - a bit noisy\n\nWill return\n\nYou may make a reservation, we walk-in to get the number and waited for about 45 minutes to be seated. Menu has variety of dishes from seafood to meats and vegetables with different kind of cooking method. Price was above average but worth a try.\n\nFried scallop - the scallop was wrapped with yam and fried it. It was crusty but the yam not quite match with it.\nCrab meat tofu - the tofu have a thin layer of veggie paste on the top, poured the crab meat gravy on it, it\u2019s delicious.\nSweet and sour pork - the sour taste was quite artificial and not what I expected but not bad though.\nGarlic stir fried asparagus - fresh asparagus and the garlic brought out its flavor.\n\nMango dessert - Sweet, sour and refreshing\nYam dessert - so special that it was the first time I tried, the paste was so thick and have yam paste inside with ginkgo and pumpkin. Recommended if you wanted to try something special.\n\nFood was great, got the chilli mud crab, cereal prawns, mi goreng noodles and scallops wrapped in yam. Service was quick and staff attentive. Best to reserve a table ahead of time and also decide on what to order as there is a 1.5hr time limit on tables and it took about 40 minutes for the crab to come out when we were there.\n",

I love the experience though and if you want to impress you vegan friends I would still bring them here just for the view and service.\n\nJoie is an absolute gem for vegetarian dining in Singapore! The elegant ambiance, coupled with impeccable service, sets the stage for an unforgettable culinary journey. Each dish is a masterpiece, beautifully crafted with fresh, flavorful ingredients that redefine vegetarian cuisine. The creative menu offers a delightful fusion of tastes and textures, leaving me astonished with every bite. The attention to detail in presentation is exquisite, elevating the dining experience. Joie isn't just a restaurant; it's a celebration of vegetarian gastronomy, and I can't wait to return for more culinary delights!\n\nI had a fantastic experience at Joie Vegetarian Restaurant! The Monkey Head Mushroom Steak was a true culinary delight. The flavors were exquisite, and it's clear that the chefs put a lot of thought and care into their dishes. What impressed me the most was the affordability of the 5-course meal. It's not often you find such a high-quality dining experience at such a reasonable price. The service was impeccable, and the ambiance was lovely. I can't wait to return for another delicious meal!\n\nWe dined at Joie today, July 16, 2023, and it was an outstanding experience. The service was excellent, and the food surpassed our expectations.\nThe attention to detail in dish presentation was evident. The staff's timing and coordination were impeccable, ensuring a seamless and enjoyable dining experience. The relaxed ambiance with soft lighting and comfortable seating added to the inviting atmosphere.\nIn conclusion, Joie offers an exceptional dining experience with attentive service and delicious food. I highly recommend it to anyone seeking a memorable culinary adventure. I can't wait to visit again.\n\nMy first time trying vegetarian fine dining, the foods were surprisingly good! The waitress , Kelly, was very professional, she explained the dishes to us and also show us the right way to enjoy the dishes. The main dishes , mushroom steak and risotto were very impressed too. I will definitely come back again.\n",

Super recommendation coming from a pure meat and seafood lover.\n\nPetai - great sambal chili fried with a whole plate of goodness\n\nOlive fried rice - we had two plates, one after the other, enough to justify the deliciousness of the dish\n\nCurry 'mutton' - good curry but something seems to be lacking in the flavour\n\nSalted egg yolk - we had two plates of this too\n\nGlutinous yam (suan pan zi) - delicious? We had four plates of this.\n\nIt is in my personal humble opinion that you are missing out on very good food if you have not tried this as a vegetarian.\n\nFood is OK. The grilled mala fish is good! Impressive imitation of the texture very close to the real fish version.\nSatay is also nice.\nThe rest are so so. Kids says favourite truffle fried rice that is usually fragrant at other places has no truffle taste. Frankly, I prefer the high tea at their other outlet.\n\nVery delicious meal here! Portion is big price is reasonable. The fish is a must have! Very tasty \ud83d\ude0b I\u2019m a meat lover and I thoroughly enjoyed myself at this vegetarian restaurant. Good job to the chef! Staff was attentive.\n\nCelebrated our friend's birthday dinner at Lotus. It was indeed a great choice we've made and no regrets too. Food was well prepared and delicious. Atmosphere was chill and clean. Will come back again.\n\nWe came just to try the Grilled \"Fish\" and we were not disappointed albeit the flavour we chose does not resemble much of the original \u70e4\u9c7c. It was still tasty and we would want to return to try the other flavours. The other dishes were also pretty good. The tofu box was really interesting with some diced mushrooms that provide an unusual taste and texture. The spinach in superior broth was done really nicely it tasted so premium. Tau Kwa Goreng was perfectly fried but a little spicy for me.\n\nWe were seated near a cabinet and discard trolley where staff kept walking to & fro, sometimes talking over our heads as they reach for stuff. Pretty unpleasant and lack of service etiquette.\n",

They could have much better crowd comming in with that.\n\nVisited Anand Bhavan, opposite to Mustaffa after a long time few years later. I always recommend to visit and try their menu. This is Indian Vegetarian Resturant, better to try their tiffins items rather than rice items. Service will be quick, though there was a huge rush, served within 10 mins. Tired their Masala Rava Dosa, Mini Sambar Idly, Sambar Vada, Onion Uttappam and Poori set, and all\nOf them tasted good. Sambar have lot of Brinjals only instead they can add lot of other vegetables also.\n\nWrong decision to visit this place and worst was to ask for take away. Just wanted to get idly set take away and thought that it would be fast. But unfortunately, waited for about 30 minutes after payment was made. The place has kitchen next to the washroom entrance and it was smelly and very unpleasant to stand there to wait for my order to be delivered to me. Overall, not very clean place to visit. Observed many foreigners there who might be looking for only vegetarian food and had limited choice rather to be there. I am sure it could be managed better in terms of cleanliness, service, order management for simple stuff. However, I was there after many years and may take me another few years to step in again.\n\nPrice: $3.60 (Plain Thosai)\n\nPlain Thosai: 5/5\nThosai was savoury, crispy, soft and had a good sour flavour.\n\nSambar: 4.5/5\nSambar was savoury, flavourful, a little sweet from the vegetables and familiar tasting.\n\nChutney: 5/5\nThe orange chutney was flavourful, tomatoey and a little spicy. The white chutney was quite gingery and sweet from the coconut. The brown chutney tasted peanuty, savoury and was rather spicy.\n\nTotal score: 14.5/15\n\nAdd-ons: Masala Tea ($2.60) was fragrant, warm and comforting but could use more spices.\n\nService was fast and I received my thosai within 5 minutes. It will be quicker to get your drinks directly from Counter 1 at the restaurant as they seem slightly short-handed in the drinks area. The lady managing counter 1 is really nice and makes your drinks after seeing your receipt. I saw this as a good thing since I could decide when I wanted to have my masala tea instead of having it served while I was having my thosai.\n\nThe place was air conditioned and the place can get crowded and is a really bustling place near lunch time.\n\nAll in all, I enjoyed my brunch of thosai and masala tea at Ananda Bhavan Restaurant (Vegetarian). :)\n\nOne of the popular South Indian breakfast places of Singapore. The food preparation is Tamil style and quantity is apt.\n\nOverall the taste, quality and hygiene was good and rates were genuine.\n",

Read many reviews saying that the carrot cake is a must try but it didn\u2019t really suit our palettes. The samosas are tasty but not very special. The lychee drink is refreshing, really helps after a long walk exploring the city. Would definitely visit again on our next trip to SG.\n\nPrice: $6.54 (Plain Thosai)\n\nPlain Thosai: 5/5\nThosai was very crispy, savoury and slightly sour.\n\nSambar: 5/5\nSambar was flavourful, savoury, hearty and had a good lentil taste.\n\nChutney: 5/5\nOrange chutney was tangy, sweet and spicy. White chutney was coconuty and spicy.\n\nTotal score: 15/15\n\nAdd-ons: Masala Tea ($4.16) was fragrant from the spices used and warm and comforting to drink.\n\nThere was a little waiting time but it was definitely worth the wait as the plain thosai was very delicious. From the thosai to the sambar and the two different chutney. Service team were really responsive to requests and new orders.\n\nThe place was brightly lit and a cozy place to have your Indian vegetarian classic as well as your familiar Singaporean dishes with a vegetarian twist.\n\nThe first time I went there, I had the vegetable briyani, Gobi 65, Aloo Gobi and mango lassi. The food was good and the lassi was awesome, don\u2019t fade the lassi.\n\nThe second time that I went there, I had the fried carrot cake, murtabak and Gobi Manchurian and I\u2019ll say to skip the Gobi Manchurian as the cauliflower was almost non-existent and I was just eating a lot of batter. The fried carrot cake is decent for an vegan take as it is not commonly available and the murtabak is alright but can be skipped.\n\nFood was really nice. Enjoyed the dishes! The service can be improved, we were more or less asked to leave the moment we finished our food. We understand that they have limited seating and a queue but just felt rushed.\n\nGood variety on the menu but I do find it moderately highly priced. Service was typical yet they really do have interesting things on the menu with Chinese and muslim influence. It has its own character but I do very much prefer pure Indian cuisine. It\u2019s nice for the occasional change. Location was good, walking distance to the Little India train station and restaurant is clean and cool with air conditioning.\n",

The customer service was no so good but that has been my experience in Singapore hahaha \ud83e\udd23 you must try the vegan dumplings they are the best! I also had the Nasi Lemak and it was delicious \ud83d\ude0b\ud83e\udd24.\n\nIt's in B1 so take the elevator then go through the door on your left lol.\n\nIn case your looking for the restaurant it's downstairs in B1, we went for dinner and it was very quiet. Ordered the clay pot rice which was the highlight! Dumplings were so so with to much wrap for my taste. Laksa was ok also. Overall it was quick service and Decent food. You have to order also at the counter and pay upfront.\n\nThis place looks... ordinary... in fact a little plain and obscure. But, the food is phenomenally good. Seriously they should be awarded a Michelin Star.\nCame highly recommended by my partner, and despite a long work day, we chose to go for dinner. We ordered what you see in the pictures--and we were blown away. Really, very good, no it's outstanding.\nEverything is good, and I particularly like the dumplings, the Nonya laksa, Lasagne, especially the Korean noodle Jajangmyeon, I must go back there and eat again! And the cheese cake is to die for! They have a reputation for THE BEST VEGETARIAN LASAGNE in Singapore, voiced by Food Critics, and I can tell you, you would have wasted your trip if you did not try it!\nThe service is personal, plain, direct and friendly (no airs). The people here are just down to earth, and the food service is fast. It's best to go in the evening, because it's in the CBD area, and therefore day time it would be crowded.\nThis is a vegan place, so for those of you are allergic to milk or preservatives, you can eat with a peace of mind.\nI would highly recommend this place, give a 4.5 Star. The 1/2 star missing is for them to include more local favourite like the Char Kway Teow and perhaps Hor Fun. Really all they serve there is very very good. Go and thank me later. Just go!\n\nOne of the trusted place for vegetarian food. Always enjoy the simple but nice offering there... Assam fish has the sour kick. Nasi Lemak was great with the chilli.\n\nSmall menu yet you can definitely find something you\u2019ll like! Has a range of local food and western food - Nonya laksa, chicken rice, dumplings to lasagne and salads!\n\nI have tried the laksa, very rich not too spicy soup. The chicken rice made from beancurd is very meaty and the chilli sauce has a kick!\n\nMy favourite drink to order is their homemade almond milk - very thick (might not be for everyone), rich and filling.\n\nIt is at basement of havelock II, it has limited seats due to the small storefront, and can be a good place to catch up with friends as the area is not too noisy\n",

Two plates and small noodles was more than enough for two to share and almost finish. Drinks were quenching, and the service was outstanding. Thank you!\n\nI got invited for lunch by work friends to this wonderful vegetarian restaurant. Being a vegetarian, I was delighted to see the vast options in the menu. Each dish we ordered was unique and with distinct aroma and taste. I particularly recommend signature olive rice, Garden Medley, Tempeh Long Beans with Olive to name a few. A very satisfying experience and look forward to next visit.\n\nMy very first visit to a vegetarian restaurant.  Service was great. They let me in a few minutes earlier than the opening time when they saw me waiting outside.\n\nStaff were professional, proactive, and helpful.\n\nI appreciated it when the staff told me that the number of dishes I ordered was already a lot, and previously informed me that the dishes I ordered were all mushroom-based and recommended different dishes for variety.\n\nFood was tasty, especially the Thai green curry and the rendang. One of our companions was amazed when he was told the \"chicken\" in the dish he ate was not meat.\n\nPortions were sizable and work well for group diners.\n\nWhole Earth should be considered as the best restaurant serving plant-based food in Singapore. The location is in the Tanjong Pagar neighbourhood, just a short walk from the MRT station. They serve incredible vegetarian food. I\u2019d say it\u2019s quite unusual in a meat country such as Singapore.\n\nVegetarian food is hard to find as many eateries only offer a very small number vegetarian food on their menus. (usually pizza, sandwiches or soup).\nThe place is nicely renovated. The interior with its decor is simple & uncluttered. The establishment seems more keen on focusing on the food rather than a flashy interior. I\u2019d suggest to book a table in advance.\n\nThe service is fast. The menu consists of classic dishes that\u2019s a mix of  Peranakan & Thai. The restaurant is Singapore\u2019s first & only plant-based restaurant to be awarded the Michelin Bib Gourmand for 6 years from 2016 - 2022. That, if anything, should make you curious & eager to visit.\n\nFor you who\u2019s not vegan | vegetarian, don\u2019t let the fact that this is a plant-based restaurant dissuade you from eating here or order food for take away. The quality, the taste, textures & the variety of flavours is second to none.\n\nGenerous portions\nQuick and good service\nU may want to make prior reservations since it is very busy during evenings and not much  place to accommodate walk-ins.\nNeat and chique ambience. Easily accessible from tangong pagar MRT.\n\nPretty elaborate menu to cater to all taste buds. Amazing smokey aroma from the rice. Eat food while still hot. Once it cools off, taste no good\n",

The dishes that we ordered tasted good. Also they have some selection of interesting beverages. There are also a variety of tea to choose from. Overall, a good place for a meal if you are vegetarian or want to eat vegetarian food.\n\nFriendly services provided by the staff.The staff were accomodating to our seat and food request. They also offered to help us take a group photo. There are a wide range of food available on the menu. When we were undecidable on the pizza flavours, the staff recommended two of their most popular flavours - BBQ pizza and pesto pizza. We thoroughly enjoyed both pizzas. Overall, the food was delicious even for some of us who are non-vegetarians. Highly recommend iVegan!\n\nI had few different mains here from asian to western.\n\nI would recommend their black bean burger. The house made patty goes very well with the rest of the ingredients. See picture. The sauce pairs well too. The sweet potato fries are seasoned  just right, not too heavy. Salad refreshes the palette. I also tried their bbq mushroom sandwich with the same sides and different sauce (mayo). It was decent.\n\nFor the guacamole sushi, it is unique and worth a try.\n\nFor the Asian mains, I have tried rice and noodles for the set lunch. I feel they are on the bland side. However, you can request to add more salt and pepper on your order. The peach gum dessert is also very less sweet and taste very healthy.\n\nThe staff is very friendly. Sometimes, complimentary appetizer would be served. Expect to spend close to 20 dollars for a meal here.\n\nGreat flavours, great aesthetics and vibes, great service! Staff kindly gave us a heads up that their food is towards the lighter side but all the dishes we ordered turned out so flavourful and satisfying hmm so didn\u2019t face the issue of food being bland at all. Service was great too!\n\nWe tried the salad, mushroom soup, sushi and grilled broccoli/mushrooms. All were served promptly and were delicious. Wasn\u2019t too difficult getting a table on weekend dinner.\n",

Loved the food \ud83d\ude0b.\n\nThe food is great overall, though sometimes they try to cut corners. For instance, pre-made rotis become hard and stretchy. I opted for the buffet and it was amazing, except for the roti on a particular day.\n\nAmazing food and great portion, all food without garlic onion. We ordered this for 3 people and had enough to take away for another meal! Also probably the best puri I've had!\n- Malai Kofta\n- Paneer Butter Masala\n- Jeera Aloo\n\nGreat food for folks looking for Jain / no onion-garlic meals, this is one of the best restaurant in little India, Singapore. Basic food with great taste, good variety and pocket friendly. Just improve service a notch and it will be perfect..\n\nDivine Veg Saatvik food for cleansing your body and soul ! A service to humanity , Enjoy the buffet at a trivial cost listening to therapeutic Hare Krishna chants ! \ud83d\ude4f The service staff are amazing , try engaging with them to know about the culture !\n",

There were alot of insects in the restaurant on the day of my visit but it could be because of the rain.\n\nOrdered via grab food. The kimchi jiggae healed my flu. The bulgogi fries were addictive.  The tteokbokki had the perfect chew.  Can't wait to actually eat at the restaurant to have a full experience.\n\nI enjoyed my dish Army Stew which as you can see from the photo was bubbling away for minutes. My wife was rather underwhelmed by her dish though unfortunately.\nThe Kimchi Jeon (pancakes) were nice enough though not better than Indian flavoured breads/uttapam in that the flavour was not as storied/flavourful as we expected.\nStaff were very nice and I'm sure if we had visited it when busier then we would have probably enjoyed it more. Their sister branch we happened to pass one evening and had a completely different feel, more intimate and cosy so we may try that another time. Very nice man on the reception.\n\nThe rare place that my daughter who is a vegan to enjoy Korean food. Surprisingly it's quite good even for a non-vegetarian like me.\n\nExceptional Korean food at a decent price.\n\nFood is excellent & service is prompt. Tofu soup is delicious and flavourful, with the ingredients generously portioned. Omelette & Kimbap are also great.\n\nThis is also one of the few Korean places I've encountered where the Kimchi pancake can be shared between 2 people, which is great if you aren't dining in a large group.\n\nDefinitely give this place a try if you get the chance! Be warned you may have to queue during lunchtime.\n",

Unique dishes not seen elsewhere and the set meal allowed us to have a taste of all the great dishes. Most dishes were made from scratch, even the ikan bilis! All made with minimal or no seasoning and all natural ingredients. Yum! \ud83d\ude0d\nVery worth it and I'll definitely be back again!\n\nGreat for celebrations. Remember to make a reservation. We were a group of 11 people and service was great. They made special provisions for parking because we had a family member with mobility issues. We also had a birthday cake and celebration.\n\nFoodwise, in my opinion \u4f5b\u6709\u7f18 serves the most unique vegetarian cusine in Singapore. The best is still Miao Yi (for personal reasons) but it closed down \ud83d\ude22 Forget about the \u81ea\u5728 \"empire\", Shu and coffee shop zizar, it's always the same old thing.\n\nWe had the cold dish with \"ice vegetable\" salad, which is really good. The yuzu monkey head mushroom is always a hit. The sugarcane flower is unique. And last and not the least, the humble bee hoon - is always a family favourite.\n\nA Delightful Vegetarian Culinary Journey at Fo You Yuan Vegetarian Restaurant\n\nApart from the outstanding food, the service at Relocate Vegetarian Restaurant was impeccable. The staff members were friendly, attentive, and eager to cater to our needs, making us feel welcomed and valued throughout our dining experience.\n\nOverall, Relocate Vegetarian Restaurant has truly impressed us with their diverse and mouthwatering selection of dishes. Whether you\u2019re a vegetarian or simply looking to explore plant-based alternatives, this restaurant is an absolute gem. We highly recommend it to anyone seeking a memorable dining experience with top-notch vegetarian cuisine.\n\nThe delicate strands of noodles were expertly stir-fried with an assortment of fresh vegetables, creating a harmonious medley of taste and aroma.\n\nThe Rendang was a true masterpiece. The rich and aromatic coconut-based curry was impeccably spiced, resulting in a tantalizing symphony of flavors.\n\nOne of the highlights of our meal was the Vegetarian Shark\u2019s Fin Soup. It was a delightful surprise to find a cruelty-free alternative that retained the essence and texture of the traditional dish.\n\nThe Sweet & Sour dish was a perfect balance of tanginess and sweetness, complemented by succulent mushroom and an assortment of colorful bell peppers and pineapples.\n\nTo end our meal on a sweet note, we indulged in the Yam Paste with Gingko Nuts. The smooth and velvety yam paste was flawlessly cooked and paired beautifully with the tender gingko nuts\n\nOld school vegetarian restaurants good not too salty good service. Friendly staff. Must try for old school vegetarian restaurants. They have moved a few times already hopefully they can stay here. Finally found them again. I have been eating at this restaurant over 15 years now...still as good as the first time I tried....\n\nI'm super glad that we have a Chinese vegetarian in Desker Road, stone throwaway from Mustafa. Food was authentic and feeling good old days. Fantastic and thank you for opening an outlet in Little India.\n",

Vegetarian but meat eaters will enjoy this place too.\n\nMezze platter was quite big even for 2 pax.\n\nReally enjoyed the moussaka and the Spanakopita.\n\nIf you pay by cash there is some free ice cream.\n\nFirst time visiting due to friend\u2019s recommendation. Did not disappoint. Lots of options that don\u2019t make you feel you\u2019re eating vegetarian. Drink menu is extensive but on pricey side. Service was good.\n\nAmbience - The restaurant has this very European, relaxed vibe. Good for families but I don\u2018t see why you can\u2019t go for a date either \ud83d\ude01\n\nFood - my friend and I ordered the halloumi salad and lasagna. We really enjoyed the meal, the ingredients were good quality and food was prepared with care. However, did feel the halloumi was a bit too salty. They have a variety of Mediterranean and Italian options and can make it vegan too. Didn\u2019t really enjoy the rose though.\n\nService - prompt service and the staff were polite and friendly\n\nWould definitely return again.\n\nYou won't believe how rare it is to have a Mediterranean vegetarian place that has so many allium free options, including the Pizzas. Glad to see original sin survive the pandemic when many didn't.\n\nThe Moussaka and Mediterranean pizza were good, though a little too salty but that's probably just me. Nice ambience for a date with friends or the significant other, especially over a good conversation. You pay for the quality. Enjoy!\n\nWonderful and classy vegetarian restaurant. Had dinner here with the wife on a weekday evening. Food was wholesome, good service and atmosphere. Recommended!\n",

Massive menu of delightful dishes.\nEasy to find - right next to the Budda Tooth Relic Temple.\nReservations are recommended\n\nThis is a pure vegetarian Chinese restaurant close to Buddha temple in Chinatown. For Indians, this is 'Jain vegetarian' - no onion, no garlic. The food was very tasty. Ben (pr\u00e9sume he is the owner) was very friendly. The warmth of the service added to the great experience. Though the menu doesn't look like a vegetarian one, these are all mock-meat..made from tofu. A nice place for vegetarians to get an authentic taste of Chinese food.\n\nA great survivor of the pandemic unlike it's contemporary Miao Yi at nearby People's Park Centre \ud83d\ude22. We are grateful that we still have a place for restaurant standard Chinese vegetarian cuisine. The Ee Fu noodles has a good balance of noodles and vegetables.\n\nSurprisingly, some dishes aren't that expensive, with the mock meat and tofu dishes going for $12 for the small version.

I even had the potato salad and as a black man, I'm very picky about this, but it was unique and really good! The pasta, the bread stick, the drinks, the miso soup with surprises at the bottom.

Please come here if you are VEGAN!!!! and I told the owners to please advertise that they have vegan options because they are so delicious \ud83e\udd24\ud83e\udd24\ud83e\udd24\n\nOnly two set meal options are available (6 courses or 8 courses ) No \u00c0 la carte option.

Their 8 Treasures Fried Rice and Thai Style Fried Rice are culinary brimming with flavors. Try the Fried Prawn, served with a delightful Pineapple Mayonnaise dip. It's a tantalizing blend of crispy goodness and sweet tanginess, complementing their diverse menu perfectly. The menu also boasts ethical choices like Vegetarian Sharkfin Soup, comforting and guilt-free. Don't forget to end your meal on a sweet note with the Cold Lemon with Aloe Vera Dessert, a refreshing delight.\n\nhaving vegan food during \u4e5d\u738b\u7237\u8bde\u3002food is quite decent, got many type of dessert as well. Price is abit expensive 20-30% compare to nearby shop maybe due to service and nice deco inside. Can come here for vegan food after praying at the guam yim temple.\n\nOne of my family\u2019s favourite restaurant especially my son\u2019s. The food is great over all these years, eaten almost 30 years. The price is reasonable except lunar new year. The boss is very friendly and the Chinese male staff gives great service. Our fav will be the cold dish, shark\u2019s fin soup and the fried bee-Hoon. The Mala is the one that is a bit expensive but really nice.\n\nVisited on 27/08/2022. Reached there around 2pm+ but still crowded majority 70% tables fully occupied. First time visited as wanted to try it's vegetarian food. Not much choices for ala carte  menu. So try its Fried Beehoon, $6. Taste-wise yummy. Order a pot of chrysanthemum tea $2,full of chrysanthemum flower in pot. If want to add some snack have to walk to entrance there's different types of snacks display in cabinets. Have to choose n used a tong to take and queue to pay only cash payment. Tried vegetarian chicken and vegetarian sping roll,it's yummy. For mode of payment there's Paywave but if you paid by cash will not charge of GST. Overall,like the yummy food, will definitely revisit again, to try others food.\n\nFood is not bad . But the service of some staff is horrendous . Its like cant wait for you to walk out of the store . ( so that they can be lazy again ? Then whats the point of employing so many ? )\n\nThe tall lady service staff quite ok\n( theres is only 1 tall lady service staff there so should be able to know who )\n\nThe others staffs manning the snacks station is also ok .\n\nThe elderly Auntie Cashier is VERY RUDE . Wanted to pay by card . ( Understood theres additional 8% ) and already made clear its ok . She still saying dont have cash etc with an annoyed look . Very very impolite .\n\n* looking among the comments . Service seems to be a perpetual problem here . Boss should take a look why this is so .\n( unless boss dont care bout the biz )\n",

The restaurant holds the legacy with not just the location, the interior but also to the taste with food. We tried a few variations including the famous meal and biriyani. A must try will be the meal combo, served hot. We had to wait for around 30 mins to get seated but it\u2019s worth the wait.. ground floor and first floor has seating capacity. The prices are very reasonable for the quantity being served. Will definitely recommend this place for all South Indian vegetarian fans!\n\nFood here is good, not that very bad. Service got to improve. Environment can be cramped and noisy. Pricey but still okay, you pay what you asked for. I was served food first, even finished up eating the foods but drinks were served after 5-10 after finishing up my meals. Masala tea arrived 30-40 minutes late upon ordering. This is not acceptable at all. And never even apologized for serving the drinks late. I ordered one ice tea and one masala tea. Also, I personally feel the standard of the food have dropped a lot. Used to patronize here often but I think it's about time that the service and food taste is falling apart.\nOverall food is 7.5/10.\nService is 3/10.\nEnvironment is 4.5/10.\nThis review is based on my honest opinion.\n\nI saw this on a food travel show and immediately wanted to try it out.\n\nThere was a short queue but seated after 5min or so wait. Service was friendly and no fuss. Dining area is simple but as expected.\n\nDefinitely lived up to expectations with amazing, fresh, authentic and tasty food. I had the dosai meal which had 3 curries, some chutneys, Daal, sambar, and even a sweet sago coconut pudding. Amazing flavours, colours and spices. A generous meal which was thoroughly enjoyable.\n\nFor a sweet finish I tried the almond hawa and milk kova which were both new to me. Very sweet but had their own unique taste and texture which hit the spot.\n\nOne improvement would be to use less plastic for serving food - lots of little plastic containers on my meal set and for sweets.\n\nOverall a great experience and will definitely be recommending and be back.\n\nThe food and service is always good in Komala Vilas. We stay nearby so we can walk to this restaurant during our jaunt in Singapore.\nI wish they include an elevator to go upstairs for lunch. On request they let my parents share the meals but mentioned there will be no refills.\nTaste is always exceptional.\n\nNestled in the heart of Little India, Singapore, Komala Vilas Indian Restaurant is a culinary gem that proudly showcases a rich history of authentic Indian cuisine. With a legacy spanning over several decades, this restaurant has been a beacon of tradition and a must-visit for anyone seeking genuine Indian flavors.\n\nAuthenticity Unveiled: Komala Vilas has stayed true to its roots, preserving the authenticity of Indian culinary traditions.

The experience started with their signature Afterglow Maki Rolls, a perfectly balanced spicy and tangy treat that set my taste buds alight, though they were a bit dry; however, upon request, the waiter kindly offered me some complementary almond spread as a dip.\n\nNext came the Cauliflower \u2018Steak\u2019. It was nothing short of a culinary marvel, turning a humble vegetable into a dish bursting with flavor and texture, both hearty and delightful.\n\nFinally came the Acai Bowl, a dessert that defied all my expectations. It wasn\u2019t just a simple bowl of fruit and granola; it was an artful blend of fresh, juicy fruits, the crunch of granola, and the velvety smoothness of acai sorbet. Each spoonful was a celebration of taste, striking a rare balance between indulgence and health. This dish wasn\u2019t just the end of a meal; it was the highlight, leaving a lasting impression of how incredibly satisfying and diverse vegan food can be.\n\nAfterglow isn\u2019t just a restaurant; it\u2019s a testament to the beauty and richness of vegan cuisine. It\u2019s a place where every dish is crafted with care, not just for the flavors but for the story it tells about plant-based eating. For anyone who cherishes vegan food or is curious about it, Afterglow is a must-visit. I loved it and will definitely be back!\n\nHad a very attentive server explaining the ingredients behind the dishes. The menu is well marked for common allergens such as nuts, gluten, alliums, etc.\n\nWe absolutely loved the vegan meatballs. Each dish was flavorful and even our non-vegans friends had an enjoyable experience at this restaurant. The salads are also nicely seasoned. Would like to come back for their desserts next time.\n\nThe place is quite cozy and intimate but perhaps not suitable for larger groups (6+ people) as it is hard to navigate between tables.\n\nFirst time visited with a friend for a lunch. The ambience and atmosphere is relaxing. The food portions are quite big and very satisfying. Really grateful for the kind lady who explained us and asked us if we had any allergies etc and notified us of the dishes that have nuts at the same time gave some good recommendations. Very attentive, detailed and the food was delicious. Such a heartwarming experience.\n\nSome of the dishes are very nice, but overall too pricey. I like the vegetable pur\u00e9e, tomyum zoodles and cold lasagne very much. The beetroot hummus is good too. Kimchi roll is decent as well.\n\nThe atmosphere was cozy and inviting, perfect for a relaxing meal. The staff members were incredibly friendly and welcoming.  They took the time to give us detailed explanations of the dishes and provided us with their recommendations.\n\nEvery dish we've tried was bursting with flavors even though its vegan.\nOne dish that really stood out to me was the mushroom balls.\nIts packed with savory umami flavors and the texture is on point.\nThe cauliflower steaks were also perfectly seasoned and had a delightful char that added a smoky depth to the dish.\n\nThe friendly and attentive service combined with the incredible food made for a truly memorable dining experience.\n",

They have Punjabi, Gujarati thali, special Jalebi and Froops fruit based ice creams. Food taste will be average and service will be good, staff is very friendly and timely serves the customers.\n\nFood: The food was delicious, well flavoured and not the extremely spicy. We tried the puri bhaji and the bhaji was a little bland but we added a bit of salt and it was good to go. I got their dal batti churma as a takeaway and the dal was delicious, however the bati was a little different and more doughy than I\u2019m used to but it was still delicious. The churma however had more sugar than wheat so that could do with improvement. The star was definitely the gatta Sabzi which was extremely delicious. The dahi puri was also delicious. Overall, we were satisfied and would definitely eat there again. They have a wide variety from Mexican, Italian to the normal North Indian and Indo Chinese and being a vegetarian restaurant, it provides great variety to vegetarians.\n\nService: This wasn\u2019t great as the staff who attended us was a bit rude. He kept on insisting that we should order more puris (we got 4 to share between 2 ladies) but we know how we can eat. The dahi puri was the last thing to come and i had forgotten that we\u2019d ordered it so I said this is not ours and he said \u201cthis one ordered\u201d referring to my friend. My friend was very shocked and I feel more training should be given to staff so they know how to refer to people. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a very nice way to refer to your customers.\n\nAmbience - It\u2019s not a fancy place and as it was the weekend, it was quite packed and a bit stuffy. However, we didn\u2019t mind as the food made up for it.\n\nGreat place for Gujarathi thali in Singapore . Good ala Carte options reminds of mumbai food . We had both Punjabi and Gujarati thali\n\nExcellent vegetarian place.\n\nThere are numerous fusion loads to choose from, including Indian and Mexican menus. The food was flavorful and delectable. Portion size was reasonable for the price.\nFriendly staff and excellent service.\n\nOverall, it was a pleasant experience. I will definitely return.\n\nI recently ate there and it was delicious! I can't wait to go back and try more dishes. Everything was so flavorful and fresh, and the prices were reasonable too.\n",

Ask for it to be heated up for you.\n\nA tip: it can get really packed so you might end up with a sofa seat rather than a dining table. Try booking a table!\n\nCompared to typical Chinese vegetarian restaurants, which serve mainly fried foods , this restaurant serves many greens options, and the salad really tastes good.\n\nOrdered three different types of pizza, and the odd one is the \"Tom Yum.\" Pizza tastes really a bit weird.  The taste of Yum ingredients does not blend well with the pizza \ud83d\ude05.\n\nWe also ordered two burgers, and they are very nice.\n\nOverall, this is a very nice restaurant for both vegetarian or non vegetarian persons who like to have a healthy meal \ud83d\ude0b\n\nVery pleasant ambience and super polite staff!

The food was fabulous. Everything was nice, except for two. Tom yum pizza and the broccoli pizza. The taste was exotic and overwhelming for my wife and I. Rojak is a must try, and I love the varieties of Tea  in the Menu. I heard the dumping was good, it was sold out during my visit, will try next time.\n",

                  "reviews": "\n\nI want to preface this review by mentioning that I'm not a professional food critic, and my thoughts are based on how I felt during my family dinner experience for my grandfather's birthday.\n\nOur dining experience was unfortunately not up to our expectations. Firstly, the food left much to be desired as everything tasted very bland. We had to request salt and pepper, and even after adding a generous amount, it didn't do much to enhance the flavours.\n\nTo make matters worse, the servers missed out on serving the APPLE CIDER, which was supposed to be part of our 8-course meal. Instead, they brought it to us at the end of the entire meal while we were already packing up to leave soon. This left us feeling quite disappointed.\n\nOn a positive note, I must say that the atmosphere was pleasant and contributed to the overall experience. However, the lackluster food and the timing of the cider service were significant drawbacks to what should have been a special family celebration.\n\nCelebrated my birthday here with my friend :) We were served by Mr Peter who did a great job in service and even gave me a surprise birthday treat towards the end.\n\nThe service here is impeccable and food is absolutely delicious! The set meal offered is very affordable, about $80 for 2 pax (8 course meal) \ud83d\ude0a\n\n10/10 will visit again. Thank you Mr Peter!\n\nWell done vegetarian restaurant with lovely set meals.\n\nCame here for lunch, and loved the decor and set up. Ordered the 5 course set meal and was delighted at the selections available.\n\nI was however abit let down by the portion of the mains. The food was done very well, I loved the appetizers, but the mains was abit of a let down, portion wise. Taste was good and I really hoped the portion could be bigger as it was such a minimal serving that I was not even full after the 5 course meal. Service was ok but the servers did appear quite busy.\n\nIt would be worth coming over to try the dishes and experience vegetarian done in a very classy way.\n\nThe waiters had an average attitude and felt like they wanted to finish their work quickly, you could tell they were busy. Despite having booked a table a couple of weeks ago, we were placed close to the kitchen and the entrance to the restaurant, we did ask for a change of location but were refused. The food was average, nothing particularly good, the value for money is okay.\n\nWe have been patronising this Elemen outlet at the Millenia Walk since 2017, and never once have we been let down by their service or quality of food.\nThey serve a wide variety of fusion vegetarian cuisine at an affordable price. The food are flavourful to the palate and their presentation are pleasing to the eyes.\nThis outlet is helmed by Manager Peter and Asst Manager Cheng Yee who are friendly, accommodative and customer oriented.\nHowever, due to manpower shortage and during peak hours, slowness in service may occur.\n",

The highlight of the meal was the seafood stew. All the breads were also exceptionally delicious. However, the sea bass tasted very ordinary and the sky high price tag went to the showy \u2018performance\u2019 by the chef. Restaurant was too dim and had a funky smell.\n\nThe staff are very friendly and the food is also tasty. The portion is surprisingly big and we ate till our hearts content.\n\nStaff very helpful and polite. Atmosphere is chill with soft music. Food serve just in the right timing.  Of cause the price is not cheap. But it worth the price overall.\n\nLastly thanks for the birthday cake. Love it but we were too full to finish it.\n\nBooked Sunday afternoon to have their set lunch, only to find out they only serve buffet that day at $78++ per person. Opted in anyway and didn't regret it, given the fresh ingredients, great taste of Italian and friendly staffs! Personally I love the dessert section especially Panna Cotta! If I had to pick on something, it'd be the dim lighting. No discount on the bill even with Shangri-la Circle membership, but you do get extra points.\n\nRemember, when you get into the lobby, you are on 3F. You need to take an elevator to get down to 1F where the restaurant is.\n\nThe restaurant has decent ambience for a semi chic and comfortable dinning experience. The salt crusted fish is delicious and if you want to see some fire show. The winner for me is the crab pasta. Yum!\n\nWe celebrated our anniversary dinner here and it was a great decision! They generously presented us a complimentary cake, thank you for perfecting the night.\nAmong the dishes, we absolutely love the Porchetta. It was tender, yet crispy and flavourful, Highly recommended! While on the other side, we didn\u2019t like the potato pur\u00e9e in the braised lamb leg dishes. It may have ruined the experience with that main dish. Despite that, this would not stop us from giving 5 stars because the other aspects (service/ambience) make up to it. A great dining place for celebrations.\n",

The steak was served dry and raw which when we complained was taken back, warmed and served back. 18$ truffle fries were soggy and salty. We paid like 250$ for 3 dishes and dessert.\n\nA romantic place for lovers. Surrounded by nature and good food. There's nothing to not like here.\nAmidst lush greenery and pristine forest air, it's truly \"Love's in the air\".\nYou can't help falling in love after this.\nFinish the meal with a kiss \ud83d\udc8b to seal in the memories. \u2764\ufe0f.\nBy the way, menu is also halal.. \ud83d\ude0a\n\nThe place is great. Not noisy on a weekday. Staff were excellent. Food options was good. Pricing felts a little on the high side. Restaurant has kids menu option - one of the pasta choice didnt taste great. Serving portion is good.\n\nIt was a work dinner where we pre ordered the items of the set menus. I had the Wagyu rump steak which was really good, no gamey taste and very juicy. Dessert was Valrhona chocolate tart which was so sinfully good, very chocolatey. The Halia also served complimentary matcha and banana chocolate macaroons.\n\nThe place was very nice, covered with greenery.\nService was great, staffs were attentive and food was served timely spaced out.\nNot a place that\u2019s very accessible unless you drive or take a hired ride. If you don\u2019t drive, it\u2019s a little hard to get a ride out.\n\nThe food here is fantastic. They are masters with flavour and use of herbs. It\u2019s so in line with the whole experience of dining in the Botanical Gardens. For starters, the Octopus and duck are a must try. For Mains, get the scallops (they come with Barramundi). Both are great and served with beautiful balsamic vinegar (not the supermarket kind).\n",

The food surpassed our expectations, with each dish reflecting a perfect blend of flavors and culinary expertise. The menu showcases a diverse selection, catering to various palates.\n\nThe ambience, especially during sunset, adds an enchanting touch to the dining experience. The view is breathtaking, creating a serene backdrop for a memorable meal. The well-thought-out decor and layout contribute to a sophisticated yet inviting atmosphere.\n\nMoreover, the service at Dusk is impeccable. The staff is attentive, knowledgeable, and goes above and beyond to ensure a delightful dining experience. Their recommendations were spot-on, enhancing our overall enjoyment.\n\nWhile the prices are reflective of the quality offered, the outstanding food, captivating ambience, and top-notch service make Dusk Restaurant & Bar a must-visit for those seeking a memorable and refined Modern European culinary adventure.\n\nGreat ambience & food. Celebrated my mum\u2019s birthday here. We all loved the food. The beef cheek was really tender and mash was really creamy. The lobster was cooked really nicely. Even the birthday cake served on the house was good \ud83d\ude0b it was a really decadent and rich chocolate cake.\n\nYou could even purchase add-on cable car rides at the restaurant for just $5 per head.\n\nWe really enjoyed having our meal here as the view was fantastic. We went at 6.30pm and managed to enjoy the sunset. Food is reasonably priced considering the service and atmosphere. We were also given a complimentary slice of cake as it was my partner\u2019s birthday.\n\nREALLY NICE MEAL OUT\n\nPopped into Dusk for dinner with a reservation. The highlight was the service we received, cordial and attentive! The food was simple but well done, but the cocktail mixes \ud83c\udf79 and beer options \ud83c\udf7a weren\u2019t very impressive. Being said that, Dusk offered us such brilliant views, beautifully appointed and had an astonishing view of the city. Normally views like that carry a serious price tag, but to our surprise it\u2019s surprisingly affordable here, and both food and drinks were well priced. Thumbs up!\n\nVisited this place with 4 other friends last evening, and we managed to catch the sunset there! The view was amazing and beautiful!\n\nThe restaurant atmosphere was quite zen and chill when the sun is still up, and becomes romantic when the sun goes down. Haha! Quite a good environment for dates and/or hanging out with friends.\n\nMost of the food is deliciously yummy, especially their meat items. We ordered the following:\n- 3 sharing platters (1 beef, 1 lamb, 1 pork)\n- 2 mains (prawn pasta and fish&chips)\n- 1 sides (tomato meatballs)\n\nI feel that everything's tasted good but some of my friends felt that the pasta wasn't up to their standards. Oh well~ to each of its own... I highly recommend the beef and lamb sharing platters and the meatballs!\n\nAs for the drinks, most of them are quite common like anywhere else but at affordable prices! There are a few unique drinks but weren't available last evening. \ud83d\ude14\n\nLove the atmosphere and vibe. Will definitely visit this place again when there's occassions to celebrate. \ud83d\ude04\n\nFYI, the restaurant is an outdoor one and there's only fans around.\n",

There was no reception upon entering the hotel, and the manager was not particularly friendly nor understanding: I had made a reservation prior for the rooftop bar, but I was not informed that there was a minimum spending required of $75 per person. It would have been courteous at least to have been informed prior. As such, my expectation of a pleasant dinner experience turned out to be an unpleasant and short-lived meal, what more right in the middle of the dim-lit hotel lounge as guests continued to stream in (yet with no other diners at 7pm), and while the manager worked at the table right next to us. That being said, if you can afford to spend for a luxurious atmosphere at the expense of a service, professionalism and good food, go ahead.\n\nCosy upscale Italian restaurant located on the ground floor of a boutique 5 star hotel.\n\nSurprisingly empty on a Saturday evening, so we had the entire wait staff looking after us.\n\nWe started off with a refreshing French 77 drink paired with Tartufo Fries and Burrata Pomodoro & Pesto. Pretty good truffle fries, but not the best I had.\n\nCape Santa alla Griglia (scallops) was almost mind-blowing, with a crispy bread that is really delicious if you dip it in the amazing broth before taking a bite, and well-cooked scallops. Repeat note: Amazing broth.\n\nTruffle porcini was a pretty big portion and really creamy. They ran out of the fresh truffle slices, whicj would have made this dish perfect.\n\nWe finished off with a classic Aperol Spritz. Done nicely, though not the best I had.\n\nOverall, this is an excellent Italian dining option.\n\nFoods are awesome especially the pizza mama mia(sorry cant pronounce the name)! We always come back because of the best customer service by Marcello. Not only that he gives the best food in the menu but he put personal touch in his service.\n\nLoved all the dishes and the service was great too. Went up to the rooftop bar after dinner which had great views. A nice place to chill when you're done with dinner.\n\nChanced upon this place after seeing a review of places with rooftop bar. The food is not pretentious, instead they are what you would expect of delicious Italian food. The environment and hospitality is a plus - with the opportunity to head for a drink at the rooftop bar before settling for dinner at the restaurant. Great place wind down to have a Italian fare in a chic but relatively inexpensive place.\n",

Didn\u2019t have expectations and was pleasantly surprised.\n\nWe had booked a table outside but the Singapore heat was too much to handle and decided to sit inside, which the staff were very kind in accommodating. Salmon was good and cooked well. The penne vodka sauce pasta was tasty and the caesar salad good as well.\n\nHaving lunch here is a great way to get views from the top of Marina Bay Sands without paying the admission fee for the deck.\n\nWe had a beautiful birthday dinner here, made better thanks to professional and friendly service, delicious Italian food, and a chill, cozy ambience.\n\nThe music can be quite upbeat that is similar to a club but softer, adding to the relaxed yet personal dining experience. Thank you to the team for a wonderful experience in the sky.\n\nWonderful view\nSo great for sunset\nWe were also able to catch the Super Tree Grove light show at 7:45 and then run to other side to watch the Spectra Water & Light show at 8:00\n\nWe only ate the truffle gnocchi & giant 1 pound meatball, be forewarned it is a meal all by itself.\nThe meat ball was great quality meat, my hubby said it was dry for his taste and the sauce saved it but I felt it was pretty juicy, so to each their own\nThe truffle gnocchi was absolute PERFECTION. The gnocchi was a good size and not to soft or mushy like it can get sometimes. The truffle flavor was very pronounced just the way I like itS and I particularly love that they shredded the truffle like a garnish on top rather than just one huge chunk of truffle. That way I could get a bite truffle and every single mouthful.\n\nAnd at the end they surprised us with a happy anniversary cake and I have to say that cake was surprisingly good. I really enjoyed it.\n\nThe view and the staff are definitely the highlight of this place. The awesome skyline of Singapore can be appreciated from this restaurant, especially if you sit in the outdoor patio. In terms of food, it can be better. The price tag for some of the dishes are high considering it\u2019s quality.\n\nOverall very good service by our waiter. We really got the pasta as we asked for. Great. Our table wasn't ready as it just started raining and everyone needed to be moved inside.\nView inside not really great but of course outside. Wine was quite pricey and not really good. But if you want to be once up.. best option!\n",

Great service and thanks for making our Friday a truly enchanting experience.. will bring friends here next time!\n\nNice Indian bistro with good live Indian music. Even better food. Their padayapa rice is damn shiok. Their fried chicken wings too.\n\nVisiting Singapore for a holiday and staying with my sister's family who lives there. We came here on a Saturday evening to celebrate her birthday. Her family is a regular at this place.\n\nWe certainly had a great time celebrating her birthday. The live band belting out the tamil songs were in their element and they were so gracious to take in all of the song requests coming from the patrons.\n\nThis was like an experience never before for me coming in from Chennai to have a tamil songs playing at a resto bar. We had Guinness on tap which was fine. The food orders took quite some time though and all of them were tasting good. I would definitely come back here in my next visit to Singapore as well.\n\nThe band and music was good. Service was ok as the wait staff were always walking around.\n\nProblem was the wait for food was terrible. 2hrs for a Padaiyappa rice and the other dishes had to be reminded and main white rice had to be called again after the dishes arrived. Couldnt enjoy the meal and food.\n\nThe ambience and music band with TV for football was good. But food service was appalling.\n\nSuggest to minimise your menu to finger food as Fri/Sat are your peak and cant seem to handle food orders once 8 or more pax at a table comes. I spent about $400 but didnt get the dinner feel from eating. Focus on e music and drinks and some light finger food.\n\nWestern and Indian and local menu maybe too much to handle for the business. Background music toned down a bit would also be good to hear us talking at the table.\n\nThe reviews all seem to say the same thing. Try work on it. We'll come again. But just music and drinks this time.\n\nOur go-to place for drinks after basketball games in the evening. Prices for beers are good, and more importantly for me, they have a tap for Guinness. Fries and nuggets are our staple bar foods with the drinks. And added points for the always obliging staff to spare us packs of ice for our ceremonial icing down of old joints after games.\n",

Their firewood pizza is not to be missed too. A perfect environment to stay and chill with a glass or wine or beer after a nice dinner.\n\nI visited this place for a dinner date. We had already made a reservation in advance, as we knew very well that this place would be packed on the weekends.\n\nThe staff were very nice to greet us as we made our way into the restaurant and even walked us over to our tables. The waiter at the time was very observant, and would constantly check up on how we were  doing.\n\nMore on the food:\n\n(Appetizer)\nBurrata Bruschetta - 8/10 \ud83c\udf1f\n- The Burrata was really lovely!\n- The sweet and juicy tomatoes compliments the creamy and milky cheese\n\nHowever, the bread was a little tougher than expected that our knives struggle to cut through. Nevertheless, it was pretty delicious \ud83e\udd24\ud83d\ude0b\n\n(Appetizer)\nEggplant Parmigiana -  10/10 \ud83c\udf1f\ud83e\udd0c\n- Absolutely bussin!\n- It tastes better than a regular lasagne, the eggplant is barely noticeable. Which is good in a way as my partner is not too much of a fan of veggies.\n- The sauce topped with the cheese just makes this dish one of the best in my opinion\n\n(Main)\nDiavola pizza - 9/10 \ud83c\udf1f\n- Spicy, greasy and meaty pizza\n- The spicy and salty sorpressata balances the thick and absorbent pizza dough\n- Low-key better than pepperoni pizzas \ud83e\udd2d\n\n*Unfortunately I forgot to take a picture*\n\n(Dessert)\nFlamb\u00e9ed Chocolate Ecstasy - 6/10\ud83c\udf1f\n- Presentation was really good \ud83d\udc4d\n- Interesting concept of both Hot and Cold dessert\n\nHowever, our brownies were a little too frozen \ud83d\ude15. We knew it was a hot and cold dessert as there was ice cream served with the hot-plated brownies. But when we tried to scoop booth goodies, the brownie was frozen hahaha. Interesting concept but would recommend other stuff like the tiramisu maybe.\n\nOverall, excellent experience. Prompt service, a little pricey but worth the occasional visits. Came in hungry, left full  \ud83d\ude35\n\nMy first time dining here and the staffs here are really sweet and customer oriented. They made the dining here with my girlfriend beyond pleasant. They made small talks with you and check on you regarding the quality of the food. The food was amazing but my friend and I couldn\u2019t finished it because we are 2 girls that over ordered. If you are going for a date, this place is extremely ideal. Will definitely be back.\n\nWas here for a birthday celebration. Staff was very nice and provided complimentary tiramisu cake (slightly alcoholic), which tasted phenomenal. Pizza is very well balanced and does not get gelat from a few bites, while the pastas and risottos pack a good flavourful punch. In total, it was slightly pricey but overall nice place to wine and dine.\n\nRegarding indoors seating, music is kinda loud to have a clear conversation. Place is pet friendly and there are many dogs around\n\nService was underwhelming for the price paid.  Not the worst. But one would expect better.\n\nFood. so long is pizza or pasta or Italian is nice. The pork chop was soso only.  Pizza came before the starters.\n\nDessert is a must have!! The tiramsu and flaming chocolate extasy. Don't touch the hot pan!!!\n\nWine selection is good and recommendation by the wine guy was great!!!\n\nGood for celebrations... or hangout.\nBut bring a big wallet.\n\nFree parking (4hrs) too if u need to know  1 ticket per bill.\n",

We ordered the eggs Ben and French Toast Brioche, latte and flat white. The food and coffee were excellent, the portion of eggs Ben was a bit small though. A great place to chill!!\n\nMy first visit to Merci Marcel and my friends and I had a good time bonding over the food and the servers were great, especially Marilyn who was patient in giving us and overview of food selects and sharing the specials of the day. Soft yellow lighting gave it a nice cosy family/friends evening gathering atmosphere vibes. Thumbs up!\n\nGood services. Food is presented artistically.\nLatte is nice with a cute pattern, although this pattern is not very stable.\nThe French toast is okay. A bit pricy but understandable because this is Orchard.\nGood environment with sunshine.\n\nVery good! Although we didn't have a reservation, they managed to fit us in. The staff were all friendly and provided a fast and efficient service. The food and coffee were amazing, not to mention the cafes' atmosphere was very relaxing. It was a lovely breakfast and experience.\n\nAmazing place, nice atmosphere. Food was excellent but the portions are small (unless you ordered pizza). Also on the higher price range, so do take note. Great for special occasions though!\n",

Alfresco was cooling and chill vibes.\nTruffle mushroom pizza is one of the best I have ever eaten. Not too creamy, just nice. Truffle has a complex taste, nothing monotonous like the cheap gas smell.\n\nSeafood pasta was also great, strong umami taste with a touch of spicy\n\nAmazing food, one of the best dinners I've eaten, ever.\n\nBoth crabmeat pasta and truffle pizza were delicious and exceeded our expectations. Thin crust pizza paired with mushrooms and truffle oil, mmmm.\n\nOur lava cake took a while as the first had an incident. That was fine. However, the second one came and it wasn't lava'ish. No chocolate flow and it was just warm which is disappointing.\n\nAnother issue is no free tap water which I had an issue with. It's $2 for water which is non-refillable.\n\nStaff service and the other two food were impeccable. Will definitely return to try other dishes, probably skip the lava cake.\n\nFood is above average. Atmosphere is great and not overpowering. Dog friendly. Staff are generally attentive, younger staff tends to be more casual and overlooking details. Indoor is ac, outdoor is open and dog friendly.\n\nA quiet dining place within the bishan park. Easy to park your car and short walk to the restaurant. Food were nice and a variety of wine and beer with happy hours will 8pm. A good place to chill, happy and drink.\n\nRelatively standard menu. Limited vegetation options. I ordered the Margerita pizza.\nThe service of food was prompt and the staff was quite polite.\nThe taste wasn't bad but not exceptional and gave me the feeling that the menu is a bit overpriced.\nThe indoor seating can get a bit noisy due to the canopy styled roof and echo. There is an outdoor seating option that also allows you to bring pets I think.\nOne thing I wasn't too happy with, was the cleanliness of the toilet.\nIts a nice option to go with if you are in the vicinity but keep expectations moderate.\n",

The \"meaty\" harlequin sandwich was meant to have lots of meat, Tabasco sauce and proper cheese, however I was served a greasy and soggy sandwich today had dripping egg yolk, two measly skinny strips of streaky bacon and missing the Tabasco... The service is good, interesting themed environment if you're going there for a drink (or two) by the river. Was surprisingly expensive for what we got, must be.....the location?\n\nI think it\u2019s a nice place to hang out to have a drink by the river. However the food was really bad. The French onion soup was really salty. The mushroom soup was served cold. When we told them, could see that they just took it back and threw it in the microwave as it came back with a thick skin on top of the soup. The onion blossom wasn\u2019t fried well and I could taste the flour.  The onion was also slightly raw. I ordered the masala ratatouille for my main and I do not know what came (some mush of vegetables blended together). The only edible thing was the little bit of rice on top.  I would probably not come here again for food.\n\nUndercooked salmon which we got the waiter to send back. It came back still undercooked to our dismay so we sent it back once again. After 20 minutes, we went to check on the progress of the cooking and realised they haven\u2019t started it. We were slightly annoyed. Thankfully they apologised and agreed to waive the order. Nothing too special abt the food. The calamari was oily and the batter didn\u2019t stick to the protein. Same as the cod fish bites. The western dishes were nice. King prawn pasta was good. I liked the view of the water and the distant city lights. The place had an abundance of alcoholic options so great for drinking. It was dog friendly which is a plus but the outdoor area could be better maintained.\n\nNice and quiet place to come chill or work like we did today, with a beautiful on the downtown skyline. A perfect hideout without the hustle and bustle.\n\nI think Kontiki has somewhat lost its shine. Food can definitely be better - tried their local food fusion dishes but was left disappointed. Noodles were quite undercooked and just totally underwhelming. Prawns were big and looked nice but idk I guess your chef was having a bad morning or something. Probably just stick to western food.\n\nThe store could use more upkeep especially in the outdoor areas.\n",

Special thank you to the team for looking after my friend who doesn\u2019t eat beef by replacing it with something equally delicious, small touches like this show that this is a restaurant that really cares for its diners. Don\u2019t miss out on burnt ends!\n\nWe went for the chef selection.\nThe portions was small so can try many things.\n\nTaste wise are beyond average, but not to the extend of giving a lot of excitement\nThe dessert was great. Wines was great.\n\nDefinitely nice environment for sure\nVery good service.\n\nTried the chef\u2019s menu where the head chef Vincent prepared for us highlights of Burnt ends plus some new items.\n\nReally enjoyed the dinner. Firstly, the service was exceptional. One person on my table doesn\u2019t eat raw food or beef and Vincent prepared a menu that catered to that for her.\n\nThe food was also mind blowing. The food really made use of amazing fresh ingredients that are cooked to perfection. The beef steak at the end had a nice char to the crust. The uni on the crab toast was mouth wateringly good. The marmalade beef on toast was also so soft and delicious.\n\nOverall, a superb dinner. The cocktails and wine selection were also amazing, and I highly recommend ordering.\n\ngreat experience as some dishes do not taste as you expected how it would be. love the surprising element. overall food was superb. sourdough was super good.\n\nHas to be my favorite restaurant in Singapore! Every single dish represented Singapore\u2019s melting pot of culinary landscape really well! Food tasted great, and cooked with pride!\n\nI love the service as well! Jasmine was pinpoint with her recommendations. I thoroughly enjoyed her enthusiasm and sense of humor as well \u2764\ufe0f.

The menu is different from then but the quality of the food is consistent! We loved almost everything. Not to mention, the attentiveness and warmth of the staff - really made the whole dining experience more enjoyable\n\nOverlooking Singapore CBD, Marina Bay Sands, Singapore Flyer, and the sea, the view from the restaurant was simply breathtaking. The food presentation was impeccable, and I particularly enjoyed the beef tartare as well as the burrata with ham and figs. However, I found both main dishes, the chicken breast, and iberico pork a bit on the dry side, but overall, they were still satisfactory. The service was outstanding, and I was touched by their attentiveness to my reservation note about celebrating my boyfriend's birthday. They remembered and brought out a delicious sticky date cake with a candle and birthday wishes, creating a wonderful surprise. The overall experience was truly fantastic.\n\nStaff service was top notch ! Food was amazing and special. We were treated with a full moon night view too ! Even my 8 year old commented \u201cGood Service\u201d ! Definitely will be back for more :)\n\nI would give more than 5 stars if it was possible. An unforgettable and delicious last diner in Singapore after 1 week. And the sauvignon blanc was perfect!\n\nFood is not good as we expected. Ambience is nice and cozy though. I understand from colleagues that the finger food at cocktail section is appetizing, they recommended the french fries.\n",

Salad was quite sumptuous, only that we had to ask for additional dressings and some salt to add flavour. Beef cheek was fantastic and recommended, while the pumpkin mac & cheese was ok although I were not crazy about. Night time was a great place to be. Price was above average.\n\nWe were here to celebrate a colleague\u2019s birthday. The ambience was great and food was delicious. Homemade Gnocchi with Porcini Mushrooms was certainly my favorite. Service staff were friendly and attentive. Overall it was a pleasant and enjoyable dining experience.\n\nDelicious Italian food in a nice, mostly outdoor setting. Very nice patio, much of it covered if needed, and some indoor seating. Food was great, loved the gnocchi in truffle cream sauce. The namesake mozzarella dishes were also very good. The service was friendly, but sometimes hard to find. Would definitely go back again.\n\nI came here for dinner with a friend. The restaurant is in a great location and the outdoor space is particularly lovely at night. Their speciality is of course the variety of Italian cheeses they offer, but this also leads me to why I don\u2019t come here more often: the menu isn\u2019t really the best for couples. It would be great if they offered portions or even a mix of cheese dishes that were sized and priced appropriately for two people to share. As it is, they\u2019re a little large and, frankly, rather expensive. Likewise, the rest of the menu offers some nice dishes, but it\u2019s not a huge range and we struggled a bit to find things we could share. For larger groups, I think this would be less of a concern, and there is a set menu available, as well. I just wish they had a more couples-friendly menu. The dishes we tried were of course all very tasty. Likewise, service was nice and friendly.\n\nWe ordered the smoked burratina which was really good and I mean the mozarellas are a must order since its in the name. Pastas were good but the mains stood out for me. Service was great as well, staff were attentive and friendly. I really loved the ambience as well, the outdoor seating just felt so cozy and intimate.\n",

As for the taste, not much of surprise in any way.\n\nThe Arrabiata pasta (not fresh pasta) didn't gave the woah effect in any way as well. Saving grace was the fresh prawns.\n\nMy wife tried the Gnocchi with gorgonzola. Pasta (fresh) texture wasn't good, sauce not really to our likely.\n\nAnother disappointment is the dessert from the set lunch, which we had ordered the flourless Chocolate cake. Look at the picture and you will understand. Taste, so-so, maybe due to the presentation.\n\nLastly is the Tiramisu, saving grace to not get below 3 stars.\n\nOverall, not a place which we would be considering to go again.\n\nThis is my 5th visit to Poco Loco. Each visit I am always bowled over by the great food . This is a hidden gem at Upper Thomson. I have eaten at many Italian restaurants, I have to say the pasta here are extremely good, full of flavour and really satisfying . Not sure where did the chef previously came from but I dare say it is even as good as some of higher class restaurants like Etna. Highly recommend.\n\nValue for money! We tried PocoLoco for the first time and we really enjoyed our meal. We ordered 1 dinner set ($45), which consisted of an appetiser, 1 pasta dish, 1 main course and 1 dessert, there\u2019s an option to order a glass of wine for $8. We ordered an extra pasta dish with lamb as well. Portion was good (not too small/big) and our favourite was the pork collar main course (part of the dinner set). Price was nett and drinks were reasonably priced as well ($2 for jasmine green tea and other soft drinks). Overall it was enjoyable and value for money.\n\nGenerally the food is fresh and not too bad. We had mushroom soup, calamari, spaghetti carbonara, spaghetti arrabbiata, spaghetti vongole, Panna Cotta and chocolate flourless cake.The first 2 items and the last are worth trying. Could give the calamari a miss though. The restaurant is within 5mins walking distance from tel station exit 4.\n\nJun 2023. I always loved pocoloco Italian food. We got mushroom soups, seafood pasta and lasagne.\nNothing to complain about.\n",

Food freshness and quality good. A lot of design has gone into their food presentation. Ambience of the place is great and the view of the bay is unparalleled. Only downside - price could have been cheaper. \ud83d\ude09\n\nThis place has a wow factor. The 19th floor view of Marina Bay Sands and its surroundings are astounding. Service was impeccable.\n\nThe angel hair pasta was one of the best I ever tasted. The halibut was perfectly done. I don't like fish that is overcooked. The duck breast did not have any gamely taste. The \"melt in the mouth\" beef cheek was tender and tasty. Definitely worth a second visit.\n\nView of Vue is breath taking. Perfect for a romantic date. Celebrate the hub bday here. We order a A5 Black wagyu that melt in your mouth but was serve a little too cold for my liking, we top with a foie gras which taste great on the sweet side. Cheese platter was great. Tuna tartar was ok. We also ordered a the Darjeeling Poached Pear dessert. Unlimited servings of Fat Beef bread with the dip was very tasty. The restaurant also surprise us with complimentary birthday dessert as well. The bill came up to be $600++. Outstanding Customer service by one of the male staff with spect, he is not only attentive, also very observant. Did I mention he is a superb photographer as well \ud83d\ude0d. The Caucasian lady waitress gives off a tired of working vibe. Unfriendly, when we express need for help, she answered in a way as if we have no money to dine there. When we were leaving I say thank u smiling to her she even return a half eye forced smile, not really bothered by it but really \ud83d\ude44. I would recommend Vue for the atmosphere, not too intimidating.\n\nIt was a wonderful fine dining experience with awesome service!\n\nThe wine was smooth and nice too!\n\nPerfect place for any celebrations or just a fantastic meal with awesome view of Singapore skyline!\n\nMy second visit. My last visit was during the pandemic.\n\nToday\u2019s lunch was very satisfactory. Food was improved than last time. It is not amazing but good. They allowed us to choose 2 appetisers for 3 course meal, which was satisfying.\n\nService was flawless.\nAtmosphere is great- it is quiet so you can actually hear what your friends are saying (in many restaurants in Singapore, it can get quite rowdy and you cannot hear what those sitting next to you say)\u2026here they provide ample space and long distance between tables. Ceiling is high and the whole space is quite magnificent.\n\nAll of my friends felt it was not bad value for money. We usually dine in hotels and fine restaurants. So my standards might be a little bit different from tourists.\n\nWe love the view. I have been to many places with the MBS view (Jaan, Smoke & Mirrors, Art, Dolce Vita, Level 33, One Fullerton area, Monti, Fullerton Bay hotel, Fullerton Hotel and so on)\u2026 but I think this place has the best view.\n\nThe only downside is they open new bottles of water without informing us. We thought we had two bottles but we ended up paying for three bottles of sparkling water. Not a deal breaker but it would be nice to ask each time they open a new bottle.\n",

We highly recommend trying the White Truffle Tagliolini while it is still in season. The ambiance of the restaurant is brilliant, perfect place for a romantic dinner, or just a night out with friends/family. We wholeheartedly recommend this restaurant to anyone who appreciates fine Italian cuisine and exceptional service.\n\nOur server, Cheryl/Cherry, went above and beyond to make our dining experience truly exceptional, we want to express our sincere gratitude for making our dining experience memorable. Your professionalism, friendliness, and knowledge about the menu were outstanding!\n\nFrom the food itself to the service offered all we could say is it\u2019s stunningly perfect. Mr Ronnie helped us much, even with the picture taking , he\u2019s even so vibrant to all the guests he served.  We\u2019re also glad that the team keep on checking with us on what we needed and they are of such great help , Mr Mark was there to help and even gave us a complimentary dessert. Special thanks to Mr Suren who did a great job and elaborate to us the foods and wine which was served .\n\nThe wine which was served to us is just so\ud83d\udc4c.\nSalute to the mentioned names for going above and beyond on serving us.\n\nCame here for the first time to celebrate an anniversary and it couldn\u2019t have been a better choice.\n\nSourdough bread was unassuming but soooo fresh and fluffy, the best we\u2019ve had! We enjoyed our starters which were the lobster and the carpaccio more than we did the mains! But overall food was delicately plated and delicious.\n\nThe service here was nothing short of amazing as well, the waiters were very attentive and explained each dish to us, checked on how we\u2019d like the food every now and then which we appreciate.\n\nEspecially enjoyed the part where we got the option to have our desserts alfresco with the amazing view of the city lights and MBS area.\n\nPricey but overall would recommend for a special occasion!\n\nThis is the first time I have visited an Italian place, not had a pizza and pasta primarily, and still walked away full and satisfied. We took a set 3/4 course menu, and the chef was kind enough to bake in dietary preferences (eg. Vegetarian for me). All the items were amazing. But (weirdly) a special callout for the warmest and loveliest bread that I have eaten in a long time. And yes, if you do manage to get a seat outside, the view of Marina bay is just spectacular.\n\nStaff were absolutely friendly and attentive. I brought my mom who rarely enjoys fine dining but she thoroughly enjoyed her experience and were overjoyed with the dessert recommended by the manager. The ambience is cosy. Decor and interior looks ok but not too exciting. Desserts were truly the highlight. We had the espresso mascarpone and amalfi lemon desserts and it was perfect for both our taste buds.\n",

Got a good spacious place seated inside as there were lots of cigarette smoke outside.\n\nOrdered the pork knuckle and had 2 pints of beer.\n\nHave to say that the pork knuckle was very well done.  Very crispy on the outside, and soft and succulent on the inside.  I have to say though that the meat was not as juicy as it should be.  But nevertheless, it was still good and much much better than the other popular German outlets.\n\nWas served by a quiet and strange non-responsive Sikh wait staff.  Not that alert, and certainly unsure of what our order was.  He also spoke very softly and quite intelligibly.  However, I have to say that he was polite and obviously wanted to be good at his work.\n\nFinally, the place was quiet and great for a dinner.\n\nWill definitely be back for the pork knuckle and beer if I longed for any of these.\n\nService staffs are very friendly and helpful.

Went there for lunch with wifey as we wanted to grab some fresh meat at butchery. Ordered 2 soup to go along with our main. She ordered potato soup and onion soup for me. Before the soup arrived, we were served with their in house baguette and butter. It was so so good especially the butter. Main were served hot from kitchen, portions were good for the price and we left the bistro with our happy stomach. Wish they can offer ribeye in time to come. They were having Oktoberfest menu too. Do drop by! Will definitely return. Thank you\n\nHad an outdoor seating which was sooo hot. They gave a time limit of 1 hour but was happy to let us hang around if there wasn\u2019t too busy. Food wise was ok but nothing spectacular. Has a children\u2019s playground at the side so lots of family groups were there. would recommend the onion soup and creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e but sirloin was underwhelming. Great that it had lots of vegetables at the side.\n\nHad fresh onion soup that warmed us up . Thereafter we shared the mains of short rib and pork cordon blue .\n\nThe short rib served tender w mixed flavour between savoury meat and sweet caramelised onion, and tinge of horseradish . And pork cordon blue toughen up texture in breaded form and broaden the palate w some greens .\n\nEnjoy the meals as much as the shopping later .\n\nThis place have very good beer and western foods. I highly recommend as service are good and foods are excellent. Only downside are the outdoor seating only got small wall fans and the downlight are too strong and sharp make me felt warmer on a sunny day dinner. Last to mention that the portion are quite big.\n\nNice food!\nRevisited, food n service are great \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\nPlants in the garden were healthy, nice to have plant labels.\nAlso playground for kids while waiting for seats.\nSupermarket offers wide selection of meat, snacks, fresh vegetables etc!\n",

So special. And they even heated up our cookies \ud83c\udf6a \ud83d\ude0d\n\nFood portion now is so horrible, it was much better last time.\n\nQuality still good\n\nVery little portion of steak for $15.80. Waited quite long but the food was left at the counter and turned cold.\n\nIt took 35mins for a take away salad and rice on a Sunday lunch time where only 2-3 tables had guests so that was a negative. Staff gave an extra cookie so that shows they care for customer service .\n\nNice outdoor space to sit and some good healthy options. Taste is good and food is fresh. We had mangoes green salad and cluck Norris and both were delicious\n\nHealthy bowls with set options as well as customisations available, as well as a make-your-own-bowl option. You need to fill in the paper menu by selecting your choice and hand it to the counter. Collect your order when your assigned beeper goes off. Convenient lunch option for office-goers around Biopolis, can get fairly crowded at peak lunch hours, typically between 12 and 1. Indoor as well as outdoor seating available, the outdoor tables have a pleasant atmosphere, surrounded by the greenery. Very vegetarian friendly as well, they've added a lot of new bowls to the menu. My favorite is the spears and shield. The olive rice is wonderfully flavoured and the vegetables are grilled to perfection.\n",

Each dish delivered a unique and delightful burst of flavors.\nThe prawn and banana fritter boasted a crisp exterior, giving way to a delightful blend of sweet and savory flavors within.\nThe pastries ordered were generously filled, resulting in a burst of rich and flavorful goodness with every bite.\nThe Shrimp fried rice deserves a special mention as it stands out as one of the finest I've ever tasted, boasting fresh shrimp and perfectly textured rice, with each bite delivering a delightful array of flavors\n\nWhat a surprise! I LOVED this restaurant. The most delicious dim sum ever!! We sat in the open area and it was really nice. We didn\u2019t have data in our phones so we couldn\u2019t order with the QR code but the staff gave us a sheet of paper and a pencil to order. Everything was absolutely DELICIOUS.  For fellow tourists: make sure you have cash since they don\u2019t accept card payments (there is an ATM nearby)\n\nThe best authentic Dim Sum and Chinese food! Amazing quality, great service\u2026 yes you sit on a plastic chair and the place is not fancy\u2026 but guaranteed yummy! A must do once in Singapore \ud83d\ude0b\n\nSwee Choon's dimsum is alright if you don't set too high an expectation. Service and dining environment is comfortable.\nLots of variety from noodles to stir fry items. Can cater for all diners.\nPrice is reasonable.\n7/10.\n\nStill one of my favorite dim sum joints, offering food served very quickly.\nSwee Choon seems to have figured out their winning formula. Offering simple fares at reasonable pricing served very quickly. This dim sum eatery has blossomed from one small shop space to taking over the neighboring spaces for their never ending queue of customers.\nWe ordered quite a few dishes. Cucumber with black fungus was a surprise crowd winner, even winning over someone who does not usually enjoy cold dishes with its simple and light garlicky taste. The porridge was so so, a rather small bowl though but I wasn\u2019t watery so you do get it chock full of ingredients. The chilli wanton was abit of a let down, as the spice level was abit meh. I loved the Kang kong stir fried with garlic. With the simple way of cooking, it brought out the freshness of the vegetables. I like the fried pork too, it was marinated just right and very tender and not over fried. The tentacles was abit over fried and was kind of like chewing on rubber.\nI would definitely hands down visit Swee Choon anytime.\n*good to note: I ordered a takeaway of egg tarts, char Siew puff at the outside takeaway kiosk. Waiting time was very short too, and staff ensured items were tied up properly for ease transportation back home. Egg tarts still tasted amazing when they were cold.\n",

Added more flavours to the chicken chop.\nThe Mexican cheese pasta as side dish is decent, the boiled vegetables don\u2019t have much taste but it\u2019s okay.\n\nValue for money. I like the Mexican grilled chicken that comes with cheese sauce and sliced white onions. It\u2019s hard to find this in typical western stalls but I like this style the best.\n\nWas here on 4th Aug 2023, around 1am after midnight.\n\nHad the smoked duck carbonara and chargrilled chicken chop with ice lemon tea!\n\nIce lemon tea was sweet but more on the slightly sour side so not my thing but it may be for others.\n\nCarbonara was creamy as well as savoury with a lot of smoked duck bits mixed in aside from the smoke duck slices seen in the picture. Chicken chop was tender and the fried rice had flavour. Both dishes had generous portions and although the food tastes generally like your average western food, giving it higher rating for the price point in par with the quality and quantity of food.\n\nAtmosphere was chill and the customer service was warm and attentive.\n\nGenerous portion of collar pork was nicely grilled. Mashed potato tasted similar to KFC \ud83d\ude05. Onion served under the pork could be more cooked. Overall, it's good for the price. \ud83d\udc4d \ud83c\udd97\ufe0f\n\nYou all will love this place if you enjoy chilling in a comfortable environment.

They did not scrimp on the alcohol \ud83d\ude02 Also had an appetiser and ordered an extra cocktail before dinner (refer to photos). No phones allowed during dinner and it\u2019s pitch black anyways so can\u2019t help you there. Will come back again soon :)\n\nFantastic once in a lifetime experience! We had an amazing host - Bernard who shared his life story. He had an amazing voice, sounded like a radio DJ. Randy was really friendly too in guiding us to our seats. The customer service at the lounge was really warm and friendly too!\n\nVery very unique experience and 10/10 will recommend to come to this place. The picture was taken before the dinner and the dinner was served incomplete darkness. The service is very heartwarming and very friendly.  Dining in pitch dark really gives us the perspective on how a vision disabled person experience their day to day life (just the eating part alone). I think I should not reveal too much details but rather let you experience yourself. This unique experience start from the time u step in the restaurant. Really must try!!!\n\nAbsolutely great experience. Booking with credit card is necessary. When arrived we waited at this fancy bar area where an appetiser is served. We can order bar drinks too. Lockers were provided to keep your bags, phones, watches that illuminate. Then we were taken to a second floor where the room was in complete darkness. When you can see, the sense of touch smell and taste elevates and became more sensitive. Food and wine were great just have to be careful when consuming since we can\u2019t see. Servers are all very passionate, friendly and professional. They told us they can\u2019t see and we are impressed by how swift and accurate they serve. They were also very engaged in conversations with us. Menu changes every two months we were told. Highly recommended!\n\nHad a unique dining experience at this restaurant with a concept of complete darkness. This added a thrilling dimension to the entire experience. The reception area was lit up and the staff were very friendly.\n\nOnce ushered into the pitch-dark dining room, the staff orientated us with our table setting.\n\nA total of 3 courses with 4 dishes each were skillfully served, and although the adjustment to eating in complete darkness took a moment, it became a novel part of the experience.\n\nI want to extend special appreciation to Bernard, whose friendly and jovial service elevated the evening. His assistance in helping us find our seats and orientating us with the table made a significant difference. Bernard's delightful humor, peppered with funny jokes, truly made the experience enjoyable.\n\nWhile the portions were not large, the food itself was decent. However, the overall adventure, coupled with Bernard's excellent service, makes this restaurant a standout choice for those seeking a distinctive and memorable dining experience. Highly recommended!\n",

Specially the senior staff..... with whom used to chit chat quite a lot at late night at 2 am to 3am..... had a wonderful food there......\n\nWhat a surprise find!! The food here is amazing!!\n\n1. Truffle fries is perfectly fried and truffle oil is evenly distributed, with generous amount of cheese\n2. Chicken mid wing with belachan - wonderful pairing\n3. Pork knuckle steak - new on the menu - good portion and well cooked. Even the salad on the side is so fresh!\n4. Lamb chops are great too, super tender and well cooked.\n\nOverall definitely returning to try other dishes in their extensive menu, highly recommended!\n\nwe stumbled upon this place and decided to try out their all-day breakfast! we ordered it with scrambled eggs, english muffin and bratwurst chicken sausage. the scrambled eggs were cooked to perfection, and english muffin (which was just toast?) was toasted to a crispy exterior and a soft interior, and the sausage had a nice snap. the pasta was also cooked nicely and had a nice mushroom flavour. the whole place was very clean and the atmosphere was great. the staff were very friendly as well! make sure to check out this place if you're in the area!\n\nNice cosy place to have a evening drink with few friends or family. Super service. Waitress was extremely helpful in selecting menu items suitable for our pallet.\n\nA nice place for small gathering on weekdays. Food was so so \u2026 escargot chewy , lamb rack 2 pcs for $24 dun worth and slightly over cook. Lamb shank was a better choice tender and nicely braised. Salmon ordinary abit dry. Finger food acceptable . Oyster at that price was not really promotional. Good for beer drinker . Wine selection limited and stock also limited.\n",

We got Plain Prata x1, Egg Prata x1, Butter Chicken x1, Garlic Naan x1, Dum Briyani x1 and Iced Teh Tarik x2 which added up to $38.80 for 2.\n\nPrata is average but their fish curry is really diluted. Butter chicken is not bad. Garlic naan is what you would expect it to taste. The only thing worth the price is probably the Dum Briyani. Although it looked like a small portion, there was a lot of mutton buried in the rice and was really filling. The mutton was also tender with really nice gravy. Personally will not be back again.\n\nGood place to have your Indian breakfast. Service is good during the morning.\n\nLast I had supper here at night on weekend, they clean your table as soon as you finish your food to make way for the next diner which is understandable. So, decide if you want a place for good food or a place to hang out.\n\nI've been using this restaurant as a JC peeps meeting base for years. Glad to see that it, together with its competition down the road, has survived the building of the MRT line. When I last went, they didn't have date milkshake. Not sure if its temporary or for good. Date milkshake is good \ud83d\udc4d\n\nIncredibly extensive menu with plenty of seating. Service is really quick and you order through a QR code so it\u2019s convenient. There\u2019s parallel parking along the road and parking at the malls opposite. The food was good, there\u2019s choice between dum briyani and just briyani and this was the plain briyani, rice was flavourful and the chicken was good. Can even choose what piece of chicken you want. Overall quite nice, i would return and would want to try the other stuff on the menu.\n\nThis is one of those few eateries I often wonder how they managed to attract the crowds. The place isn't cozy, the food are generally pricey, there are mostly misses than hits in their extensive menu, even the tasty ones are achieve by being too greasy & over saucy like the Maggi Goreng Pattaya I had today.\n\nAlso their QR code ordering system is a pain to use, there's no embedded payment system to any of the many existing digital payment we have here, you simply have to enter ur credit card manually. If you choose to pay at the counter, your cart orders would be gone and you have to re-order everything at the counter.\n",

Drinks were alright. Overall really nice supper place near the Serangoon area.\n\nPrata's crispy and good. Service is ok though it can be slow. But the prawn masala's a real letdown with the small size, you can see the photos of the size of the prawn, which is really the size of a shrimp. Also ordered the butter chicken, which is ok.\n\nCame here for Lunch with my family and Kids. Not only their Prata are crispy, their other dishes are delicious. Recommend their Spinach which my kids also love. Services are good but dont expect restaurant type at this coffee house. Kids love to have their prata with condensed milk which they didnt charge me. Recommended Prata place for family.\n\nCame back to edit my review in the past to downgrade the ratings. They are becoming too complacent and now everything is served not freshly made. Parata or fried rice, both were served cold even though requested to serve the freshly made hot one. Requested and got a reheated parata. Done with the place and will never return to eat cold fried rice or cold parata again. This place is super popular for their Roti Prata Plain and Egg Prata. ( things go down when business becomes too complacent and forgot to serve the product what it meant to be). Good staff with great attitude to serve the customer. This WAS the best place rated by me for variety of prata. Should you need to have a sizzling hot prata to be served, then just let the staff know and they will serve you accordingly. But now they do not do it anymore. You must try this place at your own risk, look around a newly opened parata place around your home which might be better in taste and served freshly made hot ones.\nFeel bad to downgrade their ratings but in this business one have to keep it with the pace. Hope they will improve soon but for me I am done.\n\nMeant to catchup with friends over Prata but this place was extremely noisy (and packed), and the staff kept chasing us away even when we were not done with our meals. They kept coming to ask if they could clear our plates when most of them were only half eaten.\n\nWe were a big group and had ordered a lot. So it would definitely take more time for us to finish our food. But the experience was extremely poor because of the service attitude.\n",

Was really happy with the service by Joshua, he went the extra mile to sing us a birthday song and requested to take a photo for us. Food was great too, highly recommended!\n\n[Sep 2023] Intimate restaurant that serves modern European cuisine. The grilled octopus and prawns were pretty good, enjoyed the smokiness that came with the fresh seafood. Service was prompt and warm. Place is fully booked on a friday night, reservation a must.\n\nvisited over the weekend and had an amazing experience! The ambiance was inviting yet intimate, creating the perfect atmosphere for a great night out with friends. The cocktails were well crafted and came with a variety of choices from classics to innovative ones. The food was good for sharing and we throughly enjoyed every dish. The staff was attentive and friendly. recommended\n\nFood was phenomenal. Usually I would have really great appetizers and mains but desserts are a letdown. Lumo exceed expectation in every way down to the desserts. The cheesecake with lime yoghurt is a great pairing and I simply had to takeaway a slice for my husband. The sirloin was done perfectly well in medium rare and my favorite is likely the scallops with pumpkin puree. Service was impeccable and overall I had a great night celebrating my friend\u2019s birthday. Thank you to the Lumo\u2019s service crew and chefs!\n",

The gray is just nice too, not salty nor blend. The rice has also the chicken rice pandan fragrance. Laksa portion is huge and top with a generous spoonful portion of chilli paste.\nLunch time is very crowded, suggest to go in evening or night for supper as it wont be that hot too.\n\nSuch a cozy space for dinner with an extensive menu :)\n* Maggie goreng 4/5\n* Pineapple fried rice 2.5/5 (avoid this one, there are many other menu to try)\n* Teh peng 4/5\n* Iced Lemon Tea 4/5 (a bit too sweet for my liking)\n\nHad a mee goreng with chicken added on. $6+. Chicken was too salty. Decided not to finish the chicken.\n\nThe wife had stir-fried plain broccoli. $14. Was a bit expensive as the portion wasn't big for $14.\n\nThe boy had the chicken wrap with fries. The best review came from him. He thought the wrap was better that the one at Spize as the sauce was nicer and the wrap wasn't overflowing with purple cabbage \ud83d\ude05\n\nFood is Trash, why even bother when the price also makes no sense for the quality the provide. A regrettable experience. Hokkien mee was diluted and teh ice was sugar loaded.\n\nHalal restaurant at Paya Lebar area which remains open 24x7. The price is cheap, yet the food was really delicious. It gets quite busy from 10am till midnight. I tried the Hainanese Chicken Rice, Sambal Stingray, Otak-otak, Super Cooler Drink (based on coconut juice), and I highly recommend it.\n",

We love the ambience that the rotating restaurant has to offer. I must say the view of Marina Bay Sands is stunning. A great place for celebrations. We went there for birthday celebration and they gave us a free birthday cake. The staff were so attentive and took so many nice candid pictures for us. We really enjoyed ourselves dining at Tong Le Private Dining. Thank you!!!!\n\nFood was really good for its price. We had the Colorful Cloud Dinner Set Menu. I will say it started out amazing and plateaued off around the main course. But for its price I am won't be too picky. Service was good, staffs were friendly and professional. The revolving platform gave a 360 view of the city which was a huge plus for me. Atmosphere was quiet when we came early on, but started to get a bit rowdy due to a huge party to our sides despite the closed-off rooms. But overall a pretty decent visit. Will recommend!\n\nI had the pleasure of indulging in an exquisite dining experience at T\u00f3ng L\u00e8 Private Dining, and I can confidently say it was an absolute delight for all the senses. The first thing that captivated me upon entering here was the stunning view. The restaurant's unique concept of a rotating dining room allowed me to indulge in a 360-degree panorama of the cityscape, adding a sense of wonder and spectacle to the already exquisite dining affair. The menu was a testament to the chef's creativity and culinary expertise. Each dish was a harmonious blend of flavours, beautifully presented and bursting with vibrant colours and textures. I must also mention the impeccable timing of the service. Each course was served with precision, allowing us to savor every bite without feeling rushed. The staff's attention to detail and their commitment to providing exceptional service truly enhanced the entire dining affair. Overall, my dining experience at here was an unforgettable journey of culinary delight and I cannot wait to return to experience their wonders once again :)\n\nMost rotating restaurants live off the gimmick of being exactly that - a rotating restaurant offering a 360 degree view of a location. Many times, the food in such restaurants isn\u2019t a priority, but the experience is. This restaurant, however, serves excellent food and offers a great view of Marina Bay Sands and the fountain and light show in front of the mall, as well as a nice view of parts of the Singapore skyline. The rotation is very slow and it take about two hours to do a full 360 revolution. If you are unlucky, you will be at the opposite side of the fountain show both times it occurs. For a period of the 360 tour you are very close to an office building - so close that you can see the monitors of the people working in the building.\n\nThe seating arrangement is varied, from two/four person tables, to separate dining rooms for larger groups. The restaurant has a very good bar which has a great selection of cocktails and spirits. The restaurant is quiet which makes it easy to have a business conversation, if that\u2018s why you are there.\n\nThe restaurant offers a seven-course menu which is perfectly timed for a two-hour dining experience. The wine menu is very extensive and there is a sommelier that can provide advice if you require so. The menu was extremely well thought-through and the various dishes were perfectly combined to provide a first-class dining experience.\n\nThe staff is very attentive and friendly, and made us feel welcome from the minute we set foot in the restaurant.\n\nWe would come to this restaurant again, and in particular for the dining experience. We were positively surprised by every course.\n\nLocation: 5/5 (in the financial district opposite Marina Bay Mall)\nAmbience: 4/5\nMenu: 5/5 (albeit a fixed menu)\nFood: 5/5\nDrinks/wine selection: 5/5\nStaff: 5/5\nPrice/quality: 4/5 (pricey but very high quality)\n\nQuality of food matches the price. The family all agreed it was a perfect place for a family celebration. The service was immaculate and staff very attentive to details. We didn't mention it was a BD celebration but when we clinked our wine glasses, they must have overheard us saying Happy BD, and they surprised us with longevity buns. They also understand Chinese etiquette well as our son discreetly wanted to foot the bill, but the attending staff came quietly to check with my husband who was the host if they should accept my son's card. That's so thoughtful as in Chinese custom the host foots the bill and they respected that.\n",

I had their No.1 and No.2 burger before, never fails to impress me \u2728 The burger is pretty big, and they have insane promotions everyday! Lunch time sets and dinner sets and even happy hour. Super worth the price for the food and the drinks were really good too. Had some sides of truffle fries and nacho tater tots (for the happy hour 1 for 1)- super worth, not soggy or too oily. I had their curly fries before as well and it\u2019s great too. Would recommend and i will always come back here when i crave a good burger! Tho their service is a little slow- cause i believe they are low on manpower, other than that it\u2019s great\n\nSo glad my wife and I finally got to have a meal here; the last time was on a weekend at peak-hour so we weren\u2019t prepared to wait then on a walk-in. This time there were plenty of seats available. We were really impressed by all the food (and milkshake) here! I think it says a lot when wife, usually not a burger fan, really enjoyed her 25 Degrees burger! \ud83c\udf54 She had the No. 2 while I had the No. 1, both so juicy, tasty, and fresh. Absolutely value for money especially with the high quality ingredients! The crispy broccoli was pleasantly delicious too \ud83d\ude0b Service all-round was friendly, prompt, and excellent \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb Thank you so much! We hope to be back again soon.\n\nGreat value for money. Juicy patties in burgers, though the medium well is still quite pink and rare. Had the Number One which is quite a classic burger  and Number Three- jalapeno provided a good kick. Kids burger is a fantastic size. Sides come in huge portions. Happy hour has 1 for 1 offers for certain items.\n\nProbably dined here for over 5 times and their consistency never fails.\nLove their signature Number 1 burgers\nThe combination of cheeses with the caramalized onions and bacon goes so well together.\nWould recommend their Number 3 if you're looking for something with a kick of spice from the Chipotle sauce and Jalapenos.\nAtmosphere can be quite humid in the afternoon as it is facing the outdoors.\n\nMy wife misses 25 Degrees at Lake Tekapo New Zealand.\n\nI neither have the time or money to bring her there now so I provided her one of their branch at an alternative location.\n\nThe place is nicely decorated.\n\nFood was fresh and delicious. The beef was juicy, and the chicken was tender and succulent.\n\nService was fantastic despite only one guy was on the floor service. He managed to get everyone served until some of the staff came in at a later time.\n",

Staff always very attentive and it is a great venue to entertain and impress. Cuisine is contemporary Chinese and decor is modern\n\nNot your cheapest place but some of the items are superb. Ox Tongue yummy, Grilled Black Throat the best I had since I started looking out for this fish 6 years ago. Did not try their wagyu cos they are from Kagoshima, not my first choice of Wagyu. The truffle rice is awesome, almost nothing rice at $12/little bowl as a $48 hotpot of it only serves 4 small bowls, yet some how you find it irresistible, the the wagyu oil on rice at Fat Cow. Give it a try if you feel like feeding your soul. Squid can skip. Warm Ankimo also can skip, still like cold with ponzu better.\n\nGreat place for dinning. Steak, crab cakes and salad. Excellent.\n\na bit of a let-down. I expected fine dining. Yes the place is nice as per fine dining, service is good, menu looks even too broad, prices are quite top.\nSo from the prices I thought that it was really going to be fine dining experience. I was puzzled by the abundance of items on the menu... how does a fine dining restaurant keep up with all those items, ingredients, preparation, etc..? It should have been a red flag from the outset.\nThe food is substandard for the place. My beloved domestic helper can prepare this food, minus the presentation.\nPresentation of the dishes is average. All meats lack of the right flavors. Sure I know that a tenderloin or a filet will have less flavor than say a sirloin. And that's where the chef should do something about it. Few thin cut potatoes don't do the trick for me. Pasta another disappointment.\nThe burger, isn't it the same that they serve downstairs???\nSo I left quite disappointed, and wondering if The Second Floor is actually serving some of the same food that you get from The Eagle's Nest, plus some dish decoration, at double the price.\n\nThere for wine dinner, the dishes were interesting and impressively done.\n",

The presentation of food is enchanting. A must try is their dessert. Chef Andy even approached us to check our experience on the food. John the manager also took time to converse with us. Teamwork was evidently shown with how the staff interact with each other. Every minute of stay counts. Will definitely go back.\n\nI was so happy when I found out about this 24hrs restaurant! It's usually really late when I end work, so I'm happy that there's somewhere I can go to eat! The receiving staff John was super friendly and welcoming, and throughout my meal he was able to make lots of passersby smile with his cheerful personality which is super nice \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\udc95\uff01\n\nLingesh was the staff who helped serve my food and he was super nice too! He had an excellent smile and was super polite and friendly through our conversation! The staff all seemed wonderful and the food was really tasty, but a little pricey. Really liked the strawberry latte. Would definitely like to come back again, for both excellent service and wonderful food! \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\n\nThanks for the excellent service from Lingesh and the lady who helps to take order (didn\u2019t manage to get your name). We enjoy the dining experience here.\n\nThe grilled salmon and royal chocolate hazelnut are delicious. Portobello mushroom burger could be better as feel the mushroom was a bit over cooked. We don\u2019t really like the pizza margherita as the cheese is not the taste that we usually had.\n\nThanks for providing candle and decoration on the cake. We will go back again to try other food  next time. Hope the service will be as good as now in future.\n\nFirst time checking this place and landed there cause it stays open 24 hours. Great place to hang out for supper and chit chat late into the night.\n\nStarted with the Quesadillas which was quite light, some places pack it with loads of cheese and heavy in taste. I liked this cause it worked for supper. I would say the avocado could have been a little more seasoned with salt and perhaps garlic for added oomph.\n\nNext up was Pasta Pomodoro, which was as expected. The sauce could have a bit more flavour, unfortunately the cherry tomatoes on the side were sour. Linguini was al-dente. Simple dish that sufficed.\n\nChicken Roulade was a tad dry on inside after it set for a while. Maybe we should have dug into it the instance it hit the table. But none the less, it was tasty, well seasoned, crusty and nicely browned on outside for good flavour. Perhaps making the roulade a little thicker would better hold in the moisture. The star highlight of this dish was the mash potatoes!!! It's been a long time since I had a side dish that actually made me do a double -take. Not the creamy smooth cheesy type, smooth enough with little chunks of potatoes. Fragrant, lightly salted, hint of butter creamy flavour. Lovely Chef Andy graced my cravings and served an additional bowl of mashed potatoes.\n\nChef Andy is a pleasant dude, and clearly passionate about his food. Friendly and very engaging with guests.\n\nOk, this review isn't about him. Let's round it off with dessert. OMG!!! The portion of the Caramelized Banana Waffle was GENEROUS. Definitely a sharing portion. The waffle isn't super crispy on outside, but it was warm on inside and Kenna gave you the feeling of a warm hug. Nice amounts of walnuts and banana. In this day in age where food prices are insane for even the tiniest of portions, this dessert was a lovely surprise.\n\nFood was very well seasoned and tasty for both the carbonara and steak. Steak was nicely cooked and pink in the middle. The tea was the Muse specialty, very nice and berry-tasting tea. The restaurant on level 2 also has a nice overlooking view of the Orchard intersection with Wheelock, Ion and Tangs so would be even nicer during Christmas time when the Orchard is lit up. We had 2 desserts, the pecan pie was fantastic and the red velvet cake was moist and nicely layered. Fast and friendly service too. Overall a great place for good food and a nice view!\n",

Alex and Kim were friendly and was impeccable in their service. Food was amazing with unique combinations of fresh ingredients. Chef also came over to each table to interact which we felt was an awesome touch. Strongly recommended!\n\nWell deserved Michelin Restaurants.\nThe bread is so crispy on the outside and so so so soft on the inside. Pairing with the bordier butter, it is really exceptional.\nEvery dish of the food is amazing.\n\nThe service is so good. When the table is full of crumbs, the waiter will clean it up to sweep away the crumbs. The waiter are also friendly and knowledgeable about the dishes.\nWhen we found a bone in the fish and the chef came out to apologize. Felt the service was so good.\n\nThe atmosphere in the round room felt great too.\n\nOne of the best fine dining places I\u2019ve ever been to! I can\u2019t keep track of what was being served because there was just so many different courses, but each course was really tasty \ud83e\udd70 I don\u2019t think I\u2019m a small eater but I was so full by the last few courses, I don\u2019t think I ate any at all. Remember to pace yourself. I\u2019m most impressed by their bakes; their toasty black sesame bread was literally the best bread I\u2019ve ever had in my life.\n\nWhite Grass is a hidden gem, providing a distinctive dining venture with its fusion of Japanese and European flavors.\n\nEach dish is delectable, especially the bread, pastries, and desserts rank the finest that I ever tasted.\n\nThe real flower centerpiece adds a pleasant fragrance, and the stylish decor contributes to the overall charm, making it an excellent option for couples and hosting friends.\n\nOn my second visit, I can confidently say they consistently exceed my expectations.\n\nVery good ambience and attentive service. The bread is crispy outside and moist inside. Sesame bread is delicious too. Abalone is well done combined with the sauce and texture. The lobster meat is too soft for our liking. Everything is fine but no distinctive wow factor.\n",

We highly recommend trying the White Truffle Tagliolini while it is still in season. The ambiance of the restaurant is brilliant, perfect place for a romantic dinner, or just a night out with friends/family. We wholeheartedly recommend this restaurant to anyone who appreciates fine Italian cuisine and exceptional service.\n\nOur server, Cheryl/Cherry, went above and beyond to make our dining experience truly exceptional, we want to express our sincere gratitude for making our dining experience memorable. Your professionalism, friendliness, and knowledge about the menu were outstanding!\n\nFrom the food itself to the service offered all we could say is it\u2019s stunningly perfect. Mr Ronnie helped us much, even with the picture taking , he\u2019s even so vibrant to all the guests he served.  We\u2019re also glad that the team keep on checking with us on what we needed and they are of such great help , Mr Mark was there to help and even gave us a complimentary dessert. Special thanks to Mr Suren who did a great job and elaborate to us the foods and wine which was served .\n\nThe wine which was served to us is just so\ud83d\udc4c.\nSalute to the mentioned names for going above and beyond on serving us.\n\nCame here for the first time to celebrate an anniversary and it couldn\u2019t have been a better choice.\n\nSourdough bread was unassuming but soooo fresh and fluffy, the best we\u2019ve had! We enjoyed our starters which were the lobster and the carpaccio more than we did the mains! But overall food was delicately plated and delicious.\n\nThe service here was nothing short of amazing as well, the waiters were very attentive and explained each dish to us, checked on how we\u2019d like the food every now and then which we appreciate.\n\nEspecially enjoyed the part where we got the option to have our desserts alfresco with the amazing view of the city lights and MBS area.\n\nPricey but overall would recommend for a special occasion!\n\nThis is the first time I have visited an Italian place, not had a pizza and pasta primarily, and still walked away full and satisfied. We took a set 3/4 course menu, and the chef was kind enough to bake in dietary preferences (eg. Vegetarian for me). All the items were amazing. But (weirdly) a special callout for the warmest and loveliest bread that I have eaten in a long time. And yes, if you do manage to get a seat outside, the view of Marina bay is just spectacular.\n\nStaff were absolutely friendly and attentive. I brought my mom who rarely enjoys fine dining but she thoroughly enjoyed her experience and were overjoyed with the dessert recommended by the manager. The ambience is cosy. Decor and interior looks ok but not too exciting. Desserts were truly the highlight. We had the espresso mascarpone and amalfi lemon desserts and it was perfect for both our taste buds.\n",

There was no reception upon entering the hotel, and the manager was not particularly friendly nor understanding: I had made a reservation prior for the rooftop bar, but I was not informed that there was a minimum spending required of $75 per person. It would have been courteous at least to have been informed prior. As such, my expectation of a pleasant dinner experience turned out to be an unpleasant and short-lived meal, what more right in the middle of the dim-lit hotel lounge as guests continued to stream in (yet with no other diners at 7pm), and while the manager worked at the table right next to us. That being said, if you can afford to spend for a luxurious atmosphere at the expense of a service, professionalism and good food, go ahead.\n\nCosy upscale Italian restaurant located on the ground floor of a boutique 5 star hotel.\n\nSurprisingly empty on a Saturday evening, so we had the entire wait staff looking after us.\n\nWe started off with a refreshing French 77 drink paired with Tartufo Fries and Burrata Pomodoro & Pesto. Pretty good truffle fries, but not the best I had.\n\nCape Santa alla Griglia (scallops) was almost mind-blowing, with a crispy bread that is really delicious if you dip it in the amazing broth before taking a bite, and well-cooked scallops. Repeat note: Amazing broth.\n\nTruffle porcini was a pretty big portion and really creamy. They ran out of the fresh truffle slices, whicj would have made this dish perfect.\n\nWe finished off with a classic Aperol Spritz. Done nicely, though not the best I had.\n\nOverall, this is an excellent Italian dining option.\n\nFoods are awesome especially the pizza mama mia(sorry cant pronounce the name)! We always come back because of the best customer service by Marcello. Not only that he gives the best food in the menu but he put personal touch in his service.\n\nLoved all the dishes and the service was great too. Went up to the rooftop bar after dinner which had great views. A nice place to chill when you're done with dinner.\n\nChanced upon this place after seeing a review of places with rooftop bar. The food is not pretentious, instead they are what you would expect of delicious Italian food. The environment and hospitality is a plus - with the opportunity to head for a drink at the rooftop bar before settling for dinner at the restaurant. Great place wind down to have a Italian fare in a chic but relatively inexpensive place.\n",

Would highly recommend getting the seven course menu as there were so many more elements in our dinner incorporated that made it all the more special. Flavours were all very well balanced and overall we left feeling very satisfied.\n\nVisited in Sep 2023\n\nBraci was on my list of restaurants to visit for over 4 years and I must say that it was worth the wait. It is no surprise that Braci has retained its Michelin 1 star for 6 consecutive years. The menu was a progressive one which is definitely inspired by Chef Mattie\u2019s Italian roots. There are 2 choices for people (5 course and 7 course). I would suggest people to go for the 7 course as the additional dishes in the 7 course meal are worth it. One of my favourite parts of the experience was trying out the 100 yr old balsamic vinegar.\n\nIf you\u2019re not taking the wine pairing, I would strongly recommend folks to try out a few of their cocktails, esp. their Negroni (one of the most unique ones I\u2019ve had)\n\nService was good. The restaurant is able to cater to some food allergies (like my shellfish allergy).\n\nA definite recommendation for fine dining lovers.\n\nLocation was not to my liking.\nGreat staff very welcoming and accomodating to our strict dietary restrictions.\nThey had to make a menu from scratch for us which gives them bonus points.\nFood quality was amazing and the ingredients exquisite.\nHowever, the taste of the food was confusing and frankly bland at times.\nBut i cannot judge the restaurant fairly as i did not try the actual menu items.\n\nAmazing time at Braci for a birthday celebration for my husband. The Italian food was superb with beautiful floral aesthetic to each dishes. Staff is polite and friendly too! Special thanks to Chef Matteo who is very engaging and make the day extra special! Love the black truffle \"hide and seek\" dish which is one of the highlights of all dishes! It so savoury and unforgettable\u2026.\n\nnice food nice atmosphere. i tot the service could be more positive. but i still enjoy the experience especially on a chill night in the rooftop. overall quite an expensive experience but they were very nice to add an additional anniversary dessert for us:)\n",

Not many restaurants can command a 4.9/5 rating on Google after 700+ reviews and one can see why. The menu is well thought out and the e dish preparations are absolutely perfect. The Wagyu, Cod and Risotto dishes were brilliant and the desserts were great too.\n\nService is really good. Chef Leong was also kind to have a long conversation on the fine dining scene in SG and provided some great insights on certain places to visit outside of SG.\n\nA definite recommendation for all residents of SG. This restaurant must be on your places to try.\n\nWe chose to try Restaurant Ibid for our birthday celebration this year. They blew my mind with the creativity of their food and their courage to venture into the unknown. Go big or go home they say. And Ibid certainly didn\u2019t hold back on their desire to be bold and try what others have not. There are many good fine dining restaurants but the key is how you create the wow factor and create even the slightest temptation to revisit soon. The last two restaurants that gave me this feeling was Andre and then Mosu. Mark my words, this place can become very big.\n\nIt was hard to decide which dish was the best for the night. But if I can to choose, it would have been the Mangalica Pork. It looks just like steak, and tastes incredulously divine. The pair with a glass elio perrone mongovone hit the right notes. This dish can\u2019t get any better than this.\n\nBig shout out to Chef Woo and his team, particular Anita who has been wonderful through the evening. We will see you soon.\n\nMy boyfriend and I celebrated his birthday at Restaurant Ibid and I must say, it was an exceptional experience. From start to finish, the staff were warm and friendly, making us feel right at home. We were impressed with the attention to detail that went into every dish, as Chef Woo himself took the time to explain the menu to us and answer any questions we had. It was clear that each dish was carefully crafted with a deep understanding of ingredients and flavor combinations.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend Restaurant Ibid to anyone looking for a truly memorable dining experience in Singapore. The level of care and attention put into every aspect of the meal, from the food to the service, is truly exceptional. We left feeling satisfied and impressed, and can't wait to come back for another visit.\n\nWe visited in April and had a wonderful time dining at Restaurant Ibid. The menu was well thought out and the dishes absolutely delicious. We really enjoyed interacting with the staff and Chef. Chef even took the time to made a list of restaurants we should check out in Singapore. Everyone there is really passionate about food. This is definitely a place for a food nerd. And as gen z would say, the food is bussin\u2019.\n",

The place focuses more on a wide range of quality vegetables across the world. Very unique presentation of the dishes! My partner was having the vegetarian option and it was as good as the non vegetarian options. The chef even packed us his hometown cake to bring home for tasting.\nA little high on the cost, but worth the experience!\n\nOne of the most breathtaking food experience I had the chance to enjoy.\n\nAmazing culinary journey. The contemporary symphony of aromas and textures through a vegetarian focus was fresh, exciting and new. Every dish is meticulously crafted to bring a delightful balance of flavors. The wine pairing was on point. Compliments job to the chef.\n\nExcellent service. Attentiveness and professionalism exceeded our expectations.\n\nThe atmosphere was warm, friendly and cosy. We felt welcomed and in optimal conditions to savor our dinner.\n\nWe recommend this restaurant to anyone passionate about food.\n\nBeautiful vegetarian cuisine, beautiful ambience, beautiful service and staff. Just take that leap for tastebud and exquisite ingredients discovery. Presentation of the food, attention to your dining experience made it such a pleasant experience. Do come by each season for different culinary exposure.\n\nChef Jeremy and the team did a fantastic job championing seasonal vegetables. The wine paring was beautifully done for each course to highlight the taste of the food with a great balance.\n\nThe ambience of the restaurant was intimate and lovely but the light was slightly dark. It was a birthday celebration and we had a great time throughout the night.\n\nThe menu was exceptional, a great variation of vegetables and herbs tastefully balanced and beautifully presented. The choice of courses was perfectly matched. The staff was very attentive and friendly. The chef introduced himself to all the guests and was very accommodating. We really enjoyed our dinner at JAG, a highlight in Singapore.\n",

The rest though was consistently good.\n\nI've been coming here for the past 5 years with my wife. This is her go to Halal Ramen stall whatever the timing is. Be it for lunch or dinner, the food is still good. Thumbs up for the service and good food. Thank you for being a good go to Halal Ramen for my wife and I.\n\nJust know by chance walking around and found this place. Quick order and great service. Serving until 11:00pm we think. Price is ok. Should try. They have Japanese foods and Singapore foods as well. Over all value money.\n\nThe entire dining experience here was just so smooth and impressive. Weill definitely come for more.\n\nFast service and supportive staff. Refined broth, not too oily. And they are very generous with the gyora filling. Overall a perfect meal to end a long day.\n",

Really enjoyed everything but especially the chef\u2019s special seaweed pasta and the grilled bacon wraps. Unfortunately the restaurant was busy and because it\u2019s quite open it\u2019s very loud and has a cafeteria feeling to it. The service was quite disappointing, and we had to ask multiple times where the rest of our food was (even servers came a few times to ask if we were done with the table or waiting for more items). The whole thing felt very chaotic and like no one was really on top of things; which is as disappointing. Food was good enough that we  will try again in a less busy night and hope service is better.\n\nLoved the service by the staff. They are friendly and accommodating. They would check about the food too.\n\nFood was great; tasty and generous. It\u2019s nice to now that the class of dish can be found in the area. Love it.\n\nThe space is pretty crowded, especially on weekend. Walking areas between the tables and payment area are tight. Worth to mention too, the ventilation can be improved. The air was towards the warmer side (probably because of the crowd during dinner time?) and made clothes smell.\n\nFinally got to have a meal here, and real glad we did. Everything looked so good! I think the meatballs, which we had for starters, were simply amazing, quite possibly the best I've ever had - so tender and moist and tasty! \ud83d\ude0b  The pasta and the lasagna were wonderful also, deliciously creamy and so rich in flavours (on hindsight I really shouldn't have tried to eat the entire lasagna on my own.. way too rich \ud83d\ude05). And the pistachio tiramisu was a surprisingly delightful treat, though personally I still prefer the traditional version. Definitely coming back for more and to savour the many more other items on their menu. \ud83d\ude0a\n\nThe baked pork belly deserves special mention. The succulent and perfectly seasoned pork is roasted to a crispy, golden perfection, while the meat inside remains tender and flavorful. Every bite is a harmonious combination of savory, salty, and wild fennel flavors that dance on your palate.\n\nOf course, I couldn't leave without indulging in their delectable pistachio tiramisu, which was the perfect sweet ending to my Italian gastronomic adventure.\n\nOrdered some items from the regular a la carte menu and some weekly specials. It\u2019s my first time there, celebrating my husband\u2019s birthday. The dishes are delicious and flavourful, we cleared everything. Only thing I felt could be better was service.\nDidn\u2019t get any \u201chow\u2019s everything\u201d when all the tables around me got it; need a bit of attention to get them to come over to take orders etc\n",

Always start with the buratta and end your meal with the itramisu, it's just lovely. Would come more often if I didn't stay so far away!\n\nThe restaurant is a 2 mins walk from my office but I have never tried it on a normal weekday. So on a Saturday, I brought the whole family to the restaurant and I was really impressed by it.\n\nWe ordered a few off-menu items like the burrata, guanciale pizza and the cod fish on summer vegetables. Added another mushroom risotto as well. Food is really very good and the service staff is also caring. It's one of the best Italian restaurant I visited in Singapore.\n\nThe traditional food of Tuscany! Wow! Experience for me. The food was exquisite and the service, impeccable.\n\nDine in dinner. Sat outdoors. Beautiful wind and cool air in the evening.\n\nThe crew at Pietrasanta are warm\nAnd welcoming. Attentive and interactive with suggestions. Loved the experience.\n\nThe food is amazing. Double, Wow!\n\nMade a last minute booking for a weekday lunch and only the outdoor seats were left. But the outdoor seats were lovely as well. And service was also very prompt!\n\nFood was excellent. Both the pasta and pizzas we ordered were amazing. Was very full after all the appetizers and mains but we still inhaled the tiramisu very quickly after it was served.\n\nHidden gem in One North! Try it for yourself! ;)\n\nGood & friendly service staff.\nReasonably good food. The calamari and cold cuts were good. So were the pasta, focaccia, pizza of the day, fettuccine of the day, linguine of the day. Nice deserts too.\nHowever, the beef of the day was over cooked vs the medium rare that was asked for.\n",

We ordered pizza with mushroom and meat it was so hearty and delicious. The gnocchi was creamy and hit the spot. The surprise was the dessert. I never had the citrus cake before and it was a revelation. Absolutely loved it. Can\u2019t recommend it enough. Overall the food and service makes this restaurant worthy of a visit again.\n\ndefinitely enjoyed our dinner here, staff were attentive and friendly. The seafood platter was fresh, the steak was definitely a 10/10. The fresh crab meat pasta was good too. Will come back again.\n\nThe pasta was the best!! We had Mediterranean salad which was good, it\u2019s like Italian mix with Greece. We ordered spaghetti vongole and spaghetti seafood with Bisque sauce, both are delicious and I almost lick the plate, I\u2019m sad that I\u2019m full already if not will order cheese cake for sure. It\u2019s my new favourite Italian restaurant for now, love the service and vibe so much, it\u2019s casual and classy, parking is complimentary valet is a plus! Will be back 100%\n\nGreat Italian dishes.  Especially the starter fish dish.  Superb and nicely executed\n\nDeep fried calamari is so good!\n\nPork collar was nicely seared and presented\n\nPizza with anchovies are interesting\n\nRisotto was also good\nSeafood pasta was not as exciting though\n\nOverall a good dining experience\n\nHowever,  I hope the servers can be more attentive in filing the wine glasses of customers when it goes empty.\n\nPizza was quite a let down, if you are looking for a crispy crust pizza, you\u2019ll be let down\u2026 the centre of the pizza was wet and floppy, we resorted to taking it home. Calamari was tough, carbonara was a special request and disappointed with the clumpy sauce. Unlikely that we\u2019ll be back unfortunately.\n",

The beef carpaccio course was also brilliant. The restaurant doesn\u2019t have a non-alcoholic pairing and that\u2019s probably a small area where they can improve their \u2018value proposition\u2019.\n\nService was top notch.\n\nA definite recommendation for a classy dinner experience\n\nWonderful culinary experience from the start till the end. The location and ambiance is welcoming and cosy, the staff is friendly and took great care of us, the food is delicious, high attention to details and wonderful ingredients from all over the globe. The chef is very talented and creative. The sommelier chose some amazing wines and champagne to pair the dishes with. Amazing experience.\n\nA sensational lunch which well exceeds its price point of $178++ per pax. The only criticism would be that the bread course was uninspiring, but who cares? It\u2019s free anyway. Canap\u00e9s started with their signature playful tomato soup. Using trompe l\u2019oeil to make it look like tomatoes it\u2019s actually a soft shell with tomato gazpacho encased within. The scallop tartare with avocado and tomato jelly was wonderfully light with all the elements working in harmony. The cod mousse taco was nice but overshadowed by its two counterparts. The first course started with a bang, yellowtail finished table side with a horseradish snow. Light, refreshing and full of flavour with an added air of theatricality for good measure. The second course was Mozambique langoustine which was the highlight of the menu. Sitting on top of a creamy anchovy sauce. The sweetness of the langoustine was a perfect complement to the (not-too) salty sauce. While the gem lettuce added some crunch to contrast with the soft and plump shellfish. This course was pure delight from start to finish! The pasta course was an elevated carbonara which utilised cured egg yolk. It was not too heavy which was a pleasant surprise. The main was veal with white asparagus coated in sabayon in a moscato sauce. The veal was cooked to perfection and the kitchen, once again, demonstrate their attention to detail by ensuring that each dish consists of an equal balance of flavours and textures. The palate cleanser was finished table side with a prickly pear granita, highly refreshing after two somewhat heavier courses. The dessert was the chef\u2019s take on semifreddo using Marsala grapes, dessert wine sauce and clotted cream. Wonderful and I loved the bitterness of the grapes and wine sauce. Overall a spectacular meal, one of the best michelin-starred lunches one can grab in Singapore that showcases high quality ingredients, inventiveness while also not ripping a gigantic hole in one\u2019s pocket. The setting of the restaurant is intimate and perfect for a date or a more private business meeting. Staff are warm, attentive and knowledgeable (and also take good photos). Definitely worth a visit.\n\nModern Italian restaurant serving interestingly innovative dishes especially the amuse bouches. Wine pairing was generous and well thought out - always a nice way to find new wines if a restaurant gets it right! Service was good. Small but well spaced and clean relaxed ambience.\n\n1st time at their restaurant for dinner. Nice colonial place. Restaurant itself felt inviting. Staffs were all smiling when greeted & warmed when serving food.\n\nFood were great. Wine pairing was generous.\n\nRecommended.\n",

Definitely not a daily dining Italian shop. I came with my friend for a celebration.\n\nShop opens up with a bar, and then leads you into a dining area where there were ample space and ambience was on point. Good vibes.\n\nWarm bread was fluffy and tasted perfect when dipped with a their top grade olive oil and a touch of balsamic vinegar. Starter was ok. Mushroom soup done right, service was prompt, pastas were all round tasty (one of the best), beef steak was done exactly the way I wanted it, not over cooked and not under cooked, tiramisu was a good old recipe that is worth it.\n\nI must also comment that the restaurant made an effort to portion the food for 2 for every ordered item, when they noted we were sharing everything, this I\u2019m very appreciative of.\n\nThe only thing I thought could be better were the bread sticks offered on the table, they were lacklustre as a tidbit or small bite. Maybe it\u2019s just me but I saw most tables did not bother to eat or touch.\n\nOverall, this restaurant definitely deserves a 5 stars.\n\nI refuse to believe that this is a Michelin star restaurant. Food was AWFUL. How could you ruin steak? I literally had one bite of the meat and it was rancid just like the lobster we had for starter - I left it untouched. The truffle pasta was the only thing we were able to eat but won\u2019t give it more than 2/5. Service was also below average. Truly disappointed \ud83d\udc4e\n\nAlways a super experience at Garibaldi\u2019s. What a treat with the amazing starter bread that comes out steamy hot, the salad delectable and the mains delicate and delicious.\n\nFun to order different dishes so you can have a taste of all the starters, mains and desserts.\n\nWe were here for SG restaurant week and had the set lunch menu.\nNice ambience, crowded even on a weekday afternoon. Staff was nice and friendly, took care of our table and topped up the water.\nChoice of appetizer: salmon trout or wild mushroom soup\nMains: Mediterranean royal sea bream or Braised beef cheek with fettuccine\nDessert: cheese platter or blueberry yoghurt cake.\n\nVerdict: I loved the seafood dishes as it was quite fresh. Good choice of salmon and sea bream. As for the beef fettuccine, it wasn\u2019t as nice as expected. Perhaps the braised beef did not have much taste. Lastly, the dessert was alright, it was a mix of fresh blueberry, yoghurt and also blueberry jam. They could keep it simple by having a classic tiramisu instead.\n\nWent for SG Restaurant Week. Weakest point for me has to be the service. Feels like eating at a neighbourhood cafe with the lack of attention and care from staff.\n\nFood is very hit or miss. We love the scallops starter, but my burrata dish was very bland. The lobster pasta main was amazing, while the beef was disappointingly dry. We both had the blueberry yogurt dessert and it was alright.\n\nOverall wouldn\u2019t come again.\n",

The highlight of the meal was the seafood stew. All the breads were also exceptionally delicious. However, the sea bass tasted very ordinary and the sky high price tag went to the showy \u2018performance\u2019 by the chef. Restaurant was too dim and had a funky smell.\n\nThe staff are very friendly and the food is also tasty. The portion is surprisingly big and we ate till our hearts content.\n\nStaff very helpful and polite. Atmosphere is chill with soft music. Food serve just in the right timing.  Of cause the price is not cheap. But it worth the price overall.\n\nLastly thanks for the birthday cake. Love it but we were too full to finish it.\n\nBooked Sunday afternoon to have their set lunch, only to find out they only serve buffet that day at $78++ per person. Opted in anyway and didn't regret it, given the fresh ingredients, great taste of Italian and friendly staffs! Personally I love the dessert section especially Panna Cotta! If I had to pick on something, it'd be the dim lighting. No discount on the bill even with Shangri-la Circle membership, but you do get extra points.\n\nRemember, when you get into the lobby, you are on 3F. You need to take an elevator to get down to 1F where the restaurant is.\n\nThe restaurant has decent ambience for a semi chic and comfortable dinning experience. The salt crusted fish is delicious and if you want to see some fire show. The winner for me is the crab pasta. Yum!\n\nWe celebrated our anniversary dinner here and it was a great decision! They generously presented us a complimentary cake, thank you for perfecting the night.\nAmong the dishes, we absolutely love the Porchetta. It was tender, yet crispy and flavourful, Highly recommended! While on the other side, we didn\u2019t like the potato pur\u00e9e in the braised lamb leg dishes. It may have ruined the experience with that main dish. Despite that, this would not stop us from giving 5 stars because the other aspects (service/ambience) make up to it. A great dining place for celebrations.\n",

The steak is soft and juicy but pity the tomahawk is a bit dry. Roast lamb is great as well. Didn\u2019t really ate too much of the pasta though its very good cos need to save space for cheese and desserts!\n\nAll the food was excellent, the service was courteous and friendly, and we had a great time. (Honestly, the quality of the Asian food wasn't that great.) The chefs came around during the meal to give us tastings, and it felt like we were at a friend's party. It was a great time. Thank you:)\n\nDelicious brunch with an extensive selection of Italian cheese. The Lasagna was also extremely delicious! The service was perfect as well. Money well spent and a very fun afternoon thanks to wine/prosecco free flow as well.\n\nWent for Sunday brunch. Cheese room is lovely with a wide selection of cheeses. Loved the unique chocolate cheeses and burratas. Mains selection is ok, could be larger. Lamb stew was nice. Desserts are good as well.\n\nThe restaurant offers an array of \ud83e\uddc0 cheese.\nIf you are a cheese lover, this will be the restaurant for you!\nWe had buffet but the selection is limited unlike the conventional buffet.  However, food is delicious.\nThe service is good. Mr Muru / Mr Nuru (Manager) is very helpful & friendly.\n",

Their firewood pizza is not to be missed too. A perfect environment to stay and chill with a glass or wine or beer after a nice dinner.\n\nI visited this place for a dinner date. We had already made a reservation in advance, as we knew very well that this place would be packed on the weekends.\n\nThe staff were very nice to greet us as we made our way into the restaurant and even walked us over to our tables. The waiter at the time was very observant, and would constantly check up on how we were  doing.\n\nMore on the food:\n\n(Appetizer)\nBurrata Bruschetta - 8/10 \ud83c\udf1f\n- The Burrata was really lovely!\n- The sweet and juicy tomatoes compliments the creamy and milky cheese\n\nHowever, the bread was a little tougher than expected that our knives struggle to cut through. Nevertheless, it was pretty delicious \ud83e\udd24\ud83d\ude0b\n\n(Appetizer)\nEggplant Parmigiana -  10/10 \ud83c\udf1f\ud83e\udd0c\n- Absolutely bussin!\n- It tastes better than a regular lasagne, the eggplant is barely noticeable. Which is good in a way as my partner is not too much of a fan of veggies.\n- The sauce topped with the cheese just makes this dish one of the best in my opinion\n\n(Main)\nDiavola pizza - 9/10 \ud83c\udf1f\n- Spicy, greasy and meaty pizza\n- The spicy and salty sorpressata balances the thick and absorbent pizza dough\n- Low-key better than pepperoni pizzas \ud83e\udd2d\n\n*Unfortunately I forgot to take a picture*\n\n(Dessert)\nFlamb\u00e9ed Chocolate Ecstasy - 6/10\ud83c\udf1f\n- Presentation was really good \ud83d\udc4d\n- Interesting concept of both Hot and Cold dessert\n\nHowever, our brownies were a little too frozen \ud83d\ude15. We knew it was a hot and cold dessert as there was ice cream served with the hot-plated brownies. But when we tried to scoop booth goodies, the brownie was frozen hahaha. Interesting concept but would recommend other stuff like the tiramisu maybe.\n\nOverall, excellent experience. Prompt service, a little pricey but worth the occasional visits. Came in hungry, left full  \ud83d\ude35\n\nMy first time dining here and the staffs here are really sweet and customer oriented. They made the dining here with my girlfriend beyond pleasant. They made small talks with you and check on you regarding the quality of the food. The food was amazing but my friend and I couldn\u2019t finished it because we are 2 girls that over ordered. If you are going for a date, this place is extremely ideal. Will definitely be back.\n\nWas here for a birthday celebration. Staff was very nice and provided complimentary tiramisu cake (slightly alcoholic), which tasted phenomenal. Pizza is very well balanced and does not get gelat from a few bites, while the pastas and risottos pack a good flavourful punch. In total, it was slightly pricey but overall nice place to wine and dine.\n\nRegarding indoors seating, music is kinda loud to have a clear conversation. Place is pet friendly and there are many dogs around\n\nService was underwhelming for the price paid.  Not the worst. But one would expect better.\n\nFood. so long is pizza or pasta or Italian is nice. The pork chop was soso only.  Pizza came before the starters.\n\nDessert is a must have!! The tiramsu and flaming chocolate extasy. Don't touch the hot pan!!!\n\nWine selection is good and recommendation by the wine guy was great!!!\n\nGood for celebrations... or hangout.\nBut bring a big wallet.\n\nFree parking (4hrs) too if u need to know  1 ticket per bill.\n",

Huge portions good food qualify for good quality. Like service staffing professional\n\nAlways lovely to have dinner in this place. I am Italian and I appreciate good food made with good ingredients, in a genuine and simple way. Vespetta is one of our favourite. Great service, great location. We always have good time and we will keep coming back \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\n\nWe had a company lunch. The set menu $41 (before service charge and gst) comes with starter, main course and dessert. However certain dishes need add-on price so the price is not absolute final.\n\nThe food quality is acceptable but no surprise. The breaded roasted sea bass fillet maybe a bit dry considering it is roasted. The roasted boneless chicken leg is quite well prepared and juicy. Calzone Alla Nutella is good for 2 or more people to share. Taste is good thanks to Nutella. Tiramisu is so-so.\n\nAtmosphere is nice if you're sitting outside along the river, but may be hot and exposed to sunlight if it is sunny.\n\nIt maybe a good place for business lunch or drinking only.\n\nCame here for lunch after my banking stuff.  Pretty much little aircon but it\u2019s alright not warm as there are many wall fans around.  Food quality is okay but wish the tomatoes is grilled and potato not burnt.  Salads is good as I love the cheese, beef is okay.  Tiramisu serving is big, plus point is not too sweet just right.  My colleague ordered sea bass and looks really good.  Overall a decent and happy meal.\n\nIf you like authentic and very tasty italian food, it\u2018s a must to go her. We had a very good time - thank you so much! \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf9\n",

The pasta was decently yummy but nothing too out of the world. Everything was done well hence the 4 stars review but perhaps it lacked the little OOMPH factor that would make it a five star. Service was exceptional, waiter was very attentive and nice, provided tons of recommendations and was very warm!\n\nWent there during restaurant week and was amazed by the food quality and impeccable service. Everyone was friendly. Special shout-out to one of the staff, not sure if is the manager with a cross chain, interacting well with my 3 years old boy! Will definitely return again :)\n\nWe decided to celebrate the little boy's birthday at an Italian restaurant renowned for their delicious sourdough pizza, which has been ranked among the top 10 best pizzas in Singapore.\n\nFor starters, we opted for the Burrata cheese and sourdough bread, which was nothing out of the ordinary. However, the roasted potatoes with rosemary were a standout dish that shouldn't be overlooked.\n\nUnfortunately, we were somewhat disappointed with the expensive petite Wagyu Striploin, possibly because it wasn't cooked to our desired level of doneness. We also sampled the Linguine Clams pasta, which was decent in taste but didn't quite wow us\n\nTheir menu is extensive, but their pizza steals the show. So many toppings to choose from! We ordered quite a feast, but I highly recommend the Calamari, Lobster Pasta, and any of their pizzas. The best part? They serve up your food lightning-fast, perfect for the hungry souls out there.\n\nAnd don't forget to save room for dessert - their Pistachio Gelato is out of this world. Creamy, nutty, and just heavenly! \ud83c\udf55\ud83c\udf5d\ud83c\udf66\n\nAll of the food is delicious. The waiter was so attentive, polite, and friendly. They can explain their own food.

Special thanks to Mr Suren who did a great job and elaborate to us the foods and wine which was served .\n\nThe wine which was served to us is just so\ud83d\udc4c.\nSalute to the mentioned names for going above and beyond on serving us.\n\nCame here for the first time to celebrate an anniversary and it couldn\u2019t have been a better choice.\n\nSourdough bread was unassuming but soooo fresh and fluffy, the best we\u2019ve had! We enjoyed our starters which were the lobster and the carpaccio more than we did the mains! But overall food was delicately plated and delicious.\n\nThe service here was nothing short of amazing as well, the waiters were very attentive and explained each dish to us, checked on how we\u2019d like the food every now and then which we appreciate.\n\nEspecially enjoyed the part where we got the option to have our desserts alfresco with the amazing view of the city lights and MBS area.\n\nPricey but overall would recommend for a special occasion!\n\nThis is the first time I have visited an Italian place, not had a pizza and pasta primarily, and still walked away full and satisfied. We took a set 3/4 course menu, and the chef was kind enough to bake in dietary preferences (eg. Vegetarian for me). All the items were amazing. But (weirdly) a special callout for the warmest and loveliest bread that I have eaten in a long time. And yes, if you do manage to get a seat outside, the view of Marina bay is just spectacular.\n\nStaff were absolutely friendly and attentive. I brought my mom who rarely enjoys fine dining but she thoroughly enjoyed her experience and were overjoyed with the dessert recommended by the manager. The ambience is cosy. Decor and interior looks ok but not too exciting. Desserts were truly the highlight. We had the espresso mascarpone and amalfi lemon desserts and it was perfect for both our taste buds.\n",

                  "reviews": "\n\nFood is alright, flavours are all good but nothing too spectacular.\n\nThe seafood in the calamari platter was fresh, no weird tastes. Pizza is on the average side. Crab pasta tasted like the non-spicy version of chilli crab which is quite unique. Would say the fish was the best. The fish itself is roasted very well and also love the layered potatoes.\n\nOverall, felt that it was Italian cuisine tailored to the Singaporean palate. Also, the restaurant is understaffed, there was only two service-crew serving everyone. Atmosphere-wise, it\u2019s on the top  level of the hotel but there\u2019s no views of anything. It was basically a poolside restaurant with the occasional crying / screaming of kids and babies in the pool.\n\nWould only recommend if you are hotel guest or looking for a casual restaurant in the area.\n\nWhen you're looking for a less crowded Italian restaurant on Orchard Road, this is a good place to hide. Nice small restaurant, located on the Rooftop of Voco Hotel. The food is good, but it could be better. Service staff were wonderful and knowledgeable of the menu.\n\nI\u2019ve visited with my mom during singapore trip. They served great dishes. I especially recommend Truffle Burrata Cheese Pizza. The staff who is Korean guy is very kind and professional. We had a good moment because of him. I want to thank you to he and rest of all staffs.\n\nLove the ambience of this roof top bar as well as the service received!\n\nThank you Cai Ying, Jeremy and Owen for the exceptional services during my dinner at il Cielo, thank you for making it easy and enjoyable for me and my 5 year old son.\n\nSpecial mention to Cai Ying, who was especially attentive to all my needs and food recommendations were superb (look at the photos!)\n\nOf course, thank you to Chef Marco and Chef Beh Li for making my foodie son crave for the food even more after we left the restaurant.\n\nWould definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who is looking to have a quiet evening with pool and view of Orchard!\n\nDo try the Burrata Purgilese and the Tiramisu! These 2 are my favourites!\n\nI had a really lovely lunch with my family. It was a special occasion to celebrate and the food and service was excellent (the pool view is great as well). The staff Owen made our day and we genuinely enjoyed our time there. Thanks team!!\n",

Would highly recommend getting the seven course menu as there were so many more elements in our dinner incorporated that made it all the more special. Flavours were all very well balanced and overall we left feeling very satisfied.\n\nVisited in Sep 2023\n\nBraci was on my list of restaurants to visit for over 4 years and I must say that it was worth the wait. It is no surprise that Braci has retained its Michelin 1 star for 6 consecutive years. The menu was a progressive one which is definitely inspired by Chef Mattie\u2019s Italian roots. There are 2 choices for people (5 course and 7 course). I would suggest people to go for the 7 course as the additional dishes in the 7 course meal are worth it. One of my favourite parts of the experience was trying out the 100 yr old balsamic vinegar.\n\nIf you\u2019re not taking the wine pairing, I would strongly recommend folks to try out a few of their cocktails, esp. their Negroni (one of the most unique ones I\u2019ve had)\n\nService was good. The restaurant is able to cater to some food allergies (like my shellfish allergy).\n\nA definite recommendation for fine dining lovers.\n\nLocation was not to my liking.\nGreat staff very welcoming and accomodating to our strict dietary restrictions.\nThey had to make a menu from scratch for us which gives them bonus points.\nFood quality was amazing and the ingredients exquisite.\nHowever, the taste of the food was confusing and frankly bland at times.\nBut i cannot judge the restaurant fairly as i did not try the actual menu items.\n\nAmazing time at Braci for a birthday celebration for my husband. The Italian food was superb with beautiful floral aesthetic to each dishes. Staff is polite and friendly too! Special thanks to Chef Matteo who is very engaging and make the day extra special! Love the black truffle \"hide and seek\" dish which is one of the highlights of all dishes! It so savoury and unforgettable\u2026.\n\nnice food nice atmosphere. i tot the service could be more positive. but i still enjoy the experience especially on a chill night in the rooftop. overall quite an expensive experience but they were very nice to add an additional anniversary dessert for us:)\n",

The service from Albert was impeccable, with the staff showing a passion for Italian fusion cuisine.\n\nEvery dish was a work of art. I started with house-bread that was given as complimentary food, and it was delicious. Then, I ordered the Chef's recommendation of Cold Pasta Scallop Uni with extra Black Truffle, 3 Bruschetta and Grilled Lamb. The combination flavours of them were vibrant, and the presentation was stunning.\n\nThe water selection was also extensive. You'll know by heart that when the waiter asked, \"Do you want a regular or sparkling water?\" It is truly a 5-star restaurant. It's the perfect place for a special occasion or a romantic evening. Bravo!\n\nSuperb everything.\n\nFrom the moment we stepped in, we were well taken care of by Albert.\n\nWe ordered the following and were stuffed by the end of the dinner service. Portions were relatively huge for us both.\n\nWhat we ordered:\n1 X Angel hair scallop uni pasta\n2 X Oysters\n1 X Eggplant parmigiana\n1 X Lamb rack\n1 X Tiramisu\n\nHouse bread was really really really good!\n\nOverall, very value for money!\nNo words can describe, only numbers can. 10/10!!!!!\n\nCosy restaurant.  Went with my family. Very delicious food. Every dish i had was decently well presented and tasty. My family really enjoyed sharing the different variety of food from salad, scampi pasta, calamari, lasagne, stead, cod fish, crispy spanish pork.\n\nPrices are on the high side. Be very careful when ordering items not listed in menu.   We had a shock at how expensive the truffle pizza was. They should have highlighted the cost during recommending since they are really off norms by a lot ( really many times the usual price;  though i know truffle is supposed to be more expensive).\n\nGenerally, it is still a pleasant dining experience.  We will go back again but will be really careful during ordering. \ud83d\ude05\n\nLovely Italian lunch celebrating a friend's birthday. We used to work near to this restaurant more than 10 years ago. The food must be good since it survived Covid?! Decided to try it and boy it was good. Abit on the pricey side.\n\nWas recommended to dine here, I must say I was rather impressed by the quality and portion.  All our orders are well divided before being brought to us, portion was really generous and filling.\n\nReally love the truffle uni capellini, and the service standards of service staff. Tiramisu (baileys) gals alittle short of my expectation and I feel can be better, but otherwise the rest of the food were great!\n\nWill recommend to call in for a reservation.\n",

The restaurant provided impeccable service, and the buffet itself offered a delightful selection of Italian dishes.\n\nFrom the moment I walked in, the staff at Rubato made me feel welcome and ensured that I had everything I needed throughout the meal. Their attention to detail and dedication to guest satisfaction were evident.\n\nThe lunch buffet at Rubato featured a wide variety of Italian classics, from fresh salads and antipasti to hearty pasta dishes and delectable desserts. The flavors were outstanding, and the buffet's diverse offerings catered to a range of tastes. It's a fantastic option for those looking to explore a variety of Italian flavors in one sitting.\n\nThe only area where Rubato could improve was in the presentation of the main courses on the buffet. The plating of the meats and sauces at the start could be refined to make it easier for diners to identify and enjoy each dish.\n\nIn summary, Rubato's lunch buffet offers an exceptional culinary journey through Italian cuisine, with outstanding service to match. It's a fantastic option for those seeking a wide array of flavors in a warm and welcoming atmosphere. With a little attention to plating, Rubato's lunch buffet could become an undisputed five-star gem in the world of Italian dining.\n\nWe had a blast celebrating at Rubato with their fancy Vegetarian Italian Omakase! We told them we don't eat meat or seafood, and they whipped up a 6-course masterpiece just for us. All we had to do was sit back, relax, and enjoy the delicious Italian dishes they served up!\n\nScallop, Uni angel hair pasta was 10/10, worth the price. Octopus was 10/10 too, charred taste and sauce goes well together. Crab leg pasta was alright 7/10. Big and juicy oyster 8/10.\n\nWe just had the best dinner date at @rubatosg \u2764\ufe0f!\n\nThey are one of the oldest & most prestigious Italian restaurants in Singapore founded in 2009. Do you know they are available till 2am daily for deliveries via @grabfoodsg & for dine-in during weekends, eve of PH & PH?\n\nAmong the dishes that we've tried in our 6 course Japanese-Italian Omakase, here's our top 3 picks! See till the end to salivate over what we enjoyed \ud83d\ude1d.\n\n\ud83c\udf1f \"A Gift from the Angels\"\nYou literally \ud83e\udd2f when you take a mouth, it consist of Chilled Angel Hair Pasta, Hokkaido Scallops Sashimi, Exotic Japanese Seaweed, Premium White Truffle Oil And Freshly-caught Hokkaido Bafun Uni, the combination matches so well and they are really fresh!\n\n\ud83c\udf1f Lobster Cappuccino & Mushroom Soup with Truffle\nThe soups are so flavourful & rich but not cloying, we just slurp down the soup till the last drop, it's definitely one of the best we've ever tried.\n\n\ud83c\udf1f Cod Fish\nThe cod fish literally melts in the mouth, there wasn't much seasoning or sauce but you can taste the freshness of the fish in every bite!\n\nYou can enjoy a Japanese-Italian Omakase between 6 - 9 courses starting from $128++. The chef will decide on the menu, you can inform them of your dietary preferences & they will customize the menu accordingly for you! They also have regular menu if you prefer to choose your own dishes.\n\nThis restaurant is a perfect place for dates, gathering or celebrations. Recommended to make a reservation and enjoy the amazing dining experiences!\n\nCelebrated my birthday with my girls at Greenwood! Mr Daniel was attentive and provided a great experience for us! The Tomahawk Steak & Seafood Platter is a MUST TRY! Ended the lovely night with amazing desserts, one of every kind! Thank you Daniel for the arrangement! Will be back!\n",

Service is very good (9.5/10), all service staff were friendly, attentive & helpful. Ambience good (7.5/10), acoustically a bit noisy.

We will be back for more delicious pasta \ud83d\ude0b\n\nCame here on a Monday evening for dinner with friends. Enjoyed all the food! All taste good and reasonable pricing. However, the restaurant is rather small.\n\nMy family found our favorite Italian restaurant now. We loved every dish that we ordered. The pastas were memorable. Every bite was al dente. And the chocolate sauce that came with their cannoli was amazingly rich. It brought me back to Paris where I had the best hot chocolate that tasted like liquid chocolate.\n\nDined-in at Etna last weekend for a birthday celebration. Booking was made online and requires a confirmation on WhatsApp on the day of booking which I had missed on my end. Nevertheless, we were fortunate to be able to take the only outdoor table left which was by the pavement which was equally comfortable with nice vibe.\n\nThe service staff were all friendly and nice. Food is not the best but I do recommend the crab pasta that we had. The crab taste was not overwhelming and the bisque blends in well with the pasta. We did not particularly enjoyed the ciriole alla norcina pasta as the pasta was a little thick for our liking. We also ordered a traditional focaccia and a calzone napoletano pizza as well which were amazing too. Portions were huge and we barely were able to finish the food for a group of 4.\n\nOverall, Etna serves great Italian food and is worth the visit. Food were reasonably priced too.\n\nOverall not bad, I\u2019d say 7/10. We had the veal was a \u2018today special\u2019.\n\nDidn\u2019t know veal could be breaded. The batter was tasty. Pasta was mediocre for me. All on was a good meal!\n",

Amano's does great pizzas which are generously sized with a nice crunchy crust and fluffy dough.\nThe rocket and prosciutto pizza is reliably good. Prawn and bacon was also excellent.\nLook out for their weekday promos which are an exceptional deal for the taste and quality of the food.\nStaff were polite and kept our water glasses topped up.\nGood place for a nice and laid-back weeknight dinner.\nParking can be tricky since it's in a residential area, but normally don't have to walk too far to get one one weekdays.\nI find the tiramisu a tad cloying on the sweetness, would give other options a go next visit.\n\nAs this place is quite hidden amongst the private estate enclave, there is little crowd and no need for reservations (even on Friday evening).\nDecent Italian food with oven baked pizza! The best dish was the seafood risotto! Yummy!\n\nAmano is probably one of the best kept secrets for those looking for budget (relative to the usually more upscale options) Italian food. One of the main reasons for this is its location - it is located deep inside a private estate at a standalone row of shophouses. Unless you drive, you'll probably have to do a fair bit of walking to reach it. If you drive though, you can park for free along the road just outside. The food itself is really nice, especially the pastas and pizzas. Despite being a relatively small joint, they do have one of those huge traditional pizza ovens and I understand that their dough is made in-house. Can't comment on the other types of dishes on the menu but the pastas and pizzas are generally a safe bet. Do not that the pizzas are huge so you can definitely share one among two, or even three persons! The place itself is usually empty so you can just pop by and eat without too much fuss. Strongly recommend if you're willing to travel abit!\n\nA hidden gem in the middle of a neighborhood. Only way to get there is to drive.\n\nFood in general is a good variety and decent quality. Prices are much friendlier than the other Italian restaurants in the Bukit Timah area. And service has been excellent.\n\nDinner for 3: Had 2 starters (burrata/ prosciutto platter and bread basket), 3 mains (1 pizza, 1 seafood pasta and 1 lamb gnocci), 2 glasses of wine.\n\nEnjoyed the food, though I thought the gnocci was a bit too salty - probably won't get 2 tomato based ones next time. Whilst generous with the cheese on the Pizza, I reckon the restaurant can do better with a better selection of parmesean topping for pastas.\n",

The serving portion are decent and we ordered a tad too much. Food are great. The fettuccini was al dente and flavourful. Personally would prefer if the prawns are deveined. Pizza was nicely baked with crispy edge and generous amount of toppings. The Tiramisu\u2019s lady fingers were fully soaked in kahlua, making it a nice touch to finish up a good meal. All the servers are great, courteous and attentive to the customer\u2019s needs.\n\nWife said i will love their Tiramisu... n she was right! Tiramisu al pistachio.. fantastic dessert. Amazed with their Bolognese too. Seeing my son 9 could nearly finish it by himself i had to ask him to stop save room for dessert. ^_^. It's been a while since i had dined in ltaliano restaurant. I like the food here n the ambience in there,it was well lit up.\n\nThe service was very good. Enough staff, smiled n well trained. It was rare to see when a waiter cleaning the table, spray the cleaning agent closely onto the cloth first, then wipe the table. *Waiter-John 2 thumb up*\nUsually the one i saw just spray the chemical agent straight onto the table...=_=\"\n\nI say this place will do better if there are more parking lots. Haiz... SG cramp up\nHope to come back again with just my wife, kids just mess up the mood lol.\n\nLove the food here! Pizza and the truffle focaccia were super good and fresh. Super tasty (and personally I think eating with chilli flakes makes them even better!). The fried calamari dish was light and is great for starters. We also ordered the appetizer (melon wrapped in parma ham), and I think that was really good too (I have not tried it before and was a little skeptical, but after the first bite it totally changed my mind). Desserts (tiramisu and molten chocolate lave cake) were okay.\n\nWe had the Calamari Fritti, Pizza Ai Frutti Di Mare Al Nero Di Seppia, and Risotto Di Mare Zafferano \u2013 all via food delivery. All of them tasted so good, I can imagine it would be fantastic to dine at the restaurant. Looking forward to that next!\n\nHard to find parking but like the attentive homely service. Food is good. Pasta is the type with lots of sauce. We will try the pizza next time with the return voucher.\n",

The 8 cheese pizza is excellent and so is the veal ravioli! Drinks are great too. We also love the decor -will definitely return to this restaurant.\n\nLoved the experience. Great service at the door and through the lunch.\nThey accommodated all my requests, food was served in record time and great, from the lobster spaghetti, to the grilled prawns and grilled veggies. Good portion and quality was there. Very nice the espresso too.\n\nHighly Recommended.\n\nGreat place for desserts. Good pastries and ice cream. Would be great if the kitchen can be opened until 12am. \ud83d\ude2c\n\nWas looking forward to the vegetable bowl BUT it's not available on the weekends so we shared a pizza, calamari and vongole pasta. Service was quick and efficient. Pizza was baked in an oven behind us. And even if we came in without a reservation on a Saturday we got a table easily.\n\nIt was a great experience. The food, the ambiance and the staff, all put together made the 1st experience dining here really great. Whether you are with family, or friends, or on a date night, this restaurant fits for all.\n",

The whole experience was brought to another level by extremely warm service by genuinely friendly staff. We would be back again.\n\nCame to celebrate Father\u2019s Day lunch on a lazy Sunday.  Place is not crowded and quite a nice homely atmosphere.  Ordered pizza, lamb chop, burrata cheese plater and bruschetta bread. All tasted delicious and pizza is really good.  Finished with nice coffee and tiramisu dessert.  Service is fast and prompt.  Overall a pleasant experience and the bill came up to $126 which is reasonable for the quality of food served.  Will certainly be back.\n\nA nice cosy Italian restaurant nestled inside a private apartment. You will be spoilt for choices as they have a great authentic Italian menu and everything is tasty. Interior decor is also nicely done with a homey touch. Very friendly staff and chef as well.\n\nI used to order often from them 4-5 years back as I was living next door and I returned for a dinner (last visit was probably 2019). The atmosphere is still great (old school italian place), the food is still amazing. Had the burrata, the 4 cheese pizza (I always order this wherever I go and Al Borgo is top 3 in Singapore for me) and pasta (angel hair with prawns). Nice Super Tuscan red wine at 90$ a bottle. Had deserts too (tiramisu and affogato with whisky instead of coffee). Total damage approx 230$. I left happy in spirit and tummy\n\nIt's definitely a great restaurant for who wanna taste real Italian food!! Thanks so much for giving us a lovely and unforgettable evening :)\n",

Definitely not a daily dining Italian shop. I came with my friend for a celebration.\n\nShop opens up with a bar, and then leads you into a dining area where there were ample space and ambience was on point. Good vibes.\n\nWarm bread was fluffy and tasted perfect when dipped with a their top grade olive oil and a touch of balsamic vinegar. Starter was ok. Mushroom soup done right, service was prompt, pastas were all round tasty (one of the best), beef steak was done exactly the way I wanted it, not over cooked and not under cooked, tiramisu was a good old recipe that is worth it.\n\nI must also comment that the restaurant made an effort to portion the food for 2 for every ordered item, when they noted we were sharing everything, this I\u2019m very appreciative of.\n\nThe only thing I thought could be better were the bread sticks offered on the table, they were lacklustre as a tidbit or small bite. Maybe it\u2019s just me but I saw most tables did not bother to eat or touch.\n\nOverall, this restaurant definitely deserves a 5 stars.\n\nI refuse to believe that this is a Michelin star restaurant. Food was AWFUL. How could you ruin steak? I literally had one bite of the meat and it was rancid just like the lobster we had for starter - I left it untouched. The truffle pasta was the only thing we were able to eat but won\u2019t give it more than 2/5. Service was also below average. Truly disappointed \ud83d\udc4e\n\nAlways a super experience at Garibaldi\u2019s. What a treat with the amazing starter bread that comes out steamy hot, the salad delectable and the mains delicate and delicious.\n\nFun to order different dishes so you can have a taste of all the starters, mains and desserts.\n\nWe were here for SG restaurant week and had the set lunch menu.\nNice ambience, crowded even on a weekday afternoon. Staff was nice and friendly, took care of our table and topped up the water.\nChoice of appetizer: salmon trout or wild mushroom soup\nMains: Mediterranean royal sea bream or Braised beef cheek with fettuccine\nDessert: cheese platter or blueberry yoghurt cake.\n\nVerdict: I loved the seafood dishes as it was quite fresh. Good choice of salmon and sea bream. As for the beef fettuccine, it wasn\u2019t as nice as expected. Perhaps the braised beef did not have much taste. Lastly, the dessert was alright, it was a mix of fresh blueberry, yoghurt and also blueberry jam. They could keep it simple by having a classic tiramisu instead.\n\nWent for SG Restaurant Week. Weakest point for me has to be the service. Feels like eating at a neighbourhood cafe with the lack of attention and care from staff.\n\nFood is very hit or miss. We love the scallops starter, but my burrata dish was very bland. The lobster pasta main was amazing, while the beef was disappointingly dry. We both had the blueberry yogurt dessert and it was alright.\n\nOverall wouldn\u2019t come again.\n",

Double, Wow!\n\nMade a last minute booking for a weekday lunch and only the outdoor seats were left. But the outdoor seats were lovely as well. And service was also very prompt!\n\nFood was excellent. Both the pasta and pizzas we ordered were amazing. Was very full after all the appetizers and mains but we still inhaled the tiramisu very quickly after it was served.\n\nHidden gem in One North! Try it for yourself! ;)\n\nGood & friendly service staff.\nReasonably good food. The calamari and cold cuts were good. So were the pasta, focaccia, pizza of the day, fettuccine of the day, linguine of the day. Nice deserts too.\nHowever, the beef of the day was over cooked vs the medium rare that was asked for.\n",

Thank You Chef Valentino\n\nWhat more can I say except that I wished I had dined here earlier! It is one of the pricer restaurants I\u2019ve been to AND it was worth every dollar \ud83d\udcb5 spent! Every food and drink ordered hit the spot for us - deliziosa!  Prompt and warm service crew and the chef-owner, Valentino, and his family were present, and personally supervising the service crew and attending to guests. What lovely hospitality! You should be there to soak it all up\u2026 food, drinks, great service and lovely ambience (check out the photos!) I will surely miss them when they move out. You can still catch them before their last day on 24 Dec 2023. Dining reservations strongly recommended.\n\nA family favourite restaurant that\u2019s been around for a long time and unfortunately they are going to cease operations soon! Food is great as usual, their garlic bread is good, and it\u2019s white truffle season now, best time to enjoy their truffle tagliolini. Their aglio Olio is unique as it comes with whole cloves of garlic, the seafood or lobster versions taste best. Portions are on the small side making it less value for money but taste is always on point.\n\nI love this italian restaurant & it has been my top favourite. Food is heavenly, ambience is nice & hosts are really so warm & friendly.  Never fail!\n\nHad my birthday celebration here and loved it. The portion were huge, staff were super attentive by clearing and changing plates frequently. I was pleasantly caught by surprise when the staff sang happy birthday. Highly recommended the lamb shank, pizza, salad, tiramisu and lava cake.\n",

                  "reviews": "\n\nVisited in Sep 2023\n\nA fantastic dining experience. The dry-aged duck main course was absolutely fantastic and so was the fish/turbot main course dish. The beef carpaccio course was also brilliant. The restaurant doesn\u2019t have a non-alcoholic pairing and that\u2019s probably a small area where they can improve their \u2018value proposition\u2019.\n\nService was top notch.\n\nA definite recommendation for a classy dinner experience\n\nWonderful culinary experience from the start till the end. The location and ambiance is welcoming and cosy, the staff is friendly and took great care of us, the food is delicious, high attention to details and wonderful ingredients from all over the globe. The chef is very talented and creative. The sommelier chose some amazing wines and champagne to pair the dishes with. Amazing experience.\n\nA sensational lunch which well exceeds its price point of $178++ per pax. The only criticism would be that the bread course was uninspiring, but who cares? It\u2019s free anyway. Canap\u00e9s started with their signature playful tomato soup. Using trompe l\u2019oeil to make it look like tomatoes it\u2019s actually a soft shell with tomato gazpacho encased within. The scallop tartare with avocado and tomato jelly was wonderfully light with all the elements working in harmony. The cod mousse taco was nice but overshadowed by its two counterparts. The first course started with a bang, yellowtail finished table side with a horseradish snow. Light, refreshing and full of flavour with an added air of theatricality for good measure. The second course was Mozambique langoustine which was the highlight of the menu. Sitting on top of a creamy anchovy sauce. The sweetness of the langoustine was a perfect complement to the (not-too) salty sauce. While the gem lettuce added some crunch to contrast with the soft and plump shellfish. This course was pure delight from start to finish! The pasta course was an elevated carbonara which utilised cured egg yolk. It was not too heavy which was a pleasant surprise. The main was veal with white asparagus coated in sabayon in a moscato sauce. The veal was cooked to perfection and the kitchen, once again, demonstrate their attention to detail by ensuring that each dish consists of an equal balance of flavours and textures. The palate cleanser was finished table side with a prickly pear granita, highly refreshing after two somewhat heavier courses. The dessert was the chef\u2019s take on semifreddo using Marsala grapes, dessert wine sauce and clotted cream. Wonderful and I loved the bitterness of the grapes and wine sauce. Overall a spectacular meal, one of the best michelin-starred lunches one can grab in Singapore that showcases high quality ingredients, inventiveness while also not ripping a gigantic hole in one\u2019s pocket. The setting of the restaurant is intimate and perfect for a date or a more private business meeting. Staff are warm, attentive and knowledgeable (and also take good photos). Definitely worth a visit.\n\nModern Italian restaurant serving interestingly innovative dishes especially the amuse bouches. Wine pairing was generous and well thought out - always a nice way to find new wines if a restaurant gets it right! Service was good. Small but well spaced and clean relaxed ambience.\n\n1st time at their restaurant for dinner. Nice colonial place. Restaurant itself felt inviting. Staffs were all smiling when greeted & warmed when serving food.\n\nFood were great. Wine pairing was generous.\n\nRecommended.\n",

We ordered pizza with mushroom and meat it was so hearty and delicious. The gnocchi was creamy and hit the spot. The surprise was the dessert. I never had the citrus cake before and it was a revelation. Absolutely loved it. Can\u2019t recommend it enough. Overall the food and service makes this restaurant worthy of a visit again.\n\ndefinitely enjoyed our dinner here, staff were attentive and friendly. The seafood platter was fresh, the steak was definitely a 10/10. The fresh crab meat pasta was good too. Will come back again.\n\nThe pasta was the best!! We had Mediterranean salad which was good, it\u2019s like Italian mix with Greece. We ordered spaghetti vongole and spaghetti seafood with Bisque sauce, both are delicious and I almost lick the plate, I\u2019m sad that I\u2019m full already if not will order cheese cake for sure. It\u2019s my new favourite Italian restaurant for now, love the service and vibe so much, it\u2019s casual and classy, parking is complimentary valet is a plus! Will be back 100%\n\nGreat Italian dishes.  Especially the starter fish dish.  Superb and nicely executed\n\nDeep fried calamari is so good!\n\nPork collar was nicely seared and presented\n\nPizza with anchovies are interesting\n\nRisotto was also good\nSeafood pasta was not as exciting though\n\nOverall a good dining experience\n\nHowever,  I hope the servers can be more attentive in filing the wine glasses of customers when it goes empty.\n\nPizza was quite a let down, if you are looking for a crispy crust pizza, you\u2019ll be let down\u2026 the centre of the pizza was wet and floppy, we resorted to taking it home. Calamari was tough, carbonara was a special request and disappointed with the clumpy sauce. Unlikely that we\u2019ll be back unfortunately.\n",

The steak is soft and juicy but pity the tomahawk is a bit dry. Roast lamb is great as well. Didn\u2019t really ate too much of the pasta though its very good cos need to save space for cheese and desserts!\n\nAll the food was excellent, the service was courteous and friendly, and we had a great time. (Honestly, the quality of the Asian food wasn't that great.) The chefs came around during the meal to give us tastings, and it felt like we were at a friend's party. It was a great time. Thank you:)\n\nDelicious brunch with an extensive selection of Italian cheese. The Lasagna was also extremely delicious! The service was perfect as well. Money well spent and a very fun afternoon thanks to wine/prosecco free flow as well.\n\nWent for Sunday brunch. Cheese room is lovely with a wide selection of cheeses. Loved the unique chocolate cheeses and burratas. Mains selection is ok, could be larger. Lamb stew was nice. Desserts are good as well.\n\nThe restaurant offers an array of \ud83e\uddc0 cheese.\nIf you are a cheese lover, this will be the restaurant for you!\nWe had buffet but the selection is limited unlike the conventional buffet.  However, food is delicious.\nThe service is good. Mr Muru / Mr Nuru (Manager) is very helpful & friendly.\n",

Their firewood pizza is not to be missed too. A perfect environment to stay and chill with a glass or wine or beer after a nice dinner.\n\nI visited this place for a dinner date. We had already made a reservation in advance, as we knew very well that this place would be packed on the weekends.\n\nThe staff were very nice to greet us as we made our way into the restaurant and even walked us over to our tables. The waiter at the time was very observant, and would constantly check up on how we were  doing.\n\nMore on the food:\n\n(Appetizer)\nBurrata Bruschetta - 8/10 \ud83c\udf1f\n- The Burrata was really lovely!\n- The sweet and juicy tomatoes compliments the creamy and milky cheese\n\nHowever, the bread was a little tougher than expected that our knives struggle to cut through. Nevertheless, it was pretty delicious \ud83e\udd24\ud83d\ude0b\n\n(Appetizer)\nEggplant Parmigiana -  10/10 \ud83c\udf1f\ud83e\udd0c\n- Absolutely bussin!\n- It tastes better than a regular lasagne, the eggplant is barely noticeable. Which is good in a way as my partner is not too much of a fan of veggies.\n- The sauce topped with the cheese just makes this dish one of the best in my opinion\n\n(Main)\nDiavola pizza - 9/10 \ud83c\udf1f\n- Spicy, greasy and meaty pizza\n- The spicy and salty sorpressata balances the thick and absorbent pizza dough\n- Low-key better than pepperoni pizzas \ud83e\udd2d\n\n*Unfortunately I forgot to take a picture*\n\n(Dessert)\nFlamb\u00e9ed Chocolate Ecstasy - 6/10\ud83c\udf1f\n- Presentation was really good \ud83d\udc4d\n- Interesting concept of both Hot and Cold dessert\n\nHowever, our brownies were a little too frozen \ud83d\ude15. We knew it was a hot and cold dessert as there was ice cream served with the hot-plated brownies. But when we tried to scoop booth goodies, the brownie was frozen hahaha. Interesting concept but would recommend other stuff like the tiramisu maybe.\n\nOverall, excellent experience. Prompt service, a little pricey but worth the occasional visits. Came in hungry, left full  \ud83d\ude35\n\nMy first time dining here and the staffs here are really sweet and customer oriented. They made the dining here with my girlfriend beyond pleasant. They made small talks with you and check on you regarding the quality of the food. The food was amazing but my friend and I couldn\u2019t finished it because we are 2 girls that over ordered. If you are going for a date, this place is extremely ideal. Will definitely be back.\n\nWas here for a birthday celebration. Staff was very nice and provided complimentary tiramisu cake (slightly alcoholic), which tasted phenomenal. Pizza is very well balanced and does not get gelat from a few bites, while the pastas and risottos pack a good flavourful punch. In total, it was slightly pricey but overall nice place to wine and dine.\n\nRegarding indoors seating, music is kinda loud to have a clear conversation. Place is pet friendly and there are many dogs around\n\nService was underwhelming for the price paid.  Not the worst. But one would expect better.\n\nFood. so long is pizza or pasta or Italian is nice. The pork chop was soso only.  Pizza came before the starters.\n\nDessert is a must have!! The tiramsu and flaming chocolate extasy. Don't touch the hot pan!!!\n\nWine selection is good and recommendation by the wine guy was great!!!\n\nGood for celebrations... or hangout.\nBut bring a big wallet.\n\nFree parking (4hrs) too if u need to know  1 ticket per bill.\n",

Really enjoyed everything but especially the chef\u2019s special seaweed pasta and the grilled bacon wraps. Unfortunately the restaurant was busy and because it\u2019s quite open it\u2019s very loud and has a cafeteria feeling to it. The service was quite disappointing, and we had to ask multiple times where the rest of our food was (even servers came a few times to ask if we were done with the table or waiting for more items). The whole thing felt very chaotic and like no one was really on top of things; which is as disappointing. Food was good enough that we  will try again in a less busy night and hope service is better.\n\nLoved the service by the staff. They are friendly and accommodating. They would check about the food too.\n\nFood was great; tasty and generous. It\u2019s nice to now that the class of dish can be found in the area. Love it.\n\nThe space is pretty crowded, especially on weekend. Walking areas between the tables and payment area are tight. Worth to mention too, the ventilation can be improved. The air was towards the warmer side (probably because of the crowd during dinner time?) and made clothes smell.\n\nFinally got to have a meal here, and real glad we did. Everything looked so good! I think the meatballs, which we had for starters, were simply amazing, quite possibly the best I've ever had - so tender and moist and tasty! \ud83d\ude0b  The pasta and the lasagna were wonderful also, deliciously creamy and so rich in flavours (on hindsight I really shouldn't have tried to eat the entire lasagna on my own.. way too rich \ud83d\ude05). And the pistachio tiramisu was a surprisingly delightful treat, though personally I still prefer the traditional version. Definitely coming back for more and to savour the many more other items on their menu. \ud83d\ude0a\n\nThe baked pork belly deserves special mention. The succulent and perfectly seasoned pork is roasted to a crispy, golden perfection, while the meat inside remains tender and flavorful. Every bite is a harmonious combination of savory, salty, and wild fennel flavors that dance on your palate.\n\nOf course, I couldn't leave without indulging in their delectable pistachio tiramisu, which was the perfect sweet ending to my Italian gastronomic adventure.\n\nOrdered some items from the regular a la carte menu and some weekly specials. It\u2019s my first time there, celebrating my husband\u2019s birthday. The dishes are delicious and flavourful, we cleared everything. Only thing I felt could be better was service.\nDidn\u2019t get any \u201chow\u2019s everything\u201d when all the tables around me got it; need a bit of attention to get them to come over to take orders etc\n",

Flavours were all very well balanced and overall we left feeling very satisfied.\n\nVisited in Sep 2023\n\nBraci was on my list of restaurants to visit for over 4 years and I must say that it was worth the wait. It is no surprise that Braci has retained its Michelin 1 star for 6 consecutive years. The menu was a progressive one which is definitely inspired by Chef Mattie\u2019s Italian roots. There are 2 choices for people (5 course and 7 course). I would suggest people to go for the 7 course as the additional dishes in the 7 course meal are worth it. One of my favourite parts of the experience was trying out the 100 yr old balsamic vinegar.\n\nIf you\u2019re not taking the wine pairing, I would strongly recommend folks to try out a few of their cocktails, esp. their Negroni (one of the most unique ones I\u2019ve had)\n\nService was good. The restaurant is able to cater to some food allergies (like my shellfish allergy).\n\nA definite recommendation for fine dining lovers.\n\nLocation was not to my liking.\nGreat staff very welcoming and accomodating to our strict dietary restrictions.\nThey had to make a menu from scratch for us which gives them bonus points.\nFood quality was amazing and the ingredients exquisite.\nHowever, the taste of the food was confusing and frankly bland at times.\nBut i cannot judge the restaurant fairly as i did not try the actual menu items.\n\nAmazing time at Braci for a birthday celebration for my husband. The Italian food was superb with beautiful floral aesthetic to each dishes. Staff is polite and friendly too! Special thanks to Chef Matteo who is very engaging and make the day extra special! Love the black truffle \"hide and seek\" dish which is one of the highlights of all dishes! It so savoury and unforgettable\u2026.\n\nnice food nice atmosphere. i tot the service could be more positive. but i still enjoy the experience especially on a chill night in the rooftop. overall quite an expensive experience but they were very nice to add an additional anniversary dessert for us:)\n",

Huge portions good food qualify for good quality. Like service staffing professional\n\nAlways lovely to have dinner in this place. I am Italian and I appreciate good food made with good ingredients, in a genuine and simple way. Vespetta is one of our favourite. Great service, great location. We always have good time and we will keep coming back \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\n\nWe had a company lunch. The set menu $41 (before service charge and gst) comes with starter, main course and dessert. However certain dishes need add-on price so the price is not absolute final.\n\nThe food quality is acceptable but no surprise. The breaded roasted sea bass fillet maybe a bit dry considering it is roasted. The roasted boneless chicken leg is quite well prepared and juicy. Calzone Alla Nutella is good for 2 or more people to share. Taste is good thanks to Nutella. Tiramisu is so-so.\n\nAtmosphere is nice if you're sitting outside along the river, but may be hot and exposed to sunlight if it is sunny.\n\nIt maybe a good place for business lunch or drinking only.\n\nCame here for lunch after my banking stuff.  Pretty much little aircon but it\u2019s alright not warm as there are many wall fans around.  Food quality is okay but wish the tomatoes is grilled and potato not burnt.  Salads is good as I love the cheese, beef is okay.  Tiramisu serving is big, plus point is not too sweet just right.  My colleague ordered sea bass and looks really good.  Overall a decent and happy meal.\n\nIf you like authentic and very tasty italian food, it\u2018s a must to go her. We had a very good time - thank you so much! \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf9\n",

The highlight of the meal was the seafood stew. All the breads were also exceptionally delicious. However, the sea bass tasted very ordinary and the sky high price tag went to the showy \u2018performance\u2019 by the chef. Restaurant was too dim and had a funky smell.\n\nThe staff are very friendly and the food is also tasty. The portion is surprisingly big and we ate till our hearts content.\n\nStaff very helpful and polite. Atmosphere is chill with soft music. Food serve just in the right timing.  Of cause the price is not cheap. But it worth the price overall.\n\nLastly thanks for the birthday cake. Love it but we were too full to finish it.\n\nBooked Sunday afternoon to have their set lunch, only to find out they only serve buffet that day at $78++ per person. Opted in anyway and didn't regret it, given the fresh ingredients, great taste of Italian and friendly staffs! Personally I love the dessert section especially Panna Cotta! If I had to pick on something, it'd be the dim lighting. No discount on the bill even with Shangri-la Circle membership, but you do get extra points.\n\nRemember, when you get into the lobby, you are on 3F. You need to take an elevator to get down to 1F where the restaurant is.\n\nThe restaurant has decent ambience for a semi chic and comfortable dinning experience. The salt crusted fish is delicious and if you want to see some fire show. The winner for me is the crab pasta. Yum!\n\nWe celebrated our anniversary dinner here and it was a great decision! They generously presented us a complimentary cake, thank you for perfecting the night.\nAmong the dishes, we absolutely love the Porchetta. It was tender, yet crispy and flavourful, Highly recommended! While on the other side, we didn\u2019t like the potato pur\u00e9e in the braised lamb leg dishes. It may have ruined the experience with that main dish. Despite that, this would not stop us from giving 5 stars because the other aspects (service/ambience) make up to it. A great dining place for celebrations.\n",

Service is very good (9.5/10), all service staff were friendly, attentive & helpful. Ambience good (7.5/10), acoustically a bit noisy.  The table setting very nice (9/10), the table cloth has a pleasant look & comfortable feel. The tiramisu cake lacks the alcohol but still scores a solid 8.5/10.  Good price value. We will be back for more delicious pasta \ud83d\ude0b\n\nCame here on a Monday evening for dinner with friends. Enjoyed all the food! All taste good and reasonable pricing. However, the restaurant is rather small.\n\nMy family found our favorite Italian restaurant now. We loved every dish that we ordered. The pastas were memorable. Every bite was al dente. And the chocolate sauce that came with their cannoli was amazingly rich. It brought me back to Paris where I had the best hot chocolate that tasted like liquid chocolate.\n\nDined-in at Etna last weekend for a birthday celebration. Booking was made online and requires a confirmation on WhatsApp on the day of booking which I had missed on my end. Nevertheless, we were fortunate to be able to take the only outdoor table left which was by the pavement which was equally comfortable with nice vibe.\n\nThe service staff were all friendly and nice. Food is not the best but I do recommend the crab pasta that we had. The crab taste was not overwhelming and the bisque blends in well with the pasta. We did not particularly enjoyed the ciriole alla norcina pasta as the pasta was a little thick for our liking. We also ordered a traditional focaccia and a calzone napoletano pizza as well which were amazing too. Portions were huge and we barely were able to finish the food for a group of 4.\n\nOverall, Etna serves great Italian food and is worth the visit. Food were reasonably priced too.\n\nOverall not bad, I\u2019d say 7/10. We had the veal was a \u2018today special\u2019.\n\nDidn\u2019t know veal could be breaded. The batter was tasty. Pasta was mediocre for me. All on was a good meal!\n",

The serving portion are decent and we ordered a tad too much. Food are great. The fettuccini was al dente and flavourful. Personally would prefer if the prawns are deveined. Pizza was nicely baked with crispy edge and generous amount of toppings. The Tiramisu\u2019s lady fingers were fully soaked in kahlua, making it a nice touch to finish up a good meal. All the servers are great, courteous and attentive to the customer\u2019s needs.\n\nWife said i will love their Tiramisu... n she was right! Tiramisu al pistachio.. fantastic dessert. Amazed with their Bolognese too. Seeing my son 9 could nearly finish it by himself i had to ask him to stop save room for dessert. ^_^. It's been a while since i had dined in ltaliano restaurant. I like the food here n the ambience in there,it was well lit up.\n\nThe service was very good. Enough staff, smiled n well trained.

Haiz... SG cramp up\nHope to come back again with just my wife, kids just mess up the mood lol.\n\nLove the food here! Pizza and the truffle focaccia were super good and fresh. Super tasty (and personally I think eating with chilli flakes makes them even better!). The fried calamari dish was light and is great for starters. We also ordered the appetizer (melon wrapped in parma ham), and I think that was really good too (I have not tried it before and was a little skeptical, but after the first bite it totally changed my mind). Desserts (tiramisu and molten chocolate lave cake) were okay.\n\nWe had the Calamari Fritti, Pizza Ai Frutti Di Mare Al Nero Di Seppia, and Risotto Di Mare Zafferano \u2013 all via food delivery. All of them tasted so good, I can imagine it would be fantastic to dine at the restaurant. Looking forward to that next!\n\nHard to find parking but like the attentive homely service. Food is good. Pasta is the type with lots of sauce. We will try the pizza next time with the return voucher.\n",

The service from Albert was impeccable, with the staff showing a passion for Italian fusion cuisine.\n\nEvery dish was a work of art. I started with house-bread that was given as complimentary food, and it was delicious. Then, I ordered the Chef's recommendation of Cold Pasta Scallop Uni with extra Black Truffle, 3 Bruschetta and Grilled Lamb. The combination flavours of them were vibrant, and the presentation was stunning.\n\nThe water selection was also extensive. You'll know by heart that when the waiter asked, \"Do you want a regular or sparkling water?\" It is truly a 5-star restaurant. It's the perfect place for a special occasion or a romantic evening. Bravo!\n\nSuperb everything.\n\nFrom the moment we stepped in, we were well taken care of by Albert.\n\nWe ordered the following and were stuffed by the end of the dinner service. Portions were relatively huge for us both.\n\nWhat we ordered:\n1 X Angel hair scallop uni pasta\n2 X Oysters\n1 X Eggplant parmigiana\n1 X Lamb rack\n1 X Tiramisu\n\nHouse bread was really really really good!\n\nOverall, very value for money!\nNo words can describe, only numbers can. 10/10!!!!!\n\nCosy restaurant.  Went with my family. Very delicious food. Every dish i had was decently well presented and tasty. My family really enjoyed sharing the different variety of food from salad, scampi pasta, calamari, lasagne, stead, cod fish, crispy spanish pork.\n\nPrices are on the high side. Be very careful when ordering items not listed in menu.   We had a shock at how expensive the truffle pizza was. They should have highlighted the cost during recommending since they are really off norms by a lot ( really many times the usual price;  though i know truffle is supposed to be more expensive).\n\nGenerally, it is still a pleasant dining experience.  We will go back again but will be really careful during ordering. \ud83d\ude05\n\nLovely Italian lunch celebrating a friend's birthday. We used to work near to this restaurant more than 10 years ago. The food must be good since it survived Covid?! Decided to try it and boy it was good. Abit on the pricey side.\n\nWas recommended to dine here, I must say I was rather impressed by the quality and portion.  All our orders are well divided before being brought to us, portion was really generous and filling.\n\nReally love the truffle uni capellini, and the service standards of service staff. Tiramisu (baileys) gals alittle short of my expectation and I feel can be better, but otherwise the rest of the food were great!\n\nWill recommend to call in for a reservation.\n",

                  "reviews": "\n\nWe started the meal with the calamari, squid was fresh but the seasoning was a little bit too sour for my liking. The pasta was decently yummy but nothing too out of the world. Everything was done well hence the 4 stars review but perhaps it lacked the little OOMPH factor that would make it a five star. Service was exceptional, waiter was very attentive and nice, provided tons of recommendations and was very warm!\n\nWent there during restaurant week and was amazed by the food quality and impeccable service. Everyone was friendly. Special shout-out to one of the staff, not sure if is the manager with a cross chain, interacting well with my 3 years old boy! Will definitely return again :)\n\nWe decided to celebrate the little boy's birthday at an Italian restaurant renowned for their delicious sourdough pizza, which has been ranked among the top 10 best pizzas in Singapore.\n\nFor starters, we opted for the Burrata cheese and sourdough bread, which was nothing out of the ordinary. However, the roasted potatoes with rosemary were a standout dish that shouldn't be overlooked.\n\nUnfortunately, we were somewhat disappointed with the expensive petite Wagyu Striploin, possibly because it wasn't cooked to our desired level of doneness. We also sampled the Linguine Clams pasta, which was decent in taste but didn't quite wow us\n\nTheir menu is extensive, but their pizza steals the show. So many toppings to choose from! We ordered quite a feast, but I highly recommend the Calamari, Lobster Pasta, and any of their pizzas. The best part? They serve up your food lightning-fast, perfect for the hungry souls out there.\n\nAnd don't forget to save room for dessert - their Pistachio Gelato is out of this world. Creamy, nutty, and just heavenly! \ud83c\udf55\ud83c\udf5d\ud83c\udf66\n\nAll of the food is delicious. The waiter was so attentive, polite, and friendly. They can explain their own food. The place was easy to find. The price was reasonable.\n",

The gnocchi and lasagna are well seasoned! Staffs are friendly and helpful as well!\n\nI think this Italian restaurant is 5 stars for its food, service and atmosphere. We basically ordered 3 dishes (a seasonal grilled fish, a Limoncello pizza and the Angus Tenderloin) for 2 pax and it is more than enough. The taste of the seasonal fish (sorry can't remember what fish it is) is exquisite. Both the looks and the taste profile can completely fool anyone that it is not a fish dish. The Angus Tenderloin is grilled nicely with the medium rare pink in the centre looking so succulent. Limoncello pizza (duh!) is also recommended if you are spoilt for choice. Lastly, go for the dessert! It is so good! I also appreciate the attentiveness of the staff. Seldom you find mid-range restaurant servers pouring wine when you are near empty. This restaurant staff ensured my glass is never empty, which is also not exactly good if you really want to take things slower. Robertson Quay is a very nice spot to immerse yourself into the weekend evening crowd. Be sure to ask for an outdoor table so you can enjoy the people watching.\n\nWanted to dine at Publico but it\u2019s fully booked so we went here which slowly started filling up seats by night.\n\n\ud835\ude41\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude58\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude63 \ud835\ude68\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5e \ud835\ude59\ud835\ude5e \ud835\ude62\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude6f\ud835\ude64 \ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude5c\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5e \ud835\ude58\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude62\ud835\ude65\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude5c\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude63 ($28)\n- Al dente homemade fettuccine with a slight chewy bite soaked the luscious sauce well, although a little too wheat-tasting for me.\n- Champignon mushrooms provided an earthy note.\n- Beef tenderloin strips were a bit gamey and could be more tender though.\n\n\ud835\ude47\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude62\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude61\ud835\ude61\ud835\ude64 \ud835\ude65\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude6f\ud835\ude6f\ud835\ude56 ($29)\n- White base with mozzarella, parmesan, porcini mushrooms, very flavourful beef sausage and button mushrooms!\n- I liked the thin pizza dough that\u2019s Neapolitan-style with a crispy crust and a slight chew \ud83c\udf55\n\n\ud835\ude3d\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude56, \ud835\ude65\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude68\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude64 \ud835\ude59\ud835\ude5e \ud835\ude65\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude62\ud835\ude56 30 \ud835\ude62\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude68\ud835\ude5e \ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude65\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude62\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude59\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude64 ($24)\n- Burrata cheese was very fresh and creamy!!\n- Balanced with prosciutto ham that\u2019s moist and not overly salty.\n\n\ud835\ude3e\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude61\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude62\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5e \ud835\ude59\ud835\ude5e \ud835\ude65\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude6f\ud835\ude56 ($32)\n- Baby squid fried in crispy coating was firmly chewy with a salty flavour profile!\n- Prawns were sweet, wouldn\u2019t mind a bigger portion given the price of the starter \ud83e\udd90\n\nComplimentary bread was served warm and soft, we enjoyed it so much that we got another basket \ud83e\udd56 Their seafood tasted fresh so a better choice of pasta could be the crab linguine or mix seafood spaghetti!\n\nFollow @iloafbready Instagram for more food reviews \ud83e\udd70\n\nLove the night vibe: warm and cozy lights, big plants and water body. The pizza is really delicious, will definitely come back for this thin and crispy wood fire pizza. Love the ham with burrata, simple yet yummy! Although for dessert, don\u2019t recommend limoncello cake, it\u2019s pretty average or rather below average.\n\nLimoncello is one those Italian restaurants that you can be assured that the quality of the food is always there. I have eaten at this place many times but never get to write a review. So this is long overdue. The restaurant is situated in a Condominium ground floor facing the river. You can order a coffee and a cake and watch the world goes by. The customer service is excellent. The food is even better. We had the crab pasta and linguine with winter truffles. Sadly the grilled amberjack was sold out. This is one of the reasons why I made a repeat visit. Instead we ordered a pan fried bream. The pastas are a joy and delight to savor. They used real crab meat. There is also a generous portions of truffles. The menu is wide and the desserts are awesome! This place deserves to succeed. I pray that they will be here to a long time to come.\n",

Great place for special occasions, family gatherings if you\u2019re looking for good food, with decent pricing. Stars of the show has to be the calamari and the seafood cartoccio. Other favourites include the Pizza Bella Roma, Pollo, Crabmeat risotto and tiramisu! Definitely looking forward to my next visit, will be back for more :)\n\nFoods are delicious and well done. Especially the beef. Lava not as good as expected, the liquid flows not that smooth. Love them not too sweet. It was regret they have no hot water for coffee. It should be resolved easily.\n\nI like the fact that this is a neighborhood trattoria, where locals are regulars. You can see that the proprietor and staff know their customers.\n\nWe were a group of 6, and managed to try quite a number of their dishes. Overall quality was good, we enjoyed the food. The highlights were seafood soup, squid ink pasta, scaloppini, capriciossa pizza.\n\nI brought along a bottle of Barbaresco to enjoy (a reasonable corkage of $20).\n\nA nice place that I would return to. Recommended.\n\nTitle: A Memorable Italian Delight at Cacio e Pepe at 3 Chu Lin Road, Singapore 669890\n\nMy family and I recently had the pleasure of dining at Cacio e Pepe, an Italian gem tucked away in a quiet suburban location. From the moment we stepped in, it was evident that this restaurant was something special.\n\n**Ambience:** The ambience at Cacio e Pepe was warm and inviting. The rustic Italian decor, soft lighting, and cozy seating made for a perfect setting for our family dinner. It struck a balance between sophistication and comfort, which we truly appreciated.\n\n**Food:** Now, let's talk about the star of the show \u2013 the food. Cacio e Pepe takes Italian cuisine to a whole new level. We started with their bruschetta, which was bursting with flavor and a perfect way to kick off our meal. The pasta dishes were a highlight, and it's no surprise considering the restaurant's name translates to \"cheese and pepper.\" Their Cacio e Pepe pasta lived up to its reputation, with al dente pasta coated in a creamy pecorino and black pepper sauce. Each bite was a burst of cheesy, peppery goodness.\n\n**Wine Selection:** The addition of an extensive wine menu was a delightful surprise. We paired our meal with a recommended red wine, which complemented the flavors of our dishes perfectly. It's evident that the restaurant takes pride in curating a diverse and complementary wine list.\n\n**Overall:** Our visit to Cacio e Pepe was nothing short of fantastic. The combination of delectable Italian cuisine, a cozy ambiance, and a well-curated wine selection made for a memorable evening. It's safe to say that we'll be returning to savor more of their culinary delights.\n\nIf you're in the Hillview area, (nearest Mrt is DT3 Hillview Mrt), and craving authentic Italian flavors in a charming setting, Cacio e Pepe is a must-visit. It's an experience that will leave your taste buds dancing and your heart content.\n\nAbsolutely delicious pastas here! Highly recommend the gnocchi and tagliatelle al tartufo. The tomato sauce of the gnocchi was refreshing while the truffle paste sauce was creamy but light, and very flavorful. I will love to come back and try the other dishes.\n\nA very busy restaurant on a Saturday night. As I had no reservation, I was given the last available table at the back outside. There was the drain smell that made it not the most pleasant environment to be in for long. Definitely good to make a booking in advance.\n",

Amano's does great pizzas which are generously sized with a nice crunchy crust and fluffy dough.\nThe rocket and prosciutto pizza is reliably good. Prawn and bacon was also excellent.\nLook out for their weekday promos which are an exceptional deal for the taste and quality of the food.\nStaff were polite and kept our water glasses topped up.\nGood place for a nice and laid-back weeknight dinner.\nParking can be tricky since it's in a residential area, but normally don't have to walk too far to get one one weekdays.\nI find the tiramisu a tad cloying on the sweetness, would give other options a go next visit.\n\nAs this place is quite hidden amongst the private estate enclave, there is little crowd and no need for reservations (even on Friday evening).\nDecent Italian food with oven baked pizza! The best dish was the seafood risotto! Yummy!\n\nAmano is probably one of the best kept secrets for those looking for budget (relative to the usually more upscale options) Italian food. One of the main reasons for this is its location - it is located deep inside a private estate at a standalone row of shophouses. Unless you drive, you'll probably have to do a fair bit of walking to reach it. If you drive though, you can park for free along the road just outside. The food itself is really nice, especially the pastas and pizzas. Despite being a relatively small joint, they do have one of those huge traditional pizza ovens and I understand that their dough is made in-house. Can't comment on the other types of dishes on the menu but the pastas and pizzas are generally a safe bet. Do not that the pizzas are huge so you can definitely share one among two, or even three persons! The place itself is usually empty so you can just pop by and eat without too much fuss. Strongly recommend if you're willing to travel abit!\n\nA hidden gem in the middle of a neighborhood. Only way to get there is to drive.\n\nFood in general is a good variety and decent quality. Prices are much friendlier than the other Italian restaurants in the Bukit Timah area. And service has been excellent.\n\nDinner for 3: Had 2 starters (burrata/ prosciutto platter and bread basket), 3 mains (1 pizza, 1 seafood pasta and 1 lamb gnocci), 2 glasses of wine.\n\nEnjoyed the food, though I thought the gnocci was a bit too salty - probably won't get 2 tomato based ones next time. Whilst generous with the cheese on the Pizza, I reckon the restaurant can do better with a better selection of parmesean topping for pastas.\n",

The fish itself is roasted very well and also love the layered potatoes.\n\nOverall, felt that it was Italian cuisine tailored to the Singaporean palate. Also, the restaurant is understaffed, there was only two service-crew serving everyone. Atmosphere-wise, it\u2019s on the top  level of the hotel but there\u2019s no views of anything. It was basically a poolside restaurant with the occasional crying / screaming of kids and babies in the pool.\n\nWould only recommend if you are hotel guest or looking for a casual restaurant in the area.\n\nWhen you're looking for a less crowded Italian restaurant on Orchard Road, this is a good place to hide. Nice small restaurant, located on the Rooftop of Voco Hotel. The food is good, but it could be better. Service staff were wonderful and knowledgeable of the menu.\n\nI\u2019ve visited with my mom during singapore trip. They served great dishes. I especially recommend Truffle Burrata Cheese Pizza. The staff who is Korean guy is very kind and professional. We had a good moment because of him. I want to thank you to he and rest of all staffs.\n\nLove the ambience of this roof top bar as well as the service received!\n\nThank you Cai Ying, Jeremy and Owen for the exceptional services during my dinner at il Cielo, thank you for making it easy and enjoyable for me and my 5 year old son.\n\nSpecial mention to Cai Ying, who was especially attentive to all my needs and food recommendations were superb (look at the photos!)\n\nOf course, thank you to Chef Marco and Chef Beh Li for making my foodie son crave for the food even more after we left the restaurant.\n\nWould definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who is looking to have a quiet evening with pool and view of Orchard!\n\nDo try the Burrata Purgilese and the Tiramisu! These 2 are my favourites!\n\nI had a really lovely lunch with my family. It was a special occasion to celebrate and the food and service was excellent (the pool view is great as well). The staff Owen made our day and we genuinely enjoyed our time there. Thanks team!!\n",

We decided on a mexican fiesta and as such, popped in for a quick fix and to our delightful surprise, we were not at all disappointed.\n\nMy dish was about $19 before GST. It was fried chicken with loads of tomato sauce on it, with cilantro rice and nachos on the side. My friends had nachos and enchiladas. The flavours were good and the cilantro rice was so yummy. They didn\u2019t skimp on the cilantro and the rice was cooked to perfection, every rice with that intense cilantro flavour. My chicken was fried to perfection, and it was juicy and moist. The serving size is generous for what you\u2019re paying.\n\nThe restaurant service was attentive, and I loved that they provided free iced water to patrons. Such should be the standard of more restaurants in Singapore.\n\nThe decor was quaint and cute.\n\nAbsolutely love the Mexican food here especially the Soup with the fresh seafood in it had the nachos with pulled pork which was amazing the enchiladas filled with beef and the set with taco and enchilada with beans on the side I added guacamole as well which was great! Definitely would recommend this! Though service is sometimes quite slow it\u2019s still quite worth while\n\nI don't eat much mexican, but I really enjoyed my dinner here. Was difficult to choose from the menu but thankfully the staff were very helpful with their recommendations.\n\nThe spring roll thingy was amazing, way better than it looks.\nI didn't know nachos can be served like that, the pulled pork one was good but wish there was more meat.\nBeef quesadilla was really good too, altho it looked really flat and sad, but it was actually very flavourful and filling.\nFish tacos tasted quite interesting, I actually couldn't taste the fish at all which is a good thing.\n\nOh and I love the guacamole and tomatoes and salsa ~\n\nThe downside is all the quesadilla/taco/XXX all looked and tasted very similar.\n\nBut yea would come visit again! It tastes quite wholesome!\n\nI am a frequent customer and have been ordering from them for a couple of years. No longer in the future as there was a cockroach wrapped in my burrito. I have reported them to the food agency.\n\nIt\u2019s been many years since I\u2019ve last been here. It\u2019s a long standing establishment and the food did not fail me.\nOrdered the pi\u00f1atas, chimichanga and calamari. Food was served fast and the server was very friendly.\nAll the food ordered were tasty, filling and authentic. I\u2019ll be back to explore the menu more.\n",

Quesadillas were delicious but the dips were too small. Beer selection is limited though.  The fried chicken wings were crunchy and went well with beers.\nGood crowd even on weekdays.  Both indoor and outdoor dining areas are available.\n\nQuite a famous place in Arab street with a long stretch outlet. Food is pretty good, drinks are good, price is pretty alright. Probably recommended for family during noon and early evening. Place has the vibes for friends and couple during dinner time and late evening. Their tacos is really good. Plenty of tables to sit and they have indoor and outdoor seats. Worth the try in a famous place as such.\n\nGreat ambient, the decorations and music.\nWe were 7 of us there on national day for dinner, ordered quite a lot of different kind of tapas and main course.\n\nThe portions were all quite large, the mozzarella cheese stick was so tasty, the pepper was too spicy somehow. The tacos with hard shell was crispy and I love the full loaded vegetables and meat perfectly with the sauces. Grilled chicken chop was well prepared, juicy and tender.\n\nFlan is different then what we have in kopitiam, this texture of flan was not smooth or silk.  Not recommend to order ice cream as it taste so cheap..\n\nFantastic hard shell tacos, freshly smashed guacamole right at your table. Burger is juicy and my kid says, flavourful.\n\nThey even helped light a candle on the dessert for my kid's birthday.\n\nOne of my all time fav Mexican bar. The great vibe hasn't change. Colorful, lively, vibrant.\n\nGreat service too from the team especially Sunil. Thoroughly friendly and super helpful.\n",

A very nice place with tables that have enough room between them and all families n friends can have their lovely time without disturbing any other tables!\n\nAbsolutely fantastic...Margaritas at Dempsey Hill in Singapore is a Fabulous culinary destination.\nThe ambience and setting is beautiful with the wonderful Dempsey hill mini fountains at the exterior and the classy interior finish\nThe service was attentive and highly efficient\nThe food was just wonderful. Mexican Cuisine never tasted this good with each item presented beautifully and tasting just right.\nA must visit place in Singapore\n\nCocktails a must in Margarita\u2019s! All good ordered was yums! The beef for fajitas was done just right. Definitely a must come back.\n\nMargarita's seems to have been at Dempsey Hill forever.\n\nThis is a restaurant that survived covid and has continued to thrive. Obviously, there are reasons for this.\n\n1. The food has never let me down each time I have come here either with family or friends. The food is freshly made and always tastes great. The sauces are also made freshly. All this effort is clearly reflected in the taste. Portions are large and generous as well.\n\n2. The service is attentive. There are always enough staff around so you can get their attention when you want it.\n\n3. There is a comforting ambience about this place. The restaurant is large, so there is a good feeling of being in a nice, large, well-decorated and well-maintained restaurant.\n\nAlthough they charge $1 for packing the leftovers to go, they do a meticulous job with it. All the sauces are put into separate containers, different components like the meat is packed separately from the tortilla wraps.\n\nThis restaurant meets you at the right level at every point where you need them. Definitely one to revisit again and again.\n\nFood was nice and a decent quantity. Don\u2019t expect to be transported to Mexico but it\u2019s good enough. If you can, go for the Carne Asada over the Fajitas. You do get Ribeye and more meat for the higher price. Worth it!\nMaybe skip the desserts though \ud83d\ude05\n",

                  "reviews": "\n\nCame here with colleagues on a Thursday night and it was quite crowded, luckily we made reservations beforehand. The table we were shown to had these weird pipes at the sides, so because we were a party of 5 people, the 5th person (me) had to either sit awkwardly at the end with the pipes blocking my legs, or squeeze together with 2 other people on one side. I chose the latter.\n\nWe ordered a few variety of tacos, wings, and drinks to go along with them. All were decent and they came out relatively quickly too. It was however, really noisy as there were large groups of friends and office workers (10+ people in a group) so it could be hard to speak above the noise. The staff was attentive and professional so that was good. All in all, this is a decent place to head to after work, but if you are looking for a nice quiet place to chill, this might not be the most ideal spot.\n\nGood ambience, with attentive & polite staffs. We had a reservation at a Friday night, yet it\u2019s isn\u2019t too crowded. They offered complimentary nachos which tasted great.\n\nThe kimchi fries tasted good too as it\u2019s filled with generous toppings. However, the tacos were bland and doesn\u2019t tasted too cohesive together, which is such a shame. Frozen lime margarita is enough for 2, which is a huge plus point!\n\nOverall it\u2019s food it\u2019s mediocre for its price-point.\n\nThe flavor of the Mexican Korean fusion dishes are delicious, although the service and ambiance leave much to be desired.\nThe seating is uncomfortable, and the small table struggled to hold all the food we ordered. Unfortunately, when we voiced our concerns to the owner, it seemed like they didn't really care. This might be my first and last visit there.\n\nReally chill place to hangout and have a meal. Waitress came by my table at least 6 times to ask if we needed anything else. That\u2019s rare by Spore standard.\n\nFood was amazing! The chips are fried fresh and the serving sizing is huge! Go for the Taco, Burrito and Quesadillas! A+++++ Well done and deserve my 5 stars rating, we will be back!\n\nVisited this place several times before and always enjoyed myself very much! Absolutely love the friendly staff and chill vibes this place offers :) This time, managed to reach in time for their happy hour (Tues - Fri; 5pm - 7pm) and ordered their medium classic margarita. The drinks were amazing and doesnt taste diluted at all~ the tacos and quesadillas were both rly flavourful and greatly satisfied my mexican food cravings :) The food and drinks were served really fast as well. Highly recommend!\n",

The breakfast burrito is great if you love sweet and savoury flavour combos as it comes with a syrup dip to have with it! Ambience is nice and casual, staff are always cheerful.\n\nHaven\u2019t tried many Mexican cafe/restaurants around but this was pretty good!\n\nHeard that they have  just rolled out new additions to its All-Day Menu as well as a brand-new Brunch Menu.\n\nHere\u2019s what we tried for their All-Day Menu:\n\ud83c\udf64 Fried Shrimp Tacos\nA crispy, zesty delight!\n\ud83c\udf5c Birria Ramen\nThe ramen was rich with a savory, spicy, sweet, sour, smokey and unique Mexican flavor.\u00a0Imagine tasty cooked beef shreds and the birria consomm\u00e9 which is a rich stew with flavors of chillies, adobo, herbs and spices dressing up cooked noodles. As simple as this sounds, it\u2019s also just luscious! You can\u2019t miss it!\n\ud83e\udd64 Milkshakes\nAvailable in Vanilla, Chocolate, Strawberry\n\ud83c\udf69 Churros\nWith White Choc or Strawberry Choc sauce\n\nWe tried some brunch menu items as well:\n\ud83c\udf73 Huevos Rancheros\nThis is a big hearty breakfast that\u2019s packs with loads of nutritious goodness! I myst say, it can get a tad messy to eat, but hey, that's the charm of a true Mexican meal \u2013 messy, delicious, and satisfying!\n\ud83e\udd69 Country Fried Steak with Mashed Potatoes & Gravy\nComfort food at its finest.\n\ud83e\udd5e Buttermilk Pancakes with Maple Syrup\nFluffy stacks of pure joy.\n\nProbably one of the best casual Mexican food joints in Singapore. Really up there on top of my list. The place is small and could be crowded during peak hours, but the location is not near public transpo - so it\u2019s not that packed quite often.\n\nThe food is top notch; I especially recommend their burritos and buffalo wings. One thing to take note of is that they offer a unique selection of beverages which are quite good, so if you\u2019re not adventurous and the type that sticks with the usual soda maybe you should bring yours.\n\nWe tend to always overindulge at this place, but on an average it\u2019ll cost you around $15-20 per person at Muchachos.\n\nGreat Mexican flavours in Downtown Singapore.  Tried tortilla chips and tacos. Got the soft one, not sure if hard tacos is available. The vegetarian option has only two possibilities: pepper, onions and tofu. Prefer to have more options. But the food was really good\n\nVery big portions. Good flavours, meat well cooked, fries crispy. Lacks something fresh light or crunchy. Every dish very heavy.\n",

We loved the Angus cheeseburger and quesidilla especially..Nice place to chill and hang out.. =)\n\nAbove average food. We tried the beef taco, fish taco and the chicken quesadilla. Of the three, fish taco is perhaps the best choice. Drinks were generally better than the food, had both the margarita and the frozen one. Will I be back? Probably, not that many fantastic Mexican places in Singapore\n\nThis place didn\u2019t disappoint! The fish tacos were bomb!!! Super crispy and fresh. Each taco set me back by $10, but I guess I\u2019m gradually resigning myself to the fact that tacos are exorbitant in Singapore\u2026) looking forward to trying the carne asada bowl and tacos next time, plus more servings of fish tacos for sure, and maybe some cocktails to spice up a future evening \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc\n\nDiscovered this gem whilst searching for dinner spots in Little India. Their warmth and hospitality were amazing from the moment we were seated. Khal, our server, did us good by recommending the fish tacos and chicken quesadillas\u2026these were bomb and so were the cocktails mixed by Razi. We are so happy we found this place and will be coming back again for the great food and friendly service! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\n\nThe food tastes really good. Cravings satisfied.\nFood ordered:\nChimichanga, nachos, burritos, soft tacos, mojito and churros.\nThe service was excellent. In our one year stay in SG, all the restaurants we have visited. This is by far the best service we have had. The servers are very attentive and proactive.\nThe place matches the vibe and the food.\n",

On a Sunday it was quiet and we had booked a table outside overlooking the Marina.\nIt is recommended to visit during sunset, there is a refreshing breeze and slowly the marina lights up all happy and colourful - a perfect way to gear up for the new week.\nWe were served by Danial. He gave some unbiased suggestions highlighting what he likes and why and some other items why his colleagues like\n\nBased on that we ordered\nA Bottle of Pineapple and Calamani Margarita - It was light & refreshing\nTrotilla chips with salsa roja\n\nFor the main course we had\nWagyu Steak - juicy bite sized on a taco\nBeef Quesadilla - quite tasty\n\nThis should have been enough for dinner but for us it was not complete without a dessert so we indulged in\nChocolate Lava - as mentioned by Danial, the Mint ice cream and choco-lava cake made a super combo.\nPanna Cotta - personally I liked this the best. The tang of lemon sorbet balanced the sweet Oaxaca cheese topped with the crunch of pistachio crumble. This is an item to return for.\nThanks Super Loco\n\nDon\u2019t be surprised by my 5 STAR ratings\ud83e\udd23 I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s not because of my birthday\ud83c\udf1d\n\nSo I celebrated my birthday at this restaurant and it was on a Saturday\ud83d\ude0a I love went to other restaurant before but not this location. The VIEW is superb even at 6pm(before sunset)\n\nI ordered Chefs Recommendation $48/6 dishes.. I would say the portion is not too much and just nice for my appetite\u2026 So, as I put in the reservation remark column, they gave me a hat that night with a complimentary citrusy shots\ud83e\udd23 Ok, it\u2019s a bonus drink, what do you expect? A glass of beer or wine? \ud83e\udd23\n\nSo.. If you like to enjoy beautiful view with nice Mexican food, you should consider here and make your reservation early at least a week before your selected date\ud83d\ude09\n\nAbsolutely delicious and satisfying Mexican fare in a chill, laid-back setting by the Bay. No complaints and would definitely return! The chips and dips are a must-order!!\n\nDropped in just before last call for orders at 9pm on a weekend, but the staff were friendly and helpful even though we were latecomers. We ordered a selection of tacos, tostados, the nacho chips and a salad - everything was served very quickly, tasted fresh, balanced, overall just really delicious.\n\nThe nacho chips with the range of dips was probably the star of the night. It\u2019s usually a starter that I take for granted but the sauces here pack a punch - so so good and deceivingly simple-looking. I may not be a regular diner at Mexican restaurants but I\u2019d imagine that it would be hard to top this off. Can\u2019t wait to go back!\n\nWe got an outdoor seat beside the Bay Area with the backdrop Marina Bay Sands.\nThe view was awesome, there were a lot of people gathering around the area just to take photos in the evening.\n\nEverything we ordered tasted fantastic, and the plating was colourful. The service was warm, friendly and attentive. It rained halfway and Solihin quickly relocated us indoor, and offered to leave the door open so we can enjoy the view, until the rain got heavier.\n\nOverall, it was a unique and warm five star experience!\n",

                  "reviews": "\n\nMy team mates organise this dinner session and it was my first time having Mexican food.\n\nWe had fish taco, potatoes and beef taco (not sure what is the dishes names). I also thought taco is crispy type but it is pretty similar to peking duck wrap that I am familiar with.\n\nIt was a new experience and I enjoyed it.\n\nI understand the restaurant is pretty popular so reservation is needed. The restaurant ambient is nice too.\n\nVery good Mexican restaurant (and it is my favorite food in the world). The cocktails are well balanced and they are able to go off menu. The food is great, and the wood grill is bringing good flavor. Negative points: Cocktails are a bit pricey\n\nEvery single dish that we ordered tasted sooooo good. Tlayuda de la Casa was something super unique which I have been eyeing on ever since I found out about this restaurant and wasn\u2019t sure which one it was in the menu but the wait staff was super helpful and recommended that we add the lobster meat. It was sweet and savory in all the right balance.\n\nWe managed to make it early for the happy hour which has tacos and drinks. However, we ended up in the first dinner seating and couldn\u2019t keep the table past 8pm and we had to pack most of our food to go\u2026\n\nFood was impeccable, as much as the service was great, we believe that it could be better since there was a hefty price tag to this restaurant.\n\nNixta. Coming from the word \"nixtamalization\", a process by which maize/corn is processed by an alkaline solution. #TIL.\n\nWhat can I say? The food here is pretty good but make sure you wallets are thick. Best dish is the Tlayuda de la Casa, a crunchy tortilla with corn all other ingredients. We opted for the additional lobster but the super sweet corn is all I can remember of this dish. The whole dish is just perfect.\n\nNext best is the giant churros. Amazing soft and hot churros topped with cinnamon sugar. The sauces were only a distraction.\n\nThe fingerlings cooked in duck fat were pretty good with the cheese and sour cream too. Duck and pork belly tacos were decent but the portions were kinda small. My other friends seemed to like the chicken. While I admit that it was pretty juicy and tender, I find it a bit too salty. Like salt baked chicken.\n\nService staff were very competent and friendly. One of them even offered to help us take photos.\n\nWe did end up going elsewhere for more food.\n\nThis place has quite the star attraction \u2013 their grilled chicken. The catch? You're best off pre-ordering it, unless you fancy an hour of patient anticipation. We opted for half a savory grilled chicken and also ventured into Tlayuda de la casa, a crispy tortilla dough creation reminiscent of a pizza, generously topped with corn. To kick up the spice, we had to try their Seafood Cocktail Veracruz, a fiery, flavorful seafood soup. And for a sweet finale, we couldn't resist the Churros.\n\nBut here's the secret sauce: The Seafood Cocktail Veracruz is the real showstopper. It's so good that you'll find yourself dunking nearly everything in that soul-warming broth. As for Churros, they're an absolute must-order, arriving hot and crispy, a pure delight. The other menu items? Well, they don't quite hit the same high note, so you can safely skip those.\n\nFor anyone fortunate enough to find themselves in this neck of the woods, remember this golden rule: Always order the soup \u2013 it's the heart and soul of the experience! \ud83d\ude04\n",

It was full of meat, vegetables, sauce, and some chips on the side. I ordered takeaway and it was still in great condition to eat. I love coming to eat here as its menu is varied and all tasty, would recommend for sure.\n\nyummy food, really love their hard taco. service can be slow depending on the crowd, understandably so. They\u2019ve finally built a stand alone salsa station. i rate it Amazing out of good.\n\nThis is not the first time I requested a non given. My house doesn\u2019t have any now due to renovation etc please do not impose your idea on others about recycling etc we all have own timing. Not everyone is good with eating with hands!! Respect each other our own way of eating be it with fork knife or spoon n with hands. !! So am I suppose to eat like this 4 legged friend?????? So now I have to use the container cover to scoop my rice. How pathetic now?? My unit in mess due to renovation. U just making me more miserable!!!\n\nWide selection of food that's much to my liking, staff is friendly and helpful to assist in ordering. Very spacious, free and easy with cool music. Thanks!\n\nFriendly, energetic staff. Food is great. Easy go to choice when you can't decide. Super glad the self-serve condiments bar is back!\n",

Service is polite, food is slow but acceptable as we can understand there seems to be a shortage of manpower. Tacos need to improve as it\u2019s small and not crispy enough.\n\nNice spot for hang out with friends over cocktails and drinks while deludge over Mexican food.\n\nThe Food:\nQuite close to authentic Mexican cuisine, especially their tacos. It's a must try.\nThe beverages are amazing. Get those!!!\n\nServices:\nThe waiter who served me was subpar in services. Lack of patience and giving a feeling like we are wasting his time. But foods and beverages are served quick. So it deserves a star.\n\nAtmosphere:\nNice, cozy, chill and outdoor spot. Not noisy and great place to chat with friends. I only wish it open till late midnight haha\n\nThe ambience is fantastic, it\u2019s open air and you get a nice view of CHIJMES. The food is great, but slightly different to what we had before. The quesadillas now have bell peppers/capsicums in them which is a change. Salsa, chips and the guacamole were very tasty and actually worth buying as a whole side. Also the fly on the plate is just a picture.\n\nIt was a Tuesday afternoon and so grateful for the incredible staff to take our big request booking for lunch of 40 people in such a short time. Shout out to the lovely staff who served us and we had the best time! Great food too! We recommend and will be back!\n\nAuthentic Mexican food in Chijmes in a beautiful setting. There's a few vegetarian options (impossible taco, salad, vegetarian enchilada or quesadilla), but some favorite options are missing (no huitlacoche, taco de champignones, flor de calabaza, tamales). I assume the ingredients are hard to get.\nOutdoor seating in Chijmes is nice, with lots of space for kids to run around.\n",

Still, food tasted alright, but not something we'll deliberately come back for.\n\nThis is not air conditioned, hence you may want to consider other dinning options if you are planning to have a business meeting here.\n\nThe nachos is really good.\nHuge portioning and very generous with the amount of chicken and the toppings.\nThe topping is a mix with the meshed avocado and minced parsley leaves.\nWith chopped to cube size tomato, it\u2019s juiciness and sourness help to reduce the heaviness from the cheese.\nThe signature Chimichanga is very unique, especially the cheese is baked to able to stretch very long.\nSuper value for money\n\nNice outdoor area to R&R as the area not very big thus once got customers queuing, the staff will start to eye on those who hv been sitting too long.\n\nStaff didn't advise customers on paying bills as they take it for granted all on QR CODE. is my 1st time there so kind of not comfy with it, they wanted to clear the plates like chasing u off when I mentioned to diff staff to leave it here 1st as we r not done.\n\nBeer-battered fish tacos rocks!! The little mango cubes were very sweet and the texture was great! Highly recommend! You can skip the spicy mushroom tacos\u2026 only good part was the juicy mushrooms, nothing special.\nI have to say they were very generous with the avocado in the guac chips :> will come back again for their fish tacos!\n\nChimichanga is a fantastic restaurant that serves authentic Mexican cuisine and a variety of drinks. Living up to their name, the Chimichanga at this place is truly fantastic. The crispy, fried skin is perfection itself, and every bite is a burst of savory goodness.\n\nThe Ribeye steak was cooked to absolute perfection, and what's even better is that it's a great value for the price. Elotes (Grilled Corn) were fantastic the addictive aioli cheese made me finish it in less than a minute.\n\nThe fresh guacamole served here is a refreshing delight and pairs well with the other dishes. And to top it off, they offer a variety of interesting drinks, and I had the pleasure of trying a few during their happy hour (before 7 pm).\n",

Water is complimentary upon request. Service staff are smiley and are very efficient.\n\nThe pricing of each item is relatively high, but the portion size is pretty good and quite filling. A small basket of salsa and nachos are given as a complimentary entree as well.\n\n\ud83e\udd59 Chicken Enchiladas ($29)\nI really enjoyed the refried beans. Its thick, flavourful, and grainy. 2 Fried tortillas are stuffed with chicken and cheese, and slathered with the green tangy sauce, topped with a small scoop of guacamole and sour cream. A side of rice is also given. Halfway through I was already quite stuffed, but was so good I finished it. Slightly towards the heavy carb side. Would like it if more vegetables and chicken were given for this price.\nI rate: 4/5 \ud83c\udf1f\n\n\ud83e\udd59 Shrimp Chimichanga ($30)\nNever had deep fried burrito before but this was a really interesting mouthfeel of soft, mushy warm fillings and crunchy shrimps. There is also a side of rice for this. Slightly towards the heavy carb side. Would like it if more vegetables and shrimp were given for this price.\nI rate: 4/5 \ud83c\udf1f\n\nBack here for the 2nd time with the same clique. Tacos can\u2019t go wrong here; I especially loved the fried fish tacos. The quesadillas and burritos and the usual Mexican fare made us return for more.\n\nWe had a chocolate sauce chicken something, ordered by one of the more adventurous girls. It didn\u2019t gel with any of us. I never liked a sweet and savory mix, and this dish confused my palate. But hey, food is subjective so maybe it\u2019ll work for you!\n\nNot many people come here on a weekday lunch, I suppose they should have an affordable lunch set to make it more enticing.\nThere\u2019s plenty of indoor and outdoor seating. There\u2019s also a plate of complimentary nachos with salsa given to us when we settled down.\nWe tried the enchiladas and burrito. Both were tasty, including the olive rice served on the side. The filling was generous and for the enchiladas, it was a fried version of the burrito so it\u2019s crispy and yummy. We did not get to try the drinks this time so hope to go back again soon.\n\nGreat little Mexican restaurant with both inside and covered outdoor seating.\n\nThe food we ordered was delivered fast and efficiently.\n\nWe had the Chicken Fajitas, which had  a large portion of nicely seasoned chicken as well as grilled onions and peppers.  All served in a sizzling hot cast iron griddle. You can simply stir or leave the cooked onions and peppers if you desire a more cooked item.\n\nWe also ordered the Habenaro spiced chicken wings, which you can pick how hot you want them made.  I ordered them at a 5 out of 10 by recommendation of the server.  It was great advice, just hot enough to pit a nice burn to your lips.\n\nHad a pint of Guiness as well.\n\nGreat personable service.\nHighly recommend this location.\n\nPrices are a little higher than others, but the food was worth it.\n\nNice outdoor seating and good service. Hearty portion of Mexican food too. Tacos were yummy and chimichanga was stuffed with lots of tender and tasty lamb, recommended!\n",

Even had a few morsels of soft tendon. Comes with choice of tomato or brown rice, and 5 more toppings, like lettuce, cucumbers, jalape\u00f1os etc. Nicely wrapped and convenient to eat on the go.\n\nFirst time trying. I\u2019ve frequent many salad places, as I usually have salad for lunch. Daily cut, Haakon, Stuff\u2019d, Super Simple, Salad Stop to name a few. In terms of price point, I would say they are fair\u2026. But they really need to expand their selections for toppings. It\u2019s actually quite pathetic. They have such a small selection, and for items like shredded cheese and guacamole, customers still need to top up $1.50 and $2.50 respectively. I probably won\u2019t buy from this place again unless they really come out with more topping varieties.\n\nI have tried SaladStop! and The Daily Cut salad bowls. Superitto is by far the best in terms of quality of food and taste! Unfortunately, they only have 1 outlet in Paragon basement 1. I wish they have more outlets. They offer Salad bowl and Burrito wrap with a wide variety of cooked dishes and high-quality salad options to choose from. I love their olive oil salmon which cooked at the right temperature. Soft and moist in taste. Their stewed beef is juicy and tender. My other favorite is their tendered seaweed wrapped chicken. I think kids will love it! There are many more dishes. Thanks to Chef Andrew for dishing up delicious and healthy food. Well done man!\n\nI like the burrito place. Huge portions, very friendly staff who address all requests make the rating. Scrambled egg was given good portion while chicken which isn\u2019t good has also made half the bowl. Good selection of veggies is a good value. I asked for an extra tortilla which is also accepted by the staff made me so happy. Chicken should be cooked more.\n\nA more upmarket version of another more common burrito/ wraps shop. Quite a lot of choices. Meat was the chewy type. Not mince. Toppings portions were kinda small though. Taste wise - average.\n",

Ordered 2 burritos & in less than 5 mins, food was served! Food\u2019s great too - no compromise on quality with their efficient service. Just that space is a little small & once it gets crowded, it gets a little stuffy.\n\nGrilled chicken meat was tender and soft, added guacamole to my burrito bowl too, fresh and refreshing!

Plus the staff were just super nice - laid back but still attentive and kind. The tacos were fantastic: they pack a punch (the waiter wasn't kidding when he checked \"you're ok with spice, right?\") but they were delicious. It's not exactly cheap - 2x tacos were $14 and 3x for $18 but it felt worth it.\n\nHad the amazing Mexican dishes here.\nThe fried fish tacos is one of the best. Fish filet deep fried and covered with a thin layer of crispy skin, it was served still hot, so it\u2019s amazing.\nThe sauce of top is a little spicy with the mango dices, it gets a little sweet. Such an amazing combination.\nThe nachos is freshly baked with cheese and  fresh avocado.\nFresh churros are good, soft and crispy. Great chocolate sauce.\n\nSecond time back here because we love the food. So far, everything that we\u2019ve tried has been good. I especially recommend the loaded nachos. Good service from passionate owners.\n\nThe only downside was that we were placed at the bar seat which had very little leg room and counter space. The owner did ask if we were ok with it beforehand but in the future, I would opt for a table instead.\n\noverall, the flavours at huevos are great but most of its philosophy seems to be just spam a bunch of flavours- which leaves me overwhelmed. I can\u2019t actually taste the fish in the fish taco anymore, because of the intense flavours of every component.\n\n- cauliflower bites (wished they used bigger chunks so I could actually feel the bite of the cauliflower)\n- fish tacos\n- short rib tacos\n- mushroom & feta cheese tacos (not worth, but nice as a breakfast taco)\n\nI ate the birria tacos. Loaded nachos. Tortilla chips with salsas. Everything was on point. Especially the birria tacos. This is coming from a Mexican, San Diego California resident. These tacos are ON POINT. Just don\u2019t tell my mom I said that. \ud83d\ude02\nThe salsas are very fresh. The Yucat\u00e1n bottle hot sauce is pretty good too. To drink I\u2019ve got their cider which is very tasty not too strong. Their Horchata(rice milk) is very authentic as well. I still need to try their other tacos. I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019re really good. Make sure to have a reservation. If not, be prepared to wait. Just know, it\u2019ll be worth it!\n",

The food is amazing!\n\nRoast chicken: Mild spicy level, breast is slightly drier; would be better if they could make it more succulent & juicy.\n\nFish taco: personal favourite, love the tangy chilli mango salsa sauce.\n\nGood vibes, good food. Good ambience to have a fun time. Food wise, not bad. Roasted whole chicken is great. Their margaritas are not bad too. It\u2019s ice blended so pretty unique.  Would say though, price point pretty high for low income earners like me.\n\nDisco lights to turn on after the sun has set. If you or your friends birthday, can ask them sing happy birthday. They will stop the music and get all their staffs to sing for you. Plus, you get an Mexican hat.\n\nDropped by because the Korean BBQ places we wanted to go to were fully booked on a Friday night.\n\nDeep fried fish taco - 4.75 stars\nBest of the lot.\n\nGrilled barramundi taco - 3.5 stars\n\nCauliflower taco - 3.5 stars\n\nChicken - 4 stars\nGets spicier as you eat it.\n\nThe broccoli side for the chicken was raw. The other salad was average as well.\n\nThe rotisserie chicken was well marinated and the meat was tender and juicy.\nThe \u201cNot your average nacho\u201d was indeed special, the topping and dips went so well with the tortilla chips.\nThe dishes were a bit salty though.\n\nPretty packed on a Friday but we managed to get a seat without reservation.\n\nOverall, the fish tacos as other reviews were good. The nacho and chicken was average.\n\nThe main disappointment is the level of service seems lacking, and one particular server didn't look like he wants to be there, and it shows. We saw a group of diners behind us leave their table without ordering after no one attended to him for a while.\n\nFor the price point, I do expect a better level of service and food.\n",

On occasions, they've special dishes served.\n\nITS JUST AMAZING GOOD AND ALL GOOD!!\nTo me one of the best Japanese restaurant which is debatable but my own opinion.\nLunch time was a lot of people and its just crowded\nBut the food amend everything\nFor those who haven eat must eat\nDefinitely must come and try it once!!\nPrice : $$/$$$$$\nprice wise not too bad, quite reasonable for a family meal which is more worth it.\n\nSushi Tei at Thomson Plaza offers a delightful Japanese dining experience. The restaurant has a warm ambiance with traditional Japanese decoration. Their sushi is fresh and skillfully made, and they have a variety of other tasty Japanese dishes. The service is attentive, but it can get busy during peak hours. Overall, it's a must-visit place for those who enjoy Japanese cuisine in Thomson Plaza.\n\nServers very kind kept trying to fill my cup with green tea. \ud83d\ude02\n\nThe freshness and the taste was acceptable. Pricey a little 113 for two adults one child.\n\nHowever what makes it nice is the speed of the food. Like machine gun service. \ud83d\ude02 the dishes were flying out fast.\n\nThe rest of the dishes were acceptable nothing to complain about. Quite standard Japanese flavour and fare here. If you\u2019re looking at omasake level this is m barely half the fineness. \ud83d\ude02\n\nThe desserts were a little too normal for the price. The red bean wasn\u2019t very tasty and the beans were a little hard. Soup was quite plain and sugared. The rest are standard quite similar to ichiban boshi.\n\nA little disappointed for the price but can\u2019t fault the speed and the overall quality which is palatable. See the pics. You\u2019re paying for the decor as well. \ud83d\ude02\n\nI find their consistency over so many outlets and so many years, quite impressive. They very seldom disappoint.\nOnly sad thing is the portions have shrunk and the prices have risen.\n\nPlace was clean and we got a good seating. Ordered the scallops ramen, salmon aburi and cold soba noodles with tempura.\n\nThe ramen.. seriously tasted like the Maggi instant noodles I cook. Add an egg. Exactly the same. I was so disappointed. That was my main course. The broth and the texture of the noodles = Maggi instant noodles chicken flavour.\n\nSoba noodles texture was of lower quality and the dip was too dilute.\nSalmon aburi was of standard but still I can\u2019t bring myself to give 2 stars instead of 1. Think I\u2019ll not visit Sushi Tei for awhile now.\n",

We got a nice table for 4 at the entrance.\n\nWould come back again.\n\nthe last time i came, the slices were huge and also very fresh. they also gave free ice cream during birthday which was awesome. disclaimer: sometimes the sashimi slices are thinner and not that fresh. but the service staff are attentive and kept refilling the green tea\n\nNice cosy Japanese restaurant with friendly and prompt service. The food is nice and enjoyable. Ambience is cosy and relax. A break from the congested city restaurant as it is tuck in a shophouse in the middle of residential and industrial  area. Price wise a bit on high but justifiable with the ingredients, food quality and service. Overall a enjoyable dining experience. A nice treasure.\n\nNov 2022\n\nExceptional quality for the price. Fresh sashimi & tasty cooked dishes. Throw in good service making this a no-brainer for Japanese cuisine at reasonable price.\n\nUPDATE - Feb 2023\nCome again for dinner. The thick cut toro is ok but I have had better. The Saury fish (not in season, so frozen) is perfectly acceptable. Smoked duck with mushroom tastes really good. Tofu salad and cod fish hotpot are not bad either.\n\nOur family always love Japanese Cuisine and Hubby brought us here as he heard the reviews are good.\n\nWe ordered Kurobuta Don, Chirashi Don, Chirashi Salmon Steak and Chicken Terikyaki Set. The sashimi is fresh and the kurobuta is delicious!

There is 5 pieces of chashu and all of it was so tender and good. The chashu ramen broth was very light but packed a nice subtle flavour to complement. Waiters were also very friendly.

Katsu-don is ok.\n\nOverall no frills.\n\nFinally came here one day after walking past it many times. This unassuming place serves up homely and good quality Japanese food!\n\nOverall, the quality of food is very high.

The outlet has limited seatings, tables are small and there is only few tables for group > 3.\n\nGood quality not bad, quantity more for Primary School kids, can't tell the size from menu picture. Cooking staff seems very unfriendly, there's a customer who spilled the soup over himself and when he requested for serviette, the table staff asked cooking staff to past customer and heard him saying \"then no need cook liao arh\". \ud83d\ude05\n\nThe lobster don  and salmon aburi don is delicious. Can choose add on of $3 - cones with drinks, choice of salad or miso soup  while the $6 add on cones with drinks and either chawan mushi, kareage or hokkaido cream croquette.\n\nA far cry from the standard and quality of their sister restaurant. Granted it is the budget friendly version but for the nominal price difference, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth the while. A big step down in authenticity of taste.\n\n$10.90 - Aburi Salmon Mentai Don\n$11.90 - Ebi Fried White Curry Rice\n\nThis place is opened by sushi tei which is next door. Both our dishes were pretty tasty and the rice was actually really good, though you can tell the salmon wasn't really the high grade sort. However at these prices, you can't really complain.\n\nI'd recommend this place for a quick tasty non traditional Japanese meal, like aburi/truffle/mentaiko stuff.\n",

Would recommend ama ebi and udon (without orange slices on top, unless you want an orange herbal taste) the tempura is also delicious along with the tori karaage.\n\nUsed to dine in there and I love the Chirashi. Decided to do take away today. For $16 hotate sashimi and $19 maguro , you can do better in terms of serving and quality. Hotate was thinly sliced and maguro was really fishy. I don\u2019t mind paying for the food but your price and quality must be at least in line with what you are charging.\n\nEverything was amazing, from the chef's friendliness to the waiter's/waitresses' attending. Very satisfied with Ken's cooking and amazing vibes all around. Friendly atmosphere and very fresh ingredients/drinks. Highly recommended.\n\nCozy little space in a convenient mall. My 10 year old enjoyed her tonkatsu ramen whilst my 7 year old loved his salmon ikura don so much he ordered 2 portions but predictably ate only 1 spoonful from the second bowl before declaring he was too full so I ate that up for him. In addition, the kids had a plate of gyoza each as well, and I quite enjoyed the chawanmushi.\n\nGood drinks, great people and excellent food. The Salmon Sashimi is really fresh. Chefs here are really creative too. Please come and try!\n\nShoutout to Arlene the waitress, Ken and Andy the chefs for making the place my go to.\n",

Dessert was probably the best out of everything, one or two pieces of sushi can be considered decent too.\nStaff told us place was packed and didn\u2019t give us really good seats but place had plenty of empty seats. When explaining the dishes, the staff just mumbled through quickly to get it over and done with.\n\nCame here on a Sunday afternoon to try the $58 omakase. Food was overall pretty decent - nothing mind blowing, but it was a pleasant meal. I only feel like the miso soup, dessert and lobster could be improved.\n\nLobster was clearly frozen and not the freshest because it was pretty dry and tough, and the miso soup was just very very normal like packet miso. Dessert tasted like an odd slightly watery mash of jelly and cheesecake. Sushi and sashimi were good.\n\nWasn't crowded and ambience was nice.\n\nDecent and chill place to have omakase. You get the food but not the typical omakase experience.\nNonetheless a more than decent dinner \ud83d\udc4c\n\n*Note, the beef in the 58++ omakase menu can be changed to a salted egg chicken\n\nNot really like Japen style, the food just normal but the service I feel good.\nWe order the $58 and $88 and the drink is sake. But for food I feel not really fresh\u2026.. especially seafood. So that\u2019s why I feel so so. I think the price I can eat better at other restaurants. \u256e(\u256f\u25bd\u2570)\u256d\n\nNice !

                  "reviews": "\n\nFood is superb. Every item is good. Sashimi is fresh. I highly recommend the grilled tiger prawns and prawn miso omelette. The grilled prawns here are the best I've ever had at a buffet. Perfectly seasoned and grilled.\n\nService is good too. They promptly top up your iced green tea.\n\nFor a Japanese restaurant offering a buffet lunch at around $50 per person including GST and service charge, it sounds like a fair deal. The quality of fresh sashimi is commendable, although the slices is a bit small. The presence of a varied selection of sake adds to the experience, catering to aficionados of Japanese beverages.\n\nThe ambiance, while small, seems to create a pleasant dining atmosphere, enhancing the overall experience. The friendliness of the staff is always a plus, contributing to a welcoming environment.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that additional charges for ice cream and green tea might catch some diners off guard, potentially affecting the perceived value of the meal. Overall, it seems like a decent choice for those seeking a reasonably priced Japanese buffet with fresh offerings and a cozy setting, despite minor considerations about Sashimi slice sizes and extra charges for certain items.\n\nCosy little restaurant in the quiet neighbourhood of Greenwood. Took my friend here for her birthday celebration and we were delighted with the affordable a la carte buffet dishes, especially the beef cubes and prawn tempura. The sashimi was quite nice. Lovely staff members who were very sweet throughout our meal. Will definitely plan a revisit.\n\nI know and visit this place since 15 Years. One of the best all you can eat sushi place in town. Amazing food, prices are very decent and Gary is just awesome. The sashimi, wafu steak and the yuzu ice cream are the highlights for me.\n\nDined in for dinner on a Wednesday night. Food was admittedly fresh and sashimi quality was good. However, the price performance ratio and the selection of food availabile were significantly inferior compared to Shin Yuu's competitors e.g., Mitsuba, Ikoi, Himawari or Irodori restaurants. $59.90++ for dinner amounted to about $72 per pax for the meal.\n\nDefinitely not worth it for the money spent. Will not return. Not recommended.\n",

Not only that, the food does not taste good at all. I remember the restaurant in its prime time with queue waiting for a table. Now the whole situation reversed. Disappointed with it.\n\nService is still good.\n\nJust had a weekend lunch at Watami Junction 8, nice that it is not too crowded and the service was good. Food wise I would say it is average because my tempura is oily, the beef hot pot with spicy miso was okay. The chocolate lava cake is a bit over done and the cut open the chocolate inside does not flow out which is a bit disappointing. Well the overall meal is a good value for money but do expect the quality to be a bit inferior to other Japanese restaurants.\n\nFirst time trying this, and was surprised at the affordability and the quality of the food. Noticed this for some time but never stepped in as I thought it was going to be pricey, but we ended up spending less than $20/pax.\n\nOrdered the seafood hotpot as well as the set items (chawanmushi, apple and udon/soba) and they were tasty! They have a pretty wide range of food items on the menu - including sushi, noodles, rice, sashimi etc.\n\nQueue was pretty fast - the sign said waiting time was 15-55 minutes, but I got in within 5 minutes. Food also came pretty quickly - served within 15 minutes.\n\nI will likely return again the next time I want Japanese food.\n\nOrdered 3 pax set, a bit too much for 3, we left some foods. Love the salad with pumpkin slices especially. Forgot to take pictures of the rest, tempura, salad, beef rice with egg, fish. Membership discount 10%.\n\nCame here for dinner. Food is good for 3 pax.

Decorated with lights, the restaurant looked really pretty when the sun went down. Like what many others have shared, the price point of the food here is definitely on the higher side. However, the food tastes authentic and there\u2019re other items on the menu we would like to try, so we would be back with our wallets ready the next time!!\n\nP.S. the outdoor area of Toriyard is also pet friendly!! So you can def grab an oishi dinner after walking your furry friend at the park.\n\nFollow us on IG @toofoodtomiss for more foodie content!\n\nWe hosted our son\u2019s birthday here as it was in the theme of a Japanese anime. The service Kevin (restaurant director) and his crew provided meticulous attention to our needs and the setup of the place was brilliant. Kevin saw that we were trying to stick a banner on the glass and he immediately ask his staff to clean the glass panel for us so that there will be no dust marks during photo taking. He and his crew are extra attentive to our elderly guests which makes its welcoming. Experiences like that should not be taken for granted, they really put in effort to help us create an amazing memory. I will definitely come back for regular meals and perhaps the next event. Thank you Toriyard (especially Kevin)\n\nThe food was fine. Prices are on a high side, but since there was only a limited selection at the park, we decided to have dinner here. Nothing special and paid $150+/- for 4 pax.\n\nNice restaurant situated within a nice park. A rustic yet classy ambience will suit any occasion, be it for a business lunch, romantic outing or just to meet up with friends. Food was authentic Japanese and of good quality.\n",

I feel that for $19, the collagen soup can do better with at least some ingredients in it. Condiments, the leek oil is flavourful. Nanbe chicken could do better with better frying of the batter. The dish tasted a little under fried and batter was soft.\n\nStaff used to be and could be more attentive. The broth was boiling away and they only adjusted the induction cooker upon request, twice. No one came to skim the floating fats off the soup or offer a sampling of it, which they used to do so. Also, there wasn\u2019t any personal touch to make you feel welcome whatsoever. It was a you say I do approach.\n\nYummy food! Recommend the tomato collagen soup, steamed chicken, vegetable platter, and spicy nanban chicken. Also love the condiments!\n\nThey provided us with complimentary jellies as well!\n\nVisited at about 730pm on a Friday night and shop was almost full, do come earlier! Tried both Original and Spicy, recommend to just get the Original! Spicy not as good.\n\nWe thought we ordered quite alot for 2 pax but it was actually just nice portion size. Meat was really good quality though was slightly expensive but totally worth it. $15 for US Beef (4 large pieces) and $12 for Chestnut Pork (7 slices). Theres a weekly promotion going on for different cut of meats too and no restrictions to the plates ordered too, do checkout their insta. Must also order their Fish Cakes!!! Omg I thought its just fish cake but noooo the texture and taste really different and yummy!!!\n\nVegetable and mushroom sets was quite well varied and very fresh & clean. Thin Tsuru Tsuru Noodles was meh\u2026 The sauces was surprisingly very unique and delish too, really liked the green paste (yuzu flavour) and spring onion with sesame oil dip.\n\nAt the end of the meal theres also jelly/agaragar served. Fantastic service too! Will be back again for the meats & fish cake!\n\nService was great and collagen soup was so thick and belly warming for a cold rainy day. The price however, is almost on par with HDL. No insane queues like HDL though!\n\nLove the collagen soup. At Tsukada Nojo, the vegetables are always farm fresh. The best part is the Australian beef. It has a strong beef flavour (which isn\u2019t for everyone). Best when undercooked in the broth (which I wouldn\u2019t recommend for everyone too). Just love the hotpot here.\n",

Wait time was pretty short, thanks to the service effectiveness despite the super high traffic on a Saturday night of Black Friday period. The food was so so good. Will come back when we come to Orchard malls.\n\nStaff - responsive, attentive and polite.\nFood - good. All good. Nothing to complain.\nPremise - maybe they are always busy for lunch but the twin seats are rather tight between each other.\n\nPortion of the food was OK I guess \ud83d\ude42\n\nOverall, happy tummies post meal.\n\nFood is generous and Tasty! My Favourite sushi place for sashimi. Although 3 slices but each slice are thick and fill my mouth. Great Service and ambience. Hidden at the corner in the mall at level 5. Highly recommended!\n\nThis restaurant serves a variety of decent Japanese dishes at a reasonable price.  From fresh sashimi to sushi, tempura to soba, you've got something for everyone.\n\nThey have good service and the quality of the food is above average.  It's a place we visit often when we are undecided for food choice in Taka.\n\nIf you don't mind a short queue at peak hours, this is a good place to try.\n\nOne of the better Japanese restaurants in town. Sashimi is always fresh and cut thickly, making the Kaisen Chirashi don an attractive and filling option. Squid is also grilled to perfection, leaving a slightly chewy yet palatable aftertaste when eaten with the teriyaki sauce. Salmon aburi soft shell crab roll is tasty, crunchy, and with a slight hint of savoury.\n",

The seafood is impeccably fresh, and you absolutely must indulge in their grilled hamachi and succulent oysters.\n\nDelicious Japanese food. Ordered a set of sashimi, bento, and a beef yuzu sauteed.\n\nSashimi was fresh, and almost all cuts of meat tasted rich and creamy. The swordfish was the standout fish.\n\nThe Natsu bento set came with a variety of side dishes. Tha beef yakiniku was well seasoned and well cooked, and the garlic fried rice was fragrant and not too salty.\n\nThe beef yuzu sauteed is an interesting dish to try, being served with a yuzu sorbet at the side. The beef was nicely cooked, and eaten with the yuzu sorbet creates an interesting flavour and sensation, fusing sweet, sour, and savoury, and balancing warm and cold.\n\nDefinitely coming back again for the dishes.\n\nWe had the Omakase set for 108 sgd per person -indeed very interesting,we loved especially the scallops ;too pricey though\n\nThe food is delicious and well cooked. Ordered the set as it is valued for money.\n\nBoth of the sets that i ordered had chawanmushi and it is so smooth and soft that it melt in the mouth.\n\nThe sashimi are thick and fresh.\n\nThe clam congee is pretty good and first time trying it.\n\nService wise is good! The staff pay lots of attention to details like placement of plate in the tray, clearing of stuff promptly and serving of desserts (fruit) without me asking for it.\n\nThe restaurant provides a good range of options. it has omakase, bento sets, sushi set, Nara House special dinner, ala carte (sushi, Don,soup, porridge\ud83c\udf72 teppanyaki.\n\nWe tried the following over 2 visits and our rating for each.\n\n1.

However the service staffed said that it was fully booked..?\n\nFood was not bad, we tried truffle beef Foie Gras don, sushi rolls, fried chicken and sashimi platter.\n\nSashimi platter was really fresh, all in good is a 8/10 but make sure you make a booking. We sat at the counter and it wasn\u2019t the best spot.\n\nThe oyster is a must have here. They are v fresh. I\u2019m not a oyster eater. But this place really make me ate 3 in one go.\n\nWagyu beef is on the tough side.\nPork bowl however is good. Nice and tender. The egg is cooked perfectly.\n\nWent there for Birthday celebrations and they gifted me a pretty good wine. Happy to bring my friends again for celebration. Yes they do check the ic for verification which is good for people who take advantage of the promotion.\n\nThe food is really good, fresh oyster ($3 each), good  foie gras ($12) , good salmon ($7 happy hour for 5 pieces) , happy hour beers ($11) , really worth the try for happy hour. Spacious seating both indoor and outdoor. Food is 5. Atmosphere is 5. Service is 3 cause the staffs are pretty inattentive and they are unsure of the dish recommendations and not service crew inside not really friendly or welcoming but the front service are friendly attentive and they welcome us and showed us to the table, after that it was pretty much we had to request for assistance. Overall 5 for the food the pricing the atmosphere, good place for couple and friends.\n\nTanuki Raw is the first place we think of when we want a good beef bowl. My favorite is their Foie Gras Truffle Yakiniku. The beef are always tender and succulent. The rice are richly seasoned with truffle, sesame and a perfectly cooked onsen egg. Not forgetting a glorious piece of foie gras as the main highlight of the meal! A perfect beef bowl I would say.\n\nStaff are always attentive and before you could reach out, they are there to help you with little things like an extra plate for your food, extra napkins or water.\n\nLove the cozy space restaurant space with nice modern music. A great place for dining alone, with family or friends.\n\nThe oysters during happy hours were great! Fresh and a little briny but the adductor muscle wasn't cut so needed to scrape a bit with the oyster fork. Salmon don was not bad but I preferred the vinegar rice rather than the seasoned mixed rice. Overall price and service was alright. Would recommend during happy hours.\n",

(@28++)\nThe Nikujaga is great: the beef is stewed perfectly, super tender and with great umami; the potato is also well softened and the whole dish is without any unpleasant odour. The chirashi don uses good quality sashimi and wasabi atop of the Japanese rice. The Aburi Salmon Oroshiponzu is with promo for autumn and the texture and freshness of the salmon is good. For the rest of the set such as miso soup and salad, they are well cooked. Overall, the taste is good and the Nikujaga hit my taste bud and elevates the whole level to great.\nThe service is good here thought waiting time a bit long. The facility a bit old but the atmosphere is great: many people enjoy their cosy chat with a cup of free of charge but free-flow tea in this\nJapan style restaurant.\n\nWe queue here for about 15 mins. After ordering, didn't have to wait that long for the food. Service was prompt and efficient. Maguro sashimi was cut a bit thin. So the satisfaction was not really there. The chirashi don has generous fillings of sashimi. The tonkatsu tuna steak with cheese was quite salty and heavy. I would not want to order this dish ever again. Tempura was done well.\n\nA few other outlets to this brand,and i feel that standards differ greatly,especially between this and their East Coast Outlet.\n\nHave eaten here at their novena outlet twice and both times we have come away very satisfied with their food as well as their exceptional service from their very friendly and attentive  ground staff, to their Japanese head chef who goes around from table to table ensuring that everything is going well for the diners. They even made sure to reserve a Kanpachi Shio fishhead for me when i called to enquire its availability,just in case it ran out before we arrived.\nHallmarks of a great sushi joint.\n\nTheir Kanpachi Kabuto Shioyaki (Greater Amberjack Grilled Salted Fish head), was superbly executed. Flesh was firm and flaky,and very fresh to the bite and mouthfeel. Hit the spot totally.\n\nThe Grilled Salmon Belly was super as well,3 pieces of perfectly grilled belly oozing with juices in its tender meat. Skin was crispy and crackling to the bite,perfect contrast.\n\nOf all the fish dishes ordered, the Shima Hokke (Grilled Atka Mackeral) looked good,but tasted pretty mediocre in the end. Think maybe its because its a pre-ordered and flash-frozen pre-marinated fish.\n\nDeep fried soft shell crab was good,but a bit on the saltier side. The California Maki Roll that we ordered as an afterthought though,was remarkable,hitting all the right spots in every way. Rice was soft and warm,ingredients were fresh and well-paired,and it didnt break apart most importantly,when we dipped it in soya sauce.\n\nAll in,kudos to this team at Novena,you guys have got it down pat. Well done!\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\n\nFood: 8.5/10\nAmbience: 9/10 (tables well spaced out,comfortable dining)\nService: 9/10\nValue For Money: 7.5/10\nMy Rating: 8.5/10\n\nI used to visit them regularly when I was working near Millenia Walk. Have been to this outlet less than 10 times.\n\nGood quality sushi at reasonable pricing. Standard of food has been consistent over the years.\n\nWe always enjoy their sets which offer amazing price-quality ratio for Singapore. Atmosphere is traditional Japanese but cosy. It can be very busy at times.\n",

We ordered the 12 sticks course and added a garlic rice. It was good. Watching the skewers being grilled over the charcoal reminded me of the yakitori restaurants in Japan!\n\nI wanted to take pic of the menu but was told by a server that it was not allowed. Other area of service was good and hence the 4-stars for service.\n\nAlways ended up ordering quite a bit whenever we patronise Nanbantei \ud83d\ude48\nFood quality's consistent and ingredients used were fresh.\nSkewers were yummy! I'm a fan of their Grilled Eggplant with Shiso \ud83e\udd24\n\nPrices have gone up a far bit though \ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8\n\nWe went to this restaurant for late lunch, arrive around 2 pm, we were reminded that the last order is 2:30 pm.\nWe ordered kurobuta don sets. The charcoal grilled pork is super good. The is my second visit, ordering the same food.\nHowever, I dun feel welcomed because they were rushing to close shop around 2:15 pm, before the last order.\nI will be back for the good food, but I hope they can be more friendly and offer better services.\n\nFeels like an intimate and authentic Japanese joint. There were a couple of tables of Japanese people. Staff were friendly and yakitori were juicy. Liked the asparagus bacon and tomato bacon yakitoris. The garlic fried rice was really fragrant too.\n\nA wonderful yakitori place located within the Far East Plaza, where each menu comes with 2 sticks (most of them). My favorites have got to be the Asparagus Maki (asparagus wrapped with pork), and the pork meatballs. All of the meat served were super juicy and salted to perfection. Definitely come back for more.\n",

Sake was yummy so they don\u2019t scrimp on quality.\n\nFood 5/5\nService 5/5\nAmbiance 4/5\n\nGood portions and great sushi. Get the Pitan Tofu! Lighting in the place could be better, it\u2019s a bit dim. Nice and quiet place. A great place to check out if you\u2019re craving sushi in Orchard \ud83c\udf63\n\nThe atmosphere of the place feels empty, not very decorated and doesn't felt like a Japanese restaurant. Service is normal as sometimes we still need to try to get their attention even though the restaurant only had two tables dining, probably they were closing soon and tired after a long day at work. Not every dish was nice for me though.\n\nTheir sashimi and sushi is really fresh and delicious. Their sashimi is thickly sliced into three pieces, however I would have preferred that they half the thick slice further more. Chawanmushi\nand soft shell crabs was great! The grilled fish is really worth it for the promotion price they were giving as it was quite a big portion and well seasoned. Tako wasabi and grilled ray fin wasn't to my liking as I've tasted better. The mentaiko spaghetti was too watery and sauce was too overpowering, although I do know Japanese pasta is a little soupy, however it was just too much for this dish. The inaniwa udon was the greatest disappointment for me as I felt their soba sauce wasn't tasty or salty enough to pair with the udon.\n\nOverall, the sashimi and sushi have good standards and would recommend.\n",

From the amazing interior and atmosphere, to the masterful and graceful slices by the chef, to the beautiful sight and taste of the ingredients.\n\nCelebrated my anniversary with my wife here and it was absolutely pleasant. Staff were attentive, and the chef is engaging as well, explaining each course and occasionally cracking some jokes with the diners.\n\nEach course was a masterpiece of their own, and makes one anticipate the next along the culinary journey.\n\nAt the end of meal, chef Kimura presented a surprise gift and a polaroid picture of my wife and I as a memory of this wonderful experience.\n\nAwesome time dinning here. Chef Kimura is friendly and constantly engaging us throughout the whole meal. He share about the ingredients passionately and the service crew was equally up to the standards of this place. Every dish was delicious.\n\nComfortable space. Went for lunch and was presented with familiar but high quality ingredients. The Nigiri rice here is still perhaps on of the best you will get in SG, each and every Nigiri is served with the same warm temperature of rice which shows their attention to details. Staff are attentive and the chef himself was super friendly.\n\nIt's a superb 1 Michelin star restaurant. Enjoyable, especially for a celebration like a birthday or an anniversary.\n\nChef is friendly and nice, service crew is superb, the food is extremely fresh, and the sakes are uniquely curated. The story is resounding as well, with chef flying ingredients back from his own hometowns, representing them here in Singapore.\n\nThat said, I'm not sure if half a grand for the experience, is something I feel easily comfortable with parting, for the price point of the ingredients (vs some other omakase spots in Singapore).\n\nRecommended by our fav omakase chef in Thailand. Got similar vibe and taste compare to Sushi Masato (also one michelin star). Food was great but service was not on point.\n",

Delicious \ud83d\ude0b\n\nVery decent Thai food for its price. Used to be cheaper and came here a lot when studying at a school nearby. Prices went up since 2017 but the food is excellent. The Thai Beef green curry is a must get, so is the basil sauce fish fillet. It is closed from 3-6pm so take note. Recently they seem to start taking reservations, so if you have a big group might want to call earlier to get seats. The Thai milk tea and lemon grass drinks are very nice!\n\nComfort meal with decent Thai food.\nWe\u2019ve dined at this outlet several times, good quality food is served here. If you enjoy milky curry, do give their green curry a try, tastier when soaked in the pineapple rice. Their appetizers are all good too, prawn cake is our favourite. Yummy Thai iced tea and green milk tea, sadly the mango sticky rice is always sold out. Take note that Jai Thai doesn\u2019t serve Thai pork dishes.\n\nDecent Thai food with reasonable price. I personally love their fried \u201cKang Kong\u201d and clear tomyam soup. Will try out other Thai dishes, green beef curry, pandan chicken, etc in the future\u2026\n\nBeen eating here for many years, maybe my own taste buds have changed as well but the food doesn't seem as good. A bit too sweet like every other generic thai food chain.\n\nOther than that the prices have gone up and portions have gone down, but that can be said for most places since COVID so it's understandable\n",

Mango sticky rice was great as well - not overly sweet and just the right size for sharing at the end of the meal.\n\nWould return to try more dishes!\n\nNice thai food of good quality.\n\n1. Welcoming appetisers for the platter\n2. Thai coconut seafood soup is the best dish from our order\n3. The quality of the fish fillet needs some improvement\n\nService: Good!\n\nOrdered too much and no space for dessert.\n\nOverall can be spicier hence we requested for the kitchen to up the spice level.\n\nKnew we fell into a tourist trap the minute we stepped inside.... Food looked really pleasing from the reviews here, but you're really paying for plating and not authentic thai food. The prices were unreasonably high for thai food in Singapore, too, so no wonder we're the only locals here.  \ud83e\udd23\n\n1. Locals are lined up next door while we stupidly paid tourist/ western prices. Didn't do a good job separating white people's reviews from the noise.\n\n2. The signature Otah at $3++ a scoop was not satisfying. I thought there'd be a special way of cooking with the clay covers, but these was deco. Fish was tough and Otah didn't have 1 ounce of coconut / banana leaf flavour. Basically fish balls with somewhat coconuty paste\n\n3. Fried rice had no wok hei and was deconstructed for no good reason - your chilli padi and onions and whatever that yellow thing was, was raw. Maybe for people to adjust to their preferred spicy levels.\n\n4. Tomyum was recommended by the waitress as their signature but was sour and fishy as heck. Like what is this....\n\n5. Place looks dated and nothing like the pictures from 6 years ago\n\n6. Ok but to be fair, one dish was good and  somewhat unique: Crab Meat Curry. This I will recommend if you want to eat here.\n\nEverything seen here + 4 beers amounted to $160. Could have gone next door or any other thai restaurant for maybe 40-50% less. Note to self: sift carefully for local reviews next time. Take the \"worthy of a Michelin star\" review with a dollop of salt.\n\nInterior is kept clean and very presentable. Definitely more towards a fine dining type of venue.\n\nPortions were rather small for the price, for what can be considered common dishes.\n\nThe food was made to be on the milder side, which is less than authentic. The stir fry and texture of the noodles were pretty well done though.\n\nAbsolutely a welcoming place and a must try Thai restaurant in Singapore. They have a great choice of vegetarian options and its absolutely vegetarian! The flavour, taste, service was very good and would recommend this place!\n",

My favourite is the Thai iced chendol and please add $1 for the red ruby as it\u2019s very delicious.\nDefinitely will come back again. \ud83d\udc4d\u2764\ufe0f\n\nNew location is bright n clean. We arrived minutes b4 11. Friendly wait staff ushered us in. However, food took long to b served. Assorted veg platter comes with 2 fishes. Don't think this is indicated in d menu. Won't b nice if vegetarians order this dish. d sambal dip for d steamed veg is good. Disappointed that only red chilli padi is served. Where's d green ones??\n\nWill return again for d reasonably-priced food.\n\nPad Thai was good. Tom Yum Soup was good. Pineapple Fried Rice was bland and unimpressive. Pandan Leaf Chicken was big but over-fried and dry. Rosella drink was pleasant.\n\n*Update: Very thirsty after the meal. Restaurant uses a high amount of MSG, most likely in the soup. I wouldn\u2019t revisit.\n\nDidn\u2019t have to wait long for the table or food, service was pretty okay. Food was good but not the best Thai food I\u2019ve had in Singapore. Pineapple fried rice is very good and has a nice wokhei! Their snack corner has pretty tasty snacks, try the fried chicken skin!\n\nFood was horrendous, sarcastically a feast for your palette. Been to their Golden Mile outlet and food was decent. Re crowd, there was no one on a Saturday afternoon. Mall parking - was tough to find a lot, perhaps due to the F1 weekend.\n\n\u2022 Tom yum soup - salty, numbing for all senses\n\u2022 Basil beef - dry and tasteless\n\u2022 Prawn omelette - minimal chopped up / small prawns in the middle which almost couldn\u2019t be found, super oily\n\u2022 Kailan roast pork - oily, bad consistency, pork was soggy and pieces were too huge, vege was black (which I ate most of anyway hence you can\u2019t see in the images)\n\nTotal damage $57\n",

                  "reviews": "\n\nThis restaurant, nestled away on an upper floor of Tanglin Mall, is a great place to come when you want high-quality Thai food. It\u2019s not inexpensive but the quality of the food and service are great, the atmosphere is relaxed and spacious, and they do have a range of set menu options, as well, if that\u2019s what you want. We\u2019ve never had a bad meal here. I think it\u2019s also a good place to bring guests. If you want Thai street food or mass market, there are other places for that, but for more of a fine dining experience, this is a great choice.\n\nOverall the menu looks Pricy. So ordering set meal . Overall taste are not authentic Thai.  Salad taste unique but made mostly from a fruit . The Tom Yum is very salty , the small prawns are not original prawn (\u61f7\u7591\u6ce1\u904e\u787c\u7802\uff09.  The beef taste more like Indian style rather than Thai style .\n\nThe plus point is the service .\n\nTo conclude :  it\u2019s a good place with good ambience and decorations. However if you are looking for authentic Thai food you need to look else where .\n\n\u201cFine dining price without the fine dining experience!\u201d\n\nLook somewhere else if you\u2019re looking for Thai fine dining. This place is cosy and impressive at first sight, until you have to interrupt your guests by leaving your seat to call the waitresses over. Yes, service is almost non-existent as I had to leave my seat on several occasions just to get a waiter. Not to say too, the food was not impressive. We looked at each other and agreed in unison that we had all experienced better ones in town.\n\nA regretful visit. To sum it up in a sentence, \u201cFine dining price without the fine dining experience.\u201d\n\nThai food flavours that come across as being refined, without being excessively salty or laden with MSG, as would be the case if one is used to typical Thai food budget options that are abound everywhere in local estates. We enjoyed some of the dishes, which stood out uniquely - the stir-fried crispy pork with homemade curry paste and long beans, and the fried prawns in filo pastry with avocado mousse. The Iced Thai Milk Tea is robust in its tea flavour, with the sugar syrup on the side. Ambience is a warm amber feel, while service is attentive. Price wise, well, it's not called \"fine cuisine\" for nothing, definitely not a price range one commonly associates with usual Thai joints. Our a la carte orders for a family of 5 came up to $315. The restaurant does run buffet options at $50 per person on certain days of the week, and they also have a range of set menu options.\n\ncame here for dinner during weekdays.  requested for window seats.\n\ngood decor, ambience and spacing.  surprisingly the service has wow-factor, i felt like i was in Thailand!\ud83d\udc4d\n\nvery comfortable and all the ordered food was good.  the fish and its dressing, however, were a bit bland for my liking.\n",

Their Thai milk tea is really sweet and flavourful, and did I mention it's really sweet?\n\nThe Baked Honey Pork Ribs is decent, though it does seem like they only season it last minute. They did cook it until the meat inside was soft but the flavour of the honey is only on the outside, and the inside of the meat doesn't have the same flavour.\n\nService is good though, and ambience is good. Quiet lunch with maybe 3 other tables with patrons.\n\nSurprise! A dinner date with my husband who chanced upon this place and decided to bring me here.\n\nThe place was dim, though, with hanging light bulbs that made it cosy. However, the surrounding area gave me a sensing that this place is abandoned with lots of empty flower pots and other decoration pieces lying around. The sight just makes me feel creepy, especially at night. Of course I am not sure if it's the design/theme of the restaurant.\n\nWhen I flipped through the menu, the condition of it gives customers a not so pleasant impression. The menu was old, pages were crumbled or wrinkled. The least can be done is to reprint the pages of the menu. Prices for the dishes were little on the high side but that is because I think of the fine cuisine that we are going to have. True enough, I was right!\n\nFor 2 pax, we ordered:\n1. Thai Fried Rice with Prawns(4 pcs)\n- was tad oily\n- not much of fragrance\n- portion was big that could feed 3 to 4(small eaters)\n- accompanied sides were salad, 2 slices of cucumber and a slice of tomato\n\n2. Tom Yum Clear Soup with Seafood\n- came in a pot that has a burner underneath\n- taste was sour and spicy\n- could feed 3 pax\n\n3. Honey Chicken\n- Chicken seemed to be fried but not overly done. Still could taste the tenderness of the chicken.\n- could feed 2-3 pax\n- nothing fantastic, quite ordinary\n\n4. Stir fried dou miaow with garlic\n- vegetables maintained its crunch but could blanch it slightly more as it has that rawness of the vegetables taste\n- could feed 3 pax\n\n5. Mango drink\n- refreshingly good\n\n6. Mango sticky rice\n- to go for no matter how full you are\n- rice was done up nicely and mangoes were riped and had a good combination of 80% sweetness and 20% sourness\n- mangoes blended well with the rice and not forgetting the coconut milk when drizzled onto the rice just enhances its taste. Yummy!!!\n\nWe visited this restaurant for lunch after a round of golf at the Champions. One of us is a Thai native and she commented that the food here is really authentic Thai. The only few places you can find real good Thai food, other than Golden Mile, is this place. We had Thai green curry, Thai basil pork, pineapple fried rice with prawns (even though this is not really Thai but it's really delicious), and stuffed chicken wings. The outdoor seating is really rustic and pleasant, albeit a few smokers around us. Service can be improved as there is only one lady serving the entire area.\n\nRecommend by my friend. Went to the other side for cafe. Never know that there is another well-hidden for Thai food. It is so right inside the area, so conceal into the greenery.\n\nOrdered more than 5 dishes including the desserts. The tom yum soup was so yummy. So was the fish cake.\n\nNice rustic place right next to a course course range. Food was good but what I love most was the environment - something you don't get alot from urbanised Singapore. Sadly I understand that they will be closing on 17 Dec 2023.\n",

Food didn\u2019t taste so strong like the authentic one but it\u2019s good for someone who is new to Thai cuisine or can\u2019t bare the strong smell of the fish sauce.\nMango sticky rice was not really good, coconut milk was bland, mango was too ripped and the sticky rice was dry at the outside.\n\nThe Thai food here was amazing and exceeded my expectations. Some of the must order would be the stir fried beef and lemongrass sea bass. Both sauces were so appetizing and addictive and both the meats were very thick and tender.\n\nThe mango sticky rice is also recommended as you'll get a whole mango that's sweet and juicy, accompanied by three beautiful pieces of blue pea glutinous rice. Kudos to the servers as well as they were efficient in refilling the free water and making sure we're well taken care of.\n\nHad an appetizing lunch at this outlet. Staff were warm and friendly and did a great job with the food recommendations. Finished off with a nice dessert and hot Thai tea. The lemongrass drink is not very aromatic and hope to see more items on the menu. IHG members can get 20% discount off the price. Bento sets take away are available to order online.\n\nFriendly and welcoming, like the laid back atmosphere. Menu is rather limited for Thai dishes. Pad thai, tom yum soups, mango and papaya salads were well done. Rest of the dishes were average. Rather pricey, and for quite a number of dishes to add on meats will have an increase in price. Enter via hotel lobby lift to reach the 5th floor.\n\nAmbience itself enough to get really relaxing time here with nice view of their roof top garden and pool.  variety of Thai Indian and western dishes available. Had western and Thai. Really good. Staffs are also friendly and quality of service really appreciated.\n",

Tip: share the rice so you can enjoy the dishes\n\nLocated at a convenient place at Level 3 at Novena Square. A very decorated big place. Staff are helpful and friendly. Vegetarian dishes are available. Fried chicken omelette, tom yam (spicy) soup are awesome. Enjoyed the lunch meal and portions with the four of us. The price may be slightly pricer but the food is really tasty. If you feel like eating good Thai food, this is recommended.\n\nQuite a busy Thur evening dinner crowd! Definitely a favourite w regular customers who like authentic Thai food. Food was served fast and hot and tasty. Pad- Thai was fried perfect and the stuffed Chicken Wings always a favourite. Good portions and lots to choose from the menu. Including the mango sticky rice dessert. Enjoy!\n\nMum\u2019s friend recommended this restaurant for dinner and we went back to this restaurant twice within the week. The food was amazing. Great and friendly staff! Highly recommended and great to go with family or group of friends. Authentic Thai food!\n\nThis place is very clean and the servers sterilise the tables and chairs thoroughly. Authenticity is legit from the quality of food and you can see many Thai diners as well. Tom yum soup has a kick and is not for non-spicy eaters. Hope to try the curries in future.\n",

Will never order again from Joe's Kitchen.\n\nI ordered a Thai red ruby to go. Found HUGE lumps of redness and one even had a hair in it. This is terrible. They use teeny pieces of chestnut filled with a whole ball of starch. Super unauthentic and unethical.\n\nFood came out slow. Tomyum soup and basil pork and kailan were not up to standard but I would say the pandan chicken, prawn cake and fishmaw soup with crab meat was good. Fried rice was not oily, healthier.\n\nWe're back after 6 years to try the food here! We came in a group 4 adults for lunch on a rainy Sunday. Quite empty.\n\nWe tried:\n1. Mango salad\n2. Clear tomyum seafood soup\n3. Beef green curry\n4. Pad thai\n5. Honey chicken\n6. Garlic pork\n7. Mango sticky rice\n8. Red ruby\n\nOut of all the dishes we ordered, the pad thai was most disappointing as they fried it with tomato sauce. \ud83e\udd72\n\nThe rest of the dishes are 100%!! Loved them! \ud83d\ude0d\n",

We ordered the drunken noodles as we saw that it was highly raved, and be warned that it is flavourful but very very spicy, even for someone like me who can usually take spicy food (so pls ask for less spicy if you can\u2019t take spicy food). The pork basil rice was a steal at $6.90. Chicken wings were juicy, and the steamed tapioca was delicious! Overall the quality of the food is good for the price point. Worth a visit!\n\nThai Kha is by far the best Thai restaurant in Singapore! Consistent quality & taste of food and great service will convince you to return. Having ordered in the first time during the pandemic, this is my go to place when it comes to Thai cuisine. Order online or visit their restaurant, a beautiful and well maintained space. \ud83d\ude0a\ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffb\n\nWent for dinner on a weekday, very quiet. Ordered through QR and food cooked fresh, but contrary to great reviews, our food was so so. Truly not bad. Drunken noodles was still a bit wet, but tasty enough but lacking oomph. Boat noodles not bad. Egg not crispy enough but tasty. Portion quite large. Spent 37.20 sgd for these 3. A viable option if around the area. Vegetarian options available for most dishes.\n\nCasual place with good food. Tried the drunken noodle, prawns, fried rice and morning glory - liked the spicy kick but prawns were ok. Good food with reasonable price - would come back for casual lunch if nearby!\n\nVisited Thai Kha at Havelock 2 (#01-01/48) for lunch recently!\n\nFood:\n\n- Had the Pork Krapow ($7.90 before tax, asked for less spicy) as my main dish. I personally thought that the pork was soft, tender and well-seasoned. Overall, the dish was well-balanced and tasty, although I wish that the egg was runny - it was cooked through.\n\n- I also had some Chicken Wings ($8.90) to share. Felt that they were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. My only gripe with this was that they could have been bigger.\n\nService/Atmosphere:\n- There were 6 of us who went for lunch together, and we all ordered Krapow with varying levels of spiciness and/or additional meat.\n\nThere was some miscommunication on the part of the service staff and they mixed up some of our orders. However, I don't deem this to be a serious shortcoming on the part of the staff - my only wish is that they would be better prepared for future orders!\n\n- The restaurant wasn't crowded during lunchtime and is a good value for money option if you're willing to travel to Havelock 2 mall. Seems like a hidden gem to me, if I'm honest.\n\nI will be back again. Very impressed with the quality of the food here.\n\nKudos to @cravings_satisfied_jay as well for suggesting this place!\n",

It\u2019s well spiced and not too dense.\n\nOnly comment was that the place is not exactly really well ventilated - given that it\u2019s located at the basement of far east. Otherwise, love the food!\n\nOrdering is super simple as well as it\u2019s all done through the app. Staff was also nice enough to explain through the process.\n\nWent with my colleagues to this place and it was surprisingly good. But on a side note, slightly more ex for the portion of the minced pork. Would suggest ordering mince pork w rice if you are looking to get that. Their drunkard noodle dish is sooo delicious tho!\n\nAuthentic stall food! I will be back.\n\nYou need to write your order down on the paper on your table then proceed to counter to order. Cash and NETS only.\n\nWe also order the steam seabass and crackling pork. Both were not bad, the seabass was very big. I ordered the thai green milk tea which wa not very sweet.\n\nThe shop do get busy and kind of noisy when there is a huge crowd. The food is nice overall and I will come here for Thai food when I\u2019m in town.\n\nThe Thai food here surprisingly nice and delicious. And the portions were big.\nLove the pork meat, super soft and it melted when put into mouth.\n\nIt is one of our favourite places to eat. A highly recommended place for authentic Thai food. A place where we'll bring friends and they have many non spicy dishes suitable for children too. Service may be lacking during peak hours so go earlier during meal times or  be prepared to wait a bit.\n",

Overall the dining experience is a good one.the fish is the highlight of the dinner. Savoury !\n\nFood is delicious,  but quite small helpings. The outlet is convenient with parking available. Quite crowded but food served fast, just that they ran out of utensils. Tom yum is good, pineapple fried rice is delicious. Fried drumstick with garlic is dry.\n\nI chanced upon it in Google and am sure glad I tried the food. It didn\u2019t feel like being in Singapore when dining in. The food was good and affordable. For 4 of us with 7 items and 1 dessert, it was $74. No GST. Food was promptly served although service was not as prompt as staff were usually busy. The homemade prawn cake was delectable and tasted fresh. Red ruby was pleasant after meal and costs $3. Having patronised this place, the other Thai chain stores located in HDB neighbourhood now appear mediocre and overpriced. We love dining here and will surely be back again. While there is parking just next to it, you likely won\u2019t find a lot during peak hours.\n\nLunch at our favourite Thai food place. They have crayfish (new item) on their menu now. Food is nice as always. They even have a mural painted beside their restaurant.\n\nOne of the better Thai food offerings around. If you want a slice of Little Bangkok where Golden Mile Complex once offered, Soi 47 is it.\n\nAffordable, delicious and generous all together. Portions can be shared easily with 2-3. Get yourselves 4-5 dishes and enjoy. Interior is a bit plain/utilitarian but actually seems quite Thai. My favourite was the Pandan Chicken (packed a spiced punch for a delicate portion) and the Green Curry (denser, more aromatic; different from the watery coconuty style). Omelette was the fluffly type, and turned out too oily. Milk tea was average but glad it wasn't overly sweet.\n\nIf you're early or unattended to, it seems like you should walk in and serve yourself to an empty table. But later on at around 830pm, when a queue started forming, I believe the staff started managing the seats/tables.\n",

Prices are also quite comparable. Price came to about $150 for 8 people with sharing dishes. Good  value!\n\nNestled at a corner of cheong chin nam road is a Halal certified (please recheck for validity before going) restaurant serving delicious authentic thai food.\n\nServing portions were big. Special mention on the mango salad, it was super tasty and authentic! So were the dishes we had. You will love it if you prefer slight saltiness in your food. We love what we ordered!\n\nService was good. Food ordering via QR code. Food served within a decent time and the prices are decent (with exception to the prawn vermiselli which is pricier given the number of prawn given). One probable issue for some patrons is the limited availability of airconditioned seating area.\n\nWill definitely be back.\n\nNo frill Thai food. Anytime crave for decent Thai food with decent price this is the place. Try their glass noodle phat Thai, crab meat fried rice, basil chicken and mango salad. All rather authentic. Also you can select less spicy so good for people who cannot take spicy food.\n\nStumbled upon this gem after hiking at bukit timah. If you are craving for a spicy tom yum soup, this is THE place for you. Our orders came within 20mins. Not crowded even during weekend afternoon too! Near DTL and parking lots available. Price is wallet friendly!\n\nHad been craving for a clear tom yum soup for quite some time now bcos Far East plaza\u2019s cahaya restaurant weren\u2019t selling them anymore. Fyi, Time for thai serves red and clear tom yum soup too!\n\nTheir soup was utterly rich in flavour and we ordered more spicy version. I can confirm my tongue was burning but not to worry, its not as numbing as Mala. You know how your throat feels powdery after slurping down some tom yum soup? This tom yum doesn\u2019t do that! Fragrance weren\u2019t overwhelming and the seafood portion were adequate. If you are starving, get the large portion. Rice is not included\n\nPapaya salad was a refreshing appetiser. Tangy, slightly spicy and peppered with crushed peanuts, each bite doesn\u2019t disappoint. Serving was big though, i would say definitely too much for 1pax.\n\nPandan chicken was alright. Only comes in 3pcs per serving i believe. I prefer Koh nangkram\u2019s (along bugis st) pandan chicken tbh.\n\nHome-made iced lemongrass and thai green tea was delicious. Iced lychee, again normal & safe bet if u didnt know what to order. Will come again for sure.\n\nIt\u2019s literally Time for Thai, as we just walked-in after seeing the eatery from the overhead bridge!\n\nThere was a set meal for 2 but being small eaters, we ordered ala carte instead. My favourite would be the big & tasty Prawn cakes, the Fried glass noodles were not bad too (although it contains mainly vegetables, u can top up for meat/ seafood), & the Tom yum chicken red soup was spicy!\n\nIG @pingguo301\n",

I suggest travellers can go for Thai food in hawker centre. Taste is not authentic AT ALL, maybe is Singapore style Thai food ONLY. Not real THAI FOOD\nFirst, the pad Thai. Tasteless, no \u201cWok Hei\u201d \u7121\u944a\u6c23\nU know\u2026 Thai stir fry cuisine are supposed to use hard fire so to make everything with \u201cWok Hei\u201d \u944a\u6c23 it just like they boil the noodle and mix with sauce for me when I am eating their pad Thai\nFor the Thai lemon fish. The soup is like water\u2026 not sour at all. It doesn\u2019t worth $34 (even more expansive than I eat in Australia). Believe me, don\u2019t order it, go for this fish is hawker centre, much better than this!!!\nAnd the papaya salad\u2026. Tasteless too, can\u2019t taste the fish sauce and the lime juice. I don\u2019t think they make it in a Thai way as all the ingredients are not mixed well.\n\nVery disappointed. $85 something for 2 people. I rather go to hawker centre than this.\n\nFor the restaurant reply : thank you for replying my review. But fresh ingredients doesn\u2019t means that you cook it right & nice and authentic\u2026 u know\u2026 it about how u cook not about the ingredients. You can cook bad even u have good ingredients.\n\nWe ordered chargrilled pork skewers, which taste nice with the sauce. The pad Thai has the chicken option, which we think is yummy, as well as basil pork rice. Iced Thai green tea is too sweet even tho we have ordered half sugar, but the iced lemongrass tea is impressive. One of the best Thai food I have in Singapore.\n\nIf you love food as much as I do, you will enjoy the place. Great selection (even for me - allergic to rice!) And impeccable service. They are a little pricey though and the vegetables were a little too salty.\n\nStill, I would definitely come back. Really favour the basil chicken. Robust flavour and not too salty.\nEnjoyed the atmosphere and the tom yum soup too!\n\nLovely thai food in busy Chinatown. Really liked the vegetarian options and the flavors. Topped up the food with refreshing Thai coconut juice.\n",

From the rich flavors of Pad Thai to the perfectly spiced Green Curry, every dish is a masterpiece. The authenticity shines through, and the service is impeccable. Cozy ambiance adds to the charm. A must-visit for anyone craving an authentic and delicious Thai culinary journey!\n\nDelicious thai food. They must be doing well because they occupied 3 separate units. I like their restaurant because it comes with a little playground for children to play. The fried garlic sotong was very good. Generous spread of garlic was yummy. Food price is reasonable. I find the place a bit too small and tight.\n\nClaypot Tang Hoon Prawn & Pineapple rice is super yummy, prawn cake a must to eat. Steam fish, kailan with roast pork, kangkong, tomyum soup, fried egg, chicken with garlic is what i will order when i there.\n\nFood quality is good and the price is reasonable. Can taste the authentic aroma of Thai food.\n\nHowever, the seats are quite limited. So prepare to que if you are going at peak hours.\n",

Fish cake is not bad too - tastes fresh and not like the processed chilled kind from supermarkets. Air con half working , seats hard wood kind  so can't sit for long.\n\nOur go-to for quick Thai food fix. The rice meal has generous dishes. You may need top-up rice if you\u2019re very hungry. The green curry is very tasty. Pineapple rice set is my fave.\n\n$12.80 per rice set meal, drink included\n\nIG @sporkandbeanz\n\n6 of us spent S$153 including GST and service charge. It worked out to be S$27 per pax which is affordable. Comfortable and clean. The service was inattentive. The food was served quickly. Only 7-8 mins walk to City Hall MRT Station or Bugis MRT Station.\n\nThe clear tom yum soup here is sad. For $9.00++ ($10.69 after taxes), the soup\u2019s ingredients are a real let down. 2 frozen prawns, frozen dory fish pieces and 2 over cooked squid pieces (so tough that I could hardly chew them). A far cry from what the menu is advertising. Truly unenjoyable. Perhaps all that hit the spot was the sourness and spice, but even then it was not balanced.\n\nThere is a dedicated menu just for vegetarians, with super wide range of options and delicious authentic thai flavours. Really accessible from Suntec area. Highly recommend their Green Curry & Thai Mango Salad that was refreshing & tangy. Good for both group and individual meals. But restaurant interior lighting can be quite dim. Along the shophouses so its expected that there is not much seating space, but sufficient- since unable to reserve seats, seats availability depends on timing you visit.\nProbably price of a zichar store\n",

The ambiance was inviting, creating the perfect setting for an enjoyable meal. The menu offered a fantastic variety of authentic Thai dishes, each bursting with flavor.\n\nI must commend the attentive and friendly staff who made the dining experience even more enjoyable. Their recommendations were spot-on, and they were quick to ensure that every aspect of our meal was to our satisfaction.\n\nThe standout, of course, was the food itself. Each dish was expertly crafted, showcasing the rich and bold flavors that Thai cuisine is known for. The freshness of the ingredients was evident, and it's clear that the chefs at Ah Loy Thai take great pride in delivering a top-notch culinary experience.\n\nOverall, Ah Loy Thai exceeded my expectations, and I can't wait to return for another round of delightful dining. Highly recommended for anyone in search of authentic Thai cuisine in a welcoming atmosphere.\n\nTruly delicious authentic Thai food at this restaurant. The process of writing down your order on paper and then proceeding to the cashier to place your order and make payment is straightforward, and the waiting time for the food is acceptable.\n\nHowever, there's a bit of an issue with the second place, which is still under renovation. The problem lies in the fact that the sound tends to bounce off the unfinished walls and ceiling, creating noise pollution and making it a bit challenging for patrons to enjoy a peaceful dining experience. Despite this, the food is definitely worth the visit.\n\nOne of the best Thai cuisine in Singapore. Located jn Bugis area, this Thai restaurant serves amazing Thai food. Fried egg, tomyum, lemongrass chicken, mango salad, is among the food that you must try, I kid you not. However, queueing system and rules can be improved.\n\nYou need to come here early or at odd hours or be prepared to queue, and it\u2019s easy to see why - this restaurant has one of the tastiest Thai food I\u2019ve ever eaten (and I\u2019ve eaten a lot).\n\nIf there is one dish you must try, it has to be their omelette with minced pork; crispy and tasty.\n\nTheir tom yam soup and tom yam fried rice are also rich and delicious. Do also remember to order their Pandan chicken.\n\nTo a person like not really eating spicy food, I honestly think this Thai food hits exactly nice for me to eat. Taste great, good vibes, hopefully to visit next time! Thank you!\n",

This place has two shops side by side and both with seats and tables. We ordered clear tom yam fish soup (spicy and nice! Fish was fresh), omelette was so good, kangkong very tasty and lastly, the deep fried pork belly is just superb.

No kids under 14 are allowed.\nSkip the high heels, if you don't normally wear them daily though.\n\n78$ pp for free flow lunch. Brought a Thai friend as I heard many good reviews about this place. But sadly the food was very salty and chicken in the green curry was rather dry and tough. Beef was tough as well. Restaurant was quite warm. Total damage 185$ after GST. There\u2019s free parking around the corner for about 10 cars.\n\nYou will forget that you are in Singapore while you are here. You can be expecting tip top level of service while you enjoy your meal in the beautiful restaurant on the hill. Really love the architecture and chandeliers hanging in the bar area. The food itself I think is quite average as I had better Thai food elsewhere. Personally, I think they are a bit too heavy handed on the MSG as I usually feel very parched after eating here. Overall, I think it\u2019s a really good place to hang out and have drinks with friends in a more secluded area of Singapore.\n\nAttending a wedding event. Nice environment. Good for chill out. The food is just ok for me. But the environment is good for meeting and chatting people with people.\n\nThe building itself was beautiful typical colonial building. Inside was quiet and while there was 5 of us and we made our own atmosphere it was very quiet. We went on a Thursday so maybe at weekends it\u2019s busier?! The food was lovely.\n",

                  "reviews": "\n\nNice place to explore if you love Thai food. Some dishes to highlight include the tomyum soup (looks very clear but was really tasty -- sour and spicy, definitely love this the most), mango salad (spicy and definitely have the Thai kick, but I think the mango was a little too ripe for a salad as it's quite soft), stuffed chicken wings (well fried, the outermost crust was crispy and the stuffs ingredients were very juicy), and the coconut jelly (that was the dessert -- coconut taste was fragrant and was not too heavy for digestion). Ordered some beer and definitely pairs well with dinner.\n\nI think all in all this place is a good try. But it's definitely pricey in my opinion.\n\nThis was a terrible experience and I would definitely not come back. Horrible service and the standard of the food does not match the high price point. I would urge those to check their menu first to find out if you want to pay for such an experience.\n\nLet me explain my ratings as given above. I firmly believe that the service crew there should be retrained (if there was any training in the first place) because what they said and did were quite ridiculous.\n\nWhen my companions and I entered the restaurant, it was very empty. The staff guided us to this room with three tables and we occupied one of them. After that, this group of around 12-14 people came in and started chattering very loudly. We requested to change tables since the noise was deafening but the staff did not allow us to. Their reasoning was that the other tables were reserved. I do not understand their reasoning because: 1. There were many other tables that were empty so why should we have been confined to that room? 2. From the time we entered to the time we left, the restaurant was at 50% capacity only. There was no reason as to why they couldn't have let us go to a table outside.\n\nAnother instance that left us totally stumped was when we ordered our food earlier than the other table in the room. However, the other table got their food first and although we waited for while longer, we still didn't get any food served to us. As such, one of my companions went to ask the staff why our food was taking so long and their response was quite hilarious. As the other table had ordered appetisers and we did not, we would be served later even though we had ordered our food earlier. I will refrain from saying any expletives but my companions and I were basically hungry and tired from their nonsense.\n\nIn total, we waited for 35mins for our food. That's too long of a waiting time when there weren't even that many tables occupied!\n\nFor the food, it was disappointing. It totally did not match up with the high prices we paid for it. For example, the tom yum was very diluted and there was little flavour. The bee hoon also had no taste.\n\nWould not come back.\n\nBeen around for almost 30 years and they are one of the older Thai restaurants in Singapore. Decent food quality but on the slightly pricier side of things. Olive rice, pomelo salad and grilled squid are some of the nicer items on the menu. The spring roll had too strong a taste of the young bamboo shoots that most of us did not enjoy. Desserts are good and worth keeping a bit of space for!\n\nRecently I had craving for Thai food. A friend recommended Yhingthai. The dishes there were really tasty. I love the prawn tom yum soup. Small portion just right for one person. Super spicy. We ordered several other dishes all were very good. Most of the dishes at Yhingthai are quite spicy. Be careful if you can\u2019t really eat spicy food. The service staff there were polite. The average cost is around $50 per person. I would expect a more grand interior design and more Thai ambiance.\n\nHigh end thai food. You pay for the quality of food and service. Everything was good. Try it if you want fine dining thai cuisine.\n",

Awesome cocktails  I recommend this shop.\n\nCame here for a lunch meeting and was told this is a popular spot for vegetarian Thai dishes as there is a whole dedicated section of the menu for vegetarian selections.\n\nVegetarian or not, this is overall a good choice for Thai food in a nicer setting, I particularly enjoyed the seafood Tom yum and the olive fried rice was not bad either. Green curry was mediocre but passable.\n\nDecided to lunch at Sabai Fine Thai restaurant. At lunch time, ground floor was full, the server suggested second floor. Second floor not very large, about 8 to 9 tables. However more cozy and quiet than ground floor. I personally preferred second floor. We ordered mango salad, stuff fried chicken wing, fried thai noodle and pineapple rice. The wait was short and food were served almost together. The serving was generous and able to feed 2 big guys (my buddy and me). We had a hearty meal and an enjoyable lunch. Staff very attentive, our water glass always filled to the brim without asking. If you love Thai food in a cosy and quiet environment with attentive staff - Sabai Fine Thai is where you should be.\n\nDelicious Thai food. The only disappointment was the Red Ruby dessert. See last photo.\n\nDelicious food & a cozy ambience!!\n\nWe went to this place for dinner. We ordered rice crackers, soup, spring rolls, chicken & Mango sticky rice. Surprisingly,  all dishes came in less time than we expected and the quantity & quality of each dish was really good. Dishes are so delicious that it just takes you to Thailand. My daughter loved the adjustable light on the table too \ud83d\ude01 Must Visit place \ud83d\udc9c\n",

The quaint place had nice decor and a good vibe. We had the butter chicken, lady finger vegetable curry, fish tikka, garlic and cheese Naan as well as a starter which was a flatbread filled with a spinach style filling and a curry on the side to dip the bread.  For drinks we had a mango lassi and lime juice. Everything was delicious and the service was delightful and friendly. Recommended to make a reservation as it got quite busy on a Thursday evening.\n\nExcellent dinner at Mustard on Race Course Rd. Restaurant is small and intimate and service is excellent and attentive.  They have a huge menu with tons of choices so we ordered way too much to try many things. Everything was wonderful but especially recommend the house special Chingri Maacher Malai, the Aloo Jhuri, Mutton Biryani and the kathi kababs.\n\nLocated in the Little India neighborhood. This restaurant has friendly staff, of which unfortunately not everyone speaks English.\n\nFood menu is extensive and you don't have to wait very long on your food. Not everything was of my personal taste, but I am sure the food was nice. Also enough dessert choices and even typical Indian drinks.\n\nDo note that the air conditioning is very cold here, somewhat too cold (heard the same thing from a co-worker who visited earlier).\n\nExcellent food!\n\nWe arrived at opening at 11:30 specifically bent on enjoying authentic Bengali food\u2014we left satisfied and glad we came early!\n\nThe waiters are able to make excellent recommendations. We opted to go straight for mains:\n\n- Kosha Mangsho: tender chunks of mutton in a fantastic thicker gravy\n\n- Chingri Maacher Malai Curry: delicate shrimp and coconut curry presented in a tender coconut\n\n- Maacher Paturi: boneless fish fillet smothered in mustard, gently steamed in a banana leaf\n\nRice bread does not come with each main, and does require separate purchasing. We opted for:\n- Luchi: aka puri, lightly fried and crisp\n- Roomali Roti: one roti is rather large, and folded in on itself; delicate with a great chew\n- Plain white rice\n\nFor dessert, we enjoyed Rossomalai (aka Rasmalai), a dessert in most areas of India, but theirs is fragrant and richly flavored with cardamom, almonds, and cream.\n\nAll in all, a fantastic visit for those who enjoy Indian food and are looking for something different than what most restaurants serve. They do include Punjabi items in their menu, which is typically what most people think of when they think \u201cIndian,\u201d but venturing off to possibly \u201cunfamiliar\u201d dishes won\u2019t disappoint!\n\nIt\u2019s a shame they are not awarded Michelin Star, all the dishes were on point. Highly recommend for anyone wish to taste good authentic Indian cuisine. Try all the signature dishes, all is a hit!\n",

The interiors of the restaurant has a heritage kind of a feel and staff is very polite and courteous.\n\nThough a bit expensive than usual, food quality and quantity was upto the mark and the food was delicious. Even the mouth freshener was really tasty. Would recommend visiting this place for authentic North Indian food.\n\nNice place and food tasted good. Especially the carrot halwa and chicken kebab. Fish gravy was little off... did not like it. Staffs were kind. The taxi dropped off me at fairmount hotel... but this restaurant is at raffles city shopping mall. But no worries, since both buildings were interconnected, I could just walk to the next. There is a corner to conduct some performance like singing. Reaaaaly traditional for Indians... haha.\n\nLovely service and food. Had my sons birthday there cos he wanted something different.  The lunch buffet on weekend is best value!! Lovely quality especially the appetisers.  And don't be mistaken the latter was rhe main course for us. Best you can order again and again!! The curries and nans as well as the dessert cum fruits were wonderful. My daughter who love the Indian food in Philadelphia was especially enjoying all the food including the sauces . And they were so kind to take a picture of the family and birthday and gave us a frame for that as well.. well done guys. Only down side, the deco has been there for many years.. a little dated but still acceptable lah..\n\nThis Indian restaurant in Singapore offers a unique dining experience. Unlike other Indian restaurants where I usually find the food heavy for dinner, here they have mastered the art of using a delightful blend of spices like turmeric, tamarind, cumin, fennel, and cardamom. The dishes, especially the curry-based ones like lamb, curry snapper fish, and chicken masala, are absolutely fantastic, and they pair wonderfully with the naan and roti. Don't miss out on the flavorful biryani rice too. To add to the exceptional experience, the wine selection, particularly the Shiraz, is a perfect complement to the meal. All of this, combined with the great service provided by Sunjav, makes it a truly memorable restaurant visit.\n\nAmazing experience. The service was so good. Sitting buffet starters, many varieties and can be served multiple times as well as per our requirements. Main course items were less,\nThe quality of food is good. Their service is exceptional.\nWhile booking the reservation, we mentioned we are coming for a birthday lunch, they arranged kulfi ice cream cake. They took photos and got them printed for us and given as a birthday card, which is unique.\nHighly recommended\n",

The service was excellent because we were asked if we could take spicy food. When the food was served, it was individually to us; it felt like a special treat.\n\nLocation is also worth mentioning. I could think of another option where I could get delicious Indian food, but having Punjab Grill at MBS is perfect because there is so much to do around.\n\nOne of the best North Indian restaurants I have ever had a meal at. Under the stewardship of their new Chef Gorang Anand the menu and the cooking has been taken to a whole new level. Must try if you live in or visit Singapore.\n\nActually didn't spend a single cent, was a treat (Pre-opening Dinner Party). Went without knowing what to expect. The restaurant is in MBS. Heard from someone that this is one of the places serving best Indian food in Singapore. The food is relatively yummy. Chicken is tender. Naan is yummy. The uniforms of the waiters add to the uniqueness of the place. The waiters are relatively polite.\n\nThis is my favorite Indian restaurant in Singapore. I always spend a time to eat there when I am in town. The food is super delicious, service is great and they gave me some Deepavali seasonal dessert the last time I ate there.  Fantastic!!!\n\nI had dinner at Punjab Grill today with family. Food was awesomely delicious. Restaurant's ambience is great. Staff is super friendly.\nWe order few dishes like pani puri & papdi chat, both were mouth watering.\nButter chicken and rogen josh were melt in mouth. For dessert we ordered rasmalai and pan flavoured ice cream. Overall we enjoyed our meal and definitely will visit again.\n",

It was my first time having a South Indian cuisine, I really have no idea what to order so I kindly requested for recommendations and everything was pleasing to my taste bud. The person who took my order yesterday was really patient as well.\n\nGiving my layman description, I\u2019ve ordered meen pollichathu (Marinated spicy boneless fish wrapped in banana leaf), gobi manchurian (fried cauliflower sauteed with special sauce), kozhi porichathu (fried chicken marinated with various spices), porata (its like local roti prata but less oily), fish curry with mango, malabar mutton biriyani, mango lassi (yoghurt drink) and lemon soda. My favourite got to be the gobi manchurian as I have never tasted cauliflower done like this before. Biriyani portion was great for 2 pax sharing or for 1 hungry person, the mutton was yummy as well. Meen Pollichathu needs no explanation as it is one of their best seller and portion is reasonable for their price. The kozhi porchathu was probably my least fav as the chicken felt like its double fried since its a little hard, otherwise the taste is really good. Food were all served within 15mins upon ordering and the temperature was hot (everything is made fresh). Total bill came out to be around ~$87 for 2. I personally think its reasonable as I was extremely full by the end of the dinner and have no stomach for dessert haha.\n\nWould definitely being my Kerala colleagues to try their dishes one day.\n\nThis place is special in its way of treating your taste buds with the kerala food in Singapore. The service is good, and the ambiance gives you the picture of the land Kerala.\n\nWent for Onam Sadhya.. all the items served were cold and tasted like cooked in the morning and served for dinner. Taste was also bland and not worth Sadhya. Nothing special in the \u201cSadhya\u201d served and definitely not worth $24!\nBetter have Andhra meal at any restaurant, its better taste and value for money.\n\nAmazing food\ud83d\ude00!!!. Excellent service. It\u2019s an authentic place to get typical South Indian food.Especially Kerala cuisine. \ud83d\ude0bHighly recommend !!!\n\nI've only had lunch meals at this restaurant. The  quality of the meals is inconsistent. When it's good, it's really good.\n\nThey offer a lot of meat dishes and only a handful of vegetarian items. But there is enough here to get a good experience of the range and taste of Kerala-food.\n\nEdit: In subsequent visits, the quality further dropped. The vegetarian meals were not served on the banana leaf, the rasam was the worst I've tasted, the puliseri looked pale and was just sweet, the ulli theeyal was too sugary, and everything else was average.\n",

Juice was fresh and came in big cups! Only thing which we felt was worth it. Service was also very friendly but we got a shocker when our bill came!\n\nFirstly the person who served us mistook our order and got us 3 starter soups. We were excited to see 3 small bowls and felt he divided the soup bowl for us. We are used to being served 1 big bowl of soup and him giving 3 was thought of as being kind.\nThose 3 bowls however popped up on our bill! When we questioned that when we had made individual orders, he just removed 1 bowl. Didn't cause much fuss and paid. And yes, that soup...not fresh but did not taste or smell aged. Regardless, was microwave heated. Could see the usual microwave stains of oil residue you can easily see inside the bowl and tell it was microwaved.\n\nWhy I am giving just a 1 star because what is most disappointing is we were also charged a 10% service charge on top of our meals! I just found out now when calculating our expenses. This the first time to experience that additional charge besides GST in Singapore. Even GST is already added, what you see is what you pay...but unfortunately, not here!\nIf you want to save costs, I'll recommend going elsewhere. A family member wanted to have a North Indian experience and quite some experience it was.\nDue to open setting, there were also some men who were just staring at my mother and when us men looked, they immediately turned their heads away! What nuisance!\n\nWill I plan to go here again? Nah, I'd even avoid crossing this place.\n\nGenerous serving!\nHad buttered chicken, decent but I've had better ones. The vegetable biryani was good and had ample variation on the vegetables. The mango lassi is pretty good, have that.\nA filling meal overall.\n\nVisited this place couple of times last week. Staff is very courteous and food is super. Not spicy at all. Tried veg/chicken biryani, mee goreng, nasi goreng, mutter paneer, naan, etc and everything was super.\n\nGood food and friendly staff , definitely will come back to try other dishes!\n\nGood food and reasonable price. They open until late night. Call first if you going there after 12am.\n",

Sometimes the crowd can be overwhelming.\n\nThe food is great. Especially the mutton dishes. The chicken tikka is also amazing. The chicken briyani want great and the chicken kerbab wasn\u2019t great too. Naan was a little too oily.\n\nI spent $38 on breads, paneer and sweets??? $10 for paneer makhani was expensive. It was not cooked properly. The best dish was \"Paneer Tikka\". I\n\nI would say that their food tasted pretty typical \u201cNorth Indian styled\u201d. But not enough to blow us away. Their pricing was not too expensive, and neither cheap, pretty affordable.\n\nAbsolutely delicious Indian dishes.\nThe mutton dum briyani is nice but comparing to the other dishes, it doesn\u2019t shine as bright.\nHighly recommend their naan and side dishes, especially their butter chicken.\n\nIf you\u2019re tall, please mind your head when you dine at the upper level.\n\nPrice point is also reasonable. Highly recommended.\n",

Equally the dal maklani was too salty and buttery albeit managed to finish quite a big helping. Pricing is bonkers tho with rice and dal dishes being close to 15 dollars. Service was excellent and I would come back and try a few other dishes. One issue is the lack of bathroom facilities or washbasin in the restaurant. You have to exit and do a couple of doors down and my nose never did recover from little India\u2019s more underground smells !\n\nI had a great experience at this Indian restaurant\n\nThe food was great and I enjoyed the service, the staff were friendly and helpful.\n\nI like the atmosphere, and I appreciated how quickly the food was served.\n\nWhile I haven't explored many Indian restaurants yet, I'm looking forward to returning to try more dishes in the future.\n\nSo far the best chaats I have had in Singapore. Nice and proper place to sit and enjoy the food. Prices are not exorbitant. One thing I dislike is that they don't have a proper hand wash inside the restaurant. Have to go out to wash and come back using the swing door, which defeats the purpose of washing hands. Indian food must be enjoyed by using hands, so hand wash point in the restaurant is a must.\n\nUpdate on 18 Sep,\nSince I liked the chaats, I thought of having at airport as I saw it was at T1 terminal @ L2. When I went there, they said it was moved to different location. Management must take out the signboard from T1 as it gives wrong information.\n\nVery good option for Indian vegetarian food. Was seated very fast and the service was also good. During peak dinner time 8-9pm place will be crowded and generally there will be waiting.\nVast Manu covers most of the Indian variety food. Food is really tasty, especially all the chat items are very nice. If you are looking for   Indian vegetarian food definitely worth a try.\n\nGreat North Indian cuisine. Service was slower than expected, however food was good. Be careful when ordering more sides as they charge for everything\n",

The vibe is good, the drinks are potent. Have been a patron for more than a decade.. time to change the ambience?\n\nFabulous Food. Great Place. Great Ambience. Must try for some fabulous Indian Food. Taste, Quality, Quantity. Everything just Perfect.\nMust say the owner is a great guy being a Ex Star Chef himself. He came out and spent so much time with us.\n\nNot interested in trekking to little India then treat your taste buds to a night at the Curry Culture. Great vibe with a great outdoor seating area with great service. Meals may be a little more than other places but the quality of the food is well worth it!\n",

Look no further for fine dining Indian cuisine.\nWe went for the set lunches vegetarian and non-vegetarian options, everything was amazing, smooth, and superbly well seasoned. Staff was friendly and attentive, and food was served quickly.\nCan't recommend enough.\n\nGives you a fine dining experience. Nice place with tall ceilings and a posh setup. The furniture was good and comfortable. The menu was decent and the taste was unique. Do try the biryani and restaurant recommended dishes.  Expect to spend $80+ ( with svc chr n gst). Felt a little shorthanded on staff and felt rushed towards the end.\n\nHigh end Indian restaurant in Pan Pacific . Went for lunch the set thali has a lot of variety and has unlimited refills . I would say some of taste could have been better . The service is great the staff friendly and very attentive.\n\nWe were there to celebrate our 21st wedding anniversary.  We ordered from the a la carte menu.  The service staff were very friendly and attentive to our needs and offered to help us in any way they could. What came as a surprise was a complimentary slice of cake from the restaurant to celebrate the occasion. Thank you for making the lunch a special one. Highly recommended!\n\nGood Indian Fine Dine, you can certainly experience the quality ingredients, but we as a family personally felt that the masalas have been severely mellowed down to cater to the masses and hence the drift of authenticity from the dishes.\n\nIndian food is all about spices, flavours and for sure calories. We weren\u2019t disappointed at all, just that some dishes could have beer better :)\n",

The chicken biryani is so so. The place is air conditioned with good hygiene. Quite a lot of tourists in the restaurant.\n\nButter chicken is good, but the tandoori chicken is okay but proportion is small, overall is pricey, and they have too many take away orders that took very long to serve our food, the outdoor tables are close to street where is not so good when raining\n\nAbsolutely brilliant food.

Loved her effort.\nThe ambiance was really loud! \ud83d\ude05\nLow priority on my revisit list.\n\nLove the history and amount of thought that went into each dish and modernizing it. The Goalondo steamer fowl curry in their special Bengali menu was the star, and so is the ema datshi. Staff members were also accommodating, and were able to explain the dishes.\n\nWe had the Experience menu which comprised about 12 items ( including a complimentary one that was not in the menu) - not cheap but reasonably priced relative to food quality/ quantity. Good array of food ranging from some more unique dishes  eg Alaskan crab, cod fish to familiar Indian items like naan ( best garlic naan ever tasted) and bryani. Attentive service with food items explained at each course. I am normally not that big a fan of Indian cuisine but this won me over . Will go again\n\nSenthil & team attended to us wonderfully. The hospitality at Yantra is unparalleled and met by very few Indian restaurants in Singapore. Chef Pinaki even stepped out to speak to our family. Their Palak Anjeer Kofte, a palatable twist on Malai Kofte, are a must-try! Can\u2019t wait to be back :)\n\nJust one caveat - the portions are pretty small so keep that in mind when ordering.\n\nBy far one of the most memorable meals we had in Singapore during our trip!\n\nWe went back there for the first time in 8 years and found that the whole place was revamped and had become a very high-end fine dining! The lunch buffets were there no more (which was a bummer at first to be honest), but the quality of food was just the way we remembered it.\n\nWhat amazed us was their amazing hospitality. All the staff were tremendously kind and friendly. When we told them that it was our first time back in 8 years and that this was our best meal this trip, they were so happy for us and let is explore some areas of the newly revamped restaurant (such as the new bar which was so beautiful I was in awe!)\n\nBit on the pricier end but if you\u2019re looking to have some eccentric Indian cuisine, we highly recommend it!\n",

The restaurant holds the legacy with not just the location, the interior but also to the taste with food. We tried a few variations including the famous meal and biriyani. A must try will be the meal combo, served hot. We had to wait for around 30 mins to get seated but it\u2019s worth the wait.. ground floor and first floor has seating capacity. The prices are very reasonable for the quantity being served. Will definitely recommend this place for all South Indian vegetarian fans!\n\nFood here is good, not that very bad. Service got to improve. Environment can be cramped and noisy. Pricey but still okay, you pay what you asked for. I was served food first, even finished up eating the foods but drinks were served after 5-10 after finishing up my meals. Masala tea arrived 30-40 minutes late upon ordering. This is not acceptable at all. And never even apologized for serving the drinks late. I ordered one ice tea and one masala tea. Also, I personally feel the standard of the food have dropped a lot. Used to patronize here often but I think it's about time that the service and food taste is falling apart.\nOverall food is 7.5/10.\nService is 3/10.\nEnvironment is 4.5/10.\nThis review is based on my honest opinion.\n\nI saw this on a food travel show and immediately wanted to try it out.\n\nThere was a short queue but seated after 5min or so wait. Service was friendly and no fuss. Dining area is simple but as expected.\n\nDefinitely lived up to expectations with amazing, fresh, authentic and tasty food. I had the dosai meal which had 3 curries, some chutneys, Daal, sambar, and even a sweet sago coconut pudding. Amazing flavours, colours and spices. A generous meal which was thoroughly enjoyable.\n\nFor a sweet finish I tried the almond hawa and milk kova which were both new to me. Very sweet but had their own unique taste and texture which hit the spot.\n\nOne improvement would be to use less plastic for serving food - lots of little plastic containers on my meal set and for sweets.\n\nOverall a great experience and will definitely be recommending and be back.\n\nThe food and service is always good in Komala Vilas. We stay nearby so we can walk to this restaurant during our jaunt in Singapore.\nI wish they include an elevator to go upstairs for lunch. On request they let my parents share the meals but mentioned there will be no refills.\nTaste is always exceptional.\n\nNestled in the heart of Little India, Singapore, Komala Vilas Indian Restaurant is a culinary gem that proudly showcases a rich history of authentic Indian cuisine.

Meals were unlimited . Taste was good and happy to have food at this restaurant. Person at bill counter was happy to welcome us.\n\nNice place to have Indian food.\n\nIf you order rice, the side dishes and curries come for free.\n\nWater is available for free.\n\nCould have been 5 stars if not for the higher price of the meal. I paid $20+ for 2 meats and 1 soft drink.\n\nAn Indian restaurant for the novelty. Generally better biryani or meals than the stalls in hawkers/ foodcourt.\n\nMasala chicken/ mutton was nice and portion is filling. Fried food like chicken 39 was cold when served. Fish/ or chicken curry is quite spicy. Dal curry is hot and nice during lunch time. Assam is peppery, siok.\n\nI frequent this restaurant. Each time seems to be worst than another. Most 5 stars are probably tourist visit or first/ one-timer. Looking at all the lowest rating, the sentiments are aligned that the service is bad.\n\nOne of my favorite thing is that the Veggies and curries are free flow. I love Dal curry.  Perhaps it was just a miscommunication but when I requested to have more of one particular veggies of the day, they don't seem interest to serve (for 1 instance). For some reason my veggie and rice portion seem a bit smaller than usual too on the last time I visited (see photos). I came around 8.30pm, a time that it was not so busy, however the service staff around the dining area is not so attentive and not service-oriented at all. It feels like I owed to them by dining here/ it is a struggle to serve. Maybe the service staff are tired after the whole day.\n\nA suggestion is to make the veggie and the curries to be self serve, it allows the individual to choose the type of veggie and control the portion so as to not waste food (not everyone wants to eat all types of veggies).\n\nReally good food! Reasonable prices too! We had Prata and rice and lots of dishes! Especially enjoyed the chicken with onions which was an interesting dish! The other dishes were very good too - mutton, fish, curry. Surprised that the Prata was also really good!\n\nVery authentic, menu is a bit confusing and the servers had a hard time explaining. We got the chicken set which comes with the white rice and a dish of chicken (these are pre-prepared and were not that warm) then someone comes around with tubs of curry sauce to spoon in your plate. Also ordered the chicken briyani, comes as whole chunks of chicken on the bone in the briyani. Was a very generous amount of food for the price.\n",

Hope to come back again soon, I was in Singapore this January\n\nAroma's is a great place to try out indian food! The owner is extremely warm and enthusiastic and he would recommend special items off the menu if you make specific requests. I have been coming with my family for a year now and have become great friends with the owner.\n\nI would personally recommend to try their chaat (light snack) items as well as the indian-chinese fusion items such as gobi/chicken manchurian. Aroma's also does excellent biryanis which are so well flavoured/seasoned, you would not even need any gravy to accompany it.\n\nI highly recommend all folks to come and give this restaurant a shot! :)\n\nIt's our first visit to such a specialty restaurant. We\u2019re not sure if we\u2019ll like it, judging from some of the low reviews. But wait!! We had such a great meal and experience with the owner here!When we first arrived, the signage was pretty small and not so eye-catching among the rows and rows of Indian food along the stretch of shophouses.\n\nThe menu was pretty big; we had no idea which to order until the owner approached us and we asked him for some recommendations. Firstly, he recommends some items to see if they suit our taste, and the more he asks, the more he knows about our food preferences.\n\nSurprisingly, when the food came, the curries blew my mind! The different kinds of curry to match with different kinds of carbs are so suitable that they do not overpower each other. They are so flavorful! I specifically recommend the mixed vegetables; they're so flavorful with the briyani! The garlic nann is topped with REAL bits of chopped garlic and fragrant butter. It's so good with the curry the owner recommends! We wanted to order another nann, but we were so full because of the delicious briyani and curry. All the food was served hot and warm.\n\nWe were served papadam with a special mix of mint and many other spices and yoghurt green sauce. The sauce is so good that you want to keep dipping in it. He also recommends dipping the fried fish into this sauce. Yum!!\n\nDo not hesitate to ask them for recommendations, as the owner did it very well! We will definitely go back for other dishes, especially butter chicken and prawns.\n\n**This is more of a specialty restaurant than the other Indian food restaurant, which serves large portions of food. According to the owner now, they have only been open for 6 months. Some of the reviews from a year ago were definitely not from the same owner. Give it a try! You\u2019ll not be disappointed.\n\nRecently eating AROMA'S restaurant ,Race course road(near banana leaf appollo) Little India. Mutton Dum biriyani,chicken Dum Briyani ,Gobi manjurian,chicken 65,mushrooms cream soup,baby corn pepper fry,Masala tea taste fantastic and fabulous \ud83d\udc4c \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c\n\nPerfect respite after a warm morning walking tour of Little India.  Muthu welcomed us, very nice (cool) setting, very cold drinks and the food was great!  We'll be back!\n",

As a vegetarian, I always come back here for their dosas and idlies. If you find yourself in Little India/Farrer Park, you have to try here at least once!\n\nWell, I can\u2019t really find words to discribe the taste.

Thosai was flavourful and slightly nutty.\n\nPudi Masala Thosai: 5/5\nCrispy on one side and soft on the other. Cheesy taste from the thosai likely from ghee. The pudi spice blend is savoury and quite spicy. The potato filling was really flavourful, soft, slightly sweet from the onions, very tasty.\n\nSambar: 5/5\nThe sambar was flavourful, bright, spicy and slightly sweet.\n\nChutney: 5/5\nGreen chutney was flavourful, coconuty and slightly minty.\n\nTotal score: 15/15\n\nAdd-ons: Uddin Vada ($3.24) was extremely delicious. Insanely crispy thin outer shell and soft inside. Filter Coffee ($3.20) was fragrant, tasty and a wonderful way to end the meal.\n\nI first ordered the Plain Thosai, finished it before I made my order for the remaining Pudi masala thosai, Uddin Vada and filter coffee. Not sure if it was coincidental or just amazing service but the Pudi masala thosai came next, and when I was just about finish, the Vada came. And shortly before I finished the filter coffee came.

A meal for 4 would cost anywhere between 65-80 SGD.\n\nThe 'Shish Mahal' Indian restaurant was just across the road from the Ibis hotel we were staying at, and we visited it three times, having some delicious curries there and cool beers.\n\nVery inexpensive for Singapore, with excellent staff who made us feel really at home, and kept offering us additional titbits.  It's a great place to eat, and the area around it - 'Albert Court' is very interesting.\n\nCame here for a late night snack and some beer. While they were kind enough to accommodate my order despite the kitchen being closed, the cheese balls were still cold at the core. Beers are fresh and cheap tho. Would come again for that.\n\nWas given complimentary papadam which was really nice! The chicken briyani was fragrant and flavourful and was nice to have together with the palak paneer and garlic naan!\n\nThe staff was also very friendly and helpful!\n\nGood place to  eat indian and nepali food.\nPrice is reasonable .Staff are receptive on your request.

I think my favorite dish was the butter chicken, but honey everything we tried was lovely. The samosas and the tandoori chicken were also great. Yum!\n\nWOW! Where do I even begin\u2026 easily one of the best, most delicious places to eat out I\u2019ve ever been to! Great and authentic setting, delicious Indian cuisine and lovely staff to make you feel like home. The spicy challenge is so fun and the taste of the food there is simply out of this world! A must visit if you happen to be in Singapore!\n\nHad an incredible time here! My group stumbled in not knowing at all what was in store for us.\n\nWe first of all were impressed that this place made the Michelin List so many years in a row, and then we saw the hilarious Spice Challenge and were intrigued with all of the fun events this place hosts like the Full Moon Nights & the cooking classes. The owner/chef was so awesome. He was so funny and sarcastic and also encouraged us to get out of our American-Indian comfort zone and wouldn\u2019t let us all just order Tikka Masala as we originally planned, and because of that, it turns out I found authentic Indian food I loved even more! I really wish I lived here so I could take the cooking classes with him!\n\nMany thanks for providing our group with such an entertaining experience and pushing us out of our comfort zones. It was truly a time!\n\nAn amazing and authentic environment with unique deliveries of classic dishes. They have a sauce heat sampler platter to see what heat level you like.  There's a challenge wall for those seeking immortality as well. But the naan and sauces are too notch. A must try. The proprietors are amazing and have a fun sense of humo(u?)r.\n\nChanged my perception of Indian food in Singapore : well-curated, small portion size, so I didn't feel stuffy while digesting and a bit pricy. Masala tea was better than I had in Mumbai but it would have been perfect if the sugar was on the side.\n",

Amazing food and service! Definitely coming back!\n\nLots of options, portion is just nice as well \ud83d\udc4c\n\nPersonal favourite tonight was the Goan Fish!\n\nA really homely establishment serving delectable Indian dishes at affordable prices relative to other places.\n\nThe paneer masala was rich and perfect with the Naan basket. The mutton biryani was rich and tender. Accompanied with the Malai chicken kebab, which was served on a sizzling hot plate that oozed rich flavours. Finally, the Gulab Jamun was rich and fragrant without exceedingly sweet. Topped with the Mango milkshake served with passion, the food was downed with great enjoyment.\n\nCome on down if you are in the vicinity, you won\u2019t regret it.\n\nThe food was excellent, the service exquisite. Thanks to the waiter we ordered incredibly good food. The Goan fish curry was probably the best I ever had. The mint chutney was very strong in taste, hence it was the first time I ever really appreciated it as an appetizer sauce.\n\nWould definitely recommend, way better than expected.\n\nLove their lamb rack briyani. The briyani was not too oily, flavourful and lamb rack was succulent. Lamb was not gamey at all. Their lassi and dal makhni were very rich in flavour. They have a variety of sauces to complement different dishes which pairs very well. It's affordable for such quality Indian food.\nService crew were very polite and attentive.\n",

We got one of the chefs menus instead. My favorite was the chili prawns and my least favorite was the fried rice, it just wasn't anything special compared to the other dishes.\n\nService was great and they even set up a kids place setting for our baby, which was sweet, even though he is much too young for solid foods.\n\nThe food was mediocre at best, but the service was good. We made a reservation for seven beforehand, yet the table we were assigned was extremely small, could not even fit the dishes we ordered.\n\nCompared to other Chinese restaurants in this price bracket, such as those at the Ritz Carlton and Hilton, this dining experience left much to be desired.\n\nBBQ Meat Combination 2/5\nSteamed Star Groupa 2.5/5\nPeking Duck 3/5\nSweet and Sour Pork 4/5\nStir fried Kai Lan 1/5\n\nOne of the best Peking ducks ever! Please note that all other dishes, despite the high price, are portions for one pax only.\n\nVery expensive but worth the Michelin star!\n\nFantastic restaurant, small portion but really great. I would say, \u70e7\u814a is the best!!!!!!! Highly recommended for family gathering or special occasions.\n\nPeking Duck was the highlight here. Level up with a touch of caviar. The duck here is more lean and crisp but I do think a little of fat adds to the flavour. Still good nonetheless.\n\nHad a soup (meh, especially for that price) and a Soft Shell Crab with Crab Meat (which was yums, creamy but not to the point of being jelak, guess it helped that we shared instead of having 1 each) and a refreshing petite fours of Osmanthus Jelly and Pineapple Tart.\n\nThe complimentary birthday cake was delish too, reminded much of Ritz's Royal Caraibe from 20 years back. Dark bittersweet choc mousse on a layer of caramelised crunch. Service was top notch, attentive yet but imposing, always there but invisibly.\n",

                  "reviews": "\n\nMy husband located this restaurant on Google maps, it was about 10 minutes walking distance from our hotel. It is situated on the 5th floor of a shopping mall and closes at 10pm. Last order is at 9.30pm.\n\nWe shared a starter of crispy crab and prawn rolls. They came separately wrapped with red and green sauce.\n\nI had a lamb rack (one lamb cutlet to be precise) on a bed of potato and vegetables. My husband had braised sliced duck for one person with steamed rice. The food was nice and the service was quick. The plates were not hot, so the food became cold very quickly.\n\nThe wine is expensive, but always is in Singapore. More cost effective to buy a bottle.\n\nThe chrysanthemum and jasmine tea was nice.\n\nI had always wanted to try this restaurant. But it\u2019s always skipped my mind when I\u2019m at paragon due it\u2019s located at level 5.\n\nSo this time round, I\u2019m very focus to go to this restaurant with the purposeful trip down to paragon.\n\nAs much as I\u2019m excited and anticipated for this restaurant, it starts to turn me off little by little as i walked in, when we\u2019re seated to our table, we could smell a strong damp and moldy stench arising from their carpet floor\u2026 this is a killer for our dining experience in there.\n\nApart from that, the food definitely still maintain its Michelin standard (though the Michelin was no longer accredited in 2023), also we like the \u201cold\u201d staffs working there, the service from the traditional Chinese restaurant where you can experience, they know their stuffs, and they do know how to talk to customers. Had a great chat with the staff as well.\n\nI guess the restaurant really need to upgrade n change their carpet.\n\nFood was okay, nothing too grand or special. Of all the dishes we got, I would only highly recommend the sweet, sour and crispy fried mushrooms. The kangkong was good.\n\nServers were very attentive and helpful with the recommendations. Although as a tourist, we didn\u2019t know that every refill of our tea would be charged and they kept refilling without us asking them to - ended up paying $20 for hot water refills.\n\nAtmosphere was okay also, walkway going inside the restaurant gave it a good vibe.\n\nNice place to have dimsum with families ablnd friend inside Paragon mall. Many choices of dimsum. It is not a big restaurant but a very nice decoration. It was in the Michelin guide. The restaurant was not busy when we arrived. The service is good and workers are friendly.  It serves typical dimsum dishes like other dimsum restaurants. It also  serves regular chinese dishes.  We order multiple dimsum dishes, and foods are delicious. If you order lo mai kai, it will take about 20 minutes  to prepare. Other dimsum items were ready pretty quickly. I like the chicken feet. It is better than the one we have in the States.  It was soft and tastes so good. Other dimsums items are good too but not like wow.  Overall I like this restaurant and the service.\n\nExtended family dinner to welcome back our nephew and niece who are studying in UK, back to Singapore on summer break. The food was great and service was good, prompt, attentive and friendly. We've been here several times and always had good experience.\n",

The dishes are good and unlike other restaurants serving Chinese Dim Sum, the place feels tranquil and quiet despite that the place is full on a Sunday lunch time. Great place for gathering and catch up over food.\n\nOrdered a variety of dim sum, all were really good except the egg tarts (mini and not the best). The price of their dim sum is pretty on par with other places but yet the fillings so generous and you can taste the fresh quality in their ingredients used. My favourite was the steamed glutinous rice, we even ordered a second serving! Service staff were quite busy and not easy to reach hence the slight markdown on service. Otherwise it\u2019s a good experience and we will be back.\n\nCame here as we got 50% discount. Arrived here at 1.45pm. We didn\u2019t order too many dim sum as we ordered the Irish duck n noodles for 2pax. It\u2019s a mistake. Maybe we came late. The duck skin was a disappointment not crispy at all. Half a duck cost $65 before discount. Instead the dim sum were much nicer especially the steam ones. I would enjoy better if we ordered more dim sum. The ambience was nice and service was good.\n\nOrdered dim sum.\nFood\nOverall okay for food. Duck was quiet hard to bite maybe they could cook medium well . For desert we got mango sago. Maybe they could add ice-cream to it.\nService\nWaitress and waiter both recommended food that were amazing. The waiter even taught us how to use our Amex voucher.\nAtmosphere wise\nWaiter led us to a room.\nIt was quite hot inside as most pf the air conditioning were outside .\nWould definitely come back here.\n\nLovely dim sum lunch today at Wan Hao for our family of 4 with 2 kids.  The Irish duck was tender and juicy. The servers didn't push for us to order more expensive dishes like we experience in some other restaurants who try very hard to cross sell. The service was attentive and polite. I loved that it was also quiet and elegant for our lunch.\n",

Definitely must order this.\nAnother dish highly recommended would be the Beef Dices and Roast Pork. crispy and solid -\ud83d\udc4d\nOthers dishes are nice too and prices tends to be on the higher side.\nSo impressed with this \u2b50Auntie Li Yong \u2b50 whom was serving our table. (Hope i got her name correct)\nShe was so efficient and on the ball, service was just Top Notch, making sure my 2 kids are well taken care of also. And what surprised me was she is just on a Part Time Basis as she is busy on family matters. Wow.\nExcellent service from all staff and top notch dinning experience.\n\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\n\nGreat service and the peking duck is one of the best I've tasted. The chef managed to cut the duck into the same thickness and size as the cucumbers so that it is asthetically pleasing and a delight to eat. Only complain if I were to nitpick is that the wrapper for the peking duck breaks easily.\n\nEvery dish was good. Especially the fried soon hock. Though this fried fish dish turned out to be more expensive than the duck.\n\nFamily friendly place good for gatherings, the young and the old.\n\nMade a reservation for Imperial Treasure Super Peking Duck because they were touted as serving the best Peking duck in Singapore. The duck required advance order and this can be done while making the reservation.\n\nThe duck skin was indeed very crispy but I found the meat rather bland, but who eats Peking duck for the meat anyway? The rest of the dishes I ordered were quite ordinary but that may be because they were ordinary dishes to begin with.\n\nNot very likely for me to return..\n\nDelectable Peking duck with crispy skin and tender juicy meat as expected from their speciality. Quite an experience to have a chef preparing the duck for us. The fried mince duck meat, fried rice and other dishes were great as well. Recommend this restaurant if you\u2019d like to try Peking duck.\n",

                  "reviews": "\n\nSince opening in The St. Regis Singapore hotel in December 2007, Yan Ting restaurant has been a stalwart of the Chinese Cantonese fine dining scene, the epitome of extravagance and luxury. These days, there are plenty of Chinese fine dining restaurants around, but Yan Ting has certainly stepped up their game, remaining a premium dining destination of choice, serving well-executed and refined gastronomic delights on each plate.\n.\nAmbience at Yan Ting is opulent. The grandeur of the interior exudes a classy elegance, without being too over the top. The tastefully arranged layout is suitable for business or private dining, and the decor enhances the overall ambience without being too loud. I also like the bright ambient lighting, which isn't too harsh or dim. The pearl marble floors and plush furnishings feel sophisticated and comfortable.\n.\nService at Yan Ting restaurant is professional, discreet, and polite. Staff may not make much conversation, but they are attentive and observant. The accord each table good attention, answering queries, fulfilling requests, serving orders, and proactively clearing finished plates with finesse. Communication in English or Chinese Mandarin is decent. Felt very well treated here.\n.\nFood at Yan Ting follows the Chinese Cantonese philosophy of freshness of ingredients, little usage of herbs, and well balanced dishes that are naturally flavourful but not greasy. Yan Ting restaurant prepares classic Chinese Cantonese dishes according to time-honoured recipes, but presents them in beautiful contemporary style.\n.\nPortions are sized for individuals, but dishes are best shared. Prices are high. Prepare to splurge, budget about SGD $245 per person for a meal here.\n\nFood was great and yummy! We ordered their signature set menu and enjoyed it. All the dishes were on point, not too salty and oily. Overall we enjoyed and will come back for their dim sum!\n\nVisited Yan Ting to celebrate a birthday, but was left disappointed by the standard of service. Food was decent, but nothing to shout about.\n\nWe were seated at around 6.15pm, and ordered 4 set meals and half a Peking duck within 5 minutes. We waited for almost half an hour for the appetiser to be served, and similarly waited for approximately half an hour for the following courses. At 8.30pm, we had not yet been served our main courses, and decided to get the main courses to go and to get dessert served instead.\n\nAs for the Peking duck, we were served the Peking duck pancakes shortly after our appetiser. We opted for the second serving to be served as chopped duck, which I assume would have been sliced together with the first serving. However, we yet again had to wait another half an hour for the meat to be served, which meant that it was cold by then.\n\nWhat disappointed us the most was the level of service provided by one particular staff, Steven. While serving the dishes, it felt that he was simply dropping or tossing our plates onto the table. What shocked us the most was when he presented the bill, he seemed to throw the bill onto the table, pointing at the line for the signature without saying anything! When we asked if there was any way to give feedback, he said that there was none other than leaving our feedback online.\n\nTo Yan Ting\u2019s credit, the managers Bruce and Fiona did try their best to offer service recovery as we were leaving and apologised on behalf of their server.\n\nFor the price point that Yan Ting is charging, we would have expected better trained staff, as well as better serving processes. Overall, not an experience we would expect from a highly rated restaurant and not a restaurant we would likely visit again.\n\nWe were here on our vegetarian routine day. Even though they don\u2019t have many selections of the vegetarian dishes. You can ask them for the off menu. They will customise for you. We ordered hot and sour soup, truffle tofu, Gongbao vegetarian chicken, fried mushrooms Mien, and stir fried vegetables. Every dishes were tasty. However you might need to wait for up to 30-45 mins to serve your food.\n\nWe were hosted to lunch here, and the place was packed at 12 noon, so much so that reservations are a must.  One negative is that the place was too loud, with so many people talking, that I ended up with a headache.  Having a normal-level conversation was quite difficult.\n\nService was quite warm and quick, and the waitstaff were always quick to top up our teas.\n\nThe food was generally of a high standard, though some meat dishes were rather tough.  The pork jowl done charsiu style was tasty, but some pieces were tough to bite through or chew.  Similarly, not all pieces of the stir fried beef, which was delish, were soft.\n\nThe xiqolong bao was nce, but the standout dish for me was the siew mai. We ordered desserts of sago with mango , and quilingao, both of which made for a sweet ending to the meal.\n",

The table setup provided a sense of privacy for our group, making the dining experience even more enjoyable\n\nCame here for birthday dinner and had the Daffodil dinner set which should be popular since many other patrons ordered the same.\n\nWould give 6/5 if we could. Food is fantastic. Service is attentive. Ambience is romantic. Price is value for money given the quality of the dishes. All worth it to put up credit card authorisation for the reservation ahead of time.\n\nLooking forward to coming back again next time.\n\nEating area is dim, and stiff\n\nService and serving of food was shockingly slow in which a multiple dishes had to be checked multiple times & server could not give adequate response or update, shirking responsibility to kitchen. Dish orders were missing/forgotten.\n\nIt was overall very frustrating and really tested patience when both trying to consistently check and lunch time was unneceasarily extended.\nIt was also difficult to get attention of server\n\nIf you do not know how to speak Chinese, do avoid this place as likely to struggle communicating to server\n\nFood only looks pretty but you can take it as a given that all the main cooked big dishes will have a lot of oil & salt.. best to make special request to exclude\n\nDefinitely not worth the $70++ per head when food, service, waiting time was ridiculous.\n\nDo get better tasting dim sum or chinese food elsewhere & for cheaper\n\nWe went for the weekday dim sum lunch buffet because they are going to discontinue buffet soon! Love the quiet atmosphere and service was good.\nMost dishes are delicious. Buddha jump over the wall is a must try soup - rich and tasty. I like the truffles charsiew bao and crispy wanton - unique. The porridge was disappointing and bland. Roast duck is so so. But we really enjoyed the desserts!\n\nHeard so much about Hai Tien Lo restaurant. Went there for dinner. Fine dining Chinese restaurant to be exact. We ordered the set dinner and we were surprised by each dish. Beautifully displayed in an artistic manner. Each bite of the dish bursting with different tastes and senses to the tongue. Each dish was painstakingly prepared and you could taste the real flavour of the ingredients. No flavour enhancer, natural, genuine taste from the combined ingredients brought out from the chef\u2019s skillful cooking. Check out the photos of the dishes I had.                                     The smoked fried chicken was excellent! You can smell the faint smell of smokiness. The skin so thoroughly fried and wafer thin, dipped into the special sauce, sour, sweet and a hint of spiciness, so freshing, a brilliant combination that brought out a whole new experience to my taste buds and senses. Other dishes were equally surprising and excites my taste and senses. Service was attentive and polite. I will make it a point to come again when the menu changes. I want to be surprised, I want my taste and sense to be excited!\n",

The restaurant was full but fortunately we waited for only around 10 minutes.   Was quote sceptical because I saw many foreigners and thought this could be tourist trap.  I was wrong,  the claypot pig liver is super delicious and the braise fish head is so flavourful.  This is indeed a very good Cantonese restaurant.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for Chinese restaurant with amazing food and friendly service, look no further than this hidden gem. I recently had the pleasure of dining at this spot and was blown away by the quality of their dishes.\nThe beef meat teow with wok hey was outstanding. Beef was so tender and portion size was generous, even for the smallest option on the menu.\nNext up was the roasted duck, which was an absolute standout. The skin was perfectly crispy and meat was tender and flavorful.\nFinally, I have to mention the cereal prawn ball, no hassle at all in removing the shell and  flavorful prawns.\nRestaurant was the friendly and welcoming atmosphere.\nIf you\u2019re in the mood for some truly Chinese cuisine, look no further than this spot.\n\nCame here because of the online reviews and  partly we were nearby. The foods are hit and miss. Can order the fried beef kway teow, vegetable and home-made tofu. Will not recommend the Indonesia curry chicken and the roast duck, roast pork and char siew combo.\n\nFood is served quick and they are delicious! Place can be loud sometimes due to the occasional loud talking and laughing by other customers but I would definitely recommend coming here for the food.\n\nWhilst visiting Singapore, my friend took me to lunch at his favourite cantonese restaurant. I can understand why - friendly, warm service and absolutely delicious food served with a smile. The fried rice, sweet and sour pork and special tofu were particularly  notable - all of the plates went back to the kitchen absolutely clean\n",

She will take care of what you need and look into all small details that you will feel very welcome in this restaurant.

We don\u2019t speak Chinese (I speak a little), but the servers are very nice people and gave a lot of smiles even though they\u2019re covered by their masks. Will keep coming back in future \u2764\ufe0f\n\nWife and I decided to finally visit this iconic restaurant today. Feels like stepping into a little time capsule the moment you entered the restaurant; greeted by those old ShangHai music and bustling noise from the dinners. We ordered this recommend dishes, steam cabbage with scallop, roast chicken with minced prawn, popiah and crispy yam seafood bowl\u2026(lol, English names don't do justice to the dishes\u2019 auspicious Chinese names). Food tasted great with loads of fresh ingredients, clean profile and right about of spices you expect when dining in a fine Cantonese restaurant. Service was on par with the food, speedy and responsive, our tea cup was nvr empty. (btw, their lychee Long Jing tea was really nice too!)\n\nPrice is on the higher end but was not unexpected. Frankly this place can be classified as a one michillen star restaurant.\n\nPlanning next trip already!\n\n4.25 stars but a touch expensive even when you try do it on the cheap. Located opposite China point it's apparently one of the oldest restaurants in Singapore. When I first saw the menu it had some extremely expensive items on there. Like $1200 for abalone with something. This being well out of our price bracket we ordered the birds nest, popiah, broccoli, rice and a full duck. It was about S$250 to feed 5 of us. We drank tea. We didn't finish it all as it was more than anticipated. Food was great. Nice to see a lazy Susan on the table.\n\nI have made the right decision to celebrate my mother\u2019s birthday at this Chinese restaurant with a long standing history of serving delicious traditional Chinese foods! My parents loved the old school ambience and the 1960s music.\n\nWe would like to especially thanks and compliment the manager, Gao Bo, for the top-notched and impeccable service! He was extremely friendly, attentive, and going extra miles to ensure our dinner is comfortable. Really appreciate his thoughtful setup for the birthday cake after our dinner (see picture).\n\nMy family and I will definitely come back again!\n",

The stir fried prawns in chili sauce is an absolute must and no wonder it\u2019s one of their signature dishes. The buns to accompany and soak up any leftover sauce were great, we would\u2019ve gotten more but didn\u2019t want to fill up!\n\nThe saut\u00e9ed wagyu beef with cumin was so aromatic and the meat extremely tender, and the fried rice with pork and seafood was delicious and equally portioned out for the three of us.\n\nWe had a fantastic time, the service was impeccable and we hope to come back soon.\n\nShisen Hanten beautifully blends the bold flavors of Sichuan cuisine with Japanese inspiration, all while offering traditional Cantonese dishes.\n\nTheir Mapo Tofu is amazing I would return here just for this dish. The perfect blend of spicy and savoury, with tender tofu bathed in a flavorful sauce, makes it a must-try. Their vegetable dishes are equally impressive. Here, the true essence of the vegetables shines through, highlighting their natural flavors and freshness.\n\nService at Shisen Hanten is impeccable, with attentive staff adding to the overall dining experience. Their commitment to ensuring your satisfaction enhances the enjoyment of the meal.\n\nGenuinely enjoyed the lunch here and the staff are very friendly, service was impeccable!! My mum has many food requests and the staff (Penny, Doris and Yvonne) were very accomodating to them. Penny was especially patient in suggesting different menu changes and making sure nothing was amiss during our meal. The lunch set menu was also pretty worth the price. Paid a bit more for the lobster but it was really fresh and tasted amazing with the sauce!\n\nFine dining time, and we love it. It's the most beautiful Chinese restaurant in Singapore. We have a great experience with the selection dishes that offer from Chef. It is kind of spicy but good to go.\n",

Shirley, Maggie and Chin Chin were amazing hosts, recommending dishes and ensuring that we were well taken care of.\n\nGreat place for your family dinners. I will definitely come again soon! :)\n\nShirley, Maggie and ChinChin service were impressive. Very attentive in service and clearing plates. Chef also put on a goof fire show for the pork dish. Every item served was explained well. They also provided a cake from my mum\u2019s birthday.\nMany thanks to the team!\n\nThe menu at Man Fu Yuan is a celebration of exquisite Chinese cuisine, and it showcases the artistry and passion of the talented chefs. The array of dishes offered caters to various palates, ensuring there's something to delight everyone. Whether you're a fan of traditional favorites or seeking innovative culinary creations, this restaurant has it all.\n\nThe service at Man Fu Yuan deserves special mention. The staff members were attentive, knowledgeable, and passionate about their craft. They took the time to explain each dish, offering valuable insights into the flavors and ingredients. Their attention to detail and genuine enthusiasm contributed to the overall exceptional dining experience.\n\nThe ambiance of the restaurant is sophisticated and elegant, with tasteful decor and comfortable seating. The soothing background music added to the overall relaxing atmosphere, creating the perfect setting for a special evening with loved ones or an important business gathering.\n\nMan Fu Yuan Restaurant is a gem that should not be missed. From the exquisite cuisine to the impeccable service and delightful ambiance, every aspect of this dining establishment exceeded my expectations. Whether you're a connoisseur of Chinese cuisine or simply seeking an exceptional dining experience, I highly recommend visiting Man Fu Yuan Restaurant. It is an indulgence for the senses and a culinary journey that will leave a lasting impression.\n\nService is good there, the 6 courses meal will get 5 stars if not because of the lobster with crispy rice noodle dish. While the lobster is fresh and the texture good, the noodle spoilt the dish with the fried noodle taste like rancid oil, disappointed. Other than this dish, all other dishes are up to standard. Recommended the Man fu yuan appetizer.\n\nCelebrating my daughter birthday Food was awesome. Was serve by a very friendly and attentive staff named Maggie Yong. She was so attentive in her details and ensuring the celebration of my daughter birthday a success one\n",

Mind you the pricing is not cheap - see latest dim sum menu in picture. The roast duck is tender, juicy and not too fatty. Top it off with fantastic service, no wonder this place remains popular.\n\nWe basically picked Carlton because of Wah Lok. We hated Carlton, but loved this restaurant and ended up eating here twice. Highly recommended. Egg tarts were very traditionally good and can easily have it by the dozens. No picture of egg tarts simply because they were gone before I had a chance.\n\nVisited on a Saturday 1pm for dim sum. Overall it is okay, but not as fantastic like it used to be.\n\nFood is decent but not fantastic, I'm talking from dim sum perspective and not main Chinese dishes.\n\nService is good, maybe primarily I avoided the lunch crowd and not too much ppl at that hour of 1pm+ for weekend.\n\nAtmosphere is hotel restaurant style where you have padded floor and it's a nice environment, not too noisy as compared to other restaurants.\n\nThere are better dim sum restaurant out there and not likely I will visit this restaurant. But I'll recommend for dinner, it is a nice place to host friends, colleagues, family, but never the dim sum.\n\nThe staff were very attentive, they talk to clients with professional smile. However, I think the food I had was not impressive giving the high end price. We ordered half roasted duck, french beef cube$36, and fried squid\u2026 the portion was so small, especially the duck cost $44, only 8-9 thin pieces. For a glass of water they charged for $2 (staff did not mention it when we order), a small portion of peanut charged for $5 (did not mention too)\u2026Not recommended, there is better duck place in town..\n\nFirst of all, just want to say that Wah Lok is still my most loved Chinese restaurant in SG. The food is excellent and they stick to their tradition of making good food. However they did disappoint me in one aspect on my last dinner there. Ordered the abalone based on the menu and when it came, the slice abalone just looked pathetic in comparison. Upon checking with the manager, his explanation was that there was a word sliced in the order and picture was only for illustration (by the way, my order was the closest to the name on the picture). To me, this is downright misrepresentation and it really irks me that they could make such a big mistake and ruin their otherwise perfectly good track record. I hope the management quickly rectify such mistakes and live up to its fine history.\n",

The sea grouper fillet was good too. I love the homemade noodles - perfect for the occasion. The only blemish was the Spanish pork was a tad too salty. But the attentiveness of the service staff + atmosphere saved the day \ud83d\ude18 Definitely back for dim sum soon. Thank you.\n\nWe had family dinner here tonight. This is one of the famous names that's been around for decades. Amazing - only the best can survive the test of time, economic cycles, and crisis. And lei garden is one of these names!\n\nThe food, service, and overall experience reflect its Michelin awards consistently received over the years.\n\nDelicious in every menu that I ordered  especially fried/grilled food.\nMenu that I like are crispy pork, abalone, fried scallop, and zucchini with pork. Moreover, mango sago and sesame ball are so good!\n\nAll the dishes didn't fail us. We tried Peking duck and roast duck. Both are nice and we didn't regret ordering.  Love it and already recommended it to many friends. We were served by Fong and we were served greatly by her and others. Thank you\n\nIts one restaurant to go for fine authentic Cantonese Cuisines and Dim Sum dishes from HK, since 1987 in SG.\n\nFor me, i like their array of dim sum dishes that include Deep-Fried Scallop, Siew Mai, Crystal Dumpling and Deep-Fried Shrimp Wonton that are good in terms of texture and flavours.\n\nOthers like Carrot Cake, Lotus Rice and Xiao Long Bao needs more attention from the chefs to not overcooked them and to serve them at correct temperature.\n\nOverall, restaurant has an elegant setting with modern oriental influence, but semi-circle bench sofa not comfortable. Service staffs wasnt attentive and impatient, probably due the overwhelming crowd on Sunday afternoon.\n",

Even my two kids are not impressed or satisfied with the food here.\n\nThe dim sum items for unlimited orders are really not enough to choose from and I don\u2019t see any dumplings with scallops or other fillings but mainly prawns or pork. Verdict for dumplings: 7/10 (nice but not impressed)\n\nSoup is limited to one serving per pax so we ordered 3 Shark\u2019s fin soup and 1 Sweet Corn & Carrot soup. Soup is delicious but sadly can only order once. Verdict for soup: 9/10\n\nMains is limited to order of 3 items once only so we ordered garlic roasted chicken, sliced fish with seasonal veg and wok-fried prawns with pine mushrooms. Food is delicious but portion for the chicken is slightly smaller than expected. Verdict for mains: 8/10\n\nLastly, we are told to order desserts for last order. I wanted to try out the Warm Red Bean Bisque but it is unavailable so kind of disappointed so I ordered the Chilled Osmanthus Jelly instead. My Godma ordered the Chilled Mango Cream with Sago and Pomelo. Verdict for desserts: 6/10 (not bad but not impressed)\n\nComplains: No restroom inside this restaurant, have to use the public toilet in the building or at the MRT station which is a distance away.\n\nI will definitely not return to this restaurant or recommend to anyone as it is too expensive and too much restriction in their ordering and there is no special item such as lobster or scallops or abalone or bamboo clams.\n\nLunch dim sum Buffet review- Food is decent. Service is excellent. Shark fin soup, dumplings and egg tarts are fantastic.\n\nHowever I do have some complains:\n- Xiao long bao is restricted to 1 serving per table. Meaning only 1 pc per person!\n- no steamed pork ribs\n- the e-fu noodles are dry and tasteless.\n- some orders, mainly the fried ones are forgotten.\n\nWent for weekend dim sum buffet. Ran into other customers who also went to the wrong restaurant. Would be great if they place a signage at the grand restaurant to redirect customers to the dimsum place. Sufficient variety but nothing that stands out. Good place for your first dim sum buffet if you have more people and you can order different items.\n\nCelebrated my grandmother's birthday on a public holiday. There was 4 wait staff and 3-4 tables of customers, service was sufficiently quick. Food was very good, except the peking duck not crispy and ice sweet and sour pork not cold enough. There are many food items which look good on photo.\n\n1st time trying. Just next to Farrer Park MRT station. Food is generally good, service  staff are friendly and the serving speed is within 15 mins. The deep fried kueh teow is special, but if you wanna eat it crispy, should not pour too much sauce on it, else, it will be soggy pretty fast.\n\nThink there is Amex promotion going on , 50% discount for 2 paxs, 33% discount for 3 paxs, and 25% discount for 4 paxs, etc.\n",

A must-visit for those seeking a perfect blend of taste, presentation, and ambiance.

Food came fast but when we needed to get help from the waiters, it took quite a while.\n\nThe presentation of the dishes was impeccable, and the flavors were simply delightful.\n\nThe smoky char siew, in particular, was a highlight of the meal. Its perfect balance of smokiness and tenderness made it an unforgettable dish that I would highly recommend to anyone visiting this establishment.\n\nWhat truly elevated my visit was the exceptional service provided by Desmond. His attentiveness and professionalism went above and beyond to ensure our dining experience was exceptional. I highly recommend this restaurant for a fantastic culinary experience!\n\nGreat service and impressively plated and flavoured food! Got the set menu and loved the crispy fish skin - soup tasted like the crab accompaniment. Dessert (not pictured) was melon balls with Hokkaido milk, very refreshing after a filling sequence of dishes.\n\nThe most creative dish of the night goes to the signature cigar roll. Overall, interesting blend of flavors though some can taste 'heavy'. Food is good, service is prompt and professional\n",

Their commitment to ensuring our comfort was evident through the constant refilling of our tea, which was done discreetly and efficiently, ensuring that our conversation flowed uninterrupted just like the tea in our cups.\n\nThe staff\u2019s professionalism contributed to the overall sophistication of the evening. The harmonious blend of delicious food and excellent service at Min Jiang truly sets the gold standard for fine dining. It\u2019s a restaurant I would recommend without hesitation and one that I eagerly look forward to revisiting.\n\nCame here to celebrate friend\u2019s birthday. Service staff is really attentive and environment is pleasant. Enjoyed the soup made with the remainder of the duck. Overall it\u2019s an enjoyable fine dining experience.\n\nWent for lunch on a Monday after getting married! The atmosphere was fantastic as the moment you step in, you are greeted by the friendly service staff and shown to your seat. The decor and design of the restaurant was beautiful and had a very tranquil feel to it.\n\nWe had the privilege of being served by Ms Lin Leng Lyang, who was professional and warm throughout the whole lunch. She  gave great recommendations for our party size, and we were all full but not over stuffed by the end of the lunch.\n\nThe food itself was really delicious, and I had way more than what I uploaded in the photos, but we were more interested in eating the dishes as soon as they hit the table. Overall, you won't go wrong with anything you order here.\n\nPricing is, of course, slightly to the higher side, not your everyday lunch or dinner option, but you definitely pay for what you get!\n\n10/10 would go back for special occasions!\n\nA wonderful evening spent in one of the most beautiful and homey restaurant in Singapore. We loved the food and ambience every time we visit. The place is always bustling with life and the service is always nice. Thank you to manager Eileen for the amazing hospitality, we also would like to thank Ebenezer for taking care of us this evening. We will be back.\n\nthe roasted duck is no where comparing to what I had in Beijing. i know is not fair to say so. skin not crispy enough n didn't slice thin enough. at least too thick to dip w sugar. meat too dry. maybe sg ducks not fat enough?? no fruit/wood aroma neither...\nThe place is too cold. not only the air-con temperature. also the material of the furniture especially the table. im having difficulties to put my hands/elbows on the table while eating. and it makes the duck cold after Chef sliced it in front of us. totally defeat the purpose of serving it hot when it's fresh out of the oven.\nanyway nice place for gathering.carrot cake n dim sum is nice. others dishes average only.\n",

(It should at least taste more like crab than prawn when it cost $60 for only eight pieces.) The signature Teochew dumpling was good though, with its fragrantly fried pork, mushrooms and chives filling.\n\nThe freshness and quality of food is not as great as compared to other branch. The beef has a stagnant smell and it does not has a great texture as compared to raffles town club Chinese restaurant and imperial Peking at paragon. The dim sum is not flavourful and the texture is not great too. The quality is surprisingly not fantastic. The ambience is not that bad but food quality has way to go.\n\nThe waitress did not take some of my orders and we decided not to wait. In addition, she even told us the wrong information of the delicacies she is recommending after much clarification. She is so blur.\n\nUpscale Teochew restaurant with large windows. Exorbitant prices but very small portions. Felt shortchanged. \u8766\u68d7 prawn ball was too moist and way overpriced for the quality. \u6f6e\u5dde\u8814\u4ed4\u70d9 was too oily. The only saving grace was the \u201csatay\u201d sauce stir fried beef in kailan. Beef was chunky and tender.\n\nWhile the food is very good esp the marinated duck, the bamboo clams and the smoked tea chicken, I was very annoyed with the service.  Was drinking wine and wanted to take things slow but waitresses constantly trying to clear our dishes.  Please respect people who wish to drink wine and eat their meals slowly.  It\u2019s not a hawker\u2026.\n\nGreat service. Despite being so busy staff were very attentive. Food was of high quality. Ion was a nice place to be in. Very kid friendly.\n",

The waiter knees that we were busy eating Chili crab so they served our veggies and Hokkien mee after we almost finish our crab. This is the first time ever I had this thoughtful service. Definitely will be back again to explore more dishes!\n\nDidn\u2019t know where to go for dinner at Capitol piazza, we saw this restaurant facing the escalator in front of us, we took the escalator up and went to give this restaurant a try.\n\nFrom the outside, we thought it was not crowded, until we went in and realise that it was actually quite full of diners in there.\n\nOrdered a fish head curry and roasted pork belly.\n\nThe fish head curry was hitting the spot, right on point! Tasty and the curry spice is superb!\n\nHowever, the roasted pork belly, we find it falling short compared to some other Chinese restaurants out there. Hence only 4 stars were given.\n\nWill return to try other dishes. The sambal and prawn paste chicken are exceptional. Dessert wise, I love the orh nee. It was not sweet and the flavour was perfect.\nGenerally, other dishes are delivered decently.\nService was warm and prompt.\n\nWe went to celebrate my dad birthday.  The food was ok but pricey. But service was not fantastic as we felt that we are being rush through the meal, the restaurant was not full, but they are constantly clearing our plates and asking if we still need it.\n\nWent in with a large group, too bad the private room was not available when we book.\n\nFood is ok but service is not bad. Their volcano chicken is ok a bit dry. Price is a bit higher but guess it is because of the location.\n",

The managers, Kenny, Dennis and Raymond were all very friendly. Remember to book your seat before you go.\n\nHad dinner. Ordered 3 of the chef recommended dishes. Food average. Only the tofu is good - soft and has a tinge of egg taste. Quite special. Stew chicken with bitter gourd - despite seen a recommended dish has nothing special. The taro too is pretty tasteless and hard. The sweet and sour pork and fried rice pretty average.\n\nDim sum was generally good, deserving of 5 stars. BUT if I were to compare it to Empire Fine Chinese Cuisine (same level, just next door) some dishes of Empire\u2019s dim sum are better flavoured and ingredients seems of better quality (like the roasted pork belly, duck and char siew. Empire wins hands down!!) Their char siew soh was good! Crispy yet soft, pastry and meat ratio was good! Do not order the fried white bait. It was bland and the batter tasted weird. Service was very efficient and staff were very attentive when you need something - even tho it was full house!\n\nCame here for breakfast. My favourites are fried glutinous rice, char leong (fried fritters dough wrapped in steam rice noodle roll) and their roast pork and duck.\nIt's better to make reservation and all your party need to be present before they let you in because once you ordered, they serve fast and you are expected to leave once you finished and do not linger. There is always a queue even though u made reservation, you still have to wait.\n\nMade a reservation and the staff on the line got the date wrong, but thankfully, a staff called to confirm the reservation closer to the date and that was fixed.\n\nThe food was definitely great overall! I personally really enjoyed the following:\n\u2705 Teochew Style Crispy Noodle with Sugar & Vinegar\n\u2705 Seafood with Vermicelli in Claypot\n\u2705 Crispy Roasted Pork Belly\n\u2705 Braised Tien Tsin Cabbage with Minced Ham\n\u2705 Peking Duck\n\nSteamed Bamboo Clam with Garlic & Chili was $18++ each and it was nice, but think it\u2019s way too pricey. My family members also enjoyed their Chilled Pig Trotter Jelly!\n\nFood was served promptly, piping hot and delicious! The service staff who attended to us were mostly attentive with speedy responses.\n\nHowever, it was slightly frustrating as I had pre-ordered their mooncake and had made multiple requests for this to be brought to our table since we were dining in, but in the end I had to queue to collect my mooncake after the meal while my family waited for me.\n\nOverall still a great experience and would definitely recommend!\n",

Had the set lunch and it was a sumptuous dim sum and Cantonese style dishes. Great layback ambience. Very good attentive service\n\nQuite disappointed with the flavour or the food. Quality is good, like the prawns were juicy and fresh, but the flavour was meh. Salmon skin was incredibly crunchy though. Sure we were there for an event but expected a lot more flavour wise. Surprisingly enjoyed the black sesame ice cream.\n\nTook the sharing 70$ tasting menu and the food was delicious , so as the view from the inside and outdoors.\nLoved the deep friend salmon skin and shrimp soup.

In fact most of the dishes portion is relatively small for that price range.\n\nService experience is also under expectation. We sat at a place with a blind spot and the service staff are not attentive to our request. I have to walk to the counter for help. Suggest to provide some electronic buzzing system if the restaurant has under staff to serve the customer.\n\nCame across this place via Google search.\nSuppose to come here for DimSum. But only available in the afternoon.\nBut we still decided to stay for dinner.\n\nFood is not bad, very well presented. Taste is pretty ok especially the chicken and the laksa prawn.\n\nBut when comes to the service by the restaurant staff, I gotta give them a lower rating. It certainly under expectations.\n\nFirstly, they are not welcoming at all when we were at the counter waiting to be seated.\n\nSecondly, the waiter is not attentive. They have no smile at all (which is important in service line).\nWhen we request for tea or request him to add hot water, he just came and grab the teapot and go off with super monotonous attitude. When we say thank you, the staff don't even response at all (basically like a robot).\n\nTherefore, I don't think we will come back again. The food is ok but definitely not the best compare to the same level restaurant elsewhere. Also the service staff and their attitude didn't impress us despite the restaurant is not busy at all (only 3 tables including our table).\n\nCame for lunch, excellent staff service and quality food. Recommend to come \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\n\nThe food and atmosphere was good but one of the staff had a really bad attitude and kept showing us black face.

If bread can be served so hard, what else can customer expect from the rest of the dishes.\nPork loin was tough and had no veg. Mushroom soup tasted nothing like mushroom. Mussels were fresh but too salty and small. Escargots were too salty too. Duck confit was quite tender. Steak was tender but lacking in presentation. Staff were  attentive. During reservation, I indicated that it\u2019s a friend birthday but there wasn\u2019t any complimentary dessert or wishes on the dessert plate. On a whole, 3 of us were disappointed with the experience. Wont consider coming back.\n\nWas lunch there on Wednesday. Expect to see less crowd since is the mid of the week , who knows they are full house throughout lunch period. Luckily we made reservation in advance.\nWe\u2019ve opt for $45++ 3 course set lunch, each of us ordered different dish.\nExcept the poached grouper taste so so and they serve ONE piece cheese as The cheese of the day\u2019s dessert that looks so minimalist , the whole lunch experience was great, cozy ambience, service staffs are attentive in just right way.\nThey serve good wine too.\n\nEstablished in July 2009, Bistro Du Vin (BDV) is fully committed to delivering a truly authentic dining experience in a French Bistro. No effort or expense has been spared in creating an ambience typical of a similar establishment in France, from the furnishing right down to the convivial service style, music and memorabilia decorating its walls. Wash down the meal with a bottle of wine from Bistro Du Vin\u2019s simple yet comprehensive wine list which features a variety of French wines.\n\nGreat food, intoxicating booze and friendly staff \u2013 what more can you ask for?\n\nStaff were friendly and always prompt in our questions and required service. Awesome!!\n\nService and food was on point, love the braised beef cheek in red wine that was served in a Le Creuset pot. My friends had the duck confit and it was equally good. Ambience was nice with dimmed lighting but can get a little noisy with all the ongoing conversations from diners. Restaurant was full when we were there for dinner so best to make reservation in advance.\n\nDelicious food. Nice environment and good service. The grilled pork rack was delicious! The meat was lean yet tender. The rib eye steak was good but a tad too salty.\n",

Cold angel hair pasta was excellent, everything else was rather unmemorable. The restaurant was packed for lunch and the atmosphere was very noisy; we could not have a tabletop conversation without leaning into each other to hear ourselves. For the price point, much better food was expected. Better food would also justify the mighty long waits between each course. Lastly, petit 4s were just a canele and a chocolate disc each (no more financier, at least for the set lunch)\n\nLove the angel hair pasta with caviar! I literally licked the plate!!! So good. The Apple \u201ctart\u201d is really good, so crispy and top a little ice cream on each bite sent me to heaven. It\u2019s worth the price, the whole experience is exquisite and I was there for lunch. I have to go for a dinner next chance I am back in Singapore.\n\nNice ambience, service is good. Food is good  but not surprising. Recommended the pork jowl, well cook, very soft, moist and tasty. Angel hair pasta texture is very good except the truffle oil fragrance overpower the pasta.\nRoasted gambas also recommended. We are eating course meal, I am not super impressed overall, maybe the ala carte menu might be better.\n\nI had high expectations of this place. Our meal started off very well, the bread was fantastic. Appetiser was great, the best being the cold truffle pasta. Mains was a letdown. Carbonara is mere 3 pieces of pasta sitting on a generous portion of pork slices. Pork however was tough. Apple tart with ice cream was great. Staffs were friendly, however we waited very long between each course.\n\nCelebrated our wedding anniversary here.\n\nThe restaurant and service staff are attentive to our dietary request, and the food are lovely.\n\nWith the pricing and the generous portion of the truffles. It really made my husband's day.\n\nMy gluten free pasta was seriously good and I could easily have another one. Another highlight was the pork and love how tender is was, as good as beef.\n\nEven though we told them last upon arrival that we came for our anniversary, they still got us a little celebratory cake that so yummy.\n\nOverall, nothing were disappointing.\n",

Today , it had a horrid bitterness from the char and was really flat and tiny. Seemed  smaller than 300g being dwarfed by the chips. The creamed spinach actually tasted slimy. French onion soup had an unnatural sweetness. And the chips were sad and hard . Not the moreish chips I remembered!\nService was professional but without any trace of warmth or sincerity. Like we were an imposition.\nThe tables around us were full of very loud and noisy people which totally spoilt the atmosphere of calm dinnertime.\nAfter the hefty bill and disappointing food ,we decided that we will not return again.\n",

French onion soup\n2. escargots\n3.duck\n\nThis is our 2nd visit. We love the food and the fact that it's a non pretentious place. We've felt really comfortable on both our visits. For starters we had the escargot and bone marrow. It was really good. We ordered 2 rib-eye with bearnaise sauce and a ravioli for mains.\n\nThe only thing we were not really comfortable with was how close the table next to us was. Overall we had a lovely time.\n\nStepping inside Brasserie Gavroche, it had a nice old rustic charm to it, with the vintage looking wooden furnitures and 50s style hanging lights. Not a typical fine dinning setting but more of a simple sit down dinning for a close group of friends to meet up and chat over a hearty meal.\n\nThe restaurant serves some of the more classical French dishes such as foil gras and escargot, with choices of either cold or warm appetisers dishes. It seems the white asparagus is in season now and we ordered 1/2 dozen of escargots and the foie gras (served with toasted country bread) to go with it for our starters.\n\nThe escargot was baked with parsley and garlic butter. Classical proven dish that couldn\u2019t really go wrong, but nothing outstanding either. Felt that the escargots was a tad over baked for me as the meat was slightly tough. Overall the taste was rich and flavourful, and the leftover butter oil makes great dip for the bread. 3/5\n\nThe white asparagus was served with Parma ham, Benedict eggs and hollandaise sauce. The asparagus was crunchy and juicy, and would have paired perfectly with the savoury ham, if not for the lingering bitter vegetal aftertaste coming from the asparagus. Not sure what the Benedict egg and hollandaise sauce bring to the dish, didn\u2019t think the sauce went well with the dish. 3/5\n\nThe foie gras serving was generous! Some of the inferior foie gras I tasted had a powdery and crumbly texture with a strong metallic iron aftertaste lingering. But the foie gras served here was of a much higher quality. Smooth and buttery with a right proportion of fat; lighter in taste but yet flavourful (from the meat) and rich without being too overpowering. It left you wanting to try more as it didn\u2019t have the saturating greasy feeling. The yellow portion of the foie gras in the picture was actually solidified fat and simply pure decadent! I would strongly encourage everyone to at least try a small bit of it to savour the slow melting of pure animal fat essence in your mouth! The reddish condiment at the side was some sort of dried fruit puree and the slight sweet-sourness went very well with the savoury foie gras. The only disappointment I had with the dish was the hard country bread, but otherwise excellent dish. 4.5/5\n\nWe ordered 3 mains for sharing:  lamb tongue (not in regular menu), beef tartare and ribeye steak\n\nPersonally I prefer my lamb to be grilled for that rich \u201cmuttony\u201d favour. This lamb tongue was stewed and served on top of potato mash. I chose this main as lamb tongue was an interesting cut I had not tried before despite the cooking style. The meat was tender with a bit of chewiness to it. Taste was delicately light and I hardly get any \u2018muttony\u2019 favour in it. This was a very nice dish albeit it didn\u2019t suit my personal taste preference. 3.5/5, only because of personal taste preference, otherwise the dish deserved a 4.\n\nThe beef tartare was disappointing. I loved the Angus beef for its \u2018sashimi freshness quality\u2019 with a slight chewy texture. But the condiment was a tad overpowering from the pungent shedded onion and the overly tangy dressing. I felt that the taste was off balanced in the mouth, skewing more towards the condiment. Texture was good, chewiness of the meat went well with the onion crunchiness. The bread was disappointing hard. 3/5\n\nSaving the best for the last, the ribeye was the highlight of the meal for us. Perfectly grilled to medium rare with a pinkish tender center (an expected standard for any high end restaurant) and a slight crusty charred exterior. Decent fat content and the juice of the meat was well sealed during the cooking. Every mouthful was a fine balance of favour and texture. Tenderness of the meat interspersed with crispy charred parts, full bodied and juicy meat favour elevated by the light seasoning. It also went very well with the B\u00e9arnaise sauce as it presented a different taste profile. Just to show you don\u2019t need super expensive beef cut or A5 wagyu to enjoy a premium quality steak. 5/5\n\nWent for dinner\nOrdered the onion soup, lamb rack and mussels\nHad an amazing time wining and dining\nThe soup was delicious and fragrant\nLamb was very flavorful\nMussels was very fresh and tasty\n\nA Belgian in a French Brasserie\u2026 what could possibly go wrong.\n\nNothing actually. Superb business lunch. Relaxing atmosphere, warm traditional interior, capable and attentive staff, and the food - oh man - the food!!\n\nTried the morel mushroom soup and the evergreen Angus Beef tartare. Sublime! Just the way I\u2019d expect it in the best restaurant in Paris, or Brussels. And even the fries are \u201cBelgian Approved\u201d.\n\nThanks guys\n",

The restaurant provided a casual vibe, making it a good choice for that night. The dishes we had were all amazing, and I liked the Boeuf Bourguignon the most. Jon (sorry if I didn\u2019t spell it correctly) who served our table was super energetic and elevated our dining experience to another level. Will definitely visit again if I travel there.\n\nIf you are looking for a casual, chic French dining then So France would be it.\n\nManager has great PR skill, chat with most patrons effortlessly. Offered us complimentary appetizer and cold cut platter which was a lovely gesture.\n\nFriendly staff yet they do not hover around the table to clear empty plates (unless you are all done), which leave much privacy for chats to take place.\n\nEnjoyed the food. Set lunch was good deal. And their ala carte mains, though seem pricey but big portion is good enough for sharing (think 300gm steak or 3 decent size chicken).\n\nWill return with friends again (this is my 2nd time) because of the lovely vibes and decor. They allow us to linger past lunch time without chasing us off (very kind of them).\n\nAlways a great experience at So France. Food is impeccable, great selection of alcohol. Will definitely be ordering the fruit-infused french rum next time.\n\nThank you Shiva and team!\n\nI visited on 17 Jun at 1pm. Had the Duck Hash and Rum Baba.\nIt was my first time having French food in a casual setting. The only previous experience I had with French food were just those stuffy fine dining places, which honestly sucked for me. Too little food, too much pomp and airs.\nSO France changed my perception of French food; French food can be tasty and enjoyable!\nThe Duck Hash was great. The potatoes really sucked up the flavour of the jus, and the freshness of the yolk in the poached egg complemented the entire dish perfectly.\nThe Rum Baba was a surprise. I was worried that the sweet rum poured onto the citrus-flavoured cake will make it soggy or fall apart easily, but it didn\u2019t! The integrity of the cake held up well while soaking up the sweetness and flavour of the rum. They were generous with the rum too.\n\nThe service staff was excellent. Cozy, quiet place to date.\n\nOrdered the truffle soup which has soft vegetables & beef inside covered by a pastry.\n\nBeef Bourguignon was soft with a wine reduction that made it intense without the beefy taste.\n\nI'll skip the Steak Frites and order the duck or coq au vin if I'm here next time.\n\nReally want to thank the staff for taking care of me and an excellent dining experience.\n",

The ambiance felt like a page out of a Parisian romance novel, with soft lights and a melody of enchanting tunes. The menu, a poetic composition of flavors, offered a dance of taste that left me in awe. The waitstaff, dressed in elegant attire, choreographed a dining experience that was nothing short of a culinary ballet. Each dish, a masterpiece plated with precision, tasted like a symphony of harmonious ingredients. If you're yearning for a dining escapade that feels like a rendezvous with gourmet dreams, Les Amis is the destination to indulge your palate in a poetic feast!\n\nOrdered the dark chocolate cake and it was so delicious! The cake is placed on top of a tart shell which is very special. Almonds are super fragrant too.\nHope that delivery service can be included in the future and handwriting on the chocolate could be better \ud83d\ude05\n\nHad a very pleasant dining experience at Les Amis. Patrick, our server, was very friendly, attentive, and entertaining. He suggested a perfect wine to have with the steak. He also patiently explained every dish to us. The amuse bouche tartalette with bacon and mushrooms was a good introduction to the meal. Notable food from our dinner are the French egg, crab souffl\u00e9, simmered celery root, salted brioche, herb sorbet, and poached pears. The caviar that was thoughtfully used in some of the dishes is an interesting addition of a complex salt flavor; it did not overwhelm the taste of the other ingredients. The wagyu was tender but I expected a bit more flavor and it lacked a bit of surprise. The herb sorbet is most interestingly a refreshing palate cleanser. Overall, it was a memorable and pleasant gastronomic experience.\n\nTruly Michelin 3 stars! Excellent food with great creativity,  best service, excellent wine pairing, and the deserts are the best.  Not cheap but it is worth it!\n\nEverything was impeccable, the food was great and the portions were generous, great wine pairings and amazing service.\nToni and the team were very kind and took genuine care of us.\nThe Blu Lobster appetizer, their sour dough, the riz de veu and the cheese course were divine.\nHighly recommended.\n",

There are 3 options/dining experiences you can choose from. I went for the most comprehensive one - 3 starters, 1 main with chef\u2019s premium ingredient and 1 dessert.\n\nWhile I can see how Rhubarb has been able to maintain its 1 star for so many years, I struggled a bit to find some key differentiating factor versus other French contemporary Michelin places. Good food nonetheless.\n\nService was really good. The dishes kept coming fast and I was done with my entire dinner in an hour.\n\nAll in all a very good dining place. If you haven\u2019t been there, it is definitely worth going.\n\nThe 4-course lunch Omakase was very very satisfying, with interesting notes and flavours that I\u2019m pleasantly surprised by. I also really enjoyed my chat with Joseph as a solo diner, so that my lunch was a little livelier. I had an absolutely lovely time and would return again.\n\nDecided to go last min as I suddenly met a long time friend. She said she didn\u2019t want to eat something too heavy. The starters were mainly seafood and fruits, which opened up her appetite after a full day of hard stress work. The main was a tender slowed cooked beef. Dessert was a coconut sorbet I think (?). Accompanied the meal with a Riesling. We quite enjoyed the night.\nFunny note, one of the appetisers is a mix of fruits and seafood, I confused the apple with an olive. The taste was good though. Please don\u2019t change the dish because of my comment.\n\nFood are all tastefully plated and delicious. They were kind to ask me if I have dietary restrictions and I told them I would like to have all cooked food. So they made changes for me to replace the lightly torched scallops to cooked crab stick for appetiser. Really appreciate it:) every dishes were all well explained and executed.\n\nOutstanding food, worth its Michelin star. Service is friendly. The atmosphere is a little bit let down by the lighting and impersonal musical background. Overall a very nice place to have an amazing meal. Prices very reasonable.\n",

End it with creme brule that's deliciously crunchy and soft in the inside.\n\nJune 2023:-\nBooked for 8pm dinner and we were the only table at that time. It was a birthday celebration but was so disappointed with the food this time, not consistent. Downgraded from 5 to 2 stars.\n\nOct 2022:-\nGreat dining experience. Love the foie gras and duck confit.  Satisfying meal. I would go again to try other dishes.\n\nTaratata Brasserie is a great place for traditional French food in the heart of Singapore. We enjoyed the carefully sourced wholesome and fresh ingredients. This allowed the meats to be lightly seasoned for the natural flavors to come through. The various sauces and condiments were hand-crafted in the kitchen by the master chef. The curated French wines were excellent, unlike the new world wines that are rushed to the table by adding sulfur and sugar. Overall, the experience at Taratata Brasserie reminded us of the leisurely meals we had in Paris and Europe during our holidays.\n\nHad a wonderful experience at Taratata. Service was fast and we finished everything on the plates. Would highly recommend the foie gras, duck confit, salad and escargot. The kurobuta pork was nice as well but it reminded me of chinese char Siew.\n\nThe pesto escargot sauce was great but the escargot itself was a bit chewy. the steak was a miss. No taste, very hard to chew on, we asked for medium but we received it quite too well done. Would suggest to try other surrounding restaurants instead\n",

After the meal when I went home I then realized my reservation was for the next day lol!!!!\n\nBut the waiters was so polite that when I told him I made a reservation for two pax, they obviously couldn't find it but they still got me a nice table without embarrasing me by telling me no reservation was made. ^^\nPLEASE share the story with the chef, he obviously didn't know what happened cos I just stood up and wanted to leave cos I felt a bit neglected, when he asked me how was the food I said very good and left in a hurry. :p\n\nFood was obviously excellent and service was impeccable, thanks so much for for everything, we will be back~\n",

Food was good - subtle flavours that meshed really well together, and beautiful presentation. The lamb in particular was executed perfectly. I also loved the mignardises and that the kitchen was open but calm and not chaotic.\n\nHere for birthday lunch, cosy setting but nothing much to shout about for the interior. Had the lunch menu, food is good but nothing really outstanding that I can remember. Hmm maybe Cherry Gazpacho is quite special. Perhaps its a normal lunch menu, maybe should come back again for special collaborations when they have one.\n\nSome changes to the menu itself. Menu is very refreshing, akin like the Spring season. As always, hostess & chef hospitality are the best. To us, their food, restaurant atmosphere, relationships between staffs & us are what made us being their regulars.\n\nA very nice ambiance intimate dining room that caters to about 6 pax capacity and some counter seats for perhaps, Omakase? Set menus are definitely French and heavy on seafood.\n\nThe service was nicely paced, dishes was explained, and professional. Their wine recommendation was good as well.\n\nThe presentation of each dish is where the star is. The taste is ok, balanced.\n\nRecommended for date night, probably not the best suit for big  groups or business dinner unless you reserve private room.\n\nWe booked the restaurant to celebrate our 25th year wedding anniversary.\nWe took the $268 set dinner and added on foie gras ($20) for one of our dinner set, and changed one of the dessert to cheese truffle.\nAll the dishes are wonderfully made, and even the bread basket (uniquely in a cloth pouch) is warm and hot, with specially made bread spread.\nThe service is amazing and special mentioned to Louis who has made our experience really enjoyable.\nWe also had Yamanaka-san who personally served us for one of the dishes.\nThe downside for the place is that it is a small restaurant and seatings are quite closed to one another. It's no issue for us and we mingled with other patrons.\nHighly recommended.\n",

Their duck congee was great! Their mashed potato taste great!! However, the grilled fish was not good. Not much taste and dry.\n\nMy friend said their beer is no taste and just like water. I didn\u2019t drink it but just feedback from friend.\n\nEscargot and chicken are good. Souffl\u00e9 looks normal but apparently not cooked. It\u2019s empty inside. Been to So France many times and this evening seems very much under staffed. Waitress is very polite but getting too busy towards the end of the dinner.\n\nGreat food, better than great actually. Had the quinoa salad, sparkling water and an espresso. The service was impeccable, friendly and helpful staff, the automostre is excellent. Went for a business lunch and it was a good environment for talking. The only downside is all the beautiful, well dressed people to distract you but that\u2019s a bonus isn\u2019t it!\n\n5++ stars\n\nYou can find decent French breakfast and great coffee here. The restaurant is big with lots of seats, staffs are friends and service is good, best time to visit is during weekend morning and you can enjoy your breakfast and coffee without being rushed to get out. They sell French cooking/ baking/ chocolate/ tea  just outside the restaurant, it\u2019s a good place to get some French essentials if you needed some.\n\nCosy ambience and food was fantastic, we had the festive set (chose the smoked salmon salad + lemon sole+ chocolate souffl\u00e9), plus ala carte items: salad nicoise and the $140 meat platter, but what really impressed us on top of the food was the impeccable service and warm hospitality from the staff, Eika.

A delightful journey for your taste buds awaits.\n\nA nice French restaurant for date nights and special occasions. Unfortunately, the food quality was rather mediocre for the price point. The ingredients didn\u2019t taste fresh and some tasted like they were frozen. The raw oysters were very good though. Service was very casual.\n\nVisited the restaurant for the 3rd time. Food is consistently good and the service was great too. We made a mistake with the member rewards and the staff helped to resolve the issue promptly without much interruption to our meals. Recommend to try the tooth fish and truffle fries!!\nFrench onion soup is good too.\n\nNice ambience. Food is expected of an authentic French Restaurant. Ordered dinner set menu and opted for:\nEntr\u00e9e: Foie Gras\nMain: Lobster Risotto\nDessert: Tarte Varlhona\nFoie Gras was good and so was the Lobster Risotto. The dessert was for me somewhat ordinary.\nOverall food was good and ambience is great. However, from a price perspective with each of us spending over $100 per pax, I thought it could have been better.\n\nFood is reasonably priced and tasty! Place is rather small and wasn\u2019t as busy as compared to other restaurants on a weekend night. However, even when the restaurant was not packed, the staff was inattentive and lack proactiveness. Service could definitely be improved drastically. Some of their male staff especially, could certainly work on their tonality and facial expressions when serving food to customers.\n",

Cut out looking very French,  it brings out that bonjour feel.\n\n3 of us ordered 3 different dishes to try.  The fish,  the pork and the beef cheek and a French Onion soup.\n\nTaste wise, they were above average.  The fish stood out the most.  It had all the lovely condiments accompanying.\n\nThe beef n pork was tasty enough n flavours were intense.\n\nThe soup was slightly let down.\n\nPrice was surprisingly on the high side for a small residential setup like this.  Parking was not too difficult though.\n\nOhh... they also provided a cut-up baguette with butter.\n\nGenerally, a nice cozy place to visit if there is a good reason to celebrate.\n\nQuaint and very homely atmosphere. Good food.\n\n[19 Sep 2023]\nbread - 9/10, very addictive.\n\nescargot - 8/10, good\nportabello - 8/10, very nice\n\nbeef cheeks in red wine ($36) - 9/10, fantastic red wine sauce. replaced with short rib today.\npork ($36) - 8/10, great mash and nice mushroom sauce.\nsteak ($58) - 8/10, NZ Black Angus ribeye\n\nlemon tart ($12) - 6/10, not quite crunchy, the mousse wasn't fantastic\napple tart ($12) - 8/10, very nice\n\nSurprisingly good french food in a small quaint neighborhood. French onion soup was nice and cheesy and duck confit also was cooked really well.\n\nThere's also a complimentary bread basket which has a just nice portion size. Other restaurants we've been too, it's either too much or too little \ud83e\udd23\n\n5 stars for food and atmosphere. Quite little place with great settings. The duck confit was absolutely delicious.\n\nRun by a local husband and wife team, the French Ladle is a quaint little restaurant serving authentic French food.\nHelping of the much lauded foie gras was both generous and yummy. The delicious escargot paired extremely well with the crispy bread to soak up the sauce.\nBoth the mains of barramundi and ribeye steak were decent but a mite too bland.\nDesserts of apple pie and ice cream rounded up a hearty lunch\nAll prices are nett with no GST or service charge.\nBest to book in advance as restaurant is small\n",

We went for the 3-course set lunch and were satisfied with the quality of ingredients used, great cooking, and exceptional service provided by Rimo, Charlene, and team. Recommended dishes: Escargots in garlic butter, Lamb chops, Pear Melba.\n\nWe celebrated a birthday here and were delighted with the extra mile taken with the presentation of the desserts. Thanks to this meal, we\u2019ve found another authentic French steakhouse!\n\nI recently dined at \"Les Bouchons Rive Gauche,\" and it was an exquisite culinary experience. The highlight of the evening was their selection of red wine, which beautifully complemented the succulent steak.\n\nTo start, we savored the pan-seared duck liver, a dish that showcased exceptional freshness and a rich, melt-in-your-mouth texture. It was truly unforgettable.\n\nWe also indulged in a delightful off-menu item, the heated Camembert cheese, which emanated a delightful flavor due to its oven preparation. The combination of the gooey cheese and its subtle yet profound taste was a gastronomic delight.\n\nThe main course featured the Black Angus prime rib, which impressed with its perfectly balanced seasoning that enhanced the natural flavor of the beef. It was a prime example of culinary expertise.\n\nTo conclude this magnificent meal, we had the cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e, a dessert that was both light and zesty, providing the perfect sweet note to end our dining experience.\n\nThe ambiance and service at \"Les Bouchons Rive Gauche\" further added to the overall charm of the restaurant. If you're looking for an exceptional dining experience with an emphasis on quality, this is the place to be. I highly recommend it for anyone seeking an unforgettable culinary journey.\n\nwe did encounter a situation at our table. However, it\u2019s important to note that this issue was not related to how the restaurant was run; it was more of an outside factor. Despite this unexpected situation, the restaurant\u2019s staff handled it promptly and professionally, ensuring that it did not affect the overall dining experience. Their commitment to customer satisfaction and their adeptness in addressing unforeseen challenges further demonstrated the restaurant\u2019s dedication to providing a top-notch dining experience.\n\nBest steak we had as a family! Super value for money. So tender and juicy. Super good appetisers. Fantastic service!\n\nGood food, good service and good vibe. The lamb chop was nicely cooked and reminded us of what we had in France. Waitress was of good service. She made sure we were well taken care of.\n\nI had my birthday lunch here and the food was tres d\u00e9licieux! Special mention for the pan seared foie gras and the ribeye steak. Such depth of flavour at a great value, do check out their lunch set promo if you're coming by in the day.\n\nBig thank you to Rimo, Charlene and Jan for the impeccable service and attention to detail :)\n",

Great place for a date or a chill place to hang with your friends. Definitely highly recommended.\n\nwe had a pleasant dinner , one of the best mussel & suckling pig we ever had\n\nkey highlights of the food is , mussel , lamb , suckling pig , mussel was awesomely good , lamb was perfectly done & well seasoned  , suckling was so amazing crispy on skin tender and juicy mesf\n\nservice was great , something memorable is having a really cheerful person serving us .\n\noverall is a really decent meal , would really recommend the dishes stated above  .\n\nWe had our bff birthday celebration last night after reading so many good reviews of this place. My friends and I totally don\u2019t agree with all the good feedback, it doesn\u2019t justify with the taste of food and service that we have had a lot of not very pleasant experience in a fine dining restaurant. Is was our first encounter that Omakase main course and appetisers was served in sharing board just because we are party of 6? It was not served in a meticulous and refined way or any efforts in the presentation of the food. The indifferent of the whole team including the chef and servers was disappointing.\nWhen one of us mentioned that she is not in favour of shellfish, but she doesn\u2019t mind the lobster which all of us wouldn\u2019t mind the additional cost on top of our Omakase. She was served a vegetarian ( tomatoes and cheese salad ) as one of the appetiser instead of the lobster that the rest of us were receiving. Lack of communication and creativity even if they had misunderstood the food dietary needs in each and everyone of us. They could have clarified with us again. What we don\u2019t understand is, has the restaurant run out of ingredients that you have to serve a vegetarian salad? I even reconfirmed with the server if it\u2019s a vegetarian salad. After we had told the chef that we don\u2019t take foie gras, we were still served with a board of foie gras and pate together with ham and stuffs. To our disappointment, the whole portions of the first appetiser was reduced to half after they changed it. They made no efforts in creating something else to accord our food requirements. Overall quality of the food was not great and pleasing.  The pork was overcooked that it was so dry and chewy, the sea bass was too salty, had muddy taste and not fresh.\nThe servers were not well trained and not paying attention of the details in dressing the cutlery, they just simply put down the cutlery, my spoon and fork was crossed, not changing the cutlery in every courses and even put my spoon on my friend\u2019s bread plate. I have been using the same fork for the entire meal until dessert then I received a new fork. We were not offered salt and pepper when it comes to our beef and lamb. There wasn\u2019t any salt and pepper on our table which are ubiquitously paired on dining tables, this has resulted that we had to search and took the ground pepper ourselves, and we search everywhere there wasn\u2019t any salt at all. Non of the servers observed our needs. The whole restaurant was deserted and nobody was there to farewell us. This was the worst fine dine experience we had ever been and we would definitely not want to have our 2nd visit again.\n\nThe omakase was amazing I had the ocean trout tartare seared snapper and traditional cr\u00e8me caramel food was incredible the service is some of the best service I have ever experienced as someone who works as a chef in hospitality places like this are gems would highly recommend to anyone seeking great food and high level professional service\n\nWonderfully Flavorful, gorgeous presentations, our appetizers were simply delicious. Mains were good, desert too. Tiny space, AC a bit too strong and drafty, but really worth a visit.\nPrices are commensurate with food quality.\n",

Escargots were good and the starter prawns rather savoury. The crews were very lovely and even went all out to celebrate my parents' wedding anniversary with a complimentary cake, photo and card. :)\n\nI proposed to the love of my life in la brasserie last Sunday and it was a pleasant experience. The managers Alan, JJ and the team were accommodating, helpful, and hospitable during the planning process as well as on the day itself. They helped with many suggestions and allocated a suitably private and romantic table for us. Truly appreciated it. The food too was delicious, in particular loved the lobster roll and their starters. We got escargot and sauteed prawns which were cooked to perfection and seasoned well. My fiancee' friend and her friends's daughter was with us that night and the restaurant had a special children's menu which is definitely welcome since children may not appreciate fine dining as much. In addition, they brought out a coloring book for her. Definitely, family friendliness is something they have worked on.\n\nDeserts were delicious, and they provided a very beautiful chocolate cake with my proposal message free on the house. We had something called a lava cheesecake that I must warn is a bit deceptively named, with no liquid flowing out, but it was good nonetheless. Finally the staff were helpful in the proposal moment and taking photos. They even surprised us by printing and giving us some commemorative shots with a card from the restaurant to remember the day by.\n\nWould really recommend this place to others, and pro tip, this area tends to be less crowded on weekends, so if you have a urgent need for last minute booking for an event on a weekend, it's is definitely worth a shot checking them out\n\nHad a lovely birthday dinner celebration here recently. Appreciated the nice, classy restaurant decor,  and the very quiet environment with a bit of the bay view for table near the window.  Food was immaculately prepared. The dozen of escargot felt generous. Every bite with the meat, the bread and the tantalising garlic oil just warm the mouth and taste bud. The saut\u00e9ed prawns with chorizo was average. I was recommended to try their crispy duck confit and bordelaise beef cheeks, and had not regretted the decisions. They also have an extensive wine menu and some value for money bin wine that they wanted to clear stock of. Overall, I'd recommend this restaurant for a nice dinner date.\n\nExcellent food. High ceiling, romantic atmosphere. Take a stroll along Clifford Pier for the best view of Marina Bay Sands!\nDined in with Fullerton stay dining credits. Worth a visit.\n\nHave been dining at La Brasserie for the last 13 years .One thing consistently defines the place is the exceptionally high quality of food\n\nThe constant feedback from my non vegetarian guests has been stellar be it the sea food or steak or just other meat dishes\n\nBeing a vegetarian, I have enjoyed their salads, soups, risottos and local vegetarian dishes\n\nNOT A BIG FAN of their impossible plant dishes . Do not appeal to me and would recommend all of them to be removed from the menu\n\nWe recently went for dinner. The food as usual was high quality BUT what impressed me the most was that the service inspite of the post pandemic staff challenges was simply outstanding.\n\nAll credit to Mr Haizul, who has been watching over his F&B team and enabling them for success\n\nFairuz, Joy and Dorothy did an amazing job . More like being mind readers. Their attention to detail, making sure our orders were served right and even small customisation touches were highly commendable. We simply loved their high quality of service\n\nOverall a 5 + / 5 high quality dining experience.\n",

                  "reviews": "\n\nI had dinner here in June 2022. I commend the restaurant\u2019s efforts in the presentation of the food, but the flavors left much to be desired. The ingredients were high quality, yet somehow they didn\u2019t complement each other well enough to satisfy the palate.\n\nThe overall flavor profile of the food was acidic, most likely attributed to the green sauce that was present in most dishes. I would\u2019ve preferred a more rounded umami taste.\n\nWith the wine pairing, the bill came out to around 355 SGD \u2248 262 USD/pax. Not ridiculous for a 1-star Michelin restaurant, but the flavor combinations should be improved to live up to this price.\n\nWent for restaurant week and this is my first time to have lunch at Michelin star restaurant.\nIn general, the food is exquisite and have rich tastes. But some of the courses might be too salty or too sweet for me (Would like to rate 4.5 actually)\nWe seated at the bar counter which is around the open kitchen. It\u2019s a new experience for me when having fine dining.\n\nWe came here for an evening of modern French fusion and were not disappointed. The restaurant is an open kitchen concept where the diners all sit at counters that wrap around the central kitchen. It\u2019s all right but feels a little industrial and I would have preferred something a little more comfortable at this price point. They have a decent wine list and there is value to be had. The bread was nice and the variety of butters clever (though I\u2019d replace the butter knives with a less awkward design). It\u2019s not the very best we\u2019ve had (that\u2019s probably Pollen) but it was nice. The starters were all delicious and we particularly enjoyed the oysters with Thai green curry. The salmon was also very nice. I\u2019m not entirely sold on the combination of black truffle with the prawn. The scallops were decent, the fish a little forgettable, but the cabbage was surprisingly good. A big thumbs up there. After  that seafood, I would have preferred a proper meat dish, but everything was certainly tasty. Among the desserts, the canel\u00e9 and the lemon tart were particularly nice.\n\n[3.5 Stars] Went for a lunch.\n\n-Environment\nNice place, elegant and very clean. Seats are comfortable, not noisy, air-con is not too cold.\n\n-Menu\nI felt the overall menu is just alright, it is interesting but not super delicious or whatsoever. The portion is typical French style, the ingredient of scallop and duck able to taste the freshness. The rest of the menu are okay, not much of catchy points...sauces are in similar taste, creamy salty type....Desserts are ordinary.\n\n-Service\nI felt every time when doing the serving, it was so fast that we could not catch what the staff is explaining about the dishes/ingredient/dressing...If large part of the operating expense goes to Staffing, I do not feel the passion coming from the staff whenever we are being served. I think it is important to explain in a way which make customers could appreciate the food more.\n\n-Price\nSpent about $240+, just for an experience and it was just an okay.\n\nI didn't really enjoy the place. note to self, never go for open concept Michelin star restaurant.\n\nPlace - easy to locate, heart of CBD area and even have a happening bar as neighbor.\n\nRestaurant ambience - more for couple setting. Anything more than that is hard to have a chat with your peers as is a counter setting. Open kitchen concept.  There are 20 over staff fussing over our food, they look cool in their black outfit.\n\nFood presentation - very sophisticated, elegant and detailed. Really IG worthy but you must have good photography skills as the lighting down there is terrible at our counter setting\n\nFood taste - salty, sour, overpowering of spices, taste. A pity there is not one food that is worthy of mentioning. The mains are nice but all the special sauces over power the food.  There was one main which is the lamb tongue but it tasted like cured meat version. the Let's not talk about dessert as french dessert are always medicore everywhere. They tried their best.\n\nI am comparing with Odette. I would prefer Odette kind of French food.\n\nThe next day all of us have very easy bowel system \ud83d\ude05\ud83e\udd2d. Good for one try.\n",

They serve the best salad, octopus, sea bream, lamb chop and even chicken. Their dips and pita bread are also to die for. Service isn't as good as it used to be anymore but oh well.\n\nCelebrated a friend birthday here and the staff was quite helpful. We were introduced to a good spread. Wasn\u2019t expecting the food to be good in this type of cafe but was pleasantly surprised of the meat quality and portion. Slightly on the salty side but acceptable. Overall, would come back again.\n\nLoved having dinner here. Food, service, atmosphere all fantastic. Wayne was a great server who recommended some signature dishes - codfish roe was my fav. Octopus was well cooked and kebab was also unique but perfectly cooked.\n\nCame here multiple times including the one at the old location. Also recommended and brought my friends, colleagues here many times! Loved the food, ambience and service! Just so good! This time my friends and I came here to celebrate birthday and the bar manager treated us to complimentary alcohol and gave a small bottle of olive oil (we also purchased a big one!). Their olive oil tastes so gooooooood! The dessert was complimentary as well. I love the fish, octopus and vegetables the best!\n\nFood is fantastic. Price is reasonable as well, total damage is about $50/pax. (We ordered like 7-8 dishes).\nService is pretty prompt. The ambience is good & cozy for gathering & chit-chatting.\n",

Place tends to get crowded and there\u2019s sometimes a queue, so it\u2019s wise to make a reservation before heading down. Had the dips and bread, octopus, sea bass, spinach pastries, and finally, baklava for dessert! Everything was great! Octopus was nice and tasty + tender, sea bass was fresh, all the pastries were warm and the Greek coffee we had to end the meal was pretty good too! Will be back here again to try more food! Hopefully sooner than later! Highly recommended for authentic Greek Mediterranean food! Fantastic experience every visit!\n\nA lovely place for those looking for non pork meals. They don\u2019t qualify as a halal place  as they serve alcohol. But good for Muslim friends. It was my first time here and it\u2019s been a while since I had Greek food. I love the dips option from spicy to mild tasting dips. The fried calamari was great too followed by the medium rare lamb which was tender. Ensure you make a reservation to avoid disappointment. Good place to bring friends.\n\nAlways crowded on weekends such that even booking a table on same day is sometimes not possible.\nI really enjoyed the medium meat platter. grilling was on point  meat was juicy and not dry.\nmoussaka went down way too easily. Greek dip platter was on point flavour wise and the taramasalata was flavourful without tasting too fishy.\nsadly the pita bread is pretty small portioned, I'm not sure how you're expected to finish the dip given with the portions served\nGrilled octopus was also delicious.\n\nService was friendly and efficient.\nDecor isn't very Greek but honestly ambience is great (albeit a bit noisy)\n\nIt's harder to get a table here than the at its closest competitor, and for  good reason.\n\nGood food. Although the beef can be on the dry side, everything else was delicious.\n\nHighly recommend the grilled octopus. It is not chewy at all. For those who don\u2019t like squid or octopus, try to have a bite.\n\nRestaurant is packed on a Friday night and the food arrives pretty quick. Staff are quite alright. Some could use a little refining in politeness.\n\nThere\u2019s complimentary licorice candy. Absolutely love it.\n\nWill visit this place again. But recommend to come here in a bigger group to order a larger variety of dishes.\n\nFirst visit. Reservation was smooth via seven rooms. We chose an outdoor table as the weather was pleasant. The food was delicious. We had the whole oven chicken and chicken yiro wrap with fries. Pesto pasta was good as well. Desserts were amazing too. Overall highly satisfied.\n",

                  "reviews": "\n\nThis is our third time here within about one month time. The food here is really nice and the price is very reasonable for its quality. The place is on the bank of Singapore river, so the view is nice and relaxing. The service here is really good, and we managed to have a chitchat with Nod, who is a very nice person. Highly recommended restaurant overall.\n\nOrdered the grilled squid, which was very reasonable for the quality. One of the best I\u2019ve had. It has a good char on it, tasted super fresh. The lamb kebab was seasoned very well too. Tasted great with the pita bread that came along with it. The one that left me with the least impression is the beef souvlaki. Should have better seasoning. Service was alright. In fact they kept wanting to clear our plates when we were still trying to finish our food. Other than that, this temporary location was quite cosy.\n\nA bright, open and airy restaurant, I will start by agreeing with everyone else that Zorba does a great job of creating tasty Mediterranean food. In particular, the lamb chops and squid were excellent and I thoroughly enjoyed the Greek salad and the variety of flavours in the dips. The vegetarian platter which comes as part of the communal menu was a lovely array of chargrilled vegetables. Our toddler guest loved the tempura asparagus that came with the squid. We opted for the communal menu at $75 per head which is more than enough food. A bottle of Sauvignon Blanc will set you back $95 and a glass of wine is $16. Weirdly, after we orderedthe communal menu for 5 people, everything came at once. So the communal menu *looks like* starters, mains and a dessert but in actual fact the staff kept bringing the stuff out all at once, so we had to request two additional tables to put all the food on! It was weird and chaotic and ok / slightly amusing amongst friends, but if I was there for a business dinner or something it would not have been acceptable. In light of a restaurant bill in excess of $500 for 5 people it is also not acceptable. For that price point people do not expect to be shuffling around trying to find space for food and adding additional tables etc. It should have flowed out successively, as dips and bread starters, salad and squid, meat and vegetarian platters then dessert. As courses. The staff had no idea where to put the food themselves, they just kept bringing the plates out and getting stressed at the table as we shuffled things round. Then about 5 minutes after they\u2019d brought out all the savoury stuff, they tried to bring the dessert (!) which was the final straw for one of our party who asked them to take it away until we finished the mountain of food in front of us. The dessert let the communal menu down. It was a sad looking custard pie that we had to hack into pieces ourselves, with no ice cream or anything. The egg custard was over cooked and was more scrambled egg than custard.\nI am inclined to give any restaurant that allows me to bring my dog extra credit, and Zorba did allow us to bring our dog to sit \u2018outside\u2019 (still completely covered area) and near the open restaurant doors, so he could catch the breeze from the aircon. That\u2019s Thoughtful with a capital T. Lovely. Really appreciated that thank you. They also started well by offering him a water bowl,  but they never actually brought it. Luckily we brought our own. In fact the service generally was a bit all over the place. The youngsters serving our table couldn\u2019t tell us anything about the wine, brought the wrong number of forks, knives and plates and then went to clear tables after being asked to bring more forks and plates. They were pleasant enough, very polite but it was as if it was maybe their second or third day working and they were still learning.\nThere is also a fabulous children\u2019s play area for the toddlers to amuse themselves, which is just a fantastic idea. And very much enjoyed by our toddler guest.\nI don\u2019t want to be so critical of a restaurant that got so many things right. But you have to view these things in lieu of the cost of the evening and Zorba is not cheap. Therefore I expect the service and experience to match the prices of the food and wine.\nI would go again, but I would probably not look to spend the amount we did. Perhaps a simple brunch or dinner for two.\n\nGood atmosphere, good food and good service! I really love the food it taste amazing. Nod and the team really serve us well. Recommend to come with family or friends, very family oriented restaurant.\n\nI recently had the pleasure of dining at Zorba The Greek Taverna in Singapore, and it was an absolutely delightful experience from start to finish. From the moment we walked in, we were greeted with a warm and inviting atmosphere that transported us straight to the heart of Greece.\n\nThe food at Zorba's is nothing short of outstanding. The menu is a treasure trove of authentic Greek dishes, and every bite was bursting with flavour. We started with the mezze platter, acolourfull array of hummus, tzatziki, and dolmades that set the tone for an incredible meal. The moussaka and souvlaki that followed were cooked to perfection, and the portions were generous, making it a great value for the quality.\n\nHowever, what truly elevated our dining experience was the exceptional service provided by our waitress, Chantel. She was not just a server; she was a gracious host who went above and beyond to ensure our meal was memorable. Chantel's knowledge of the menu and her recommendations were spot on. She made us feel like valued guests, and her warm, friendly demeanour made the evening even more enjoyable.\n\nIn conclusion, Zorba The Greek Taverna is a hidden gem in Singapore. The food is top-notch, the atmosphere is inviting, and the star of the show was undoubtedly our wonderful waitress, Chantel. I can't recommend this place enough, and I can't wait to return for another taste of Greece right here in Singapore!\n\nThank you, Chantel, and the entire team at Zorba's, for an unforgettable dining experience!\n",

Apparently my friend said that the standards have dropped and the food used to be better prior to their renovation\u2026\n\nAlso, the restaurant has a strict 2 hours rule in place and we had to vacate the place by 2pm for their closing.. not a good experience for sure.\n\nOne of the best Greek food I\u2019ve ever had! The dips are yummy, pitas are warm and tasty, the grilled octopus is one of the best I\u2019ve ever had!!!! The tacos giros are yummy and the beef is of great quality!

From the grilled Octopus tentacle, to the seafood platter to the meat platter and the best of all, the pork skewers.. we almost didn't order the pork skewers but am glad we did because it was out of this world and not like anything we (or I) have tasted before.\n\nBe prepared for a budget of 80 to 100 per pax without drinks or alcohol.\n\nEasy parking at Craig Place (walking distance). May need to maneuver a bit if you have guests on wheelchairs.\n\nHad an extremely enjoyable dining experience here with my work colleagues. Although I've not been a huge fan of Greek food all along, our lunch was actually quite yummy. Got ourselves a mixed platter combo to share, some moussaka, spanakopita (make sure you get this), and some pita bread with dips. Make sure to call and reserve ahead of time, as they do get quite crowded during meal times.\n\nThis place is just outstanding: exceptional raw material used to create fresh, delicious, authentic dishes. Great wines offered, relaxed atmosphere, cozy decoration. All pieces are put together nicely for a fantastic experience! The cooks and managers are really putting their heart into Fotia and it shows!\n\nWe will be back for sure!\n\nGreek food in a nice setting. Been here a few times and the food always stands out, definitely one of the best Greek restaurants in town. Salads are delicious, uses good fresh ingredients and seasoning was good. Meat platter was big enough for 4 of us with a good selection of grilled meat, flavourful and had good taste.\n\nBeautiful venue that really makes you feel like you\u2019re in Greece. Wide variety of seafood, meat and vegetarian dishes - the platters are definitely plentiful and good for big groups. Service is friendly and prompt which is appreciated.\n",

Sat inside the bar and there were 2 HUGE cockroaches that were running across the bar counter. My friend informed the staff and they were very casual about it and just killed it and informed us that it was dead without any signs of embarrassment or being apologetic. It ruined my experience there.\n\nThe beer came very fast, but they forgot to give us our fries despite us being the only customers at that point of time. Then when more customers came in, we saw food going out but our fries were not there. Only after we informed them then we reordered something else. And again, there were no signs of being apologetic.\n\nPlace is slightly humid but friendly staff.  Place for only beers. Not sure why but beers come very fast,  not food and non alcoholic beverages. Had to order pineapple juice twice and our spam fries 4 times.\nIt came after 1 hour.\n\nBe careful when you pass by the offers provided by this bar/pub. Cheated by the staff who is offering happy hour when we walked in. One of the staff offered happy hour price when we asked about the pricing, and when billing they started to deny offering the happy hour price. They do not admit their mistakes/miscommunication at all, felt no remorse and even argued back that they did not offer the price. Very upset at the way they're handling the whole situation, and going back on their words. Drinks were overpriced compared to the other bars/pubs (who would even go to a bar that sells overpriced drinks compare to the surrounding bar/pub?). Definitely not coming back to this place due to their bad services and dishonesty with customers.\n",

The staff was incredibly friendly, making it a delightful meal from start to finish. Can't wait to go back and savor more of their delicious dishes!\n\nThe meat platters and lamb rack at this Greek gem are culinary masterpieces! Each bite is a flavor explosion, and the tenderness of the meats is truly impressive. The dips, a perfect accompaniment, add an extra layer of deliciousness to every dish. A must-try for anyone who appreciates top-notch Greek cuisine!\n\nVisited for the first time after hearing good reviews from friends. Awesome ambience and child-friendly. Helpful staff who helped us with food orders and wine recommendation. Dips were great, octopus tender and flavourful. Desserts were also delightful. The standout dish was the lamb chops!\n\nHad dinner some time last week and the food was pretty good but it was quite pricey. The waiter asked if we would like sparkling or still water and we thought still meant free tap water, but it turned out to be $10 bottled water. Don\u2019t make the same mistake as we did if you don\u2019t want to splurge on water!\n\nUnfortunately, we found a piece of stainless steel dish sponge in our food which is quite unhygienic and dangerous. The staff were kind enough to take it off our bill but this was a very eventful first experience dining here.\n\nWe had an excellent dinner here at Blu Kouzina. The food was delicious, staff very friendly and helpful, and the restaurant designed beautifully.\n\nWe shared the meat platter, kebab platter, 4 dip platter (tzatziki, hummus, red pepper, harissa), and kanafe. Everything we ordered was cooked to perfection and tasted amazing. Stand outs include the lamb chop and the red pepper dip.\n\nThe restaurant even served us a few drinks on the house!\n\nOverall a great dining experience and easy recommendation.\n\nWent to celebrate birthday with a few friends. The food and service were good. Only disappointment is that when we were leaving the place, the wine was actually not finished.  The staff could do better to confirm if we still want it before throwing the bottle away.\n",

                  "reviews": "\n\nI came to Singapore few weeks ago and was looking for Mediterranean restaurants. I stumbled upon this gorgeous place 5 minutes away from my hotel. I tried Kebabs on day one and man it was delicious. Atmosphere is great and all servers are friendly, specially three girls Urmi, Wendy and Fina are super nice, they make sure to get you a table quickly, take the order in timely manner and also make valuable suggestions on the menu. They always keep checking if everything is fine and customers are enjoying food. I loved the desert suggestion after eating my dinner. After first day I have been to this place 7-6 times and was always greeted with same service. I highly recommend this restaurant and will go again before I leave Singapore for USA.\n\nWe had the sultan's delight and mussels with garlic cream and cheese toast. The sultan's delight is really enjoyable. We could taste the smokiness from the eggplant puree and the lamb stew is really tender with tomato based sauce. It's tangy and smoky with some crunchiness from the pine nuts. Really enjoyable. But the mussel is pretty standard. It didn't taste really fresh but they're quite generous with the amount. The garlic cheese sauce is ok only.\nService was good and attentive.\n\nVisited for my birthday meal with my family as I was craving some Mediterranean food and this place had great reviews. However, the whole experience ended up kinda disappointing - as I had high expectations too on my first visit.\n\nService:\n- It\u2019s a restaurant but I felt like there was not much service per say.\n- It\u2019s a pretty high price point but they don\u2019t serve complimentary water (charged at $3 a pot of hot water, or $11 for Evian water only)\n- Ordering isn\u2019t as fuss free as they try to make it. Online ordering only from mobile app, with just one physical menu at the door. Asked for any extra copies for easier viewing but none available. You also have to pay upfront in mobile order.\n- Feels like I visited a restaurant but received fast food style service.\n\nAtmosphere:\n- Overall atmosphere is okay. Like a typical restaurant\n\nFood:\n- Average, I\u2019ve had much better at other places for a similar price point.\n- Pita bread, spreads and kebab grills were okay.\n- Saffron rice & Briyani rice were disappointing. They use basmati rice which gave a nice texture. However, flavour is so subtle that I could barely taste the difference between the 2.\n\nSummary:\nWould I return? Definitely not! For the price point, the food and service didn\u2019t live up to expectations for a highly rated restaurant. Will continue on my hunt for yummy Mediterranean food!\n\nVisited on a Thu night, it's superb crowded and busy in the restaurant. 3 dishes for 2 people, very filling. Overall the food is pretty decent and the price point is on the higher side.\n\nExcellent experience with vibrant dining experience. Food has great range of taste to excite the palate. Service is welcoming and top notch, they also gave a complimentary cake.\n",

The floor staff attend to you immediately and ensure the food served are hot. Unfortunately, there were some mishaps with the food served. When informed, it was immediately rectified and a new dish was served. I am very impressed with the service and the quality of food. Kudos.\n\nYummy food but I think they need more staff for the weekends. Hard to get their attention especially for water refill. Can\u2019t blame them as there\u2019s only two of them managing everything. Might want to consider self-service for the water though.\n\nUPDATE:\nWent back again and now they don\u2019t even serve tap water but charge for bottled water at $6? Not sure if I will revisit.\n\nWe were there on a weekend for a late lunch. The place was very empty. We were ushered in quite quickly, but when we wanted to place an order, we waited quite a while to be able to get someone's attention.\n3 out 4 items we wanted to order were not available, but we were not informed when we sat down, hence very disappointed. They also have a pasta menu that is not available for weekends too..\nFood came quite fast, but the plates have very disgusting dirty and wet cotton string wrapped handles. I cannot imagine anyone's hand touching that and then touching the fries or wrap. Mocktail was a glass of diabetes, 15% to 20% syrup, coloring and milk. The orange cake was a miss too. It tasted like tapioca kueh.\n\nWe had a comfortable good time on a rainy Sunday evening, eve of PH, at Ela (Bukit Batok)! Our favourite dish was actually 'Keto' with Pulled Beef - the cauliflower rice was very well done with a generous portion of pulled beef! #mustry\nWe would like to do a special shout out to the one and only floor staff that night, Yani! She was like a wonderwoman, running the floor service alone, serving at least 5-6 tables of guests professionally - from bringing guests to tables, to taking orders, clearing tables, making drinks, serving the dishes etc.! Mad respect! Thank you for being so attentive and patient with your warm services! Will be back at the new outlet to try other items soon too! \ud83e\udd73\n\nIt was so cozy and absolutely loved the vibes. The food was exceptional and the service was great.\n\nThe smell of the pita was sooo good and the pita on my lamb was soaked with flavor. Tho you may want to note that lamb generally has a strong smell/taste. My suggestion is to maybe elevate their dessert as the cake tasted like any ordinary lemon pound cake with an ice cream scoop on top. Wish there were smtg more special.\nhonestly would come here again.\n",

All the restaurant staff were exceptionally warm, friendly, and kind, and it felt like we were having a sit down dinner at a family home. For the birthday celebration, everyone sang happy birthday as well and we were so well taken care of. The ambience was amazing. Definitely must try and we will definitely come back.\n\nWe went to Mykonos by the bay on 1st July to celebrate my daughter\u2019s birthday. I must say that the service staff was quite friendly but the  quantity of the food actually disappointed us. The food was nice but portions were extremely small so we have to order more food. Specially the platter, which was priced at $29 was totally not worth as the dips portions were too small.\n\nVery nice view of the marina of docked boats, al fresco dining.\nWell trained staff, skillful and knowledgeable.\nFood is equally fantastic.\n\nFood is excellent, especially the fish, perfect with the creamy garlic source. Not too crowded on a Monday night, it was windy and comfortable with the outdoor seats. Staffs are attentive. Overall very pleasant experience.\n\nGreat Greek Food\n\nHad dinner with a bunch of friends. We ordered to share. The meat sharing platter was of high quality and cooked to perfection despite it being a dish with many different types of meat. The breads and dips were also great.\n\nService was excellent. We had them arrange tables and then changed tables. They accommodated us each step of the way without any fuss. Service came promptly with a smile.\n\nThe place certainly lived up to its Mykonos name - blue and white furniture graced the place. Outdoor sitting was comfortable with ceiling ELV fans constantly cooling the place next to the water.\n",

The food worth 2 stars. The meat was pretty hard, the starter was too sour. The dessert was really not able to match our taste. The house wines was tasteless, but the red wine taste better when it pair with the meat. I will strongly recommend you only order the red if you want to have their one for one house wine promo.\nOur bill was $128, you can get a much more better grilled meat platter and better food at other restaurants. :)\n\nLe Rida has a rustic ambience somewhat akin to an old time eating house in a small town. Quaint and homely\nFreshly baked pita bread with lemon chick pea hummus was delicious and filling\nMains of Lebanese lamb kafta kebab had the right balance of flavour and crunchiness.\nWash it all down with 1 for 1 Heineken draft at $17.90\n\nManager Sanjiv was both friendly and helpful in his recommendations and unlike in some establishments, he did not push you to over order.\nDefinitely worth a return visit!\n\nA quaint no frills dining place with excellent food and good service. The staff are simple people but are very hospitable, often checking in on the food quality and our experience. If you are looking for a good meal away from hustle and bustle, this is the place to go. Oh.. U can definitely have a conversation with your company and hear them loud and clear\n\nDidn't think the food was thaaaat amazing. Nor was the service. But at least they let us drink outside drinks.\nHOWEVER, i requested for no garnishing on my hummus. When the guy brought it over, there WAS parsley on it. And all he said was \"just pluck it out\". --.--\nSo if i was allergic to that, i should just pluck it out.... nice. The hummus wasn't good either. I've tasted better. Like a friend who went with me commented... it isn't creamy enough. Also, comments about the baklava was that it was too hard... and wasn't good.\n\nAbsolutely loved the food, I am heavily into Mediterranean food. I have tried most of the places around Bugis as well. The food here was so fresh, with perfect taste and presentation. It was completely worth it travelling from East.\nThe service was quick, the portion size was generous . We ordered mezze plateer and tabalu salad. They were scrumptious loved the customised heart shaped Pita bread. Hummus, was so creamy and so were all other dips.\n\nWould strongly recommend.. It has become one of my favourite place..\n",

The fish and the three dips with pita were excellent - must-try options. The salad was refreshing; I liked the sauce. A star was taken away for poor service provided.\n\nFirst time trying and went with no expectation but was blown away. Easily one of the best eating places for my 2023! Fried calamari and superfood salad were ok, not bad. But, must order the Greek handcut fries - so smooth, so flavorful, so crunchy so unforgettable.. love it even till the very last stick! Grilled Souvlaki Chicken was so damn good: the chicken - tender and juicy plus the charred aroma, woohoo! tzatziki - ooh so perfect, the sides - all were so yummy! As for the white based chicken pesto pizza - ooh lala but definitely not recommending for one, please share else will be too jelak!\n\nThe food was not bad. I don\u2019t know about the authenticity as I\u2019m not so familiar with Greek, Mediterranean food but the taste was pretty good.\nThe pita bread was a bit too chewy not fluffy enough. And the way they cut it, kinda flattened it and made it sticky. But the dips were nice enough.\nThe octopus was tender and yet flavorful with grill taste. Not much lemon taste from the sauce below but it came with some salad.\n\nHowever the price for the portion is not so value for money. For 2 pax, only 2 menu items of appetizers and 1 drink costs nearly $100\u2026 The pita bread platter was $28++, one octopus tentacle only was $38++.\nMost ridiculous this is they charge $1++ per pax for table water aka tap water. Geez, I think that\u2019s overdoing it. Firstly the tap water doesn\u2019t even taste good, it\u2019s got a weird taste, we hardly drank it. Secondly, one small cup each of tap water doesn\u2019t cost the operator $0.50 from PUB, why are they charging $1++ per pax? Yes, you argue rental costs, labor costs, operation costs etc but it\u2019s still a rip off. Evian from supermarket downstairs you can get mineral water for this price. You\u2019ll say, it\u2019s a restaurant don\u2019t compare with supermarket but seriously tap water vs mineral water\u2026 don\u2019t think water used to flush toilet costs as much as mineral water\u2026\n\nI don\u2019t get why they are charging so much for everything because there\u2019s not much service either. You even have to walk to the counter, stand and line up to pay. Is that service? Not impressed.\n\nThe atmosphere everything is just like a casual cafe. Half industrial looking with concrete floors. Nothing much. Don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be back. Unnecessary. Pita and dips you can make easily at home it\u2019s so convenient now. Probably difficult to make tender grilled octopus. But meh, I don\u2019t need it.\n\nPalatable food and fairly large servings! Burrata pizza + Pitta bread with sauces were amazing - Tirokafteri & hummus. Ambience and decorations were great too! Would appreciate more attention to details in terms of planning surprises e.g. birthdays:)\n\nFood was surprisingly good. Got the beef kebab (came with a pita and some form of tzatziki dip). The kebab was presented off the skewer, and was very juicy and flavourful. Just a little bit on the salty side, though pita + dip helped to balance that out. Wish there was another pita.\n\nStaff were reasonably nice. One seated me, took my food order and said she would return for my drinks order, but never came back. However managed to ask someone else for help.\n\nOverall a good experience and I would be back if in the area / craving juicy kebabs. Not a bad place for a date too, it's a spacious restaurant with enough room between seats that you don't feel like other people can listen in. Damage was about $38 for 1 pax after service charge and GST (ordered a main and water).\n",

                  "reviews": "\n\nI came to Singapore few weeks ago and was looking for Mediterranean restaurants. I stumbled upon this gorgeous place 5 minutes away from my hotel. I tried Kebabs on day one and man it was delicious. Atmosphere is great and all servers are friendly, specially three girls Urmi, Wendy and Fina are super nice, they make sure to get you a table quickly, take the order in timely manner and also make valuable suggestions on the menu. They always keep checking if everything is fine and customers are enjoying food. I loved the desert suggestion after eating my dinner. After first day I have been to this place 7-6 times and was always greeted with same service. I highly recommend this restaurant and will go again before I leave Singapore for USA.\n\nWe had the sultan's delight and mussels with garlic cream and cheese toast. The sultan's delight is really enjoyable. We could taste the smokiness from the eggplant puree and the lamb stew is really tender with tomato based sauce. It's tangy and smoky with some crunchiness from the pine nuts. Really enjoyable. But the mussel is pretty standard. It didn't taste really fresh but they're quite generous with the amount. The garlic cheese sauce is ok only.\nService was good and attentive.\n\nVisited for my birthday meal with my family as I was craving some Mediterranean food and this place had great reviews. However, the whole experience ended up kinda disappointing - as I had high expectations too on my first visit.\n\nService:\n- It\u2019s a restaurant but I felt like there was not much service per say.\n- It\u2019s a pretty high price point but they don\u2019t serve complimentary water (charged at $3 a pot of hot water, or $11 for Evian water only)\n- Ordering isn\u2019t as fuss free as they try to make it. Online ordering only from mobile app, with just one physical menu at the door. Asked for any extra copies for easier viewing but none available. You also have to pay upfront in mobile order.\n- Feels like I visited a restaurant but received fast food style service.\n\nAtmosphere:\n- Overall atmosphere is okay. Like a typical restaurant\n\nFood:\n- Average, I\u2019ve had much better at other places for a similar price point.\n- Pita bread, spreads and kebab grills were okay.\n- Saffron rice & Briyani rice were disappointing. They use basmati rice which gave a nice texture. However, flavour is so subtle that I could barely taste the difference between the 2.\n\nSummary:\nWould I return? Definitely not! For the price point, the food and service didn\u2019t live up to expectations for a highly rated restaurant. Will continue on my hunt for yummy Mediterranean food!\n\nVisited on a Thu night, it's superb crowded and busy in the restaurant. 3 dishes for 2 people, very filling. Overall the food is pretty decent and the price point is on the higher side.\n\nExcellent experience with vibrant dining experience. Food has great range of taste to excite the palate. Service is welcoming and top notch, they also gave a complimentary cake.\n",

The standout dish for me was the lamb; it had absolutely no odor and tasted fantastic. The grilled items were a highlight as well, bursting with delicious flavors. The restaurant\u2019s ambiance was beautifully decorated, and the staff was both charming and incredibly helpful, taking the time to explain the dishes to us. While it\u2019s not the cheapest option, the prices are fair for the quality you receive.\n\nOne thing to note, though, is that the platter we ordered was described as \u201cfor two,\u201d but for Asians, it\u2019s considered a generous portion. So, if there are four of you and you\u2019ve already ordered other dishes, I recommend going for the platter for two only; it\u2019s quite substantial. Would recommend to anyone looking for a great dining experience!\n\nFirst time having Turkish food and was really\npleasantly surprised. Their dips and bread was really exceptional. The bread was steaming when it came out it was both crispy and fluffy at the same time. The platter for 2 was also great all the grilled meats was tender and flavourful. Portion was also huge.\n\nEverything from the service to food were impeccable. Staff were polite and always made sure we were well taken care of. I ordered before my friend came and they asked when the food should be prepared and how it should be served. Food was perfectly done too. It is the little things that make a difference and win them a return customer.\n\nVery impressive food & service displayed by the dedicated front staffs and chefs. It\u2019s nice walking in the street after a wine & dine session in the area. The staffs were very attentive, price is reasonable.\n\nWent here for a birthday celebration and the attention to detail from their service staff is amazing, didn\u2019t mention to the staff that it was for a birthday celebration, only had a note in the reservation. But they went above and beyond, having candles in the dessert and even giving us props to take pictures with and proceeded to then print out the photo of us to keep!\n\nThe food also matches the service, authentic Turkish cuisine done perfectly, the Hummus was so good we had to order a second portion! I\u2019m not usually a fan of chicken but the chicken that came with the platter blew my mind, so juicy and tender. Then comes dessert, my first time having Kunefe and the only thing I have to say is that I wish I didn\u2019t share it, wanted it all to myself \ud83e\udd23\n\nDefinitely coming back here again!\n",

Whenever we want to enjoy a meal without worrying about quality and taste, we head straight to this restaurant. \ud83d\ude0b You won't regret giving it a try!\n\nHummus! Good! The lunch set is value for money - comes with a main + drink + soup + bread + dessert all for $20!\nThe pita bread is baked to perfection and the submarine bread looks so amazing! However the price for the submarine bread is a little high. Will probably not order this again the next time.\nThe soup of the day was lentil soup (vegetable soup) its really rich and herby. Very different from what i usually have.\nThe chicken dish is the highlight of the meal. The chicken meat is sooooo soft and tender. The seasoning is on point. Goes really well with the breads. The rice that comes with the dish is really fragrant as well.\nLots of vegetarian options.\nOverall a positive experience and will recommend \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\n\nTotal bill is about $85++\n\nOrdered quite abit for 2 person.  Love the cauliflower salad. Hummus, eggplant dips. As we were celebrating our birthday, the restaurant gave us complimentary tea and a kind of Turkish delight. The staff were attentive and friendly. Will definitely go back for the cauliflower salad and hummus.\n\nThis was my second visit today and my colleagues and I absolutely loved the food! I am usually not a fan of Turkish or Mediterranean food but this place is an exception. After trying the food a few months ago for the first time, I have been wanting to visit them again.\n\nEvery dish was delicious and tasted fresh and   wholesome. The Mezeplate is a good option if you are not sure what to order as it has a bit of everything and you can to try the different dips and appetisers. I enjoyed the hummus, cauliflower salad and eggplant dip very much. Their lentil soup was very good too - comforting and tasty.\n\nFor the mains, we tried two of their lunch set meals -  two rice dishes with the different chicken kebabs which were served with tea, soup and a rice pudding dessert. We also ordered their salmon which was so tender and flavourful. Several colleagues commented that it was the best salmon they had ever tasted!\n\nThe highlight of the meal was their dessert - Kunefe which was absolutely delicious! The taste and texture was so complex and had so much depth! The crispy stringy pastry with the creamy sauce, nuts and ice cream was indeed like what the menu described it to be - \u201ca slice of heaven\u201d!\n\nThis is seriously an underrated restaurant which serves amazing food and I would highly recommend it :)\n",

Starting from the hummus, absolutely generous and delicious portions. Perfect appetizer.\n\nThe butter rice with kebab was crazy delicious, we literally scraped the plate clean from the rice and the greek yogurt like substance in the centre.\n\nPizza was crispy and fragrant at the same time, the tomato sauce parts was absolutely amazing.\n\nStrawberry drink was okay!!! Not super special but nice!\n\nIn the middle of Arab street you find this restaurant. We were welcomed\u00a0by a real Turkish guy. Very friendly and he could advise us what was the best to order. We sat outside, along\u00a0the street. Within 15 min the table was full with all kinds of grilled meat. Real Turkish flavors and a nice apple tea were enough to make my day complete. Eating here, and watching the people pass by is a big joy.\n\nParking in this area is very hard, as you can understand.\n\nHad a great dinner here today. My friend saw this online with high rating stars so we just stopped by after work.  And yes, the food is delicious, the atmosphere is awesome, love the music too.\nSo if your family or friends are outgoing and friendly, this is the right place for you to gather together and laugh together and dance together !\n\nCuisine is new to me as a traveller. Trying the dish with my arab friends and the chef being a wonderful host in telling us about the different food added to the stellar experience of dining here. Service was awesome. Food was a good blend of flavors.\n\nJust returning home from an amazing service and hospitality from Cappadocia.\nChef Ahmed Hagras went out of his way to arrange a very sweet surprise for my husband's birthday at my request.\nThe whole staff sang happy birthday for him with a special kunafe.\n\nThe food itself is finger licking good, no doubt. But the experience was way better.\n\nThank you everyone at Cappadocia for helping make this day special for him.\n",

                  "reviews": "\n\nStumbled across this place today and decided to eat here with my mum. Very no frills and simple place.\n\nShe had a falafel moussaka, and I had the mexican beef bowl. The moussaka was delicious but I feel like 5 pieces of nacho chips wasn\u2019t enough and mind you this cost $13\u2026..\n\nThe beef bowl was a little dry, could do with some kind of sauce but it was good and we finished both dishes. The churros came freshly fried and was good too, but would have preferred actual choc sauce vs the hershey choc syrup.\n\nOnly gripes; the overly sugary lemongrass drink that was served premade with no ice. Had to ask for ice twice but given few pieces\u2026..  also very weird that we dined in but were served with plastic cutlery when we clearly saw metal cutlery, it was a little strange. It was practically only 2 tables and the lady served my food to the other table\u2026. Could tell she wanted to take it back to serve me but they already started eating it.\n\nI think its a quaint little place but some things need to be improved. At $30 for 2 expected just a little more.\n\nExcellent service. The beef Mexican rice bowl was not bad. With the homemade drink, I spent less than $10. I was there alone at 5 ish and I had the entire place to myself. I don't remember music playing but it sure would be nice to listen to some tunes.\n\nSmall quaint shop located near Tai Seng Mrt, they had a $10 set meal that had a wrap, small hash brown and a lemongrass tea. There was a small side of nacho chips with salsa.\n\nNothing amazing but I guess it was better than nothing coz there wasn\u2019t anything there open before 11am\n\nDropped-off my 10-months old laptop at LENOVO Service Centre at 3 Irving Rd, #01-17 Tai Seng Centre. BITC, Singapore 369522 on Tuesday 18 April 2023,\n\nThus decide to settle my late lunch within the area too.\n\nOne will be spoiled with choices as there are so many small eateries and cafes. I was drawn to  Olive Mediterranean & Middle East which was located across the street at 11 Irving Place #01-14/15, Tai Seng Point, Singapore 369551.\n\nOrdered for myself a Mexican Rice (Celantro & Spinach With Beef) Bowl at S$7.50.\n\nIf you are a small eater, the serving portion is just right. However, definitely a \"No. No.\" for someone who has a heavy duty digestive system, I would recommend that you order some nachos or Quesadillas too.\n\nIn my opinion, the rice is mildy aromatic (I was expecting a more pungent aroma of Celantro and spinach).\n\nI will rate the minced beef topping as \"healthy choice\".  It is relatively quite nice BUT will not leave one any special impression.  It will definitely taste alot better if there is a little more fat (this will enhance the juiciness) and more spices are added.\n\nHowever, if you working in this area, it is a great place to meet up with your colleagues and friends after work.  You can sufficient outdoor sittings surrounded with plants.\n\nStumbled on this place as i happened to be browsing around. Been awhile since i had my tacos and wraps, decided to try this as i noticed they had very high reviews.\n\nHad the beef Quesadilla - loved it as it was simply nice\nChicken Saffron Stew - Soooo tender and nice but soup wasnt as thick as i wanted but thats purely due to my own taste\nHashbrowns - Thumbsup as we all loved it. Hearsay its even better than M's hashbrown but i leave it for u to judge.\n\nService wise was top, very homely feel given by the lady boss and staff. She took her time to guide me through the menu and shared with me what we should order.\nI must say the food takes a pretty long time to come for a quiet Monday Afternoon but i guess Good Food - Time to prepare so no complaints from me on this.\n\nOverall i recommend this place based on the food served + prices. Very nice and they deserves better businesses. should be pretty quiet when its after office hours.\n\nWill be back again :)\n",

The food worth 2 stars. The meat was pretty hard, the starter was too sour. The dessert was really not able to match our taste. The house wines was tasteless, but the red wine taste better when it pair with the meat. I will strongly recommend you only order the red if you want to have their one for one house wine promo.\nOur bill was $128, you can get a much more better grilled meat platter and better food at other restaurants. :)\n\nLe Rida has a rustic ambience somewhat akin to an old time eating house in a small town. Quaint and homely\nFreshly baked pita bread with lemon chick pea hummus was delicious and filling\nMains of Lebanese lamb kafta kebab had the right balance of flavour and crunchiness.\nWash it all down with 1 for 1 Heineken draft at $17.90\n\nManager Sanjiv was both friendly and helpful in his recommendations and unlike in some establishments, he did not push you to over order.\nDefinitely worth a return visit!\n\nA quaint no frills dining place with excellent food and good service. The staff are simple people but are very hospitable, often checking in on the food quality and our experience. If you are looking for a good meal away from hustle and bustle, this is the place to go. Oh.. U can definitely have a conversation with your company and hear them loud and clear\n\nDidn't think the food was thaaaat amazing. Nor was the service. But at least they let us drink outside drinks.\nHOWEVER, i requested for no garnishing on my hummus. When the guy brought it over, there WAS parsley on it. And all he said was \"just pluck it out\". --.--\nSo if i was allergic to that, i should just pluck it out.... nice. The hummus wasn't good either. I've tasted better. Like a friend who went with me commented... it isn't creamy enough. Also, comments about the baklava was that it was too hard... and wasn't good.\n\nAbsolutely loved the food, I am heavily into Mediterranean food. I have tried most of the places around Bugis as well. The food here was so fresh, with perfect taste and presentation. It was completely worth it travelling from East.\nThe service was quick, the portion size was generous . We ordered mezze plateer and tabalu salad. They were scrumptious loved the customised heart shaped Pita bread. Hummus, was so creamy and so were all other dips.\n\nWould strongly recommend.. It has become one of my favourite place..\n",

They serve the best salad, octopus, sea bream, lamb chop and even chicken. Their dips and pita bread are also to die for. Service isn't as good as it used to be anymore but oh well.\n\nCelebrated a friend birthday here and the staff was quite helpful. We were introduced to a good spread. Wasn\u2019t expecting the food to be good in this type of cafe but was pleasantly surprised of the meat quality and portion. Slightly on the salty side but acceptable. Overall, would come back again.\n\nLoved having dinner here. Food, service, atmosphere all fantastic. Wayne was a great server who recommended some signature dishes - codfish roe was my fav. Octopus was well cooked and kebab was also unique but perfectly cooked.\n\nCame here multiple times including the one at the old location. Also recommended and brought my friends, colleagues here many times! Loved the food, ambience and service! Just so good! This time my friends and I came here to celebrate birthday and the bar manager treated us to complimentary alcohol and gave a small bottle of olive oil (we also purchased a big one!). Their olive oil tastes so gooooooood! The dessert was complimentary as well. I love the fish, octopus and vegetables the best!\n\nFood is fantastic. Price is reasonable as well, total damage is about $50/pax. (We ordered like 7-8 dishes).\nService is pretty prompt. The ambience is good & cozy for gathering & chit-chatting.\n",

You won't regret it.\n\nFor a person who doesn't like lamb, I'd like to share that this restaurant is the only one where I would not hesitate to order their lamb shanks!\n\nThe atmosphere is good for catching up with friends over a beer and a good Turkish meal.  A change from the usual type of dining places we locals normally go to. The friends I brought there thoroughly enjoyed the evening.\n\nThe staff are friendly and humorous.  It can get crowded Friday nights.  So go early!\n\nThey are open 6 days a week, closed on Sunday.\n\nSuper juicy and delicious kebab and loved the hummus and babaganoush too. The lunch special is good value for the quality and portion. Service was quick and helpful. Will definitely be back to try more.\n\nKazbar's cold mezze platter is a delightful mix of flavors with hummus, baba ghanoush, tabbouleh, falafel, stuffed grape leaves, olives, and pickled veggies. The lychee mint crush mocktail is a must-try, and the lively atmosphere adds to the overall experience. \ud83c\udf1f\n\nUnique experience eating middle eastern food.

Thanks to receptionist Mahiti for always giving a great smile to all guest. It definitely makes a difference.\n\nWe celebrated my brother's birthday here and had a great time. The restaurant is beautifully decorated with classic Turkish designs and really put us in the mood for their cuisine.\n\nWe ordered the mixed grilled platter to share and they portioned it for to the seven people in our party. The salads were fresh and the dessert was delicious. I highly recommend their kunfa as it's authentic, made fresh and absolutely scrumptious.\n\nMy only drawback was the warmth. There could have been better distribution of air-conditioning, other than that we had a swell time. I know there are many other restaurants in the area offering a similar experience but Byblos stands apart with class and authenticity.\n\nLOVE the food!!! Hot, freshly baked lavash bread, delectable and well seasoned kebabs, even the salads appealed to my picky 11 year old. Ambience was lovely, only downside was the music is a wee bit loud (I was sitting indoors), but the staff brought down the volume. Our plates were all cleaned out, clearly we enjoyed dinner at Byblos. Highly recommended!\n\nThere are many Turkish food restaurants along Arab Street but this is the best one I've had here. In fact, I daresay it's the best Turkish food I've ever had. The Chef and waiters were all very welcoming!\n",

Apparently my friend said that the standards have dropped and the food used to be better prior to their renovation\u2026\n\nAlso, the restaurant has a strict 2 hours rule in place and we had to vacate the place by 2pm for their closing.. not a good experience for sure.\n\nOne of the best Greek food I\u2019ve ever had! The dips are yummy, pitas are warm and tasty, the grilled octopus is one of the best I\u2019ve ever had!!!! The tacos giros are yummy and the beef is of great quality!

Place tends to get crowded and there\u2019s sometimes a queue, so it\u2019s wise to make a reservation before heading down. Had the dips and bread, octopus, sea bass, spinach pastries, and finally, baklava for dessert! Everything was great! Octopus was nice and tasty + tender, sea bass was fresh, all the pastries were warm and the Greek coffee we had to end the meal was pretty good too! Will be back here again to try more food! Hopefully sooner than later! Highly recommended for authentic Greek Mediterranean food! Fantastic experience every visit!\n\nA lovely place for those looking for non pork meals. They don\u2019t qualify as a halal place  as they serve alcohol. But good for Muslim friends. It was my first time here and it\u2019s been a while since I had Greek food. I love the dips option from spicy to mild tasting dips. The fried calamari was great too followed by the medium rare lamb which was tender. Ensure you make a reservation to avoid disappointment. Good place to bring friends.\n\nAlways crowded on weekends such that even booking a table on same day is sometimes not possible.\nI really enjoyed the medium meat platter. grilling was on point  meat was juicy and not dry.\nmoussaka went down way too easily. Greek dip platter was on point flavour wise and the taramasalata was flavourful without tasting too fishy.\nsadly the pita bread is pretty small portioned, I'm not sure how you're expected to finish the dip given with the portions served\nGrilled octopus was also delicious.\n\nService was friendly and efficient.\nDecor isn't very Greek but honestly ambience is great (albeit a bit noisy)\n\nIt's harder to get a table here than the at its closest competitor, and for  good reason.\n\nGood food. Although the beef can be on the dry side, everything else was delicious.\n\nHighly recommend the grilled octopus. It is not chewy at all. For those who don\u2019t like squid or octopus, try to have a bite.\n\nRestaurant is packed on a Friday night and the food arrives pretty quick. Staff are quite alright. Some could use a little refining in politeness.\n\nThere\u2019s complimentary licorice candy. Absolutely love it.\n\nWill visit this place again. But recommend to come here in a bigger group to order a larger variety of dishes.\n\nFirst visit. Reservation was smooth via seven rooms. We chose an outdoor table as the weather was pleasant. The food was delicious. We had the whole oven chicken and chicken yiro wrap with fries. Pesto pasta was good as well. Desserts were amazing too. Overall highly satisfied.\n",

                  "reviews": "\n\nVisited here on a weekday for lunch with office colleagues. We had reservation and took the seats arranged for our big group. There was option of set menu as well as ala carte. We went ahead with the recommendations of the staff and had the following: fried cauliflower served with mint chutney, hummus with pita bread, assorted kebabs which included lamb, chicken, pork and falafel. We had some beverages too. The menu is elaborate with Mediterranean cuisine and taste is authentic though some may not like it.\nIt was crowded during our time of visit yet the service was good. Staff are friendly and knows well of the dishes.\n\nWent for a weekday lunch and with the $29 set lunch it was filling and totally worth it. Love the artichoke and herb hummus served with pita bread. It was better than the cashew  hummus. Chopped kale was good. Pretty interesting with fried capers and lady finger but smoke aubergine seems to be less flavourful. I would like it with more yogurt. No complaints about the seabass, chicken, pork ribs and lamb leg kebabs. Chicken was soft, pork ribs had tons of asian flavours and lamb leg was juicy. Overall would recommend.\n\nCame here with some friends for brunch and decided to go ALA carte instead of the brunch package. To be honest, 55SGD for the brunch package was quite reasonable. But everyone on the table had to take it. Which was quite disappointing.\n\nHowever - not an issue since we managed to order what we wanted anyway. I like the cauliflower and the egg plant dish. It was quite tasty. I had the crab tacos which were alright. Generally not bad for a brunch spot. I would go for the set the next time I'm back.\n\nFood: very delicious, good options for vegetarians. We went for the brunch & it came with a hummus dip and side which we could mix and match. We tried the artichoke and herb hummus and cashew hummus and loved both. The kale with mihalic cheese was outstanding and I\u2019ve never enjoyed kale more. The cauliflower with green tahini had this lovely tangy taste and was roasted to perfection. For the main course, we tried the full breakfast plate but it was slightly underwhelming as none of the items were outstanding. Didn\u2019t like the falafel at all. The halloumi was delicious but only a small piece. The French toast was fresh and scrumptious.\n\nService: excellent service with attentive and accommodating staff who moved us to another table as our adjoining table was very noisy and loud.\n\nAmbience: My friend and I didn\u2019t really enjoy the ambience as we weren\u2019t seated at the best place with a huge noisy group next to us and a service trolley beside us. I feel it would be much nicer if we sat up front in the main area where the bar is.\n\nVisited in Oct 2023\n\nReally great cocktails. But found the food to be average other than a couple of dishes which stood out. Among the mezze dishes, I thought that the Roasted Cashew Hummus and the Duck Pastilla were good. Didn\u2019t like the octopus mezze as all of us felt it was burnt/over-grilled. For mains, we tried the pork ribeye which was ~3.5/5. Ordered 1 dessert item (kunefe) which was pretty good.\n\nAll the cocktails we tried were quite decent with my favs being Ottoman\u2019s Island, Aergul Paloma and the Baklava Milk Punch.\n\nService was really good.\n",

In that sense it lacked the South Asian spice overload, but also needed more of the exuberant flavour of the Turkish seaside (olives, olive oil, etc)\n\nService was amazing - it\u2019s not an Indian restaurant but I found myself accidentally ordering all sorts of off menu things like lime juice no sugar and mango lassi, and they delivered.\n\nOrdered the mutton kabsa, fattoush, khubz and a giant container of toum for dine in, as well as chicken shawarma for takeaway.\n\nI appreciate that the food closely resembles the kabsa and shawarma versions you find in Saudi Arabia or Lebanon.\n\nThe shawarma had no weird chili sauce inside it, and had pickles and french fries. The mutton was tender and flavorful and the kabsa rice was nicely aldente.\n\nIf you're not looking to try more authentic middle eastern food outside of Turkish cuisine, this is the place to go.\n\nFood tasted amazing and friendly service staff. The meats were seasoned and spiced flavourfully and the accompanying sides complemented it greatly. There was a slightly order confusion but the management solved it professionally.\n\nGood food when im dine,service staff very friendly they recommended me few nice dishes for me takeaway,price affordable compared in arab Street\n",

The concept and food was unique and good but like what others have mentioned, the portion can be rather small for its price tag. The wagyu beef was the highlight.\n\nDefinitely a unique place to visit if you\u2019d want to try Mediterranean food and the service is really good. It\u2019d be a place to consider revisiting if the portion matches its price tag.\n\nThe kind of place we had absolutely nothing to complain about.\n\nGreat food quality, amazing service, awesome atmosphere and inanely good cocktails.\n\nWe\u2019ll be back\n\nFood is great but the portion is too little, this should be improved.  Drinks are great, they have their own signature cocktail  The restaurant has great music and vibes.  Great for pre-dinner drinks.  Interior is beautiful and cleverly designed.\n\nBest cheese cake I\u2019d ever tried!!\n\nIt\u2019s a new & cozy restaurant with passionate staff, one of the best restaurant in my SG trip, especially their cheese cake and the bikini\u2026 miss them so much!\n\nFirst time into this nice Mediterranean Restaurant, ambience is good. Food is superb with Chef Marcus recommendations. The grilled salmon n lamb kofta were good! Love their desserts grapefruit tart n ice cream sandwich. The service is great n staff are friendly..\n",

Claiming to offer authentic Persian cuisine, the reality is a disappointing mix of flavors that lean more towards Indian than Persian. The kebabs, dry and tasteless, are a stark contrast to the rich flavors expected from Persian cooking. Equally disheartening is the rice \u2013 cold, undercooked, and lacking the basic essence of Persian culinary art. This establishment, once perhaps a bastion of authentic cuisine, now serves as a reminder of how far it has strayed from its original glory.\n\nFlavourful middle-eastern cuisine, the dips were delicious.\nNice al fresco dinning areas.\nThank you, Ronny for the great host that makes our dinner wonderful. We appreciate your service.\n\nCame back to this lovely Persian restaurant after 3-4 years to celebrate the Wife\u2019s birthday. Last time here was for dinner, with the belly dancer floating around!\n\nThis time we were seated indoors due to the afternoon heat! Last few times were seated outside by the river which is lovely in the evening.\n\nIt was quite busy on a Sunday afternoon ! The food was as good as we remembered it to be.\n\nLook forward to coming back here\u2026 sooner this time :-)\n\nflavourful and appetising Persian food! had an enjoyable alfresco dinner by the river with a very accommodating food attendant. the dessert was delicious but the faludeh shirazi was a tad too sweet for us. maybe next time will just stick with the saffron ice cream on top of the faludeh, sooo good. will go back to try more food on the menu!\n\nWe enjoy a spread of 3-Course Middle-eastern set lunch for $48++ per person. \ud83c\udf77And we add on 2 hours of Toi Toi Sara\u2019s Rose free flow for $40++ per person. Here what we ordered:\n\u2764\ufe0f Kash-E-Bademjan\n\u2764\ufe0f Borani Esfanaj\n\u2764\ufe0f Fish Kebab\n-Well marinated with special saffron sauce, it is very fresh and flavourful\n\u2764\ufe0f Chicken Masti\n-Marinated with yogurt and herbs, the chicken is tender and slightly charred given it\u2019s fragrance\n\u2764\ufe0f Dessert\n-We love the ice-cream with spice and the Pistachios\nThe wine is good, with tinge of sweetness and hinge of dryness.\nWe really enjoy our meal in a restaurant with such a serene environment right beside Singapore River.\n",

The quality of the ingredients was evident in every bite, and the presentation was a feast for the eyes.\n\nThe staff at Derwish are not only knowledgeable about the menu but also passionate about ensuring a memorable dining experience. Their attentiveness and friendly demeanor added to the overall positive atmosphere.\n\nHad a delightful dining experience at Derwish Turkish! The mixed kebab platter was outstanding; I was trying to control my carbs but I couldn't get enough of the fragrant rice. The hummus was good, although the bread was a bit tough for my liking. However, what truly stood out was the exceptional service. The staff was incredibly friendly and always had a smile on their faces, which added to the overall splendid experience. Looking forward to visiting again!\n\nEverytime I have a loved one visiting Singapore, I always take them here. I always come back here for the food and service. The food is great - big serving and authentic and I love their Bunefe!! \u2665\ufe0f The service is top notch, leaving us satisfied every single time. Will surely be back with other loved ones who are about to visit. \ud83e\udd70\n\nGreat food and service. Food is definitely wayyy more expensive than the usual, but the taste makes it not such a bad deal. Apple tea is really nice before eating the food, very refreshing and fragrant but after eating any food it doesn't taste as nice.\n\nPeter, the staff here, was exceptionally polite and gave us a warm welcome. When I needed to store my dessert in the fridge, he was incredibly helpful. Peter also recommended their signature dishes, and we decided to try them.\n\nThe Tajin lamb shank was a delightful surprise, with tender, succulent meat that practically fell off the bone. The flavors were rich and aromatic, making it a standout dish.\n\nThe Meze tabagi was a delightful assortment of Mediterranean appetizers, a true explosion of flavors and textures. It included a variety of dips, fresh vegetables, and savory bites, providing a wonderful contrast of tastes.\n\nFor a refreshing beverage, we ordered the Mango Ayran. It was a perfect balance of sweet and tangy, making it a great complement to our meal.\n\nUnfortunately, as there were only two of us, we couldn't order the traditional dessert Peter recommended. Nevertheless, we thoroughly enjoyed the atmospheric environment, delicious food, and excellent service provided by the staff.\n",

The menu is different from then but the quality of the food is consistent! We loved almost everything. Not to mention, the attentiveness and warmth of the staff - really made the whole dining experience more enjoyable\n\nOverlooking Singapore CBD, Marina Bay Sands, Singapore Flyer, and the sea, the view from the restaurant was simply breathtaking. The food presentation was impeccable, and I particularly enjoyed the beef tartare as well as the burrata with ham and figs. However, I found both main dishes, the chicken breast, and iberico pork a bit on the dry side, but overall, they were still satisfactory. The service was outstanding, and I was touched by their attentiveness to my reservation note about celebrating my boyfriend's birthday. They remembered and brought out a delicious sticky date cake with a candle and birthday wishes, creating a wonderful surprise. The overall experience was truly fantastic.\n\nStaff service was top notch ! Food was amazing and special. We were treated with a full moon night view too ! Even my 8 year old commented \u201cGood Service\u201d ! Definitely will be back for more :)\n\nI would give more than 5 stars if it was possible. An unforgettable and delicious last diner in Singapore after 1 week. And the sauvignon blanc was perfect!\n\nFood is not good as we expected. Ambience is nice and cozy though. I understand from colleagues that the finger food at cocktail section is appetizing, they recommended the french fries.\n",

They charged you $10.50 for the spicy pork meal they will give you the value of $10.50 meal.\n\nSpicy pork was well marinated, right amount of cabbage as well. The cabbage soup is also good got tofu inside too. Love the whole combination.\n\nPlenty of seats available and the queue moves quickly. My plate of spicy pork came out sizzling \ud83e\udd75 you can see the bits of sauce splatter on my tray hahah\n\nWorth it \ud83d\udcaf\n\nIt\u2019s truly a Korean food stall that\u2019s 100% worth the value.\nThe new items which is the spicy soba is really good. Soba is not soaked in water and it\u2019s the dry mixed type.\nThe chilli sauce is not spicy and well portioned, so that the soba doesn\u2019t get thick sauces on it.\nThe pancake is really authentic and first time liking a Korean style pancake.\nShrimp tempura 6 pieces for $5.5, it\u2019s definitely the best deal every.\n\nTaste nice! Portion wise very big.\n\nGot really confused what to order as all the menu looks good.\n\nPrice is good for the portion\n\nThink can share for two people.\n\nEach set comes with one side dish. You can choose between kimchi anchovies or cucumber.\n\nI came here 30 years ago, and they are still in operation! Kim\u2019s used to be in a food court setting, but now they have their own setup.\n\nUnique to Kim\u2019s is their water based hot plate. A must try are the beef bulgogi, spicy chicken and kimchi soup.\n\nHeard lots of good reviews on its authentic yet affordable korean food so I decided to head down for lunch on Saturday. We ordered a spicy beef soup which comes with a side of rice and one side dish, a chives pancake as well as beef bibimbap.\n\nThe soup was pretty delicious, nicely salted and the vegetables and meat portion was very generous. It wasnt very spicy, which is good for those with a low spice tolerance.\n\nBeef bibimbap was hot (temperature wise) which makes the rice nicely scorched and slightly crispy at the bottom. The sauce is slightly different from others I've tried, with a twang of sweet soy and meaty taste. The bibimbap comes with a small dish of bibim sauce as well, so you can personalise how much sauce you can add.\n\nI do love the chives pancake, its fluffy yet crisp. Theres a nice balance of veges in it, so the chives is not too overwhelming.\n\nOverall, the food is worth the trip for me. Flavours were all on-point and the meals were all quite healthy and not too oily. Great for families to visit!\n\nAesthetically, the place gives off a canteen vibe (no music and wallpaper decor), but for the price range, it doesnt bother me. Service was great as well, the staff was very helpful and multilingual (-1 though as I wanted another soup and they gave me the wrong recommendation :( )\n",

There weren\u2019t many people here when we came here for lunch on Saturday.\n\nThe rice portion is pretty generous. Must have it if you get soup. Also ordered a seafood pancake which was great. They were also very generous with the ban chan.\n\nOrdered the 2 person set for $95. Consisting of Suyuk, Dalgakbi and Seafood pancake.\n\nFood was very nice. They were very flexible in the dishes as we are allowed to change the seafood pancake into a seafood stew and two drinks, as long as it does not exceed the original price of that dish \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb.\n\nIt was slightly expensive, and the set for 2 can easily allow 3 pax to dine.\n\nHad a really enjoyable meal here. Kids loved the shoyu meat and pancake. Bibimbap was excellent as were all the sides which were plentiful, distinct and authentic. Some of the best kimchi I\u2019ve ever tasted.\n\nReservations required! Bigmama is super popular and crowded. I walked in when they opened for dinner at 5.30pm and was told I only have 1 hour for dinner as they were fully booked from 6.30pm.\n\nLuckily they prioritised our orders and served really quickly. The very nice restaurant owners took time to explain how to eat the various dishes, which were so so good. Highly recommend ordering the samgyetang, portion is good for 2-4 pax, the soup was hearty and delicious while the glutinous rice is super yummy and filling.\n\nTheir refillable banchan was super delicious especially the glass noodles, kimchi and lotus root salad - while they only have 6 dishes, everything was really good and we had a second serving. Suyuk was pretty interesting as well but pales in comparison to the samgyetang.\n\nBy the time I finished at 6.30pm the restaurant was already full of people. Can\u2019t wait to come again to try the rest of their dishes. Highly recommended!\n\n-edit- oh yeah they don\u2019t serve barley tea or water which is weird. And their drinks are not cheap. Bring your own water I guess.\n\nA short walk away from Tiong Bahru Plaza, is a family restaurant catered to neighbourhood.\n\n- The side dishes are good, better than majority restaurants. Except the japchae which is abit tough for that day.\n- Enjoyed the big bowl of Makgeolli in a heartland restaurant.\n- Soybean soup, Dakgalbi, seafood pancake are all pretty good for a neighbourhood restaurant. Dakgalbi has minimum order of 2 pax, but I would say portion is enough for 3 pax.\n- Service is lacking and note that your clothes/bag will smell of food as you walk out.\n\nGood place to go if you are tired of the food in TB plaza.\n",

Service was attentive and the bbq was done before they serve.  So we do not leave the place smelling like bbq. Plus a huge variety of banchan. Abit pricey and might not be for everyday. But for special occasions it is a good choice for korean bbq\n\nStandard of food is good. My family enjoyed different soups, and meat were nicely grilled for us. Generous servings of side dishes. Awesome\n\nHad lunch here on a weekend and was immediately seated. As it was just both of us, we could not order more to try. Tea was on the house.  There were 10 varieties of ban Chan, including cold marinated crabs which was a nice surprise. We ordered marinated pork ribs and pork belly plus a huge steaming pot of Kim chee stew. The meat was cooked away from our table, as per request. The marinated pork rib was very flavorful    The pork belly was not bad. And the Kimchi stew too sour to our liking.  Staff were all very friendly. Overall a good experience.\n\nLove the meat, tender and juicy.\n\nThe side dishes were great, there's also the soy sauce marinated raw crab as a side dish.\n\nFavourite gotta be bossam and the bean paste soup. Packed with flavours and has this umami taste.\n\nA little pricey. Services were alright.\n\nExcellent authentic Korean food. Visited during weekday lunch and it was half crowded.  The BBQ chicken was very well season and really tasty.  Galbi Tang was absolutely bursting with flavour.  Leng mian cold noodles were also lovely on a hot day.  A bit on the pricy side but it was worth it.\n",

Initially wondering why the place was so empty when I arrived but after a while it was totally packed.\nA little confusing on the menu because the physical one outside the shop had dinner menu and lunch menu and the electronic one only had lunch. Not sure if could only order from the lunch menu tab but upon asking could order from anywhere from the menu. There were duplicate dishes on ala carte and lunch menu because portion size was smaller and it comes with a set of soup and rice.\nOrdered quite a few items to try, the most important thing I wanted to try was the marinated raw crab and we also ordered the galbi along with some other dishes like seafood pancake and kimchi stew.\nEverything here was good, from the sides to the mains. The galbi was cooked by the staff and it was cooked to perfection. Raw crab was also nice and flavourful and well marinated.\nBill came and it was slightly expensive but definitely worth for the quantity and the quality. Would definitely come back again!\n\nThe newly revamp joint has a real modern touch. Service is absolutely amazing. Food quality is top notch. Many tables was having the raw crab. Looks good however didn\u2019t dare to try. Seafood pancake was delicious & they don\u2019t skimp on the ingredients. Btw the steam egg is FOC. Every table has it. We wanted to order however the waitress explained they will provide every table with one.\nHighly recommended.\n\nFirst time trying Guiga and I\u2019m so glad we did! Everything from service to food was perfect. I loved the beef tartare and marinated crabs\u2764\ufe0f We got the Black Pork set with a side of beef ribs and the samgyetang, which is by far the tastiest I\u2019ve had in Singapore. We didn\u2019t quite enjoy the steamed egg, maybe cos we let it sit there for too long because we were busy eating up the feast we ordered!  We will definitely be back!\n\nthe food here was great and the kimchi was a hit! the pasta salad side dish was also yummy. Ronnie\u2019s service was veryyy sweet and the top-ups on the side dishes were very very generous!\n\nReservations are recommended. When we visited on a Saturday for lunch, the place was packed.\n\nThe pork was good. The staff isn't very interactive or smiley, but they are quite helpful when it comes to grilling the meat.\n",

Was a very satisfying and hearty meal, especially with the free flow side dishes (very yummy!). Service staff were also attentive and helpful! Gave us a free steamed egg dish as well; thank you!\n\nthey had a great variety of side dishes, take note some of the dishes cant be refilled e.g. KIMCHI\u2026.. which was kinda weird cause it\u2019s a korean restaurant\u2026 but anw we ordered a $25 pork belly and two small slim pieces of meat was served.. quality wasnt that great\ncold noodles were okay - abit sour but noodles were chewy and refreshing\nsoft tofu hotpot - soup was not the best I\u2019ve tasted, they included alot of ingredients like octopus, some meat, black fungus, 3 big pieces of tofu, and more\n\noverall it was a meh experience\n\nFinally returned after a couple of years since the food standard dropped. Served 13 side dishes of which one of them is porridge which I think it's a good choice if comes with young children.  And it tastes nice. Ordered BBQ pork+beef set which the staff helped us grilled and cut into small bite sizes.\n\nPrompt service. Water provided. Impressed by the number of complimentary side dishes offered, but would rather they focus on the quality instead of quantity here.\nFood was nothing to shout at, felt that the quality of food used to be better. Ate recently at some of the Korean stores in Beauty World and felt this paled in comparison\n",

                  "reviews": "\n\nWe visited this place for 3-4times. And tried different dishes. The restaurant is ran by Korean. It is authentic Korean cuisine. The atmosphere is chill and cozy. Our favorite food is the spicy chicken feet pot and the beef rib soup.\nThe panchan\ud310\ucc2cthere are also nice and the waiter and waitress are responsive. Just that sometime they get really busy.\nIt would be really lovely to go there for a sip of the hot soup on a rainy and cold morning.\nReally like this place a lot.\n\noverall a popular place with good options of home cooking style Korean food, better to have more than 3people sharing , portion is big for 2 person, you may only get a chance to try 1 or 2 type of food. The pork and chicken dishes are big portion. Chicken feet comes with steam egg and rice balls, it\u2019s a good combination and good to share.\nCame at around 630pm on a Friday evening, it started to get very busy from 7pm.\n\nCame here on a Wednesday night at 7 p.m., and no reservations were needed. I have walked past this restaurant a few times, but I was more familiar with their nostalgic cultural Korean decorations. They moved recently to a new area along the same stretch, and it's so minimalistic now... A lot more space is catered for diners, with rooms for big groups. Side dishes was pretty okay only. Toilet is huge too!\n\n\ud83d\udca7 Water is complimentary\n\nWe ordered:\n\n\ud83d\udc14 Jjimdak ($55)\nBraised chicken in dark sauce, this dish is one of my favourites in korea. And this standard is pretty okay! Huge portion that feeds at least 4 people. Chicken could have been braised longer to have more flavour. The japchae noodles at the bottom soak up a lot of sauce, so it's quite filling, along with potatoes and carrots.\n\nI rate: 3.5/5 \ud83c\udf1f\n\n\ud83c\udf43 Minari Jun ($28)\n1st time trying Minari, and we were surprised how fresh this vegetable pancake tasted. It didn't have a celery scent and tasted rather clean. Quite flat as well. Would like it if it's bigger.\nI rate: 4.5/5 \ud83c\udf1f\n\n\ud83c\udf76 Pine Nut Draught Wine ($28)\nThe way it's served is pretty interesting! In a small vat with a wooden scoop into a shallow bowl. It was a little gassy and had a faint, nutty sweet aftertaste.\n\nI rate: 4/5 \ud83c\udf1f\n\nThis place serves very authentic Korean food. Although traditional bbq was available, no one was having that as the standout are the Korean cooked dishes. It's quite close to the Korean food I had in Korea last year. The standout is the braised short ribs. It's so tender and meat falls off the bone easily. Pair the rice with the braised sauce and it's heavenly. The radishes and carrots were so yummy too. 2nd best was the assorted pancakes. It was like no other I had tried before. There were fish, mushroom, prawns and it's so all very special. It really fills you up too. The place was not very closely packed where you're sitting shoulder to shoulder and tables well spaced apart, unlike some other Korean restaurants here. The restroom are also very clean.\n\nWent for an early dinner and was given a spacious seat for our family of 4. Ordered the barbecued pork belly and beef. They will actually sliced the meat and barbecue the meat for you so that you don\u2019t have to actually do it yourself. Ordered the beef bulgogi for the kids and the kids loved it. Not too many of non spicy options for kids though. Kimchi pancake tasted great while the cold noodles were quite soggy. Overall prices are on the higher side, especially the barbecued meats. Service can be improved, cos we waited quite long for the rice to be ready and there wasn\u2019t anyone to inform us that we have to wait for the rice.\n",

Focus of our meal was fried chicken and it was reasonably delicious although the cheese seemed to dominate the taste a fair bit. The kimchi pancake was nice.\n\nWent for lunch on a Saturday afternoon and the place was full.\n\nOrdered the fried chicken platter, jajangmyeon, and seafood pancake. The fried chicken was tender and juicy. Noodles were springy and flavourful. The pancake was a bit disappointing as it was overly doughy and lacked crispiness. The sauce for the pancake was too salty as well.\n\nLots of free sides were given together with the meal. Overall left with full bellies. Bill came up to $63 for two people.\n\nOrdered the Pork BBQ set for lunch with Spicy Tofu soup and a Stir fry Squid. During lunch there's only 2 tables including ours, service was quite good they bbq for you and service were prompt. The pork were very ordinary not as good as others around the area. The Tofu soup, soup base was good, but I'm not a fan of frozen mixed seafood pack with tiny shrimps and clams, and the Spicy fried Squid were very disappointing too. I'm ok with frozen seafood, but not the kind of pre-cut seafood where it becomes rubbery after cooking, and that's exactly how the squid were like. Maybe I ordered all the wrong stuff from the menu, it looks like their specialty was fried chicken.\n\nA cozy place to have Korean food. This is my second time here as it is quite far to travel from the eastern part of Singapore. The Korean  ambience here to me is a plus. While the food here is not the kind that will blow you away, they are  decent. It\u2019s a place to eat and drink and chill.\n\nCame on a Friday night and the place was packed! Service was quite fast and they have free-flow chilled water. Food was not super amazing but it\u2019s a chill place with kpop videos playing in the bg!\n",

It's so good and warms the stomach so well.\n\nSuper like the toufu soup. It\u2019s salty and sweet but super delicious. Taste abit dif coz of sweetness\n\nKimchi is Aso not bad n again food more on salty side\n\nCame on thur lunch and I was the only one. The decor look old n service abit grumpy but I will come back for the food.\n\nSecond visit ordered the toufu soup. Still as good.\n\nAlso tried the pork belly set but find the meat abit tough n not fresh tasting. Although portion is good n price is $20 ish\n\nSpent around $20 per pax for very simple food. The place is functional. Don\u2019t feel that the service charge is justified as the old couple looked impatient and unwilling to have to serve dishes and all. The furniture is so old that there are some ants crawling around.\n\nI take personal issues with keyboard warriors that has zero empathy to the elderly owners\n\nIgnore all the reviews that critique at the elderly couple service standards. Both are in retirement and working everyday in a F&B (widely known to be gruelingly laborious) and running the whole operations+kitchen entirely on their own. Cut them some slack. Once, the couple had forgotten my request to top-up the side dish, but you don\u2019t see my throwing a hissy fit. Be an adult and try to help them so you can get what you need, rather than retreat into your own shell, not get what you want and whining about it later\n\nHave more empathy. What do you stand to gain by destroying two elderly livelihood who are trying to make an honest living. Stop trying to ruin honest businesses with this toxic cancel culture nonsense.\n\nOn the main topic - food critiquing:\n(+) Food is great, one of the best Korean food in the area. Authentic and reminds me of my days in Korea. Nothing in Singapore comes close to authencity of the Korean food I vividly remember\n\n(-) Food selections are few, not a Korean BBQ place if you\u2019re looking for one but sells Korean cooked food\n\nSign off,\nStrong supporter and Regular diner at Parkers\n\n\ud83c\udf1f 3.5 / 5\n\nSimple Korean affair \u2013 just come and have your meal and leave. Not the widest menu offerings but decent. Spacious and clean environment. I\u2019d say old & neglected decor rather than nostalgic. Not crowded during weekend dinner.\n\nFood taste is alright, flavorful. Not impressive but satisfy your Korean food cravings. Good amount of side dishes but could have been more generous with the portion. Pancake could have been crispier. Bibimbap is good - recommended.\n\nNo frill service, don\u2019t think it is worth 10% extra service charges given that the overall lackluster dining experience.\n",

We ordered Set C - $125 and add on chef fried rice, ginseng half chicken soup and 2 servings of boneless chicken. Right amount of food for the 5 of us. The best part of this Korean bbq is we didn\u2019t have to cook or grill the meat. Just sat there and waited to be served LOL! Most of the food were above standard. The photos / videos said it all. Even the side dishes were nice and we have asked for few rounds of refill. The staff were friendly and attentive. The ambience was good too, not too noisy. No greasy feeling when we left the restaurant. So, thumbs up!\ud83d\ude0b\ud83d\ude0b\n\nNot pricey but the food quality was really poor. For example, the seafood tofu stew was extremely diluted, and contained very few tofu, and seafood that were not really fresh. The pancake also had so little seafood that I checked with the waitress whether it was a wrong order. Complimentary side dishes were mediocre and were not refilled.\n\nFood quality was good. I brought my colleagues there during lunch. Wait staff gave us extra kimchi without extra charge (and this is on top of individual condiments servings). This made us feel welcomed unlike another outlet in One Raffles Place which made us share the condiments (during this endemic period??!!). The reason for 4* is because the portion for ingredients (I ordered Beef bean paste stew) can be increased slightly but overall a very pleasant experience still. Will definitely go back there for lunch and bring more friends & colleagues to try. Oh, the set lunch price is not cheap but is considered reasonable in today's climate so cannot ask for more. To me, everything was good for my 1st visit \ud83d\udc4f\n\nA value for money Korean restaurant worth a visit at Boat Quay area. May not be the most authentic but its definitely good enough to satisfy one's korean craving. The gimbap was fragrantly done with sesame oil coating and the kimchi pork stew was so comforting during a cold weather. Just a note that the banchan is not refillable.\n\nHad the seafood tofu stew and it was a far cry from authentic Korean food. The soup was extremely diluted, I would have been better off eating food court Korean food that tastes much better. Tofu was a small piece inside. Soup is full of onions. The only small piece of prawn was unfresh and mushed in texture. Kimchi's taste is overly acidic and not well-balanced. The rice was also mushy yet dry in texture. Even the barley tea is also diluted. I was fooled by the 4.5-star rating as of today.\n",

I have never eaten at a Korean restaurant which the banchan that had no taste\u2026 the kimchi was flavourless and dry. Kimchi soup was up to standard but for $17++ you can see how much meat there is (photo taken before consuming). I also ordered the kimchi seafood pancake $20++, but (in my opinion), it was undercooked. Had to dabao and refry it for dinner lol. Might be a case of the kimchi being wet and thus the batter was more to the watery and soft side but it was not to my liking and I could taste the batter. Total spend with GST and svc charge at $44.\n\nThey served free ice cream after the meal but then I was asked to pick a flavour twice when I when I was obviously not done with my meal? I told them politely that I was not done and will ask for it later. You can see in the attached photo that it was done to other patrons as well. The waitress left the ice cream on the table when the customer was still eating (I remember she was about 5 mins into her meal when she was asked about which flavour she would like for the ice cream). The next table who just got served their ginseng chicken was asked shortly about their ice cream flavour as well. I\u2019m not sure if it is a an intentional tactic to chase the customers out ASAP but it sure feels that way. I really hope to give the benefit of doubt but it was not a pleasant experience.\n\nSeeing the other reviews here makes me think that the current owners are not looking to improve the standards hence hope that this would help people make an informed decision before visiting.\n\nOrdered ginseng chicken soup and beef short rib soup. Food is ok, price seems steep. Restaurant is dated. Service is ok. Probably will not return to dine. Nothing special.\n\nVisited the restaurant during dinner. There was a crowd but since the queue was reasonable, the waiting time to get a table was quite reasonable too.\nThe sides were served first, and it was amazing that the the sides were refillable. The kimchi stew was quite huge and the soup was refillable too! The seafood pancake was really delicious and it was packed with flavour.\nOverall, a great dining experience with friendly staff!\n\nIt is so disappointing that the food quality dropped. The spicy rice cake was tasteless, the kimchi pancake was too thick without any crispy. The spicy beef soup was tasteless too but at least I could smell the taste of the beef. I used to be wooed by their kimchi fried rice. So disappointed, will be my last visit.\n\nBanchan was nice and the kimchi is super spicy \ud83c\udf36\ufe0f!!!\n\nCold Noodles was way off, not cold enough and the beef was super tough!\n\nKimchi pancake was good and spicy \ud83d\udd25!\n\nSpicy tteokbokki ramen - tteokbokki was tough but the ramen texture was good!\n\nNot gonna make a special trip but will give the rest a try if I'm in the area.\n",

Anyways she went out the way to include a slice and then microwave it so it melted all over \ud83d\ude0b\ud83e\udd24\n\nOverall satisfied with the food and service. However, there is still room for improvement in terms of service. I could feel that the experienced waiter were rushed and tired, so I understand they only replenish the Korean side dishes and water upon request.\nThe owner and owner's wife were also helping to serve customers. They were attentive and polite.\nWe opted for the normal buffet which is currently on promotion, so I have nothing to complain about it at this price.\n\nThe meats were decently good, and so was the rest of the korean dishes, such as the cold noodles or pancakes.\n\nIt's slightly pricey but if you are a big meat eater, it's gonna be a steal. The restaurant doesn't seem to be set up for korean BBQ, no ventilation vent whatsoever. So be prepared to smell like BBQ after your meal.\n\nIt has a nice homely feel, almost like sitting in a Korean home or kitchen once you step into the restaurant from regent lift lobby walk way.\n\nWe ordered the normal buffet on promotion.\n\nThe serving for pork Jowl and short ribs was quite generous.\n\nThe short ribs was cut a bit too thick I feel as I'm so used to the thin sliced wagyu variant.\n\nA bit sinewy to chew for me.\n\nThe kimchi soup was slightly on the saltier side though.\n\nKorean Buffet. A very sumptuous Korean BBQ buffet that also comes with classic Korean dishes like sangyetang and cold buckwheat noodles. Their food are really good but its the focus on the money shouldd really be on their grilled meats so don't get distracted by the cooked dishes!\n",

The pancake sauce was also just right!\n\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb The jajangmyeon and sizzling bibimbap were not too bad, nothing too special about it.\n\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb Service was good, staff were friendly!\n\nNot cheap and but taste is alright.\nThe Kim chi rice is fine but the service is rigid.\nWanted to pay at the counter but the waiter said can only scan and pay.\n(Updated) I went to another staff and she said can pay at counter.\n\nNot kids-friendly. They couldn't afford purchase high chair. Not suitable for families with toddler. The taste is similar to food count. Too pricey. Think won't go back again. Because I think we can cook these dishes by ourselves.\n\nFor family, please don't come if you bring your baby/toddler.\n",

Good value for money given the quality and quantity of food served.\n\nMost delicious banchan (side dishes) I've ever tried across any other Korean restaurants! The portion of the lunch set is pretty huge (and most importantly so full of delicious goodness \ud83d\ude0c), the waiters are friendly and welcoming. So happy to finally get to visit them today even though the queue was pretty insane ~ be prepared to wait at least about 20-30 minutes during lunch time.. Will come back again for sure!\n\nThe pork knuckle is soooo nice! Soft and tender! Well marinated too. And the beef bone soup is so thick, very refreshing~ definitely will come back again!\n\nBest korean food and legit so far that i have in SG!\nAuthentic side dish, meats and jjigae!\nComfy atmosphere for dinner.

                  "reviews": "\n\nRestaurant setting was a bit too dark for my liking. The meats were not marinated well enough and I have tasted better ones elsewhere. The stew was lacking in flavour and tasted too bland. Kimchi pancake was crispy but slightly thinner and smaller in size. Only good thing was that the staff were efficient in helping to grill the meats. Overall, for this standard and price, I won't be back as it's not up to expectations.\n\nLove the place! Decent portion with reasonable price. My husband and I ordered Keto set for 8, the staff helped us to cook the meat, we just sit and enjoy. The meat is juicy and tender, side dish is refillable, we barely could finish all food. Strong recommend!\n\nService at this Korean BBQ restaurant was exceptional, with attentive and friendly staff. The meat quality was average, and it didn't quite meet the desired freshness I was hoping for, which was a bit disappointing. On a brighter note, the standout item was the delicious seafood pancake, which I would recommend trying.\n\nWe came for an early dinner and were offered a table outside for more privacy, as there was a large gathering going on inside. The weather was cool so we agreed. Best decision ever! We had a table overlooking the quay which was unexpectedly romantic for KBBQ. Also since it's outdoors, we wouldn't have KBBQ infused in our clothes and hair :)\n\nWe ordered the 4 colours set: original, garlic, miso and red pepper for the pork belly, and beef kimchi for the stew. The meats are not too marinated or overly sweet which we really enjoyed. The type of meat served is definitely better marinated. My favourite was the miso. It was perfectly cooked by our attendant, SK (and more on him later) The beef stew was OK but not great. Maybe skip that and order their army stew, I've seen good reviews on it.\n\nWe were served by SK who was super friendly and super sharp. He offered refills before we asked and was always present yet never hovering. As the restaurant wasn't crowded at that time he took time to tell us about where they source their meat (Spain) and how they ensure they always have stock. We didn't order a lot but still got a lot of attention and service. I was hesitant to take away our leftovers but he offered to pack them and was super cool about it too. He made our visit very comfortable and memorable. Our meal cost $87 for 2 as we only had the set, rice and 1 non-alcoholic drink.\n\nOn our way out the restaurant had really filled up inside and while I enjoyed the view and privacy outside, I liked the bustle inside too. It's super cosy and exudes tavern vibes, I'll definitely be back with a bigger group to experience that, with their extensive makgeolli selection!\n\nPork belly focused KBBQ with a variety of flavours for you to choose from, including curry, garlic and wine. The meal comes with a stew and you can add on favourites such as the pancake and steamed egg. Food is okay but nothing crazy to rave about - good if you want a dependable porky bbq meal.\n",

Me andd my gf had the beef set meal at just 99 and it comes with so much beef and free flowing side dishes. The ambiance of the place was amazing down to their gold plated looking utensils and plates. The service was also very good. Definitely worth visiting!\n\nI've always passed by this restaurant, intrigued by its fancy interior and being a huge fan of Korean BBQ, I finally decided to give it a try for a birthday celebration. Unfortunately, I must admit that the experience left much to be desired in terms of both the food quality and overall value. We spent around $240 for a party of three, ordering the Beef Set, SotBap, and Kimchi Stew.\n\nOur initial disappointment began when we were seated right by the door, subject to a constant noise level that detracted from the dining ambiance. To compound our dissatisfaction, the food arrived at our table at an excruciatingly slow pace. When we were presented with a choice of grilling the meat ourselves or having it done in the kitchen. Regrettably, we opted for the latter, which proved to be a mistake because the result was overcooked beef - dry and vapid.\n\nIn an ironic twist, the Kimchi Stew turned out to be the only item that stood out.\n\nIn addition, surprise cake we brought for our friend took an unusually long time to make its appearance. This extended wait led our friend to catch on to the surprise, spoiling the special moment we had planned.\n\nIt is evident that the service staff were trying their best at service and perhaps they were understaffed. Nonetheless, that can't justify the disappointing quality of the food. All in all, it was a very unsatisfying experience and I definitely wouldn't recommend this restaurant to any of my friends.\n\nFirst time here , restaurant looks amazing and clean! Service is really good! But food quantity is not the surprise me\u2026is good experience,but maybe can more focus on food quality, I have same food in other restaurants and in Korea too.\n\nKorean Cuisine with fine dining but moderate price!\n\nI think this is one of the hidden gem in Tanjung Pagar area and if you love Korean food, MUST TRY.\n\nService is on par and beyond expectation! They might surprise you with mini food presentation \ud83d\ude02\n\nFood is well prepared.\n\nSuggest call to check table and availability.\n\nThey close quite early so dinner do come earlier.\n\nTo me, this is definitely a Michelin star worthy restaurant. From the pumpkin soup in the beginning, to the impressive and delectable array of banchan, the attentive service including the grilling of the meat for the diners - all these way exceeded our expectation of Korean BBQ experience here in Singapore, and at a price that is comparable to other restaurants. The brass cutlery used here accentuate the fine dining experience and feeling of indulging in a grandeur feast.  This would definitely be my goto place for Korean fare henceforth.\n",

Will be back again.\n\nit\u2019s not the first time i went there but gonna be my last visit.\n\ni ordered army stew and when the food was served i quickly grab the ramyeon. It has a funny taste (definitely is near expiring or expired noodle) as i always ate instant noodle at home.\n\nWhen i feedback to the staff, the staff get the manager to us. We were shocked when i told the manager about it what she did was take chopstick/bowl grab our noodles and tasted it? (without our consent).\n\nThe manager even waited at the cashier waited us to made payment and show me a pack of noodle that is not expire (oh please, you can always take the latest batch) plus is not even right when you take our noodles to taste without even asking us so disgusting. Lastly, she is extremely rude and sounds like is our problem?\n\nEnjoyed my experience as a solo diner here~ ordered  sundubu which was really flavourful and i loved the side dishes especially the steamed eggplant that came w it \ud83c\udfb5\ud83c\udfb5\ud83c\udfb5\ud83c\udfb5 and thank you to server who also adhered to my request of removing clams as im allergic~ the hearty meal warmed my heart on a bad day \ud83e\udd70\n\nHit this restaurant in late afternoon after roaming around to hunt for foods. We decided to try Korean eventually. The staffs there were friendly. We were second last customer before they call it a day on Saturday.\n\nOrdered few dishes as shown in the photos. The spiciness is my liking, my wife likes their tofu kimchi soup and we ordered the garlic soy chicken which surprisingly tasty.\n\nWe were seated next to the glass that look into the Raffles central which is very decent for us. At the mark of 3, many customers got rejected since they are closing but they don't rush us for that. Will visit again soon on coming weekend!\n\nAuthentic Korean food that you will love.\nVery yummy banchan (side dish) especially the anchovy and fish cake.\n\nGinseng chicken soup, beef Bulgogi and steamed egg is a must!\n\nPortion is big, worth your money!\n\nDinner time isn\u2019t that crowded so is a good place to have dinner!\n",

Food was amazing and came out so fast, it was really well marinated and seasoned. Panchan was one of the best I ever had, even better than many Korean restaurants in Tanjong Pagar area. Everything was just right. Atmosphere-wise, I love the choice of songs here, all good Korean songs with no mainstream ones, what a refreshing place. Now down to the service, all restaurants can be crazy at peak hours but honestly we had really good service, no fuss, no one bothering us eating or doing unnecessary stuff, the waitress we had was polite and fast. Not sure why the 1-star reviews were so negative on this part.\n\nOrdered a tofu stew (for 2-3 pax).\n\nFor the price of $42, I would expect much more seafood. The shrimps are super small (as you can see in the picture and not that many), squid in small shreds.\n\nTake note that side dishes can only be refilled once.\n\nService is below average in terms of friendliness and a welcoming vibe.\n\nThe soup and side dishes are decent, I just wished the meat quantity for this dish was much more generous and the service was better, then I would gladly pay that price.\n\nThis is my favourite hunt for authentic Korean food. Cosy restaurant with great variety. Love all the little side dishes as well as the mains. Restaurant gets busy and packed from 1215pm. Best to arrive at 1130am to get seats for bigger group.\n\nFriendly service by a family run business. Food is great, very nice side dishes and of course the main course. Gotten my Korean fix!\n\nLocated on Killiney Road close to Somerset MRT and a short walk from Orchard road offers pocket friendly and homely Korean Cuisine. Walked in on a Sunday evening and got a place easily though other times times have seen it quiet crowded .\nService was very good ! The Chicken Bulgogi , ginseng Chicken soup and Kimchi Chicken Fried rice were all tasty! Each serving enough for 1 pax . Nice K-pop hits keep playing in the background and the staff keep attending and checking to your needs ! A nice place if you fancy Korean food!\n",

Overall the chicken is quite fresh & crispy the biggest issue is that even the spicy sauce is sweet. Noodles were good too & had a nice balance of sweet & savoury. Overall ok, not our favourite chicken place but good for late night fix.\n\nNice ambience. Order Chicken with cheese. It has lots of spicy tteokbokki which tasted really good. Fried chicken tasted so so, the battered is too thick, seaweed rice ball has so much rice but too little ingredients to mix with. Side dishes and jar of green tea (diluted) were given free. Steamed egg is nice. Picked up free ice cream as you exit. The price here is on the high side. Menu has wide variety.\n\nWas missing korea, but too busy to travel. Glad that I found this place online and paid a visit. Their dishes were relatively similar to the taste I recalled while I was in Korea. And got free ice cream at the end of my meal.\nFood is good. Service is good. Atmosphere can be improved but in no way bad.\n\nKnown to be the OG of Korean Fried Chicken Restaurant in Singapore which first introduced Chi-Mek (Korean Fried Chicken and Beer), Kko Kko Na Ra has recently launched a series of Crab-tastic dishes featuring fresh premium Korean Crab caught from Yeonpyeong Island on the West Sea.\n\nWe savored the essence of the Korea West Sea with their new launch \ud835\ude4e\ud835\ude4b\ud835\ude44\ud835\ude3e\ud835\ude54 \ud835\ude46\ud835\ude46\ud835\ude4a\ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude42\ud835\ude40 \ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude3c\ud835\ude49\ud835\ude42 (\ud835\ude4e\ud835\ude65\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude6e \ud835\ude46\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude63 \ud835\ude3e\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude57 \ud835\ude4e\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude6c) $85 which is the perfect hearty dish that warms the soul. The spicy broth is packed with punch with assorted vegetables, tofu and mussels.\n\nWe also had their ever satisfying \ud835\ude4e\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude6e \ud835\ude42\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude61\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude58 \ud835\ude41\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude59 \ud835\ude3e\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude60\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude63 $23 and \ud835\ude46\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude62\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5e \ud835\ude4b\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude60\ud835\ude5a $25.\n\nRare find of viral \ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude5c \ud835\ude43\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude61\ud835\ude6a that has set Korea's social media ablaze right here . For those with sweet tooth, dont miss the chance to enjoy these here. Perfect ending to our meal with Shine Muscat Grapes $5, Orange $3.80 & Mixed Fruits $3.80. Completed our meal with Green Apple CHORONG CHORONG Soju $18!\n\nSatisfied tummies & great service.\n\nWould recommend the seafood pancake, soft and crispy. Their sides were well presented and I like the pickled radish but their kimchi was a little bland in my opinion. Ordered their fried chicken and it was nice, but the kitchen or staff seemed to have forgotten our order and we had to wait longer than expected to receive our food. Fried octopus was a little chewy so it was a little tough to eat. Tea and water was complimentary and you can get a free ice cream upon leaving too (common in many Korean restaurants).\n",

It has, hands down, the best Vietnamese barbecue in Singapore. The staff are always so friendly and accommodating, and the owner never fails to make you feel at home by personally greeting each guest. And let\u2019s talk about the food - absolutely delicious every single time! The raw prawn dish, in particular, is to die for. It\u2019s obvious that a lot of care goes into every aspect of this restaurant, from the carefully crafted menu to the overall atmosphere. I always look forward to my visits to Lang N\u01b0\u1edbng Vietnam and highly recommend it to anyone looking for authentic flavors and top-notch service. It\u2019s always a treat to dine here!\n\nFood very nice. I like their cockles in tamraind sauxe as well as the prawns steamed in herbs. Service staff very approachable and friendly. Very attentive to your needs. Ambience very nice, feels like you are transported to a local eatery in Vietnam with the low tables and chairs. Vietnamese music in the play too .\n\nStumbled into this restaurant on a Sunday and it was empty compared to the rest of its neighbours.\n\nWe ordered the BBQ meat dishes as recommended and asked for them to help us with the BBQ in the kitchen.\n\nPork was the best of the lot.\nThe premium beef was out of stock and we opted for the VN beef. It tasted like protein just not beef. It was coated with alot of sweet sauce and we could quite make out what meat it was.\n\nThe coke we ordered was flat and there wasn\u2019t and fizz left.\n\nWe packed some more food home.\nThe usual, Pho, spring rolls to continue out dinner as it was really stuffy and hot in the restaurant.\n\nStaff was friendly except a little forgetful.\nWe waited half an hour only to be informed they ran out of the dish we ordered.\n\nSelf proclaimed first Vietnamese BBQ in Singapore that transports you to Vietnam with its low tables and chairs, making you believe you're eating on the streets of Saigon.\nMeat never tasted this refreshing with their generous serving of herbs and tangy sauces.\n\n29 May 2023:\nthe most authentic Vietnamese food I\u2019ve tasted in Singapore so far. grilled pork & vermicelli was really good!!! fried spring rolls made us gasp a bit so definitely must try. the shaky beef was not good, too tough- lesson learnt, don\u2019t order a dish just cause the name is funny. their coffee is nice but wished it was stronger (Vietnamese coffee has to knock you off your chair to be of standard right?)\n\n3rd July 2023:\nDecided to try their broken rice. It\u2019s as good as the vermicelli! really loved the meatloaf too (it has tiny noodles inside) overall great, clean & fills you up.\n",

They have plenty of choices for main, drinks as well as desserts. Grilled pork vermicelli, Bun bo Hue, che ba mau and iced tea are highly recommended. There are 2 separate indoor seating sections inside the mall, and one area outdoor that\u2019s usually good at evening time.\n\nA no frills place with decent food. You order from a QR code, and the food arrives petty quickly. The Banhmi was just okay. The fish tasted good. The beef with rice and banhmi bread was also decent. The spring roll was okay with the dip that they provide. Service is average.\n\nA fantastic little place for a casual sunset dinner whilst in a riverside walk/bike ride. Food was delicious (great Smokey BBQ flavour on our meat, plenty of fresh veges and self serve condiments) at a reasonable price. Photos show the red bean smoothie, chicken bun and beef boon. Service was very fast, although minimal (self order via QR).\n\nNicely grill porkchop flavour on point\nDessert is normal.\nPork amount could have been a little more and it will be perfect.\nOrder via QR code.\nPay inside the shop after dining.\nAlfresco dining feels gd with the right weather. But might get a hint of cigarettes smell once in awhile\nservice are friendly\n\nSpring Roll was too oily. U can taste the oil. So was the Vietnamese pancake very oily. Grilled pork chop rice was tender n tasty. Pho was good quality stock. Someone place was crowded.\n",

The portion sizes are unreasonably small and the overall quality of the food is low, with some ingredients missing. Based on my experience, I cannot recommend this place.\n\nI guess the good review could be the free 5 dollar return voucher. \ud83e\udd14\n\nTried the various dishes shown in picture, all were very good, fried spring roll were packed with meat, chicken was very tender, grilled pork is super delicious with the dry noodle. Everything that we tried taste good and the quantity is not bad too. Used eatigo discount and the whole meal was super worth it. Highly recommend this place and will surely be back!\n\nFood is decent with an interesting interior decor.\n\nHowever, as ironic as it is, despite being named after the dish, I'd always appreciated the diverse non-Pho menu options at the Rangoon Road branch. I'd believed that might have been the chain's strategy to Vietnamese food seeing as there isn't much more complexity to Vietnamese cuisine in Singapore aside from Pho and Banh Mi.\n\nThinking that was the standard across all Mrs Pho branches, I was a little disappointed to see that that menu at this branch was rather limited mostly to Pho and Banh Mi with limited other options.\n\nStill, the food was decent.\n\nFirst off, the food is mediocre or less. The pho soup was just salty and missing that deep brothy taste. The dry noodle were the same as you\u2019d find in any Kopitiam or Hawker\u2019s Centre. The drink cups were the size of kids drinks.. the cup is half the size of an iPhone. The only thing that tasted good was the fried spring rolls but they were very tiny as well.\n\nAlso, the place was empty (only us) even though we went during peak dinner hours.\n\nI really liked the old decor years ago before it became a franchise. The tiny low tables and short seats which really reminded me of Vietnam. Now it\u2019s modernised with even a food-serving robot patrolling the aisle. When ordering the pho, request for basil leaves, which is no longer arrives with the noodles. The leaves make the noodle soup so much more fragrant and reminiscent of the dish in Vietnam. And of course the coffee is great. Vietnamese drip coffee with condensed milk is unbeatable.\n",

Long Phung offers a spread of delicious Vietnamese dishes at prices that won't break the bank.\n\nEvery dish is packed full of flavour. You'll be left craving for more. And as you're dining, let your cup of Vietnamese coffee slowly drip, and you can enjoy the robust beverage as a perfect finisher to your meal.\n\nSeating space is adequate, but do arrive early if you're looking to dine as the spaces fill up quite fast, especially on weekends.\n\nWe were out in the east and decided to try this place because there were a lot of good reviews. Seems like a pretty traditional Vietnamese menu. Food was good and you can tell it wasn\u2019t seasoned for foreigners\u2026it had very sublet but well balanced flavors. We loved all the sauces and the balance of crunch & soft textures. Our favorite was the fried spring rolls the flaky crust was so good it was addictive. The smoothies left a lot to be desired, they seem to be very skimpy on the fruit. Otherwise I love it that the food is also very light so you don\u2019t feel so stuffed at the end. We didn\u2019t get any noodle soup, maybe next time, but most people seem to have some sort of soup. We would definitely go back. The downside is the location (if you aren\u2019t close) but the price, value and quality are all top notch.\n\nMost of their dishes come with sweet sauce which  I like. Beef was okie, not very tender but their spring roll was good. Their crepe was special, inside got prawn and pork belly. I think they add coconut to the crepe\n\nPaid 23.22 for the meal. Food was decent, served very quickly.\n\nAll seems fresh. My spring rolls may have been sitting a while as all 4 pieces were stocked together. Tough texture for the skin. Ingredients were fine.\n\nOverall more of a good vibe. Maybe skip the ones I have ordered and get a pho or fish. Didn't satisfy my cravings.\n\nAuthentic Vietnamese food. Speedy service. Love the jellyfish salad, grilled squid, and beef stew. Banh Mi bread is exactly the same as those found in Vietnam. Returned twice in less than a week. Highly recommended!\n",

The spring roll skin was thick and dry, and the soup lacked the strong flavors I expected.\n\nOn the bright side, the service was commendable. One of the staff members noticed that the spring roll might be too big for my son to eat comfortably, so he kindly offered to cut it in half, showing good attentiveness to the customers.\n\nI ordered a vegetarian banh mi for takeaway. The bread was still crispy after the 20-min trip. The lemongrass tofu, sauteed mushrooms and pickled vegetables tasted nice. Wish there was a bit more toppings though as I'm more used to having my banh mi overflowing with ingredients. The staff was super friendly and nice even though I was there for just 10 seconds to pick up my order.\n\nNondescript Viet joint at the quiet UE square. Food was quite good though I felt my dish (dry rice noodle salad with lemongrass beef) should have more meat, there were too little beef slices. However, we liked the fried spring rolls and my husband enjoyed his chicken pho. A bit pricey (nearly $70) for 2 mains, an appetiser and 2 coconuts.\n\nMoc Quan is a nice Vietnamese restaurant. The slice beef pho noodle is very smooth and tasty. Sliced beef is thin and easy to eat. The sauce is also on the spicy side.\n\nThe creme brulee has coffee taste. It's soft, not too sweet, as the sauce is bitter, but with the crystal sugar, the sweetness is just right.\n\nThe peanut sauce for Goi Cuon Is spicy. We requested for the peanut sauce to be without the chilli, and the staff were very nice to make it for us.\n\nOne of the staff is very kind to offer to refill our water at the end of the meal.\n\nIt was a pleasant experience.\n\nThey had outdoor seats too, which is good for those who do not want to be under aircon.\n\nLove the food here.

I will come back again one day..\n\nGreat flavours and affordable prices. Went to this hide-out located on the second floor of a shop house. The place is ran by Vietnamese it seems. Try out their set lunches,really good and worth it. It\u2019s also halal, so suitable for everyone to try!\n\nIn contrary of what everyone has said about the service, I had a good service from the kind lady here.\n\nNow about the food, I had a pho and spring roll. I can say both taste authentic. Pho broth is very savoury, beef is very tender maybe they cooked it overnight. Spring roll is very fresh, sauce is just nice.\n\nThe serving time is a bit slow indeed despite we were the only guest. So I would recommend coming here on the weekend or maybe to rethink whenever you see many guests.\n\nAnother important thing, it's Halal.\n",

But if you are nearby, definitely worth a try.\n\nSpace is surprisingly quite good for a casual dinner with space for single diners up to big groups.\n\nSome of the staff are hearing impaired but i did not have any problems with ordering and payment. Kudos to the business owner for running an inclusive workplace.\n\nLovely small shop in the basement of Orchard gateway.\nLunch crowd creeped in, and service still very fast! Water is not complimentary.\n\nBeef & Pork Pho are light and fragrant. Noodles are more towards kway teow than Pho rice noodles. Soup is zesty because of lime and sweet from the meat. Portion is just nice.\nI rate: 3.5/5 \ud83c\udf1f\n\nSpicy Beef bowl is really good. Love how there is a shrimp flavour in it and made the broth very robust. There's not a lot of soup though. Noodles are thick beehoon. Great for hangovers. It's not very spicy. I rate: 4/5 \ud83c\udf1f\n\nAvocado Milk Shake was so good! Thick and creamy with avocado fragrance. Good for sharing as it's quite big and filling. M\nI rate: 4/5 \ud83c\udf1f\n\nUpdated:\nVisited again in July 2023\nPortions were much more generous than before. Service was fast and efficient. We didn\u2019t have to wait long for food. The kind owner was seen personally serving customers and was very kind. I ordered the grilled lemongrass chicken with noodle salad and opted out from noodles. More salad greens was given. It was delicious and chicken portion was good.\n\nThe service was very friendly and sincere. Visited on a busy Saturday evening, and the staff took quite a while for payment and taking orders.\nThe food came rather quickly though. I ordered boiled pork salad without noodles and the owner even came out to specially check that my order was right and whether I needed anything else. Appreciate the gesture! Would have liked for more herbs though. Recommend to visit outside of peak hours :)\n",

The portion is big, almost couldn\u2019t finish the spring roll side dish I ordered \ud83d\ude0a. Overall it\u2019s value-for-money, and the surrounding environment is chill and very \u201ccampus-like\u201d\n\nI didnt had a good experience on their service today especially from the unfeminine waitress (very short hair) that ask me to give up my table because my friend hasn\u2019t arrive.\nThey could tell me the regulation before I enter. As I reach 12.15pm, she chased me at 1225pm. So I offer to order some food for myself first and this is accepted \ud83d\ude44.\nUnderstand that The restaurant is packed, but her service is curt.\n\nThe food tasted rather decent and noodles is very texture and addictive.\nIt\u2019s so disappointing to have my lunch ruined over such service. Hope to see improvement.\n\nVery average tasting but quite good portion pho. Served kinda warm rather than hot. The spring rolls are ok too, as quite hard to get wrong for Vietnamese spring roll. Overall, an ok place to get a quick simple lunch.\n\nVietnamese fusion, tucked into a corner of NUH/ Science Park area. We ordered the shaking beef shabu and caramelised veg as mains. Decent taste, decent price (lunch set ~15pp)\n\nPlus point, vegetarian friendly.\n\nPretty good vietnamese place near Kent Ridge MRT.\nThis place is a bit funny cos of the very small opening times. 4hrs a day during weekday lunches only.\nThe place is well organised with the tables fitted out with all the things you need as a diner.\nThe menu is quite unique with traditional viet fare along with fusion type dishes.\nOrdered the wagyu pho and cheeseburger spring rolls.\nPho was pretty good but my only negative comment was it felt a bit small.\nThe cheeseburger spring rolls tasted like cheese burger but in spring roll form.\nAll in all, a great place to eat. Hope it thinks about opening to more extended hours.\n",

The soup without MSG is more sweet.\nThe shrimp and pork ribs noodle is like the Singapore style. Quite normal. Meat and shirt portioning are small.\nTried the egg coffee. It\u2019s a great experience. The egg is made into milk form as the upper layer. It does have the raw egg taste without the coffee. The coffee is a little bitter.\nWent at 450pm and the staff said they only start work at 5pm. However in Google map stated as operating.\n\nWe walked past this Vietnamese restaurant and decided to come here for our team lunch. Food was delicious, everything was on point however the were short handed and by the time we were done with lunch, our drinks unfortunately hadn't arrived. The team's very sweet and apologetic but we have to get back to meetings. Definitely will want to come back when service improves as food is fresh and flavourful - one of the better Vietnamese cuisine in Singapore  \ud83d\udcaf\n\nHad lunch with colleagues here on Friday - staff here were friendly and had a good number of vegetarian options! I had the Vegetarian vermicelli, it was very flavourful but slightly salty for my person preference. The interior was nicely designed with spacious seats, would highly recommend!\n\nJust the right place to relive our Vietnamese holiday!\n\nIt was a quiet Saturday to eat at this usually crowded restaurant. The service by staff Ice was fantastic. She even offered to show us her mini garden and gave us a tiny bitter gourd to grow it at home.\n\nNice ambience and would be good if we could access the other section that is more nostalgic. Food was fantastic and the pancake was delicious.\n\nI love the bamboo rice dipped in chicken gravy. The chewiness and fragrance of the rice made this a simple yet satisfying dish. Reminds me of eating by the roadside in Vietnam. The beef pho is another must try together with the pancake.\n\nOverall a cozy restaurant that brings back memories of our trip to Vietnam.  Will return for more.\n\nEvery dish I tried was an explosion of flavors. But wait, there's more! As if the incredible food and beautiful ambience weren't enough, they even surprised us with a complimentary dessert. It was the perfect sweet ending to an already fantastic meal. The generosity and thoughtfulness of the staff truly made my experience memorable.\n\nI highly recommend Co Chung Vietnamese Restaurant for lunch. Whether you're looking for a place to impress a client, enjoy a meal with friends, or simply indulge in a satisfying lunch, this restaurant has it all. The combination of delicious local Vietnamese food, inviting ambience, attentive service, and even a free dessert make it a must-visit destination. Trust me, you won't be disappointed!\n",

They now serve banh mi too! Recommended to come here and use eatigo discount to grab a banh mi and viet iced coffee(no discount for drinks)for a tea time snack. Banh mi of course cannot win the ones in Vietnam but for the portion and taste is at least 8/10. Please support such shops instead of those big chains and too commercialized ones with not so nice food. Kris+ allowed here took with 6mpd earn rate.\n\nThis is my first time to this outlet at Rangoon Road, and I was told by my friends that this was one of the earlier outlets.\n\nI did not even know there was an outlet here at the end of Rangoon Road, where it was very quiet. It's not really accessible unless you drive.\n\nWe ordered the sliced beef pho and Hanoi sliced chicken pho as mains, and the fried spring rolls. Our friends ordered the fresh spring rolls as well, but they weren't really to our liking.\n\nThe fried spring rolls has minced meat and yam, packed fully, but the size of the spring rolls were tiny.\n\nThe sliced beer pho and the chicken pho were pretty decent, but that's also because I have actually never eaten really fantastic or bad pho. The good thing is the portion was quite big, so no lack of soup or ingredients.\n\nUnder staff for better services. Still give 4 stars for services. The team of 3 boys, make it work and still bring out great food.\n\nOne of the better Pho we ever had try from many other places.\n\nA place I frequent if I need a quick-fix for pho. Menu here has been revamped. Their regular pho, like it or not, comes with Japanese Wagyu. Tender and pricey. They have a \u201clight\u201d portion for smaller eaters \u2014 but my guess is to cater for folks used to their older menu (and prices)? You pay a bit less than before, but also get less to eat. Thankfully, their broth is still good. Now, do I need Wagyu in my pho? Not me. I think it is best kept on a grill. I love their wing bean, and its size has shrunk too. Seems like a trend\u2026 enough surprises for today. Service is nearly nonexistent. I thought their robot was more cheerful. They \u201cfeed you like family\u201d but sure don\u2019t treat you like one. Unfortunately. Finally, I think their toothpicks should be managed with more hygiene in mind (see photo).\n\nCame for lunch on Saturday afternoon. Not very crowded but notice a lot of delivery orders. The sturgeon in a hot plate was very nice and recommended. Also had the pork pancake which was crunchy but a little difficult to eat. In Vietnam it comes with a thin rice paper to roll up and easier to hold and eat. Also liked the salted lemonade and Vietnamese drip coffee.\n",

We had Platter of rolls, Papaya salad, Chicken stew, Fried crab, Daylily flowers, Mini pancakes, Grilled squid. Particularly good were the crab and daylily. Finished off with a good cup of drip coffee. Service was top notch, if you can get their attention as there's not enough waiters.\n\nImpressed by the vietnamese cuisine and it's pet friendly! My favourite is their pork sausage. It is so juicy and well marinated. Love their coffee donut too! The fried rice is a must try too!\n\nNice beautiful place at Dempsey. It used to house the former Dome and now this is a place for Vietnamese cuisine. We were early and have nice seats near front of the restaurant. I like the dishes we ordered though the soup was a tad too salty for me. The wraps were nice and the coconut was refreshing.. definitely would consider going back again as their service is excellent and attentive. Parking was great as it is just outside the restaurant..however that said, it could be extremely crowded on weekends and you might want to go early.\n\nfood here was quite tasty, with some dishes better than others. favourite dishes were the rolls, and the hot and sour soup! overall, a decent meal but does not stand out among the other restaurant offerings at dempsey\n\nBeen returning for the Vietnamese ice coffee. Another refreshing dish would be mango salad which I usually asked for 2 serving. Main course is the usual beef pho. Recommend this place if you are at Dempsey Hill.\n",

Multiple tables including ours were waiting for dishes. Our own experience was of 4 food items. The first took 20 min the last more than an hour. The poor girl doing front of house was struggling with what seemed to be a lack of system. When a dish came out of the kitchen she had to scan the half doz chits on a board to see where it was to go. We saw hot noodles turn cold sitting for more than 10-15 min before they got delivered to a table. Once to ours for an item we did not order before some rapid fire discussion with the kitchen before it got to the right place. Easily distracted by the next dish popping out of the kitchen, the current dish gets forgotten and not delivered. Or a take out meal gets packed even though the Food Delivery guy is not around. Frankly we saw the staff trying but it was chaotic. The food was pretty good (less the Water Fern Cake), but often a little colder than it should be due to delays. And 4 food items strung apart over an hour getting to the table marred the enjoyment. It's a pity but we are never going back and we recommend anyone without an extra hour over what you planned for the meal or if you are hungry to give it a miss.\n\nBeen here since they first opened restaurant days, I think they are growing a good business, food also tasted better. The fish sauce for the com tam was nice. It could be crowded during peak hours and the restaurant is limit seatings so come avoid these time or planning to queue. Service could be improved.\n\nSmall and crowded place.\nService was alright.\nFood were pricey tho.\nTaste wise, some good some okay, some can be better.\nTheir traditional Banh Mi is good.\nEgg Coffee is nice.\nGrilled pork ribs flavour nice, but texture a bit firm.\n\nQueue is always present. Revisited several times and longest wait was 45mins. The dining place is cozy with a Vietnamese-like feel. This time round recommended to my friends who are vegetarian and we ordered their vegetarian soup noodle and vegetarian spring rolls. They were surprisingly delicious and flavourful. Definitely will revisit whenever time permits.\n\nOrdered the spicy beef + pork noodle. The soup is delicious,  thr noodle is smooth. Only problem was that the beef and pork rib was too hard ... not tender. Staff was not well conversed in English ... service was ok. Price was a bit on high size ...\n",

                  "reviews": "\n\nI ordered \"Rice noodles and duck with bamboo shoots\" and it's quite nice, not too salty, the bamboo shoots is tender, serving together with special sweet and sour fish sauce.\n\nThe service is fast and the staff are very friendly. You need to go to the counter for ordering and making payment. You can pay by cash or Paynow. There's no Credit card option.\n\nQuite variety of food. It's very hot at lunch hour but the shop provide standing fan, unfortunately it's not that much helpful also.\n\nI think the price might be a little high given the facilities and food. But maybe because it's at a bit centre area?\n\n- Beside the eatery, this place also sells some goods from Vietnam such as instant noodles, soft drink, sauces and coffee.\n- The food here is acceptable.\n\nUpdated Note: Price has been increasing .. Considering the self-service, lack of aircon \u2026 it\u2019s fallen off my \u201cmust-go\u201d list\u2026.\n\nA good friend of mine recommended OC Mai months ago. I forgot all about it until I was in the vicinity recently. Today's my second visit. I don't profess to be a Vietnamese food expert but I spotted many Vietnamese patrons.\n\nAMBIENCE\nIt's hole in the wall. The wall of the The Bencoolen, to be exact. You sit at the sloping sidewalk. No air-con. You might be lucky and get the fan.  Pray that you don't encounter patrons who smoke :)\n\nPARKING\nParking is ridiculously challenging in this area. The Bencoolen's parking fees are quite reasonable. After 5pm, a flat $1.20. No grace period.\n\nSERVICE\nSelf-service with the buzzer to let you know when your food is ready.\n\nPAYMENT\nCash, Paynow, Paylah. No credit cards.\n\nPRICING\nAbove average. Given the central location, I suspect the rentals are also above average.\n\nFOOD\nThe menu is absolutely staggering! You'd be spoilt for choices, and there's even a western menu. For the 1st visit, my husband was disappointed that they didn't have the Vietnamese grilled chicken chop with rice (his favourite). He settled for fried rice.  Verdict: Avoid. Expensive and too moist.\nI took the Beef Pho and Bahn Xeo.  The beef pho stock was average and the beef ball was rather minuscule and disappointing.\nWhat TOTALLY ROCKS.....is the BANH XEO. So good!!\nAnd this, you cannot do takeaway. You MUST eat it on the spot when it is freshly prepared. Crispy and healthy. Super authentic. (Note: i took a Banh Xeo cooking class at Hoi An before, from a Vietnamese chef.).\n\nCONCLUSION\nGiven the staggering range of dishes, it is possible to end up with hits and misses. The eatery should consider tagging what her signature dishes are. Will I visit OC Mai again? For the Banh Xeo, definitely yes. And to try other dishes highly recommended by reviewers. I heard the Vietnamese drip coffee is good too. Have not yet had the courage to try their Bahn Mi. Am super fussy how Bahn Mi is done.\n\nFood taste so so only.\nI had try Vietnamese food at other air con places which taste better, price are better and service are better.\nThis place is warm and hot without aircon. And is self service, price is not as good as those.\n\nTried their pho like finally as it\u2019s always crowded.\n\nI\u2019m surprised by the price, it\u2019s a little pricey considering their store is non air conditioned and it\u2019s by the walk way.\n\nSimple and straightforward kitchen set up that you can see how your food being prepared when you place your order at the counter. It\u2019s self service. In store they also sell lots of vietnam local delights such as sauces, noodles and other dry stuff.\n\nThe pho came, nothing to wow about. The soup is ok, but not the beef. It\u2019s gamey and it\u2019s unlike the usual sliced beef I had. The beef balls has a spongey texture instead of the usual meaty beef balls I had.  Love their chilli it\u2019s very spicy!\n\nWe also order chicken pho but it came with very boney chicken parts not shredded chicken.\n\nFresh spring roll is ok.\n",

Hence the 4 stars\n\nOtherwise, the soups were really good. We had the Crab Noodle and the Braised Beef Stew with the Original Pho. All 3 were unique and pretty fragrant and flavourful. Prices are around $15-20 per pax with an additional $4ish if you order a drink\n\nDelicious Bahn Mi! Like the other reviews said, the bread is a banger. Got the beef, cheese and pineapple (one of their recommendations) and it was worth every dollar. Really enjoyed myself. Glad there were vegetarian options too! The interior was very nicely decorated and quite nice to take photos.\n\nThere was a cockroach spotted around the floor of the premises. I asked for chicken baguette the guy put beef in there as well. So off putting!\nI can\u2019t eat beef. The price - about 11 dollars for a banh mi- is so expensive for what it is. Will not return!! The guy preparing the baguette was not friendly and there are no prices stated on the menu. I regret patronising this place.\n\nUpdate* Prices have gone up slightly. B1 is selling at $12 now. Portion remains quite big and filling.\n\nTheir B1 Co Hai Baguette and B5 Stir-fried Beef & Onion Baguette are truly amazing. Super delicious! I regularly have cravings for them and travel down to eat. Best in town! #BestBanhMi\n\nQuite an unassuming place. Have just walked right past a couple of times as I wasn't aware that there were more seats on the upper floor. Food portions are pretty big that I couldn't finish it. Taste wise, it's good for the price. I especially enjoyed my fruit tea. When we entered there was only one staff, and it didn't seem like anyone was going to show us to a table, so we walked right in. Noticed the same when other customers walked in. When paying, couldn't find a staff to accept payment, so one of us had to go downstairs to find a staff to come up and settle payment for us. Tables where customers have left were left uncleared for a while. Wonder if they are understaffed? Overall still think it's a pretty good restaurant to check out!\n",

In fact, if the beef is fresh, even if it's just blanched and not cooked for a long time, it shouldn't have a tough texture.\n\nAs a restaurant on Orchard Road, the prices here are relatively budget-friendly, making it suitable for solo travelers. However, it's not very friendly to customers who don't eat pork, as more than half of the side dishes contain pork.\n\nThe soup base has a mild flavor, and the portion of beef is not small. Overall, it's a restaurant with good value for money.\n\nAs other customers have mentioned, the tables and chairs in this restaurant are particularly uncomfortable, and there's a very loud and piercing noise every time someone sits down or leaves! For customers with sensitive hearing, this can be quite torturous. I wonder if the restaurant uses these especially uncomfortable chairs to encourage customers to eat quickly and leave sooner!\n\nI love pho, it\u2019s one of my favorite dishes. That\u2019s why I was excited to try the beef and chicken pho at Mrs Pho. Unfortunately, I found that the taste wasn\u2019t as rich as I had hoped. It was just an ordinary pho. However, the clam entree was delicious.\n\nA bit disappointing as the pho noodle was overcooked. Other than that my Felix beef pho broth is tasty. Would\u2019ve been nicer if they let you add your own herbs. Chicken pho on the other hand is quite tasteless. Not quite up to standard. Other than that the place is decorated like you\u2019re dining infront of a Vietnamese shop with small store front. To make it truly authentic, they need to bring out the short stools and foldable table \ud83d\ude09\n\nHad a lunch meeting with my friend/insurance agent at Mrs Pho 313. Some items were not available like the wagyu pho and the beef brisket pho which would\u2019ve been nice to order so we settled for beef combination pho. The restaurant was offering a meal upgrade for additionl 4plus dollars for a piece of fresh spring rolls and small size drink. Overall still as good as before but notice that their prawn sugar cane has lesser meat than before maybe due to inflation. Overall nice place to meet as the staff did not chase us away and managed to settle some insurance discussion. Funny thing is we forgot to settle the bill and the service staff approached us with patience. Mrs Pho staff thank you and we sincerely apologize for forgeting to settle the bill \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\n\nwas craving for bahn mi, finally got to try it. Added fried spring roll as well. Food was good and portion is just nice. didn\u2019t require me to enter my details upon ordering.\n\nHowever I do feel like the tables need to be cleaned and dry.

We tried the beef pho soup ($12.50) and fried spring roll (5pieces).\n\nPortion was huge, they gave a good portion of huge chunky beef slices. Soup was flavourful as well but i felt there was a lot of msg in it. We thought the size of the spring rolls would be like the Chinese kind, but it\u2019s a super long roll cut into two so we ended up having 10 pieces!\n\nWill recommend as a better lunch option if you work around the area!\n\nA Vietnamese friend brought me here. We had the sliced beef noodle soup (pho), mixed platter springroll which had both fried and non fried, and the drip iced milk coffee. The bill Was $21 per pax which was reasonable.\nFood wise, the spring rolls and coffee is nice. The soup does not contain much msg however the sliced beef could be more tender. Good experience\n\nBeef pho was smooth and the broth was tasty. However, the beef was too overcooked for my liking and could be more tender. Portion was not bad. Spring roll was good. Hygiene was OK (staff wore their masks properly). Overall, just a good place to have a quick Vietnamese fix as ambience is lacking.\n",

Must order: bun cha, banh mi, pho, banana flower salad and the viet drip coffee! -basically everything on the menu \ud83d\ude0d Everything has its unique flavor without overpowering the taste of the fresh ingredients.\nMy friend recently hosted his party there and their buffet spread was so worth it. All the guests were singing praises about the food!\n\nOne of the best Vietnamese food I had outside Vietnam. The owner mentioned that the chef is from Hanoi.\n\nChanced upon this little gem of a place as I was nearby in RWS. We came on a weekday for lunch and the place was pleasantly not crowded since it was after the lunch crowd. We ordered Cha Ca, Bun Cha, fresh & fried spring rolls, lemongrass drink & sour plum drink. All food & drinks were excellent!! The Cha Ca was very yummy and reminiscent of what we had in Hanoi. Bun Cha was a slight variation of what we had in Hanoi but the soup/dip & meat were tasty & flavourful. Really brought back memories. Highly recommended to try! Will be back for banh mi & pho.\n\nUpdate - 12 Aug\n\nHad the Banh Mi with caramel pork. It was delicious and the bread was crispy outside & fluffy inside & overall tasty. The bread is made in-house, maybe that's why. Capped everything with an iced Viet coffee for a very satisfying meal.\n\nThe best and must try dish is the banana flower salad. The other dishes including the bun cha are just average.\n",

They claimed I ordered the wrong ones . Request to change but they refuse and no explanation. It\u2019s my words against theirs.\nService is cold and unfriendly.\nSoup noodle is just salt and hot water, tasteless. Basil leaves just 3 leaves and few strands of taugay. Meatball is hard and not fresh. Can tell that they just heat it up in the microwave oven. The spring roll skin is hard and rubbery. Chicken meat in the chicken soup is tough and rubbery. Lemon grass drink tasted like sugar water and nothing else. No presentation too. Look at my pictures. Not exaggerating but nothing is good here. It\u2019s really the worst restaurant I visited in Singapore.\nI go to Vietnam often and this restaurant is a big disgrace to Viet food.\n\nLove the pho. They only have beef pho now. (The beef balls are qq and \ud83d\ude0b)Used to have chicken as well. The broth is light but flavorful. Love the smell of lemongrass. Make the food full of zest. The spring rolls and chicken balls (fried) are however only so so. The prawn cane is well seasoned as well. Recommended food joint.\n\nThe restaurant decorations is good, it got a clean environment with good vibes. The staff is very friendly too.\n\nThe food is quite good. I have tried the beef noodles, the beef is tender and it tastes good \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb I personally like the drip coffee too.\n\nBad service of the staff. We wanted to change table as another group of colleague joining, the front staff said we couldn\u2019t move because order been made (number is not on a table though can be moved and extra tables are available + no queue outside).\n\nNext after ordered online, and requested to pay at the counter, she handed the paper receipt and without nice gesture said \u201cthis order pay first\u201d.\n\nThis is unacceptable for the restaurant. Previously ate here but treated better, this caused an eerie feeling to come back to this outlet! Better train your staffs basic service measurements. No complaints of food.\n\nAs a concept it's certainly a great idea if they could match it up with great food and service. Food was just about ok.\n\nAmbience nothing much to rave about.\n\nThe Spicy Pho on the menu is very  lightly spicy.\n\nFood was delivered quick despite running at capacity.\n\nThe Pho broth though was just mediocre and not flavorful.\n\nWill have to look for a better place to enjoy Vietnamese cuisine.\n\nBeef slices were thin and tender, beef balls were springy.\n\nThe Vietnamese drip coffee was good but still lacked the oomph factor.\n\nThe staff at the entrance came across as plain unfriendly though I must add he did assist us.\n\nMenu is pretty decent and everyone should be able to find something here.\n\nWill i return ? Possibly not.\n",

Super clean environment, good ambiance and price worthy. 5/5 will come back for sure.\n\nIf you like Hummus, this restaurant/pub has the best Hummus in Singapore \ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddec .\nJust order the big portion! You won't regret it.\n\nFor a person who doesn't like lamb, I'd like to share that this restaurant is the only one where I would not hesitate to order their lamb shanks!\n\nThe atmosphere is good for catching up with friends over a beer and a good Turkish meal.  A change from the usual type of dining places we locals normally go to. The friends I brought there thoroughly enjoyed the evening.\n\nThe staff are friendly and humorous.  It can get crowded Friday nights.  So go early!\n\nThey are open 6 days a week, closed on Sunday.\n\nSuper juicy and delicious kebab and loved the hummus and babaganoush too. The lunch special is good value for the quality and portion. Service was quick and helpful. Will definitely be back to try more.\n\nKazbar's cold mezze platter is a delightful mix of flavors with hummus, baba ghanoush, tabbouleh, falafel, stuffed grape leaves, olives, and pickled veggies. The lychee mint crush mocktail is a must-try, and the lively atmosphere adds to the overall experience. \ud83c\udf1f\n\nUnique experience eating middle eastern food. The food was great and there was quite a bit of variety. Also the staff were very friendly! It is a bit on the pricey side but it is still worth the experience.\n",

                  "reviews": "\n\nI came to Singapore few weeks ago and was looking for Mediterranean restaurants. I stumbled upon this gorgeous place 5 minutes away from my hotel. I tried Kebabs on day one and man it was delicious. Atmosphere is great and all servers are friendly, specially three girls Urmi, Wendy and Fina are super nice, they make sure to get you a table quickly, take the order in timely manner and also make valuable suggestions on the menu. They always keep checking if everything is fine and customers are enjoying food. I loved the desert suggestion after eating my dinner. After first day I have been to this place 7-6 times and was always greeted with same service. I highly recommend this restaurant and will go again before I leave Singapore for USA.\n\nWe had the sultan's delight and mussels with garlic cream and cheese toast. The sultan's delight is really enjoyable. We could taste the smokiness from the eggplant puree and the lamb stew is really tender with tomato based sauce. It's tangy and smoky with some crunchiness from the pine nuts. Really enjoyable. But the mussel is pretty standard. It didn't taste really fresh but they're quite generous with the amount. The garlic cheese sauce is ok only.\nService was good and attentive.\n\nVisited for my birthday meal with my family as I was craving some Mediterranean food and this place had great reviews. However, the whole experience ended up kinda disappointing - as I had high expectations too on my first visit.\n\nService:\n- It\u2019s a restaurant but I felt like there was not much service per say.\n- It\u2019s a pretty high price point but they don\u2019t serve complimentary water (charged at $3 a pot of hot water, or $11 for Evian water only)\n- Ordering isn\u2019t as fuss free as they try to make it. Online ordering only from mobile app, with just one physical menu at the door. Asked for any extra copies for easier viewing but none available. You also have to pay upfront in mobile order.\n- Feels like I visited a restaurant but received fast food style service.\n\nAtmosphere:\n- Overall atmosphere is okay. Like a typical restaurant\n\nFood:\n- Average, I\u2019ve had much better at other places for a similar price point.\n- Pita bread, spreads and kebab grills were okay.\n- Saffron rice & Briyani rice were disappointing. They use basmati rice which gave a nice texture. However, flavour is so subtle that I could barely taste the difference between the 2.\n\nSummary:\nWould I return? Definitely not! For the price point, the food and service didn\u2019t live up to expectations for a highly rated restaurant. Will continue on my hunt for yummy Mediterranean food!\n\nVisited on a Thu night, it's superb crowded and busy in the restaurant. 3 dishes for 2 people, very filling. Overall the food is pretty decent and the price point is on the higher side.\n\nExcellent experience with vibrant dining experience. Food has great range of taste to excite the palate. Service is welcoming and top notch, they also gave a complimentary cake.\n",

Staff are friendly and helpful. Lovely place to be to watch people walk by while enjoying dinner. Parking is limited in the area though.\n\nFood is really great. Had a very nice dinner with family. The street sets the mood for good food.  Food felt authentic and very tasty. We had chicken Mandi, mixed grill and \"pizza\".\n\nPlace also has some good baklava.\n\nParking lot picture below.\n\nOne of the nicest place to eat on a cool night is at Arab Street, dining alfresco. We didn't even need them to turn on the fan.\n\nMy favourite dish here is the tabouleh itself. Sometimes you may find lemon seeds in it but that speaks to how authentic the salad is.\n\nWhile initially heading for a different restaurant, at which we were repelled by the pushy staff / promoters, we headed down Arab Street to look for an alternative. Most of the other restaurants also had promoters out which tried to lure us in. The guys at Tabbouleh just let us check the menu first and then we asked for a table. Service generally was ok, we waited a bit to actually order, food did not take a very long time though. The atmosphere actually was quite nice, views on the mosque, night time street impressions with a table outside. The food was delicious, I normally don't like Hummus a lot, but here I liked it. It was well presented as well. In the end I got the feeling that despite the 10% service charge it was expected that we give additional tip, which was a bit strange hence the 3/5 for the service. We did like the tea at the very end which rounded up an otherwise nice dinner experience. Thank you very much.\n\nWe choose the restaurant because of its good reviews and as the staff was not at all intrusive as most of the other places in the area.\nWe shared a mixed appetizers plate, which was alright. Overall good, but also no particular highlights.\nThe iced lemon tea was perfect after an exhausting day.\nA plus was the free mint tea at the end, which we really appreciated.\nThe service could be more attentive, while the food was out quite fast. All in all a rather average experience.\n",

Hummus with bread and apple teas is a myst try dish over here. The price is on the higher side and I would say going in a group pf 5-6 people will be good as we get to try lot of new dishes.\n\nSanobar Lebanese Restaurant in Singapore is a hidden culinary gem that whisks diners away to the flavors of Lebanon.

The standout dish for me was the lamb; it had absolutely no odor and tasted fantastic. The grilled items were a highlight as well, bursting with delicious flavors. The restaurant\u2019s ambiance was beautifully decorated, and the staff was both charming and incredibly helpful, taking the time to explain the dishes to us. While it\u2019s not the cheapest option, the prices are fair for the quality you receive.\n\nOne thing to note, though, is that the platter we ordered was described as \u201cfor two,\u201d but for Asians, it\u2019s considered a generous portion. So, if there are four of you and you\u2019ve already ordered other dishes, I recommend going for the platter for two only; it\u2019s quite substantial. Would recommend to anyone looking for a great dining experience!\n\nFirst time having Turkish food and was really\npleasantly surprised. Their dips and bread was really exceptional. The bread was steaming when it came out it was both crispy and fluffy at the same time. The platter for 2 was also great all the grilled meats was tender and flavourful. Portion was also huge.\n\nEverything from the service to food were impeccable. Staff were polite and always made sure we were well taken care of. I ordered before my friend came and they asked when the food should be prepared and how it should be served. Food was perfectly done too. It is the little things that make a difference and win them a return customer.\n\nVery impressive food & service displayed by the dedicated front staffs and chefs. It\u2019s nice walking in the street after a wine & dine session in the area. The staffs were very attentive, price is reasonable.\n\nWent here for a birthday celebration and the attention to detail from their service staff is amazing, didn\u2019t mention to the staff that it was for a birthday celebration, only had a note in the reservation. But they went above and beyond, having candles in the dessert and even giving us props to take pictures with and proceeded to then print out the photo of us to keep!\n\nThe food also matches the service, authentic Turkish cuisine done perfectly, the Hummus was so good we had to order a second portion! I\u2019m not usually a fan of chicken but the chicken that came with the platter blew my mind, so juicy and tender. Then comes dessert, my first time having Kunefe and the only thing I have to say is that I wish I didn\u2019t share it, wanted it all to myself \ud83e\udd23\n\nDefinitely coming back here again!\n",

Thanks to receptionist Mahiti for always giving a great smile to all guest. It definitely makes a difference.\n\nWe celebrated my brother's birthday here and had a great time. The restaurant is beautifully decorated with classic Turkish designs and really put us in the mood for their cuisine.\n\nWe ordered the mixed grilled platter to share and they portioned it for to the seven people in our party. The salads were fresh and the dessert was delicious. I highly recommend their kunfa as it's authentic, made fresh and absolutely scrumptious.\n\nMy only drawback was the warmth. There could have been better distribution of air-conditioning, other than that we had a swell time. I know there are many other restaurants in the area offering a similar experience but Byblos stands apart with class and authenticity.\n\nLOVE the food!!! Hot, freshly baked lavash bread, delectable and well seasoned kebabs, even the salads appealed to my picky 11 year old. Ambience was lovely, only downside was the music is a wee bit loud (I was sitting indoors), but the staff brought down the volume. Our plates were all cleaned out, clearly we enjoyed dinner at Byblos. Highly recommended!\n\nThere are many Turkish food restaurants along Arab Street but this is the best one I've had here. In fact, I daresay it's the best Turkish food I've ever had. The Chef and waiters were all very welcoming!\n",

Starting from the hummus, absolutely generous and delicious portions. Perfect appetizer.\n\nThe butter rice with kebab was crazy delicious, we literally scraped the plate clean from the rice and the greek yogurt like substance in the centre.\n\nPizza was crispy and fragrant at the same time, the tomato sauce parts was absolutely amazing.\n\nStrawberry drink was okay!!! Not super special but nice!\n\nIn the middle of Arab street you find this restaurant. We were welcomed\u00a0by a real Turkish guy. Very friendly and he could advise us what was the best to order. We sat outside, along\u00a0the street. Within 15 min the table was full with all kinds of grilled meat. Real Turkish flavors and a nice apple tea were enough to make my day complete. Eating here, and watching the people pass by is a big joy.\n\nParking in this area is very hard, as you can understand.\n\nHad a great dinner here today. My friend saw this online with high rating stars so we just stopped by after work.  And yes, the food is delicious, the atmosphere is awesome, love the music too.\nSo if your family or friends are outgoing and friendly, this is the right place for you to gather together and laugh together and dance together !\n\nCuisine is new to me as a traveller. Trying the dish with my arab friends and the chef being a wonderful host in telling us about the different food added to the stellar experience of dining here. Service was awesome. Food was a good blend of flavors.\n\nJust returning home from an amazing service and hospitality from Cappadocia.\nChef Ahmed Hagras went out of his way to arrange a very sweet surprise for my husband's birthday at my request.\nThe whole staff sang happy birthday for him with a special kunafe.\n\nThe food itself is finger licking good, no doubt. But the experience was way better.\n\nThank you everyone at Cappadocia for helping make this day special for him.\n",

Claiming to offer authentic Persian cuisine, the reality is a disappointing mix of flavors that lean more towards Indian than Persian. The kebabs, dry and tasteless, are a stark contrast to the rich flavors expected from Persian cooking. Equally disheartening is the rice \u2013 cold, undercooked, and lacking the basic essence of Persian culinary art. This establishment, once perhaps a bastion of authentic cuisine, now serves as a reminder of how far it has strayed from its original glory.\n\nFlavourful middle-eastern cuisine, the dips were delicious.\nNice al fresco dinning areas.\nThank you, Ronny for the great host that makes our dinner wonderful. We appreciate your service.\n\nCame back to this lovely Persian restaurant after 3-4 years to celebrate the Wife\u2019s birthday. Last time here was for dinner, with the belly dancer floating around!\n\nThis time we were seated indoors due to the afternoon heat! Last few times were seated outside by the river which is lovely in the evening.\n\nIt was quite busy on a Sunday afternoon ! The food was as good as we remembered it to be.\n\nLook forward to coming back here\u2026 sooner this time :-)\n\nflavourful and appetising Persian food! had an enjoyable alfresco dinner by the river with a very accommodating food attendant. the dessert was delicious but the faludeh shirazi was a tad too sweet for us. maybe next time will just stick with the saffron ice cream on top of the faludeh, sooo good. will go back to try more food on the menu!\n\nWe enjoy a spread of 3-Course Middle-eastern set lunch for $48++ per person. \ud83c\udf77And we add on 2 hours of Toi Toi Sara\u2019s Rose free flow for $40++ per person. Here what we ordered:\n\u2764\ufe0f Kash-E-Bademjan\n\u2764\ufe0f Borani Esfanaj\n\u2764\ufe0f Fish Kebab\n-Well marinated with special saffron sauce, it is very fresh and flavourful\n\u2764\ufe0f Chicken Masti\n-Marinated with yogurt and herbs, the chicken is tender and slightly charred given it\u2019s fragrance\n\u2764\ufe0f Dessert\n-We love the ice-cream with spice and the Pistachios\nThe wine is good, with tinge of sweetness and hinge of dryness.\nWe really enjoy our meal in a restaurant with such a serene environment right beside Singapore River.\n",

Mixed grills of chicken and lamb\n\nVery decent food, but pricing wise not so.\n\nI understand that being in boat quay would command some premium pricing. However,\nI felt that the pricing is about ~30% higher than my comfort zone.\n\nI had the Lamb mandi and testi kebab chicken. They were cooked tender, the chilli sauce on the lamb was off, it has that bitterness that is probably from lime skin mixed with the chilli.\n\nKunafa is decent as you get to mix on your own whether you prefer more sugar or cream.\n\nVery nice view dining by the river. Food can be better though.\n\nDelicious! We have been there for lunch and we ordered lamb mandi, chicken kofta wrap and hummus. Lamb is delicious and we highly recommend it. The waiter was kind and helped us with recommendations. The location is cool, at night it gets more crowded and it is a good spot to get some beers\n\nNo trip to Singapore is complete without a visit to Boat Quay, so keeping up with the tradition we decided on a late night dinner. After having our meal at another place when we were heading home - while walking past this new restaurant called Sultan Palace we were stopped by this extremely courteous Indian gentleman to come and check it out. When we said we had already eaten he offered us to try out the desserts. The warmth of Indian hospitality in his voice made us stop.\n\nHe suggested we should try out the #Kunafa, as we sat down. While we soaked in a bit longer in the vibe of Boat Quay food street - and waited. When the dish was served it was #sinful and #delicious. Check out the video in the post below.\n\nAs we devoured the large portion which was good enough for the four of us - and chatted with - the co-owner of the place.\n\nThe evening closed with some amazing Turkish (Turkiya) tea served in these gorgeous looking cups and tea pot.\n\nDefiantly a must visit place again.\n",

What truly impressed me was the meticulous way he packed the condiments \u2013 neatness and attention to detail, it's the little things that count!\n\nI highly recommend giving their kebabs a try. Personally, I'm a big fan of the Shawarma Mandi Rice, as you can see in the photo here. It's not just tasty; it's downright mouthwatering! \ud83d\udcf8\ud83c\udf74\n\nBest kebab ever - they use a creamy sauce.\nthat sets it apart from most kebabs in Singapore. lamb shank texture technically great.\n\nThat said, it\u2019s not so much Mediterranean as it is a South Asian interpretation of Turkish food. In that sense it lacked the South Asian spice overload, but also needed more of the exuberant flavour of the Turkish seaside (olives, olive oil, etc)\n\nService was amazing - it\u2019s not an Indian restaurant but I found myself accidentally ordering all sorts of off menu things like lime juice no sugar and mango lassi, and they delivered.\n\nOrdered the mutton kabsa, fattoush, khubz and a giant container of toum for dine in, as well as chicken shawarma for takeaway.\n\nI appreciate that the food closely resembles the kabsa and shawarma versions you find in Saudi Arabia or Lebanon.\n\nThe shawarma had no weird chili sauce inside it, and had pickles and french fries. The mutton was tender and flavorful and the kabsa rice was nicely aldente.\n\nIf you're not looking to try more authentic middle eastern food outside of Turkish cuisine, this is the place to go.\n\nFood tasted amazing and friendly service staff. The meats were seasoned and spiced flavourfully and the accompanying sides complemented it greatly. There was a slightly order confusion but the management solved it professionally.\n\nGood food when im dine,service staff very friendly they recommended me few nice dishes for me takeaway,price affordable compared in arab Street\n",

Overall meat was dry.. so different from what we had a month ago. And the aircond is not working and ventilation was horrendous! Only one good comment - the bread served for dip were warm and fluffy\n\nThe tabbouleh was horrible. Very sour. The other dishes were average to good.

There were 2 cockroaches that ran across my feet and then headed to the kitchen, and when I notified the waiter, they were just as squeamish as we were. Food was ok, but probably wouldn\u2019t go back.\n\nLocated at the junction of Baghdad Street and Bussorah Street, good Lebanese food of large size portions, the tables at the pavement is nice in the evening.  The staff were friendly and welcoming we overall it was good experience\n\nGreat food and atmosphere. Owner is super lovely legit food lover. Go here!\n\nAmazing food, ate there twice\n\nSultan Mosque Nakamise Street has a lot of restaurants with a nice atmosphere, so I was a little confused, but a local friend brought me to this restaurant. The appetizer platter is full of Mediterranean cuisine (Lebanese?). For mains, we each ordered lamb chops and skewered beef (I don't know the name). I was so absorbed in chatting that I couldn't eat all the appetizers, but they all tasted authentic. The main meat dishes are simply prepared but delicious. I appreciated the thoughtfulness of pointing two large fans at us. None of the restaurants in Nakamise serve alcohol (for religious reasons), so if you need one, you should either drink before coming to this area, or go to a pub a little further out of this area as there are many pubs. Let's go for a drink.\n",

                  "reviews": "\n\nStumbled across this place today and decided to eat here with my mum. Very no frills and simple place.\n\nShe had a falafel moussaka, and I had the mexican beef bowl. The moussaka was delicious but I feel like 5 pieces of nacho chips wasn\u2019t enough and mind you this cost $13\u2026..\n\nThe beef bowl was a little dry, could do with some kind of sauce but it was good and we finished both dishes. The churros came freshly fried and was good too, but would have preferred actual choc sauce vs the hershey choc syrup.\n\nOnly gripes; the overly sugary lemongrass drink that was served premade with no ice. Had to ask for ice twice but given few pieces\u2026..  also very weird that we dined in but were served with plastic cutlery when we clearly saw metal cutlery, it was a little strange. It was practically only 2 tables and the lady served my food to the other table\u2026. Could tell she wanted to take it back to serve me but they already started eating it.\n\nI think its a quaint little place but some things need to be improved. At $30 for 2 expected just a little more.\n\nExcellent service. The beef Mexican rice bowl was not bad. With the homemade drink, I spent less than $10. I was there alone at 5 ish and I had the entire place to myself. I don't remember music playing but it sure would be nice to listen to some tunes.\n\nSmall quaint shop located near Tai Seng Mrt, they had a $10 set meal that had a wrap, small hash brown and a lemongrass tea. There was a small side of nacho chips with salsa.\n\nNothing amazing but I guess it was better than nothing coz there wasn\u2019t anything there open before 11am\n\nDropped-off my 10-months old laptop at LENOVO Service Centre at 3 Irving Rd, #01-17 Tai Seng Centre. BITC, Singapore 369522 on Tuesday 18 April 2023,\n\nThus decide to settle my late lunch within the area too.\n\nOne will be spoiled with choices as there are so many small eateries and cafes. I was drawn to  Olive Mediterranean & Middle East which was located across the street at 11 Irving Place #01-14/15, Tai Seng Point, Singapore 369551.\n\nOrdered for myself a Mexican Rice (Celantro & Spinach With Beef) Bowl at S$7.50.\n\nIf you are a small eater, the serving portion is just right. However, definitely a \"No. No.\" for someone who has a heavy duty digestive system, I would recommend that you order some nachos or Quesadillas too.\n\nIn my opinion, the rice is mildy aromatic (I was expecting a more pungent aroma of Celantro and spinach).\n\nI will rate the minced beef topping as \"healthy choice\".  It is relatively quite nice BUT will not leave one any special impression.  It will definitely taste alot better if there is a little more fat (this will enhance the juiciness) and more spices are added.\n\nHowever, if you working in this area, it is a great place to meet up with your colleagues and friends after work.  You can sufficient outdoor sittings surrounded with plants.\n\nStumbled on this place as i happened to be browsing around. Been awhile since i had my tacos and wraps, decided to try this as i noticed they had very high reviews.\n\nHad the beef Quesadilla - loved it as it was simply nice\nChicken Saffron Stew - Soooo tender and nice but soup wasnt as thick as i wanted but thats purely due to my own taste\nHashbrowns - Thumbsup as we all loved it. Hearsay its even better than M's hashbrown but i leave it for u to judge.\n\nService wise was top, very homely feel given by the lady boss and staff. She took her time to guide me through the menu and shared with me what we should order.\nI must say the food takes a pretty long time to come for a quiet Monday Afternoon but i guess Good Food - Time to prepare so no complaints from me on this.\n\nOverall i recommend this place based on the food served + prices. Very nice and they deserves better businesses. should be pretty quiet when its after office hours.\n\nWill be back again :)\n",

                  "reviews": "\n\nVisited here on a weekday for lunch with office colleagues. We had reservation and took the seats arranged for our big group. There was option of set menu as well as ala carte. We went ahead with the recommendations of the staff and had the following: fried cauliflower served with mint chutney, hummus with pita bread, assorted kebabs which included lamb, chicken, pork and falafel. We had some beverages too. The menu is elaborate with Mediterranean cuisine and taste is authentic though some may not like it.\nIt was crowded during our time of visit yet the service was good. Staff are friendly and knows well of the dishes.\n\nWent for a weekday lunch and with the $29 set lunch it was filling and totally worth it. Love the artichoke and herb hummus served with pita bread. It was better than the cashew  hummus. Chopped kale was good. Pretty interesting with fried capers and lady finger but smoke aubergine seems to be less flavourful. I would like it with more yogurt. No complaints about the seabass, chicken, pork ribs and lamb leg kebabs. Chicken was soft, pork ribs had tons of asian flavours and lamb leg was juicy. Overall would recommend.\n\nCame here with some friends for brunch and decided to go ALA carte instead of the brunch package. To be honest, 55SGD for the brunch package was quite reasonable. But everyone on the table had to take it. Which was quite disappointing.\n\nHowever - not an issue since we managed to order what we wanted anyway. I like the cauliflower and the egg plant dish. It was quite tasty. I had the crab tacos which were alright. Generally not bad for a brunch spot. I would go for the set the next time I'm back.\n\nFood: very delicious, good options for vegetarians. We went for the brunch & it came with a hummus dip and side which we could mix and match. We tried the artichoke and herb hummus and cashew hummus and loved both. The kale with mihalic cheese was outstanding and I\u2019ve never enjoyed kale more. The cauliflower with green tahini had this lovely tangy taste and was roasted to perfection. For the main course, we tried the full breakfast plate but it was slightly underwhelming as none of the items were outstanding. Didn\u2019t like the falafel at all. The halloumi was delicious but only a small piece. The French toast was fresh and scrumptious.\n\nService: excellent service with attentive and accommodating staff who moved us to another table as our adjoining table was very noisy and loud.\n\nAmbience: My friend and I didn\u2019t really enjoy the ambience as we weren\u2019t seated at the best place with a huge noisy group next to us and a service trolley beside us. I feel it would be much nicer if we sat up front in the main area where the bar is.\n\nVisited in Oct 2023\n\nReally great cocktails. But found the food to be average other than a couple of dishes which stood out. Among the mezze dishes, I thought that the Roasted Cashew Hummus and the Duck Pastilla were good. Didn\u2019t like the octopus mezze as all of us felt it was burnt/over-grilled. For mains, we tried the pork ribeye which was ~3.5/5. Ordered 1 dessert item (kunefe) which was pretty good.\n\nAll the cocktails we tried were quite decent with my favs being Ottoman\u2019s Island, Aergul Paloma and the Baklava Milk Punch.\n\nService was really good.\n",

The food worth 2 stars. The meat was pretty hard, the starter was too sour. The dessert was really not able to match our taste. The house wines was tasteless, but the red wine taste better when it pair with the meat. I will strongly recommend you only order the red if you want to have their one for one house wine promo.\nOur bill was $128, you can get a much more better grilled meat platter and better food at other restaurants. :)\n\nLe Rida has a rustic ambience somewhat akin to an old time eating house in a small town. Quaint and homely\nFreshly baked pita bread with lemon chick pea hummus was delicious and filling\nMains of Lebanese lamb kafta kebab had the right balance of flavour and crunchiness.\nWash it all down with 1 for 1 Heineken draft at $17.90\n\nManager Sanjiv was both friendly and helpful in his recommendations and unlike in some establishments, he did not push you to over order.\nDefinitely worth a return visit!\n\nA quaint no frills dining place with excellent food and good service. The staff are simple people but are very hospitable, often checking in on the food quality and our experience. If you are looking for a good meal away from hustle and bustle, this is the place to go. Oh.. U can definitely have a conversation with your company and hear them loud and clear\n\nDidn't think the food was thaaaat amazing. Nor was the service. But at least they let us drink outside drinks.\nHOWEVER, i requested for no garnishing on my hummus. When the guy brought it over, there WAS parsley on it. And all he said was \"just pluck it out\". --.--\nSo if i was allergic to that, i should just pluck it out.... nice. The hummus wasn't good either. I've tasted better. Like a friend who went with me commented... it isn't creamy enough. Also, comments about the baklava was that it was too hard... and wasn't good.\n\nAbsolutely loved the food, I am heavily into Mediterranean food. I have tried most of the places around Bugis as well. The food here was so fresh, with perfect taste and presentation. It was completely worth it travelling from East.\nThe service was quick, the portion size was generous . We ordered mezze plateer and tabalu salad. They were scrumptious loved the customised heart shaped Pita bread. Hummus, was so creamy and so were all other dips.\n\nWould strongly recommend.. It has become one of my favourite place..\n",

Overall the staff was the best part of this restaurant.\n\nFirst time dining at the restaurant and my family enjoyed the food thoroughly. Every dish we ordered was so yummy. The staff, Anwar, was friendly, attentive and provided good service.\n\nThe waiter say if feel the food not nice or you like it, don\u2019t have to pay. It\u2019s a very heavy sentence to put on customer. Trust me the food was indeed tasty and delicious. We ordered meat platter for 2.. it\u2019s more than enough for 2 person. And their fresh orange juice, it\u2019s purely orange. No water added in.l like other places. It\u2019s a killer pricey but it\u2019s worth your every penny. \ud83d\ude0a\n\nWe love going to Arab street and trying out the different restaurants here. First time at Hummus & Tandoor for a family lunch!\n\nThe food was delicious\u2026 all the dishes we tried were very good. The Aareyes Kofta was very interesting!\n\nThe place was quite empty on a Saturday afternoon. We had made a booking through eatigo with a 30% discount.

The meat are cooked to perfection and the servers were so attentive to details and prompt to react. If you are a meat lover, dont miss the experience here!\n\nSome of the items that I really like, (no pictures cause busy eating \ud83d\ude05)\n- Garlic Beef\n- Picanha\n- Duck Breast\n- Chicken and Chicken Heart\n- Sirloin\n- Beef Ribs\n\nAnd and and! The cheese bread and fried banana were awesome toooooo!\n\nDo try them out!\n\nWe brought a toddler with us and it was child friendly. Overall the food were great and fresh. The marination taste really good and was grilled to perfection; the beef was medium rare, good job to the chef! I'm not a fish person but it got me eating second piece, it was delicious and fresh. Our daughter just loves the chips and tomato. Service was attentive and well explained. Good job to Chris and team! Looking forward to visit again!\n\nIt was my anniversary celebration. We had\nlunch, and it was a carnivore's dream come true. The buffet-style service, with servers continuously offering a variety of meats until you signal them to stop, was a delightful experience.\n\nThe meat selection was impressive, and I must say the Picanha, Prime Part of Top beef stole my heart.\nDespite that Picanha that stole my heart, there were some others that I think otherwise. Maybe this is personal preference.\n\nOverall, I found their concept of unlimited, high-quality meat servings are truly enjoyable.\n\nNotes: the bottle provided on the table are chargeable. One is sparkling water, the other is mineral water.\n\nNo complaints whatsoever. It's worth the steap price, from the sides (pictured) to the array of various meats, all cooked to perfection, to the attentive and courteous wait staff.\n\nMy only reccomendarion is to come hungry.\n\nThe only positive thing I can say about this place is the decent interior. The food is otherwise pretty terrible. Their picanha is tough, dry and sinewy while their supposed wagyu sirloin is almost certainly not wagyu given that it lacks the signature tenderness you expect from high quality beef and also carried a weird, almost gamey taste. Service was also lacklustre, with the waitress having an attitude that suggested she would rather be anywhere else than at the restaurant.\n",

Every bite was tender and we enjoyed the service very much. At one point, we even requested the chef for a particular cut, which he very graciously prepared just for our table. The salad bar is very fresh and well prepared. We recommend the ham, pineapples and beef brisket. If you dare to try, get the chicken heart too!\n\nCarnivore started 2 decades ago at Vivo City, relocated to CHIJMES, and just relocated to Robertson Quay.\n\nThe meat or skewers were not what we accustomed to. All the variants of beef on skewers had a very strong gaming beefy taste and either dry or hard. Definitely not tender just hard. The short beef ribs not so hard or tough but strong beefy taste. The chicken heart was okay at 7/10. The home made sausage was dried out, was not tasty at all, a dismal 2/10. The bacon wrapped chicken at 5/10. The chicken thigh better at best a 7/10.\n\nThe best from carver is the skewered barbecued pineapple at 9/10 and butterfish at 8/10.\n\nStrangely the buffet sides were better overall compared to the skewered meats. Minestrone soup 7/10, black beans with sliced sausages 7/10, potato salad 8/10, asparagus salad 7/10, beef stew 6.5/10.\n\nThe assorted chocolate desert was 8/10. The fruit was decent at 7.5/10.\n\nDunno what to say. We are so used to the higher meat qualities when they were at Vivos City. Just wish they were as good as before. They just started operating less than a month since relocating from CHIJMES so maybe they just getting into the groove.\n\nService was good, friendly & attentive. Hardly anyone there during Monday lunch as it was a public holiday, in lieu of Deepavali.\n\nThis is a meat lovers paradise! Every meat they serve is awesome! My faves are the rump cap, chicken thigh and the butterfish! But on the whole food is awesome, and service is great! I especially loved the service from an elderly gentleman. He was attentive to my needs and made sure I got what I wanted. He deserves 100 stars and he makes my day!\n\nMeats were a bit dried but taste still not that bad, salad bar and dessert okay, overall okay\n\nFelt like meat variety for rotation was alot lesser than what was shown on their website. Pineapples only came twice, of which once did not even made it to our table.\n",

Definitely a must-go place for meat lovers. The salad and food bar had a great variety to choose from and the meat get served direct to the table every few minutes (^^\"). And remember to ask for the pineapple!!!\n\nAll the meat is quite salty, makes you keep drinking water and fill up your stomach fast. Most of the beef like tenderloin and lamb were overcooked and were lacking in flavour.\n\nBooked our reservation for 7pm but had no issues despite us coming earlier at 6.30. Our waiter, even though he was a trainee (some chinese/asian person) was super on the ball when it came to refilling our water and changing our plates.\n\nWhen I accidentally dropped some meat on my white shirt, he immediately dropped whatever he was doing and got me a wet and dry tissue for me to clean off the stain. Highly impressed with the service and food. Had a lovely evening together with my wife.\n\nFood is great. Service is excellent. The salad bar was also really good. It's a meat lovers paradise\n",

I especially love their nut butters but wished that they could give slightly more as it\u2019s always not enough to go around with the acai. \ud83d\ude05\n\nAlways had the Acai Flower bowl at other outlets, decided to try Coconut Yoghurt Acai bowl instead. Fresh fruits used, mixed with cruchy toasted coconut flakes, granola, and goji berries. The coconut yoghurt taste not very prominent and serving kind of little, hope to get a bigger scoped.\n\nA promotion is ongoing in Woodleigh mall with 2 bowls for $16. Ordered a Original Flower Bowl and a Nuts for A\u00e7a\u00ed bowl with 2 butters namely peanut and cookie. The staff were very helpful to help me change my order. Overall experience was good \ud83d\udc4d\n\nThe staff were so unfriendly with an unpleasant face that make you feel guilty for ordering, my appetite for eating a\u00e7a\u00ed was gone instantly. I said hi with a smile no reply, thank you no reply, looking upset and kind of scary. The a\u00e7a\u00ed is good though but never coming back here again for the service.\n\nCame to support them for their new opening at the Woodleigh Mall! Got the promotion which was 1 for 1 acai bowls and the staff were super nice and acai was super yummy!\n",

It taste really good with the chicken nicely grille.\n\nI have ordered the sweet crepe of banana and Nutella. love it when it is gluten free. it is hard for the crepe but after the first bite it kinda of melt in your mouth. it is not too sweet. the spinach drink is very refreshing and is well blended. the portion of the. crepe is alright for me as it is quite filling. but maybe little for people with bigger appetite. packaging is well protected delivered by grab. looking forward to try their other crepe.\n\nBefore visiting, I read the reviews and was wondering how good can acai be. After trying it I must say it's really very appetizing with the chocolate sauce and peanut butter. One thing that can be improved would be the packaging for the acai, the bottom of it was already wet within 10mins.\n\nThe grilled tapioca wrap was also good with generous amount of fillings. Although the skin looked crispy it was quite chewy but in a good way.\n\nLove their acai bowl! Portion was generous and they purely used acai - no fillers like chia seeds taking up half the bowl unlike at certain other places. My favourite is their keto goddess bowl - it has everything that I like: blueberries, strawberries, cacao nibs and coconut flakes! The owner is really friendly too. And price was very good at $12.90 for a large bowl which was enough for two of us to share.\n\nFavourite acai place by far.\n\nBeiju Express have the best a\u00e7ai bowl in town and I\u2018ve tried many. Fresh, delicious range of ingrediants, served at the perfect temperature and amazingly arranged.\nAnd must try the Brazilian Tapioca Crepes. I had the Watcha Chicken.

Unlike other acai, this is less sweet and very generous in portions for a $7.90 bowl. There are a few tables and chairs for dine in but I did a takeaway this time. A good place to hide from the sun and refresh yourself after walking the streets of Little India :)\n\nCozy little cafe in the mall which offers great bowls. The service has been quick and very friendly, and the a\u00e7a\u00ed bowl itself had a great flavor. Indeed, the portion (20oz) has been quite a bit of a\u00e7a\u00ed which is a great value for the money ($14.90). Really great place with a lot of fruity options. \ud83c\udf4c\ud83e\uded0\ud83c\udf53\n\nI had their Vita Acai bowl, and it was delicious. Very generous toppings! I wanted more protein and they had \u201cpea protein\u201d and \u201cwhey protein\u201d that I could add to my bowl.  Seats are limited, but thankfully I was the only one. I\u2019m glad I dropped by, it was everything I wanted in an Acai bowl.  Loved the calorie count they gauge for their bowls too. The salad looked pretty amazing on their menu, hope I can try that next time too!\n",

The place is very small with just a handful of tables. Could get a little noisy with full crowd. Make reservation before going to avoid disappointment. Home made fries tasted fresh. Even though its free flow but the initial serving was so generous that we did not ask for refills. We decided to try the 4 pax platter for 3 of us. A good selection with the platter. The ribeye was too charcoal-y for our liking. We actually prefer the beef skewers. Duck breast and sausages were delicious. Pork chop was so-so. It's a shame the food became cold too fast otherwise we would enjoyed it more. Staff service was excellent and attentive.\n\nfood was amazing, really enjoyed their camembert roti (bread was amazing btw, fresh crispy and fluffy in the middle) and the mains were cooked just right. not forgetting the free flow fries, slightly greasy but still great. definitely will come back again, very pleased!\n\nVery well cooked juicy steak with free flow fries and salad.\n\nWas too hungry to take more photos but really loved how the steak was done.\n\nThe set meals here makes it a more value for money option. We picked the burrata cheese with chocolate brownie which is amazing.\n\nAwesome place for some steaks and fries. Reasonable pricing for restaurant dining. Staffs are courteous.\nCalamari is the frozen type from supplier so that didn\u2019t sit well with me.\nThe rest of the food was acceptable.\n",

The acai is pretty reasonably priced, i got the regular size at $9.60 quite a big portion! The classic acai comes together w fruits nuts and granola. Drizzle was generous as well. Love it!\n\nA small shop serving healthy superfoods that is acai bowls, which has also become my regular \"rewards\" for sticking to my healthy diet.\n\nI chose their regular bowl with honey drizzle. The ingredients tasted fresh, the layering was compact and filling. Alternating between the crunchy and the sweet, you'll savor each healthy bite without the associated guilt.\n\nWill add to my healthy bites list.\n\nAcai with honey drizzle is da bomb. Really nice cocktail of yummy fruits and acai. The fruits are also fresh and portion is generous. For less than $10 is definitely worth every penny.\n\nDespite staying nearby, this is my first visit and it\u2019s definitely not going to be my last! Lady boss was very friendly and gave me some recommendations. I selected the regular Classic A\u00e7a\u00ed Bowl since it contains everything! Lady boss took time to cut up the fruits on the spot and presented the bowl (cup) beautifully.  She was very generous with the ingredients and I especially liked the almond butter drizzle (included in price). The a\u00e7a\u00ed tasted wonderful with all the fresh fruit, nuts, and granola. Enjoyed every bit of my cup! Nana\u2019s a real gem in the area. Please come support so I can continue having it forever!\n\nThe best a\u00e7ai! Generous with a\u00e7ai serving and toppings, wide variety of toppings available and tastes great. They use more premium toppings like macadamia nuts and goji berries. Love it so much\n",

Especially love the tenderloin, it\u2019s so tender and yummy. Also love the bread we had, it\u2019s well worth the price of $16.\n\nFantastic steak & food & service! You\u2019d probably also be able to get a decent steak here for \n\nIt was our first time visiting Bochinche. The restaurant has a lovely ambiance and the staff are polite and helpful. The manager kindly explained to us the differences between each cut of meat.\n\nFor starters, we had the SD bread basket and ox tongue carpaccio. The bread slices were delish with butter. The ox tongue carpaccio was an interesting blend of flavours that worked well together.\n\nFor the main, we ordered the Heavenly Meat Board with 4 different kinds of steaks. They were perfectly cooked medium rare, served with a bit of smoked salt, garlic confit and padron peppers, which elevated the flavour immensely. Sides were chips, broccolini and wild mushrooms. Kiddo had the cheeseburger and finished the entire thing off!\n\nTo finish off, we shared the nectarine tart and espresso creme brulee while kiddo had a scoop of vanilla ice-cream. The creme brulee was delicious. Creamy with the wonderful fragrance of espresso. We enjoyed that immensely. Were not too crazy about the tart though. The nectarine slices were not ripe and still hard after cooking. The sharp tang wasn't to our liking.\n\nAll in all a wonderful dining experience. We'll be back for more!\n\nGreat place with great food.\n\nThe staff were amazing as I celebrated my wife\u2019s birthday. The steak was beautifully done and all the food recommendations were good.\n\nKudos to the people for making this place awesome.\n\nEdit -\n\nForgot to mention that we also ordered the hand cut beef empanadas. Sad to say my nenek can make better epok epok.\n\nOrdered the \u201cRobbins Island\u201d Wagyu Bone In Striploin (MS7) along with the creamy Mac-cheese pangrattato, broccolini pomegranate (without bacon bits) and Chips Provencal.\n\nThe wagyu striploin was cooked well but lacked the juiciness that wagyu steaks typically have. The steak was also under seasoned but was accompanied by smoked Maldon sea salt and roasted peppers.\n\nChips was fried well and had a nice crisp bite to it and was salted just right.\n\nBroccolini was grilled perfectly and had a nice charred smoky taste to it but was overly salted. Portion was a tad too stingy in my opinion for the price. Served on a medium sized plate it looked like a few broccolini might\u2019ve escaped during plating.\n\nSurprisingly the creamy M&C was the best of the lot! Very creamy with gooey cheese and a nice layer of bread crumbs on top to give it a welcoming different mouth feel and texture.\n\nOver all I think Bochinche is worth a visit due to its lovely homey interior but do be prepared to spend a few dollars here. 3.6/5.\n",

Is alot!!!!\n\nWe got the originals. Is super worth it. For a person who does not like nuts and all the healthy ingredient like the wolf berries.\n\nIs surprising good ! I'll rate it 10/10(:\n\nI have been coming here for over 3 years now and probs one of their biggest customers!! I used to have one acai every day!! Their acai is made fresh and a wide range of items to choose from, the staff are always kind and friendly and the acai is always yummy although I prefer their old gronola compared to their new cashew cacao one!! Can't wait to come back for my next acai treat!\n\nThey're located on the lowest floor of Ngee Ann City basement, closer towards Wisma walkway, away from the main food hall. It's not exactly the easiest to find their shop front, but if you are aware of where Mos Burger is, then you should be able to find them.\n\nOverall a good bowl of acai bowl, with a lot of tender loving care placed on each bowl being served. I definitely did see the love as the servers were trying to ensure the look and feel of the fruits were really well positioned, cutting away excess and making sure every bowl was as close to the standard as possible.\n\nUsually love coming here, great acai and quick service. But the staff on duty on Sunday afternoon is terrible, so unfriendly almost hostile. Really ruins the normal great vibes.\n\nThis is my first time trying project Acai and I must say it's really better than other brands that I have tried. More than 10 fresh ingredients on top of my acai and I really appreciate that. As there has no table provided, you can prepare a tissue or handkerchief to hold because the bowl is very cold.\n",

Would recommend checking this place out if you are in the area!\n\nThe acai is not too sweet and of great consistency too, not too hard and not too watery. They have great variety of toppings which you can choose as much as you want but the more toppings you have, the lesser the acai is. So far my fav acai in town! The large serving is substantial enough for a meal. The staff are attentive.\nWe used burrple 1for1 and it was really worth it!\n\nIt was the second time I tried their acai, and it was worth to have it again! They have lots of toppings available, and from the medium size, u can put any toppings u want. Every topping and acai itself tasted very fresh. Perfect for a snack when walking around Theaters on the bay.\n\nDelicious Acai served here. The staff are always friendly, and the portion is big! From medium cup onwards, you can have unlimited toppings. Love the customizing options available that we can choose our own toppings and not have only  premade bowls.\n\nBeautiful location. Ate it by the river. What a view and especially beautiful with the sunset. \ud83d\udc96 Highly recommend. The prices are worth it! ( Medium cup onwards maybe\ud83d\ude05)\n",

The food was sensational, service flawless and they even helped us get back to the hotel using their own Uber app when we couldn\u2019t get a taxi. This is a must visit in Singapore. I would recommend booking ahead. Thank you!\n\nIt was a lovely place to hang out. Just perhaps a little too warm with the outdoor seatings.\n\nFood was great, the lamb was good. Love the sago cheese thingy. I didn\u2019t get to see the menu cos the ordering was done by my friends.\n\nService was remarkably nice. They are all pretty friendly and very service oriented.\n\nThe kombucha was a great addition to our lunch.\n\n10/10 \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\n\nGluten free menu but it doesn't feel like you're missing anything. The food is delicious. We ordered the dadinhos, p\u00e3o de quiejo (so good, we ordered another to go!), the ceviche, the root salad, the wagyu steak and the vegan moqueca stew. Their wine selection is extensive and they also have a great inhouse kombucha brew. If you've never had Brazilian food, this is a great introduction to it.\n\nThe fusion Brazilian food was amazing, every dish have taste on its own. Lovely night are made with lovely people, food, drinks, service and ambience. Even the crowd cooperates to create the memories. Love it here!\n\nWe ordered the Chargrilled Octopus (5stars) its very soft, beautifully grilled and deliciously paired accompaniments. Corn with cob (5STARS) is nicely grilled, the spices used is a nice pair to it. We also ordered the house made kombucha(5 stars). Came in a jar so it can be shared by 2. The wagyu steak and cassava fries are okay (3-4stars) probably cos they arent our taste.\n",

Since my family wasn't the one who ordered and I asked for no receipt, my family wasn't aware of the exact order.\n\n5 solid minutes later, a female Malay staff in Hijab came over to the table, snatched the existing order away, and confronted my family member why we TOOK the wrong order that wasn't meant for us. On hearing my family's reply that we've already consumed the item, the Malay girl said \"I CAN THROW IT AWAY\", and proceeded to throw (literally throw) the order away by flinging it in the bin, and slammed the door shut. The same staff subsequently slammed the right order down on the table.\n\nI wanted to ask for her name after I found out the events but was stopped by my family. Very bad attitude. If you cannot cope with increased volume of orders, don't work.  I decided to leave this review as customers next table also witnessed this event and told us we should give feedback, otherwise the staff and team will not learn. Horrendous attitude.\n\nInconsistent in quality. I buy acai on a regular basis at least 2-3 times a week and before it used to be more acai with some granola and toppings, but now it is more granola with some acai. It doesn't make any sense to pay that much for granola. I went back and complained to the staff showing them the thin acai layers and thick granola layers, but they said they cannot do anything and they only apologised. Too bad but the acai from this outlet is already off my list.\n\nordered takeaway. buzzer did not ring and i waited 10 mins before being informed that the order on the counter is mine and it had been there all along. the cup was uncapped and my acai was exposed to fruit flies. told the counter girl i ordered takeaway and she just put a cap over it. did not request for the acai to remade as i did not want to make things ugly, but this is very poor customer service.\n\nI always love acai but i kinda realised the (young) staffs at punngol and upper thomson are not so service oriented.. No smile no initiative.. Don't expect more from them.. More like a pick up point.... Just take and go (off please)....... =x\n\nMy mutiple times visiting acai affair ..always wanted to give them a chance but always disappoint me bcos their acai is always melted ! I can understand melted acai is easy for your staff to handle but we as customers do not like melted acai and will not patronise again at this store . Very disappointed\n",

And most important, friendly staff :)\n\nAre you an Ice Cream ,Waffle and Salad lover?\n\nDo visit @Overscoop West Coast Plaza. I did it. It was a lovely experience.\n\nTheir waffles is a must-try!!\n\nCrispy outer texture and soft fluffy interior, so nicely done!!\n\nI paired it with raspberry icecream and a cutie little scoop of mango.\n\nTheir ice cream is so good!!\n\nFlavorful, well balanced and not too sweet.\n\nNice ambience and cheerful interior, friendly staffs too.\n\nI love salads and I\u00a0 like the concept that it comes with a salad bar.\n\nPrice wise, it's really affordable.\n\nWill definitely be back to try more salad bowls.\n\nShout out to Joey for hosting and accommodating to all of us!!!\n\nShe is very friendly! Thank you @Overscoop!  I love healthy food, I will be back here for sure \u2728\n\nIt\u2019s our first time here. The waffle was basically air. Ice cream was good though. Service was not so great as we didn\u2019t feel welcomed at all. The person who was serving us didn\u2019t seem like she wanted to help us at all. A little smile would be great :). Anyways, paying $17.8 for a waffle and 1 drink is not so worth it cause you can get it at a cheaper price somewhere else\n\nWaffles is a must-try! Crispy outer texture and soft interior, so nicely done! I pair it with Belgium chocolate and a cutie little scoop of salted caramel. Regret not getting a double scoop, their ice cream is so good!  Flavorful, well balanced and not too sweet.  Nice ambience and cheerful interior, friendly staffs too. I like the new concept it comes with a salad bar. Price wise, it's really affordable. Will definitely be back to try a salad bowl.\n",

Stunning dishes. Paella is super nice as well. Good experiences. Very happening places. Price meet the service and dishes.\n\nI think this should be the best place to have Spanish food in Singapore - very delectable and original dishes. Loved the beetroot and strawberry salad in olive oil ice cream. Paella was also very flavourful. No regrets for a Tuesday weeknight dinner.\n\nLively atmosphere.   It\u2019s a bit noisy so if one will need to speak louder to your companions.  Been here for a few times and experienced seated on a table and counter.

High quality food and tasty. Have to put a credit card deposit when booking online though. Wine options are quite pricey, even the entry level ones.\n\nHad dinner with the lads yesterday and it was a great time. We ordered each of the mains to be shared amongst us, tapas style. We also sampled some of the appetizers. All I can say is that we were blown away by each dish that came out. Whilst small, each dish was bursting with flavour!\n\nWe also took each of all the desserts and it was the perfect way to wrap up the evening.\n\nbirthday + thanksgiving meal at Esquina. Honestly one of our best meals this year with each dish bringing out the beauty of the fresh ingredients.\n\nSpecial mention to the clams with cream sauce and uni foam \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\n\nMa\u00eetre d Sugan was exceptional and really elevated the experience for us! Will be back\n\nMy second time at Esquina, the last time was prob 2 years back. They are one of the few restaurants that still maintained the quality and consistency of the food. Still as good as I remembered and definitely one of the best Spanish restaurants in Singapore! All the dishes were amazing, couldn\u2019t find a fault.\nPrice is always steep at these restaurants ($167 for 2 pax), but definitely left the restaurant with my belly very full!\n\nVisited in Oct 2023\n\nFinally visited Esquina during the Singapore Restaurant week for the 8-course menu for $98++. Really well crafted menu which covered a wide variety of items across starters and mains. The octopus and pork main dishes were fantastic.\n\nService was decent.\n\nA definite recommendation and I myself hope to be back again soon.\n",

The food are generally good, and I particularly like the prawns paella and prawns. However, we find the ribs is quite salty, although it is tasty.\n\nEncourage you to make reservation as they are very crowded even on weekdays!\n\nGreat food and a nice place to chill. The pizza shop opposite is under the same management and they allowed my kid to have a single slice instead of the whole pizza. The pizza was very authentic (dough was crispy outside and soft inside). The pork ribs was so tender and juicy. The paella and Spanish omelette were very good as well.\n\nA good spot for Spanish food in Singapore. Price ~ 70-80$/pax. Almost all dishes we've tried taste great. Good portion as well. Nice ambiance & the staffs r attentive, just that stimes it's too crowded you might have to wait\n\nWent on a rainy afternoon and it was rather cold inside the restaurant.\n\nFood was great and of large portions. Honestly not sure what was ordered because a friend ordered but everything was really yummy!!\n\nI love the omelette, have to eat it fast while it is hot. Grilled potatoes are also great for sharing.\n\nThe crust of the pizza is different from those that you can usually find at the normal fast food chain.\n\nThe sea salt ice cream is amazing too \ud83d\ude0b\n\nChose this place for Spanish food as requested by the birthday star. Resturant was fully packed on a weekday night.\n\nEvery dish was nice though some items were slightly salty. Crowd\u2019s favourite was the pork belly that we ordered a second serving. Their seafood like cod fish and squid were really fresh too! Perfect pairing with the white wine recommended by the server.\n\nTotal bill came up to $500++ for 6 pax.\n",

We had the red Sangria and boy, it had quite a bit of alcohol. We could taste it on the first sip but who\u2019s complaining? \ud83d\ude06\n\nService was alright since it was full house and they were short of staff. So that\u2019s understandable.\n\nAtmosphere was quite noisy as it was a Friday night but I can imagine it to be the same during weekends. It\u2019s a nice place to be with great company. However do be prepared to pay more than a casual dinner place. We spent approx. $90 pp.\n\nWould visit again soon!\n\nFood is super good! 5 tapas is enough for two. Ordering another paella was an overkill, luckily the staff said we should just order half a portion. My favourite Spanish in SG!\n\nThis is my second visit back at Binomio, this restaurant served good Spanish food. We enjoyed the appetisers and paella today. However, the suckling pig today didn\u2019t not taste good, while the skin was crispy but the meat tasted stinky. \u2639\ufe0f\n\nWe were greeted by friendly staffs on arrival. The staff patiently explained each type of tapas he recommended to try. We let him decides and all turn out great and we really enjoy them. We loved the pulpo afeira, the ink paella, costilla de ternera and the nido de huevos rotos. First time tried the nido de huevos dish, the chorizos was generous. The dinner went well without fuss. Will return to tried other tapas, like lengua.\n\nIncredible experience and food, not a single miss. From the tapas to the paellas, to the desserts, to the sangria. Everything five stars. Service is on point, fast, and attentive. Great vibes as well both in private dining room and in main dining areas.\nCan't recommend enough.\n",

The cocktail is a must-to-order. I highly recommend this restaurant for any occasion.\n\nFirst time to try.  Nice ambience. One weekday lunch time, and it wasn't crowded. Minimal people dining in, but the service was still slow due to maybe short of manpower. Service lacks assertion.\n\nModerate selection of tapas. We ordered the set lunch and 1 classic tapas. Set lunch was priced as 19 ++ because you wouldn't get any set that would cost 19$. The minimum is 21 coz, as you can see on the menu, one main is 2$ additional cost the least.\n\nFood wise. All tasted nice. More of the salty side. Paella squid ink was good, salty. But the portion was so little.  Ham croquettes was good also. Iberico pork was good, salty also. The mashed potato was good. Everything we ordered was good for one person. A little pricey.\n\nFree water. And pickled olives.\n\nOverall, it's good to try.\n\nDinner having Mexican food and drinks and we tried the Tapas Club at Orchard central....it was good and just right. We ordered tapas green peppers, potato brava, squid fritters, pulled pork tacos and of course paella. The tapas are good and tasty. Paella are crisp but I would say I would ask them to make our paella more crispier at the bottom, chicken and other seafood are quite few, lucky the way they cook the rice is good so I forgot to count the meats and seafood. Dessert are the ones we really love and would come back for more, banana fritters and churros with chocolate dip.these you should try when you pass by and dine at Tapas Club. Drinks are OK,lots of wine varieties you could choose from.\n\nI want to share one good experience I have with a staff name Jenny at Orchard Central Outlet. Super accommodating and made us feel comfortable. Her service deserve to be recognised and praise. I think overall the staff did a great job to made us feel welcome. I would definitely come back again in the future :D.\n\nAwesome ambience, food and service. We were greeted by warm smile and excellent service throughout our dinning. Excellent recommendation by Chef Steven and the dishes he prepared was simply drooling! All the MUST order food bites for chillax are as posted.\n",

                  "reviews": "\n\nSpanish tapas at its best! They have a really good variety of tapas that you can enjoy in a small group setting. Each tapas were unique with its own set of flavour and texture, teasing the palate, readying it for the main course. Squid ink paella has that sweetness from the squid ink and further enhanced by the fresh lemon. The octopus was cooked perfectly with balsamic vinaigrette and was not chewy at all. For dessert, the churros with chocolate sauce was a good way of ending the meal. Highly recommended place to visit.\n\nWe had the lunch sets here and we enjoyed all the dishes that we picked. The Spanish Appetizers and Smoked Salmon Salad are good, the Braised Beef Cheeks are so tender and juicy, the Grilled Halibut is delicious, and the desserts are refreshing. Service is good, except that there should have been a queuing system at the door before it opens for service. Everyone rushed to the host when the door was open at 12. It\u2019s rather messy.\n\nWe came on a Sunday around 1.30pm and had the set lunch. Portions were generous especially for the starters - we had the smoked salmon salad and scrambled eggs, which were tasty and well-balanced, the highlight of the meal. The grilled halibut and lamb rump mains were good. The lamb rump was well grilled if slightly gamey and accompanied with a delicious Proven\u00e7al vegetable side. Desserts were a nice note to end on but tiny in comparison to the previous courses. Service staff were quite busy throughout and could be hard to get their attention, but courses were served quickly after ordering. Very worth it with our 1-for-1 deal but on the pricey side otherwise.\n\nWine and Co Holland village used to be our go to tapas place but since their brilliant chef left we haven\u2019t been able to find a good tapas. Then we found this place and it will be our go to. Like most tapas places in Sg it\u2019s expensive but the quality of the food is excellent and our favourite dishes  were cooked to perfection and tasted just as they should be.\n\nThe staff were very polite and service was quick. It\u2019s a little dark away from the windows and a little noisy near the windows but if you\u2019re going for a quick lunch that doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s a little difficult to find.\n\nWe came here for dinner and the ambience was lovely. Overall the food was delicious and it exceeded my expectations, especially the dishes we ordered from the warm tapas section. However, service wasn't that great. I had ordered a mocktail but was charged and delivered a cocktail. We also wasn't informed that the wagyu steak was minimum 300g, which left a bitter taste that night. Although it was stated in the menu, it was still misleading to include $28/100g. If it was stated better ($84, additional $28 for 100g onwards) We would have just ordered a dish more value for money such as a lobster. Aside from that, everything was well executed and we would definitely come again another time.\n",

I am most impressed with their service. They provided a bag hook when they see me struggling with my bag on my lap, topped up my warm water promptly and even waived off the eggplants when they got our feedback.\n\nVery good lunch set offers\n\nGood is good and atmosphere is casual. Fast service and a good spot for business lunch. I was there for lunch but would also expect a great atmosphere during dinner time, considering how lively the area is\n\nLove the paella!!\n\nProbably one of the best Spanish restaurants- price and quality were definitely a match for me.\n\nOctopus Galican style was a definite favourite at the table- sliced just the right sized and cooked to the right texture. The potato pur\u00e9e was beautifully done as well.\n\nSquid ink fiduea- please do yourself a favour and order this. I usually get either undercooked or overcooked fiduea in SG and this was done with the right amount of crisp.\n\nPedron peppers- I know it\u2019s a simple dish but to be honest, one of the best I\u2019ve tried.\n\nThe cheesecake and roasted pineapple with coconut dessert was a great cap. Coffee was good with it too.\n\nWill definitely come back again:)\n\nIt was our first time trying Spanish food. We ordered the Roasted Cauliflower, Pork Belly and Octopus for starters. And the Pork Ribs and Seafood Paella for mains. Love every dish! The Casa Sangria was a refreshing compliment, too. Will definitely patronise again \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\n\nExcellent set lunch and ambience! Compliments to the Chefs! My personal favourite is the prawn, the iberico pork, pork & sausage paella! Their signature cheesecake is to die for! Staffs are friendly! Place is clean and well decorated. They should have a cctv in private room so we can wave to get attention though. Coffee could have more punch too! But overall great meal! Will be back!\n",

Actually the joy of having tapas is that we can all try different dishes and share with friends and family- a very fun experience.\n\nThe decor and environment was cosy, with real bricks and European art collections like plates and mirrors from various sources, tastefully displayed to transport guests to another place..\n\nWould come again for a romantic dinner or family gathering, or just a chill evening with friends over yummy Spanish food\n\nA few years ago, I ate the paella with dishes made by Chef Edward. I visited today and ordered the paella that my son wanted to eat, but as shown in the photo, the bottom of the paella was too black and the texture of the rice was the result of cooking by a beginner, and the seafood all had a very fishy taste. There was no saffron scent, it was very salty and how much MSG was used... Even though I couldn't eat it all and left it behind, my tongue felt numb and it tasted like I was going to have a headache. There were only three tables including us, but the customers who arrived later than us were not served first, and when I asked to confirm our order, the waiter cut me off and replied that he would be back soon, which was also unpleasant. I visited again with delicious memories, but today I had such a terrible experience that I will never return. I hope you find your original intention and pay attention to the freshness of the ingredients. (For reference, the mussels I ate at My Little Spanish Place in Boat Quay, which I visited a month ago, were very fresh and delicious.)\n\nJune 2023\n\nFirst visit & the food quality was quite mundane really.The only bit that I enjoyed in the Paella were the prawns which were fresh and of decent size. Other dishes were middle of the road kind , not bad but certainly won\u2019t make you crave for more.\nComfortable ambience & helpful staff. A bit overpriced to be honest.\n\nNice food with a good ambiance. We love their seafood dishes. Even a vegetable-based has a special sauce to eat with it. We return here a few times for different occasions.\n\nSuper nice staff, but at this price point I'd expect more from the food. We ordered plenty and so could sample different things and there were some winners (the pan con tomate was fantastic), but there were too many that were disappointing. The gambas al ajillo, while sizable, had no heat in either sense of the word. The garlic bread was far too oily and some other dishes were over salted.\nFinally, and without wanting to sound like a lush, the glass of house red was ok but the volume provided was equivalent to what a sommelier would pour to let someone taste the wine.\n",

We ordered crispy fried squid, mushroom croquettes, potatoes with bravas sauce & aioli, Argentian beef steak, garlic prawns, grilled chorizo & potato puree, Spanish omelette, and prosecco. Food was mostly so-so and the potatoes with bravas sauce was the least nice. Maybe the steak and grilled chorizo in potato puree were the best we ordered. The frozen sangria looks good but we didn't order. Staff was attentive and response fast. Outdoor has a nice view of Sentosa.\n\nSublime tapas with swift service. The Padras peppers, chorizo with potato pur\u00e9e, garlic prawns with toast, fish tacos, and churros with chocolate sauce transported me back to an enjoyable holiday in Barcelona. These were fine Spanish grub and I look forward to trying more dishes such as the paella.\n\nWith a good selection of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages, there\u2019s also a nice grocery shop positioned near the entrance for you to take a taste of Spain home.\n\nOverall the food taste good but the quantity in both our Paella is little (compare to the previous time I ate at Orchard outlet). Mushroom croquet are so good we ordered second serving. The cold cuts, salads and tapas (prawns, chicken wings, squid, potatoes with bravas sauce, eggplant) are good. Seabass can skip, not very tasty.\n\nWell\u2026 walking out of the restaurant feeling regretful on my choice vs the money spent\u2026\n\nPotato with bravas sauce was terrible. That\u2019s the saddest choice I have made. Always a potato lover and for any potato to taste bad for me, it\u2019s really not a good thing. 1/10\n\nFried squid was just ok n nothing better than ok.\nMy son said \u201cyuck\u201d which was very shocking to me cos he loves his calamari. 5/10\n\nSpanish omelette was quite good and the portion was huge. 7/10\n\nSeafood and chicken Paella was the best out of all the choice and it was delicious.\nDefinitely a 8/10\n\nChurros was equally disappointing. Very tough and hard and the oil used must be stale or used for many times. The churros smell very seafood-ish if u know what I mean.\n\nPaying the amount for the quality. I am definitely not very happy walking out.\n\nGreat food! Came here for a company dinner and ordered many small plates. My favourites were the ib\u00e9rico pork as well as the jalape\u00f1os, which was a very interesting dish! The mushroom croquettes was also really nice, and kind of tasted like solidified mushroom soup. All in all, I enjoyed every single dish. I do prefer the squid ink paella over the Valencia paella though, as it was richer in taste.\n",

The presentation of food is beautiful & there\u2019s a wonderful selection of desserts to end with! I would wlike to come back here again and again.\n\nCame here for a birthday celebration and we were served by the pleasant and friendly Kai, who gave us excellent recommendations and advised us on the portions. Service was great and our food came super fast to the point that we got full a bit early. Kai noticed this and helped slow down the subsequent dishes. We had the octopus and truffle egg mash for starters. The dishes were all superb and up to standard but the portions were pretty big too so be warned not to overorder. The highlight for us was the seafood paella and the iberico pork, each spoonful of the paella was bursting with flavour and fresh seafood, we felt like we were one with the ocean itself. Our table for two was also very spacious. They served a light Basque baked cheesecake on the house for our birthday celebration. Will definitely be back again!\n\nThis restaurant really has it all! The service, the food and atmosphere. We were also served by an amazing waiter, Kai. One of the best genuine services! His recommendations for food and drinks were top notch =) He even insisted to take away the leftovers. And he was right, still so good the next day! Don\u2019t miss taking photos outside the mansion. It\u2019s too pretty to miss!\n\nWe celebrated my wife birthday at Una on a Friday. Only set lunch option available unless we pre ordered tapas. Service crew is very friendly here, keep checking our water is filled. The food is delicious! The server also surprised my wife with a slice of cake for her birthday! What a great place to celebrate birthdays.\n\nOverall it was a great dining experience. The staffs are friendly.\nThe foods are delicious. The Ib\u00e9rico pork was great however it could\u2019ve been better if it was cooked medium rare. As in the picture the right side was alright while the left side was kinda dry, about medium well to well done.\n",

                  "reviews": "\n\nA little understaffed at lunch but the sole lady service staff was still friendly and attentive!\nAppetisers were excellent! Wish the paella was a little less wet, but the prawns were good.\nCasual place for a nice catch up with friends!\n\nBit overpriced. Their serving sizes are teeny for the price of what they charge. Even their 4x Tapas for $78 is not worth it as some Tapas sizes are so small they are smaller than a typical entr\u00e9e. And the Paella which supposedly feeds 2-4pax is more like 2 pax because it is a super stingy  thin layer of rice.\n\nThe cheese terrine is only two small slices of cheese for $20 and some bits of bread. The prawns had 5x prawns with barely any hummus under it for $30  (so misleading compared to their Instagram pics).\n\nFour people dining, ordered 4x Tapas and one small paella, 2x desserts this cost $55 each excluding drinks. Maybe it's just inflation but I think they could have been more generous on the cheaper carb items like rice and bread.\n\nThat said the food was overall delicious, while non of them was a stellar standout, most were very well executed in terms of flavour. Service could have been much more attentive though, had to keep waving the waiter over for water even though the place wasn't even full.\n\nThe Spanish food here was pretty good! Despite being relatively new, they were quite busy when we visited.\n\nBarrio 'Bikini' Sandwich (S$20) - this uses beef instead of ham. There was tons of delicious roasted beef slices in this, the bread was flattened and also very crisp as it was toasted for quite long. However, we found the sandwich to be slightly dry - the bread could have done with more butter. This was a bit less cheesy, and the truffle flavour was not too evident in this.\n\nJam\u00f3n Ib\u00e9rico Croquettes (S$14) - this was crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside, with chunks of ham inside and mayo on the top and base of the croquette. Quite yummy!\n\nGrilled Green Asparagus (S$18) - the asparagus was done just nice (and came with lots of pepper), the sabayon sauce was creamy and delicious, the Ib\u00e9rico chorizo added some good savouriness and the hazelnuts complemented the sauce and chorizo well. We enjoyed this!\n\nHalf Roasted Chicken (800g, S$45) - the chicken meat was tender and not too dry, and the marinade sauce went well with the chicken as well. Came with Panadera potatoes (pretty delicious as well) and salad.\n\nBarrio's Special 'Ceviche' (S$20) - this was okay, the seabass was fresh and marinated with an interesting thin sauce. Came with tortillas to enjoy with the ceviche.\n\nPork Sausage & Mushroom Paella (S$42) - this was missing the crisp base/wok hei flavour - they made the paella softer as some customers didn\u2019t like the burnt base. Other than that, the paella was flavourful with the broth and it was filling. They were generous with the chorizo and mushrooms as well, although the chorizo was a bit salty.\n\nChurros (S$14, 4 pieces) - a very typical Spanish dessert, quite crispy outside and coated with cinnamon sugar. Came with chocolate sauce which went well with the churros.\n\nRed Wine Sangria (S$15) - this was fruity, slightly sweet and light enough.\n\nFor more food reviews, check out my IG @foodlesstravelled!\n\nFood was good! Ingredients were fresh and full of natural flavour.\n\nTomato appetizer was great and tomatoes were nice and sweet.\n\nAspragus was grilled really well and had nice juiciness and sweetness. Loved the sauce.\n\nFish was really fresh and you could taste the olive oil that was used.\n\nChicken was a tad dry to my taste but flavour was great and loved the potatoes.\n\nA hidden gem for Spanish tapas and paella. The ambience was fantastic and the service was impeccable here. Shoutout to Kumar, our head waitstaff, who demonstrated what world-class hospitality feels like - from the moment we stepped through the door, he and his team made us feel right at home. They were extremely attentive to our needs and always responsive to our requests!\n\nAnd where do I even start with the food - every dish served exceeded our expectations! The dishes that we tried that really stood out were the Whole Seabass and Pork Sausage & Mushroom Paella. Everything else we ordered was still amazing.\n\nWould rate a 6/5 if I could. Thank you to the amazing staff at Barrio - will definitely be back soon!\n",

I'm personally not a fan of being in a busy place so took a star off for atmosphere but I acknowledge some people like that vibe. The service was great and everything we ordered was delicious. Prices are all very reasonable as well! They gladly gave us a birthday candle when we asked too.\n\nWas at Comer Friday night of the F1 weekend. Good food and great vibe. There was a block party that evening with fantastic music and dancing. Everyone was in a festive mood. Would come again for sure. I hope they have block parties every weekend!\n\nChill outdoor vibe. Suitable for those who prefer outdoor seating. All the tables are high tables. The food is decent. Love the gambas and grilled octopus. There is happy hour before 8pm, sangria at 10$.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to find delicious yet reasonably priced Spanish food in Singapore. Most of the menu options are below $20. Drinks was also good with happy hour till 8pm daily. We will definitely return! Just a note that this is a casual eatery with no AC, but it\u2019s nice to sit outdoors in cool weather and enjoy the Arab Street vibe.\n\nAttentive and friendly service, good food, reasonably priced - couldn\u2019t ask for more! Highly recommend the seafood paella and mussels.\n",

Crab croquette was heavenly albeit a bit small portioned. Patatas bravas was great too with a super addictive sauce! Would have given 5 stars if the paella did not fall short. Have tried better elsewhere, the flavours were simply not the best.\n\nGood spot for sipping wine and chilling.\nThe ham platter was my favourite, each type has a different fat and saltiness level which is very enjoyable with bread. The other tapas were just ok. The steak (not in photo) is a bit underwhelming as well. What pulled the rating back up is the wine and the service - the sommelier really knows his thing.\n\nUpdate: Bumping up my rating because of a better experience the second time around. The iberico pork had such a good flavour profile. Meanwhile, the bone marrow is so sinful, yet almost worth all that cholesterol. I'd skip the churros, a little too oily, a little too crispy, and not enough chew on the inside.\n\nFantastic food, so much choice! We got 3 tapas each and struggled to finish them all. Seated by the waterfront with stunning night time views, just fab! Service was great, food came out very fast and the servers were very helpful and friendly - highly recommend!\n\nGood location and quite easy to get to.\nAs the name of the place suggest this is a Spanish restaurant so is all the food and majority of the wine selection.\n\nThe food was good and the wine selection is nice. Paella was huge.\n\nService was okay and the place does get busy.\n\nIf you looking for Spanish cuisine this could be a good choice\n\nWe went to Boat Q outlet and it is not spacious place and very packed with customers.\nThe food we ordered we enjoyed except the squid rice not up to our expectation. And the price for what we ordered for 3 of us at 288++ would say very expensive and unexpected. Could use this money for even better deal food. But it is an experience!\n",

The Seafood and Chicken Paella impressed with its moist rice, each grain infused with the rich essence of the ocean. Equally noteworthy were the Pulled Pork Tacos, featuring meat so tender it melted in the mouth, and the Mediterranean Salad, which was a beacon of freshness.\n\nHowever, despite the high-quality food, the prices at Tapas Club are on the higher end. The cost is a significant factor to consider, especially when comparable Spanish cuisine might be found elsewhere at a more affordable rate.\n\nGiven the sparse customer turnout during a weekday lunch, it does raise the question of whether Tapas Club might review their pricing strategy to enhance their appeal, especially if they wish to draw a larger crowd during typically slower business hours.\n\nWe had an impromptu dinner at Jewel on this weekday after landing from BKK. The ambience and decoration is beautiful. The drinks are reasonable priced and the food is delicious. The salad is fresh and the pork is really soft and tender. The friendly staff made us feel really comfortable and we enjoyed ourselves thoroughly. Thank you for hosting us Tapas Club, we will be back soon.\n\nThis Spanish restaurant is worth the advance booking, as it tends to be busy, especially during dinner hours. With a week's reservation, you secure a spot for your party of eight. The highlight here is the must-try paella, bursting with authentic flavors. The menu offers a range of delectable Spanish dishes. The ambience and service add to the overall dining experience. For a delightful Spanish culinary journey, make sure to reserve ahead and savor the unforgettable paella at this bustling restaurant.\n\nWas seated immediately at 630pm on a Saturday. Had the seafood&chicken paella, steak and spanish omelette. Surprisingly their paella tasted good for us! The best dish out of the 3 we had. Omelette was not as flavourful as I rmbr it to be.. Steak was the worst - ordered medium but texture was well done.\n\nI would suggest to stick to their tapas and paella.\n\nMost of the food wasn\u2019t really good. The arepa was terrible, extremely dense and lacked ingredients in between. I wanted churros for dessert but they said that they ran out of them. They offered me a lemon tart instead, and even the vanilla ice cream that came with it was out of stock. So they offered raspberry ice cream instead which is not to my liking but accepted it.\n",

When we entered the restaurant,  I initially felt it had a little stiff atmosphere but those worries wore off as the evening went on.\nThe service staff had excellent knowledge on the menu and recommended good dishes for us to try.\nThey were very friendly and even shared occasional banter with us whilst changing our plates or serving our food.  Special shout out to the male wait staff who wore specs, sorry we didn't get your name but you really changed the vibe of the night for us. \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\n\nChef Marti, the Head Chef went around the tables checking in on the guests. We enjoyed chatting with him as well.\n\nWe had the anchovy on toast, jamon iberico, padr\u00f2n peppers, mushroom croquettes, bomba de la Barceloneta, the Gaig's cannelloni, Galican octopus and pork belly (not pictured because I forgot! Haha!), the suckling pig dish and the Catalan creme brule\u00e8.\nEverything was lovely and I enjoyed the food very much!\nPersonally I prefer the more casual Spanish tapas styled food. But this experience was very enjoyable aswell for a special occasion.\n\nDefinitely will come back again to try the other items on the menu! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\n\nFirst time here draw in by Google review and michilin guide.\nSurprise disapointment on how bad the food is.\n1. Jam\u00f3n Ib\u00e9rico - very good taste and portion for the price.\n2. Pa amb Tom\u00e0quet - a little dry for my liking\n2. Crispy Suckling pig - tiny portion, taste average.\n3. Boston Lobster Fideu\u00e0 - the noodle is cold with boil lobster\n4. Cod fish - too salty tasted like salted fish\n5. Our Catalan cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e - Good\n6. Chocolate & Mushroom - the combo doesn't work for me\n7. Complimentery Birthday cake - Thanks\n\nNo, will not return.\n\nHighly recommended. Tasted better than many restaurants in Spain. Dishes come in small portion hence can try more. The 2 service folks who attended to us were pleasant. I would love to be back.\n\n2023-07-12\nA little understaffed and it took short waits to get water refills. Lovely playlist with oldies hits.\n\nBread $5.4 per pax - Excellent, the highlight of each visit. Freshly toasted and with homemade butter. The butter was too salty this time though.\nJamon croquettes $6 ea - Excellent\nBomba de la Barceloneta $16 - Mediocre\nRed prawn ajillo style $24 - Mediocre. Flavors were nice but the prawns were tiny\nSquid ink seafood rice $50 - Excellent. Two huge juicy prawns and a scallop. Lovely heterogeneous texture in the rice, fragrant with infused seafood flavors.\n\n2022-04-21 lunch\nStaff were very professional and available. Great ambience.\nBread $3.5 per pax - Excellent. Delicious butter. The butter was highly salted and had some inclusions, though I couldn't identify what they were. Olive oil was nice but nothing special. Free flow and served freshly reheated; the outside is crisp and the inside is warm.\nDuck foie gras terrine $26.5- Mediocre. The green apple sauce didn't seem to pair well. However, the provided shortbread sticks were great.\nTortilla camarones $5.5 each - A small prawn cracker. Great flavor and visuals.\nCanneloni $17.5 - OK, tasted like tuna filling.\nFideua with 3x carabinero prawn $61 - OK. The carabinero head was nice, but the tail flesh was average. Noodles were unique but I didn't enjoy it much.\nBaba on fire dessert $17 - Alcohol flavors were too strong, overpowering the subtle flavors of the ice cream and bread, and distracting from the texture. Nevertheless, it's a unique visual and sensory experience\n\nIt was my first time at Restaurant Gaig, and I would say the food here is simply amazing!\n\nRestaurant Gaig\u2019s menu showcases Catalan dishes with traditional recipes dating back to the 19th century through Chef Marti\u2019s innovative interpretations. They also have a really good selection of wines that you can consider going with the meal.\n\nHighlight from the new Chef\u2019s Menu ($180++ per diner) focus on the no wastage nose-to-tail Gastronomy \u2013 Lamb\n\nLocation: Restaurant Gaig,  16 Stanley Street Singapore 068735\n",

                  "reviews": "\n\nFood quality was top notch and every dish was amazingly yummy and delicious! Definitely one of the top Spanish restaurants in Singapore!\n\nOnly 3 areas of improvement:\n- to have more cocktail options, they had way too many wine options.\n- it was relatively noisy at the courtyard, might be the infrastructure or design of the restaurant where the noise keeps bouncing back.\n- should have cleared the plates on the table before serving the new dish, and not get customers to help hold the plates while they are serving.\n\nIt's a 4.5 stars for me personally.\n\nMy 7 y/o daughter and I enjoyed our dinner with TINTO. The service was impeccable - our server was attentive and patient with us, explaining the dishes as they were served.\n\nThe Gambas (prawn) starter was excellent and our favorite! The Grilled Asparagus was great, and we appreciated that it wasn't too salty. The Grilled Squid and Chorizo Paella didn't disappoint, albeit the serving was smaller than I expected.\n\nAll in all, a lovely experience and a small notch above Tapas Club.\n\nReally liked this place: Elegant, but still relaxed atmosphere, attentive service. The person who seems to be the restaurant manager is indeed checking that everything is taken care of. I also appreciate that, at the beginning, they ask what type of water you like, including warm and ice water. This is a lovely attention to detail.\nThey have a full vegetarian menu with creative and interesting dishes - I want to come back to try more of these. Also very good Spanish wine options.\nThis would be a definite 5 stars if not for the below:\n1) At our table, we had one starter and two mains. One of the mains was paella, which takes time to prepare (it's called out in the menu). They brought the other main so early, that one person at the table was pretty much done with the food when the paella arrived.\n2) the vegetarian dish of the grilled gem lettuce was really nice, especially the chimichurri. Great use of herbs and flavours. Unfortunately, it was quite oily, which made it very heavy. A less oily preparation would have been great.\n\nPS: The restaurant was full when we were there. For privacy reasons, I edited the other diners - but it certainly wasn't empty.\n\nParty of 4...we came here for a birthday celebration. First impressions upon entering the restaurant exuded positive vibes - ambience, decor, welcoming crew. We were led to the inner section which was very cosy and inviting... I knew a great night was in store. Great menu and price points. We were attended to by the inimitable Ara who made the evening very enjoyable. The recommendations were on point. Food was fabulous. Overall a lovely lovely place for authentic Spanish fare. Highly recommended. Well done guys!!\n\nTapas were very unique and tasty. I believe we had the grilled octopus and some anchovy + burrata cracker. Paella was nothing exceptional. Desserts (rice pudding and orange cake) were alright. If I were to go again, I would order just the tapas.\n",

My friend had the goat curry. I had the fish curry. Both were spicy but flavorful. The plantain chips are hot and crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. The coffee was amazing, presentation and taste.\n\nWe had a wonderful dining experience at this restaurant. The standout feature was their incredibly welcoming, friendly, and attentive service. The staff patiently recommended dishes and even showed photos of them when we needed assistance.\n\nWe ordered the peanut chicken stew and goat curry, both of which were absolutely delightful. The flavors were well-balanced with just the right amount of spice and heat, and there was no gamy taste from the goat meat.\n\nThe cocktails were also a hit, and the evening was rounded off with delicious desserts. The overall ambiance was cozy and inviting, making it a perfect setting for a memorable evening.\n\nWe'll definitely be returning, and I can wholeheartedly recommend this restaurant to friends. It's a gem worth visiting again and again.\n\nWent there for dinner and I had cauliflower and buttermilk fried chicken for starters and the portion is pretty generous. Absolutely love both of it. Got the fish curry too and it was amazing tho pretty spicy. However we didn't enjoy the Malindi Halwa dessert so much with it's jelly-like texture. Service is really top notch as they were always attentive.\n\nIt\u2019s my first time trying Africa\u2019s cuisine, and I\u2019m pleasantly impressed with the food.\n\nWe ordered a variety of curry based dishes, with different level of spiciness - and we enjoyed all of them.\n\nHighly recommended the Goat Curry, where in our opinion is the best one there.\n\nGreat ambience and fantastic customer service from the staff. Our waiter spent time to recommend us the dishes. The food is definitely on the pricier side and it felt that it might have been adjusted so much to suit the local palate that the food does not feel uniquely african. When the food tastes very similar to local dishes, it does not really justify the high price.\n",

Service is helpful albeit sometimes difficult to grab attention of, and the food is no doubt tasty. Wish they let us control the music in our own room or at least play more atmospheric music (it was basically lullaby music for the most part). Overall worth coming to if you want a good time with friends.\n\nGreat atmosphere.\nFood are some very good and some are just fine for the price.\nDrunken prawn preparation and live boiling were excellent visually and tasted good.\nPeking duck skin were very good but the egg flavored wrapper dilute the taste. And additional cost to serve the duck meat with noodles were quite high.\nShark fin was nice despite no big piece of fin and its all small mixed pieces.\nThe soup in coconut shell were very nice\nThe big bamboo clam were nice.\n\nCan't gush more about their service. Little things like offering to cut the cake we brought for a birthday celebration, asking if we wanted to pack the leftovers before we even had to ask, random staff actually looking over to smile and say goodbye while we were walking out after dinner, and that old school culture of staff treating customers like family is something we don't encounter much anymore these days...\n\nFood is perfectly done classic Cantonese food. Peking duck generously yielded enough for a table of 10 to eat at least two rounds for everyone. Really keen to go back and try their dim sum.\n\nMissed this place. Glad that they reopened at raffles city\u2019s Fairmont. It\u2019s right beside koji on the 3rd floor.\nComfy seating and great Cantonese cuisine and other fair. Peking duck was just as good as before. I liked their garoupa fish cooked 2 styles. Black pepper beef was tender and the fried bee hoon was perfect. Soup was perfect too. Finished the boiled pork ribs actually.\nYou\u2019ll definitely come back. It\u2019s such an iconic name.\n",

I just wish there was a dedicated server in the room at all times to assist with topping up the tea and offering water automatically.\n\nThe dim sum and Chinese dishes are pretty good. Some of the dishes are unique (can\u2019t get it elsewhere) so worth it to come here for the food. However, the restaurant felt very understaffed. Food came fast but when we needed to get help from the waiters, it took quite a while.\n\nThe presentation of the dishes was impeccable, and the flavors were simply delightful.\n\nThe smoky char siew, in particular, was a highlight of the meal. Its perfect balance of smokiness and tenderness made it an unforgettable dish that I would highly recommend to anyone visiting this establishment.\n\nWhat truly elevated my visit was the exceptional service provided by Desmond. His attentiveness and professionalism went above and beyond to ensure our dining experience was exceptional. I highly recommend this restaurant for a fantastic culinary experience!\n\nGreat service and impressively plated and flavoured food! Got the set menu and loved the crispy fish skin - soup tasted like the crab accompaniment. Dessert (not pictured) was melon balls with Hokkaido milk, very refreshing after a filling sequence of dishes.\n\nThe most creative dish of the night goes to the signature cigar roll. Overall, interesting blend of flavors though some can taste 'heavy'. Food is good, service is prompt and professional\n",

We got one of the chefs menus instead. My favorite was the chili prawns and my least favorite was the fried rice, it just wasn't anything special compared to the other dishes.\n\nService was great and they even set up a kids place setting for our baby, which was sweet, even though he is much too young for solid foods.\n\nThe food was mediocre at best, but the service was good. We made a reservation for seven beforehand, yet the table we were assigned was extremely small, could not even fit the dishes we ordered.\n\nCompared to other Chinese restaurants in this price bracket, such as those at the Ritz Carlton and Hilton, this dining experience left much to be desired.\n\nBBQ Meat Combination 2/5\nSteamed Star Groupa 2.5/5\nPeking Duck 3/5\nSweet and Sour Pork 4/5\nStir fried Kai Lan 1/5\n\nOne of the best Peking ducks ever! Please note that all other dishes, despite the high price, are portions for one pax only.\n\nVery expensive but worth the Michelin star!\n\nFantastic restaurant, small portion but really great. I would say, \u70e7\u814a is the best!!!!!!! Highly recommended for family gathering or special occasions.\n\nPeking Duck was the highlight here. Level up with a touch of caviar. The duck here is more lean and crisp but I do think a little of fat adds to the flavour. Still good nonetheless.\n\nHad a soup (meh, especially for that price) and a Soft Shell Crab with Crab Meat (which was yums, creamy but not to the point of being jelak, guess it helped that we shared instead of having 1 each) and a refreshing petite fours of Osmanthus Jelly and Pineapple Tart.\n\nThe complimentary birthday cake was delish too, reminded much of Ritz's Royal Caraibe from 20 years back. Dark bittersweet choc mousse on a layer of caramelised crunch. Service was top notch, attentive yet but imposing, always there but invisibly.\n",

Our waiter took special care to ensure that we had really nice pictures for the \"birthday cake shot\".\n\nThe food was nice, but nothing too special.\n\nI would go back for the service and ambience alone.\n\nWent there for lunch for the first time. We had orchid lunch set. Especially love the soup, the smoked duck and the lobster rice/fish noodles. We didn't get to take any photo so just find some photos online to show some of the best dishes we had.\nYes it's pricey, but it's worth the money.\n\nGreat food and good service. There were just 2 of us and the restaurant was able to adjust the dim sum portion to 2 pieces each so that we could try more variety. Love that flexibility!\n\nGood ambiance with impressive crockery that have beautiful black brush ink paintings of flowers. Each diner was served your individual bowl of fried cashew nuts as appetisers instead of communal serving in most Chinese restaurants. Nice touch!\n\nWe had steamed live prawns that were served with very fine strips of ginger, scallions and chilli in a light sauce for dipping. A silver finger bowl with a lemon slice was provided. Nice touch!\n\nIngredients used in Sze Chuan Styled Stewed Sea Cucumber Fish Maw and Braised Bean Curd Bamboo Pith were fresh and good quality. However the flavours of both were not memorable and the gravy for the beancurd had too much cornstarch.\n\nFried Rice Crab Meat with Dried Scallops was full of \"wok hei\". The only dish that left a good impression.\n\nGood hospitality for there is no charge for warm water.\n\nI was here on a weekday afternoon (prior reservation is recommended). The place quickly got crowded at around 1pm, mostly with business folks who presumably were there for lunch meetings.\n\nExcellent place for dim sum. The food isn't cheap here, but what you get in return is high-quality food, in fact the best dim sums in town, and excellent service.\n",

Our orders arrived promptly, and each dish was beautifully presented and bursting with flavors. I highly recommend trying the foie gras and crab roe soup- it was an absolute delight!\n\nWould definitely recommend to anyone seeking a memorable dining experience.\n\nIncredible place for lunch! Such a beautiful atmosphere accompanied by beautiful food.\n\nHad the half duck with the first course in pancakes (not pictured) and the second course wrapped in lettuce which was a great way to freshen up our palettes. The stir fried prawns in chili sauce is an absolute must and no wonder it\u2019s one of their signature dishes. The buns to accompany and soak up any leftover sauce were great, we would\u2019ve gotten more but didn\u2019t want to fill up!\n\nThe saut\u00e9ed wagyu beef with cumin was so aromatic and the meat extremely tender, and the fried rice with pork and seafood was delicious and equally portioned out for the three of us.\n\nWe had a fantastic time, the service was impeccable and we hope to come back soon.\n\nShisen Hanten beautifully blends the bold flavors of Sichuan cuisine with Japanese inspiration, all while offering traditional Cantonese dishes.\n\nTheir Mapo Tofu is amazing I would return here just for this dish. The perfect blend of spicy and savoury, with tender tofu bathed in a flavorful sauce, makes it a must-try. Their vegetable dishes are equally impressive. Here, the true essence of the vegetables shines through, highlighting their natural flavors and freshness.\n\nService at Shisen Hanten is impeccable, with attentive staff adding to the overall dining experience. Their commitment to ensuring your satisfaction enhances the enjoyment of the meal.\n\nGenuinely enjoyed the lunch here and the staff are very friendly, service was impeccable!! My mum has many food requests and the staff (Penny, Doris and Yvonne) were very accomodating to them. Penny was especially patient in suggesting different menu changes and making sure nothing was amiss during our meal. The lunch set menu was also pretty worth the price. Paid a bit more for the lobster but it was really fresh and tasted amazing with the sauce!\n\nFine dining time, and we love it. It's the most beautiful Chinese restaurant in Singapore. We have a great experience with the selection dishes that offer from Chef. It is kind of spicy but good to go.\n",

In fact most of the dishes portion is relatively small for that price range.\n\nService experience is also under expectation. We sat at a place with a blind spot and the service staff are not attentive to our request. I have to walk to the counter for help. Suggest to provide some electronic buzzing system if the restaurant has under staff to serve the customer.\n\nCame across this place via Google search.\nSuppose to come here for DimSum. But only available in the afternoon.\nBut we still decided to stay for dinner.\n\nFood is not bad, very well presented. Taste is pretty ok especially the chicken and the laksa prawn.\n\nBut when comes to the service by the restaurant staff, I gotta give them a lower rating. It certainly under expectations.\n\nFirstly, they are not welcoming at all when we were at the counter waiting to be seated.\n\nSecondly, the waiter is not attentive. They have no smile at all (which is important in service line).\nWhen we request for tea or request him to add hot water, he just came and grab the teapot and go off with super monotonous attitude. When we say thank you, the staff don't even response at all (basically like a robot).\n\nTherefore, I don't think we will come back again. The food is ok but definitely not the best compare to the same level restaurant elsewhere. Also the service staff and their attitude didn't impress us despite the restaurant is not busy at all (only 3 tables including our table).\n\nCame for lunch, excellent staff service and quality food. Recommend to come \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\n\nThe food and atmosphere was good but one of the staff had a really bad attitude and kept showing us black face.

The rice is fluffy and well cooked.. almost like fried rice with individual grains.. and the mutton curry is succulent and soft to the bite, with very deep indian smell and taste to the curry sauce. Worth all the $5.50 paid for it\n\nCheap and nice crab promotion. $38.80 for 3 crab with any flavour really worth the price. But Asam fish taste not that fresh and some vege got bitter and sour taste like not that fresh. However, it is still worth going if promotion still valid.\n\nNow there is promotion on for new zichar restaurant. (1) One whole fish for only S$18. (2) Indian curry chicken $4.50, if add egg and vegetable, it becomes a set at S$5.\n\nOnline but no response for whole day, after saying can order we placed order and pickup time. We already on the way to pickup since there was no response, after spam call for few times 6pm+ pickup call say crabs smelly not selling say order cancelled.\n\nOrder since 11am confirmed already, no responses no reply. Best part, WhatsApp was ONLINE ALL THE TIME. Absolutely disgusting service, no apologies aftermath and not remorseful through phone convo. NOT RECOMMENDED!!!\n\nI went to the place on a Saturday at 615pm. There was only one other table of diners then. The place got really crowded after 7pm. There was only one waiter serving everyone so service is kinda slow. Food is on the saltier side but still very delicious. Strongly recommend their black pepper crab. Affordable and tasty.\n",

I highly recommend the mussels as I single handedly polished the entire bowl. Great buzzing atmosphere too for a Friday night!\n\nExtremely friendly staff and good service. Grilled Cod Fish is a must try, suoer tasty, juicy and fresh!\nMango mustard salad taste weird to me (maybe just I don't like it) but overall its a good experience!\n\nHave been to Coriander Leaf a few times and most recently again with my husband. Food was great, in fact even better than we remembered! We ordered the duck curry, the garlic naan (best naan we ever had), miso cod and spicy eggplant, and ended with the spiced lava cake. We had a delightful meal, and highly recommend the combination of the red curry and the garlic naan, it's a flavour explosion! We will be back :)\n\nOverall, it was a good experience. Some food like the lamb was very good, but the stingray was not fresh. Naan was very good,served hot, and freshly made. Each serving per dish was small, good for 2 pax. Wide varieties of asian food to select from.\n\nFood was very unique with the set lunch choices of South Asian, Chinese, Thai & Persian. I chose the South Asian and the naan was beautifully prepared, fluffy on the inside and crispy at the sides. Staff were very helpful & friendly and the ambiance was perfect!\n",

The fried udon was also quite good although I wished that the portion would be slightly bigger.\n\nFood quality, taste and value, this place is on par with the best in their class. A good team of staff provides decent service. Noodles, fried rice are nicely done. Only thing is tables are so small that plates are falling off if one is not careful.\n\nthe suan la lamian is the only dish i eat here. it\u2019s one of the better ones, imo even better than DTF. can\u2019t really say much about the other dishes as i haven\u2019t tried but all in all a solid bowl.\n\nWent for a quick lunch. Food was served in less that 5 minutes. Quality is decent for the price. The chicken is the highlight of all the dishes we ordered as the meat was juicy and tasty. Overall, it's a good place to bring visiting friends/colleagues for some Asian style food. Service crew are polite and attentive even on a busy lunch (which is a plus).\n\nFoodibear gives Chopsticks by the Asian Kitchen a decent 4/5.\n\nAvoid lunchtime crowd. The queue can take 45mins. Tofu is very soft and fine. The skin of the wo-dia (rd pic) was thick and rubbery. I personally dont like it.  The fried chicken dish was all meat. Would prefer some bony parts.\n",

We had to keep turning on our Hp flash light. Service & Atmosphere is very good. Staffs are friendly & restaurant decorations are retro vibes & pretty. Even the utensil they used are pretty. Food portions are small so it\u2019s actually quite expensive. Taste is unique & not bad but I don\u2019t really think it\u2019s fantastic till it\u2019s worth the pricing. We paid over $300+. We had a Yakult cocktail @ $48 for 3 pax, coconut lime mocktail & ice dirty chai latte (couldn\u2019t taste the chai taste) at $10 each.\n\nLobster kueh pie tee taste good. Ugly broccolini is deep fried till very crispy, not to my liking.. Crab fried rice is tasty as it\u2019s fried with XO sauce. Crispy Squid is not bad but the wilted kale is deep fried also so it\u2019s crispy too. It doesn\u2019t taste like veggies. Crispy crab omelette with the Singapore chilli dip had a tinge of Assam taste. Truffle roast duck is good, skin is crispy. But truffle smell & taste is not obvious enough. Crispy tofu is small portioned, it goes well with the Salty black pepper sauce.\n\nLastly is the xinjiang style Lamb ribs. We were suggested to order 2 portions since we had 5 person..  For 1 of the plate, whole ribs is totally fats & no meat. Every bite I took i thought I will at least ate the meat part but too bad it\u2019s totally fats. End up i felt so nauseous & my stomach rumbles so badly that i threw up when I reaches home. It\u2019s is the smell of the Lamb ribs \ud83d\ude22\u2026\n\nKind of anticipated the meal here so was a little disappointed.. Also understand why it\u2019s mostly foreigners since it might felt like fushion Tze char. But I really appreciate their good service.\n\nGreat place to catch with friends over delicious food and drinks.\n\nThe menu never fails to impress with the Asian twists. Huge variety of drinks as well.\n\nGreat team to provide a great experience here, and always a fabulous visit.\n\nFor 6 pax, we had the crispy crab omelette, truffle roast duck, spicy brussel sprouts, wok-fried wagyu hor fun, XYT hokkien mee, kurobuta char siew. The food was surprisingly good! My personal favourites were the truffle duck and brussel sprouts.\n\nOverall a cosy and interesting bar to dine and chill with friends!\n\nHands down one of my top 3 places in Singapore.\nThe style of the place is so laid back and the staff is very nice.\n\nDrinks and food are out of this world and of outstanding quality.\n\nCome here, have a good time and drink a Soju Bomb!\n\nCosy little restaurant with a nostalgic atmosphere with good food. The kurobuta char siew was fatty and yummy. The fried chicken wings were not bad and the duck was good too but not much truffle taste.\n\nThey also have a good selection of cocktails and we had fun with the menu and drink selection.\n",

                  "reviews": "\n\nSince opening in The St. Regis Singapore hotel in December 2007, Yan Ting restaurant has been a stalwart of the Chinese Cantonese fine dining scene, the epitome of extravagance and luxury. These days, there are plenty of Chinese fine dining restaurants around, but Yan Ting has certainly stepped up their game, remaining a premium dining destination of choice, serving well-executed and refined gastronomic delights on each plate.\n.\nAmbience at Yan Ting is opulent. The grandeur of the interior exudes a classy elegance, without being too over the top. The tastefully arranged layout is suitable for business or private dining, and the decor enhances the overall ambience without being too loud. I also like the bright ambient lighting, which isn't too harsh or dim. The pearl marble floors and plush furnishings feel sophisticated and comfortable.\n.\nService at Yan Ting restaurant is professional, discreet, and polite. Staff may not make much conversation, but they are attentive and observant. The accord each table good attention, answering queries, fulfilling requests, serving orders, and proactively clearing finished plates with finesse. Communication in English or Chinese Mandarin is decent. Felt very well treated here.\n.\nFood at Yan Ting follows the Chinese Cantonese philosophy of freshness of ingredients, little usage of herbs, and well balanced dishes that are naturally flavourful but not greasy. Yan Ting restaurant prepares classic Chinese Cantonese dishes according to time-honoured recipes, but presents them in beautiful contemporary style.\n.\nPortions are sized for individuals, but dishes are best shared. Prices are high. Prepare to splurge, budget about SGD $245 per person for a meal here.\n\nFood was great and yummy! We ordered their signature set menu and enjoyed it. All the dishes were on point, not too salty and oily. Overall we enjoyed and will come back for their dim sum!\n\nVisited Yan Ting to celebrate a birthday, but was left disappointed by the standard of service. Food was decent, but nothing to shout about.\n\nWe were seated at around 6.15pm, and ordered 4 set meals and half a Peking duck within 5 minutes. We waited for almost half an hour for the appetiser to be served, and similarly waited for approximately half an hour for the following courses. At 8.30pm, we had not yet been served our main courses, and decided to get the main courses to go and to get dessert served instead.\n\nAs for the Peking duck, we were served the Peking duck pancakes shortly after our appetiser. We opted for the second serving to be served as chopped duck, which I assume would have been sliced together with the first serving. However, we yet again had to wait another half an hour for the meat to be served, which meant that it was cold by then.\n\nWhat disappointed us the most was the level of service provided by one particular staff, Steven. While serving the dishes, it felt that he was simply dropping or tossing our plates onto the table. What shocked us the most was when he presented the bill, he seemed to throw the bill onto the table, pointing at the line for the signature without saying anything! When we asked if there was any way to give feedback, he said that there was none other than leaving our feedback online.\n\nTo Yan Ting\u2019s credit, the managers Bruce and Fiona did try their best to offer service recovery as we were leaving and apologised on behalf of their server.\n\nFor the price point that Yan Ting is charging, we would have expected better trained staff, as well as better serving processes. Overall, not an experience we would expect from a highly rated restaurant and not a restaurant we would likely visit again.\n\nWe were here on our vegetarian routine day. Even though they don\u2019t have many selections of the vegetarian dishes. You can ask them for the off menu. They will customise for you. We ordered hot and sour soup, truffle tofu, Gongbao vegetarian chicken, fried mushrooms Mien, and stir fried vegetables. Every dishes were tasty. However you might need to wait for up to 30-45 mins to serve your food.\n\nWe were hosted to lunch here, and the place was packed at 12 noon, so much so that reservations are a must.  One negative is that the place was too loud, with so many people talking, that I ended up with a headache.  Having a normal-level conversation was quite difficult.\n\nService was quite warm and quick, and the waitstaff were always quick to top up our teas.\n\nThe food was generally of a high standard, though some meat dishes were rather tough.  The pork jowl done charsiu style was tasty, but some pieces were tough to bite through or chew.  Similarly, not all pieces of the stir fried beef, which was delish, were soft.\n\nThe xiqolong bao was nce, but the standout dish for me was the siew mai. We ordered desserts of sago with mango , and quilingao, both of which made for a sweet ending to the meal.\n",

It is an indulgence for the senses and a culinary journey that will leave a lasting impression.\n\nService is good there, the 6 courses meal will get 5 stars if not because of the lobster with crispy rice noodle dish. While the lobster is fresh and the texture good, the noodle spoilt the dish with the fried noodle taste like rancid oil, disappointed. Other than this dish, all other dishes are up to standard. Recommended the Man fu yuan appetizer.\n\nCelebrating my daughter birthday Food was awesome. Was serve by a very friendly and attentive staff named Maggie Yong. She was so attentive in her details and ensuring the celebration of my daughter birthday a success one\n",

                  "reviews": "\n\nHeard about this establishment from friends who lived near Mandarin Gardens, decided to order out on a Saturday afternoon. It was pretty quiet on a Saturday post-lunch afternoon, and I was attended to promptly.\n\nThe staff who took my order was conscientious and meticulous. She made sure to present the signature dishes as well as repeated my orders to confirm them. She was also helpful in making sure that I could come back after the food is prepared as I had to run a short errand around the area.\n\nI ordered the small portions of the following: Jing Du pork, tofu with chicken floss, butter squid. The olive rice was available in a standard size.\n\nThe family was not impressed with the food, the pork had a sweet vinegary flavour and was quite tough, the tofu with chicken floss was decent, but nothing to rave about. The butter squid was quite mushy, perhaps it was better to have it on-site? The olive rice had wok hei but barely any other flavours.\n\nWas quite disappointed, perhaps due to the hype from the previous reviews. Probably won't be heading back for the food, despite the excellent service. Will also be sharing my disappointment with my friends at Mandarin Gardens.\n\nGood service from the restaurant staff. I liked the foods here especially the olive fried rice, \u4eac\u90fd\u6392\u9aa8 and butter squid. The food quality is great and consistent. I dined in during lunch time and really enjoyed the quiet atmosphere here with great food.\n\nWe dropped by on a Wednesday and got the Butter Squid at 50% off. Also tried the Jing Du Pork and Fried Hong Kong Noodles, all of which were yummy. Ambience was quiet and peaceful, service staff was attentive.\n\nWill be back here again!\n\nI had a great experience at Thaipan on 24 Mar 2023. I went there for my ROM lunch and it was superb! The food was really yummy and the service was good. The staff were very polite and both my families were very pleased with the food presentation and taste! Their yam ring and fried salted egg prawn ball along with their fish were all cooked excellently! When I reserved the place and informed that it was for my ROM lunch, they specifically bought fresh flowers for the table. I would recommend this place as the price point is good too! (Attached photos of yam ring and cereal chicken)\n\nDidn't come back to this restaurant for 8 years. Decided to try their new location at turf city. Food standard dropped a bit compared to last time. But the service is impeccable and also a good deal for the happy hour. Will try the other dishes next time.\n",

Hmm can\u2019t say for sure.\nThe food was undeniable good though\n\nFresh ingredients, taste of the original ingredients, simply steam the fresh crab with soya sauce, this require very fresh crab, and the soya sauce enhanced the taste.\n\nAnother dish I like was their yong tou fu, they make their own Toufu.\nIt was tender and the minced meat were well blend in their toufu.\n\nThe food here is excellent, very high quality and flavor is authentic and tasty. The peking duck is really good and the pancakes they used are really unique and delicious. Service is also very good even when busy. The restaurant ambience is very nice and is a great place for many occasions whether entertaining guests or celebrating family events\n\nOver the years, the food standard has dropped IMO as they were really good in their initial few years back in 2011 when the Island new clubhouse was completed. Nevertheless, we still patronize them as the savings on the 10% service charge as member helps to defray the costs of the meal. In addition, the roast duck is nicely done - crispy skin and juicy meat on the inside. As a member's club, the service level from the wait staff is acceptable.\n\nGreat place for a sit down family dinner. The service is good and food is yummy! Request for the table with the view - the sunset over the golf course was simply breathtaking!\n",

The table setup provided a sense of privacy for our group, making the dining experience even more enjoyable\n\nCame here for birthday dinner and had the Daffodil dinner set which should be popular since many other patrons ordered the same.\n\nWould give 6/5 if we could. Food is fantastic. Service is attentive. Ambience is romantic. Price is value for money given the quality of the dishes. All worth it to put up credit card authorisation for the reservation ahead of time.\n\nLooking forward to coming back again next time.\n\nEating area is dim, and stiff\n\nService and serving of food was shockingly slow in which a multiple dishes had to be checked multiple times & server could not give adequate response or update, shirking responsibility to kitchen. Dish orders were missing/forgotten.\n\nIt was overall very frustrating and really tested patience when both trying to consistently check and lunch time was unneceasarily extended.\nIt was also difficult to get attention of server\n\nIf you do not know how to speak Chinese, do avoid this place as likely to struggle communicating to server\n\nFood only looks pretty but you can take it as a given that all the main cooked big dishes will have a lot of oil & salt.. best to make special request to exclude\n\nDefinitely not worth the $70++ per head when food, service, waiting time was ridiculous.\n\nDo get better tasting dim sum or chinese food elsewhere & for cheaper\n\nWe went for the weekday dim sum lunch buffet because they are going to discontinue buffet soon! Love the quiet atmosphere and service was good.\nMost dishes are delicious. Buddha jump over the wall is a must try soup - rich and tasty. I like the truffles charsiew bao and crispy wanton - unique. The porridge was disappointing and bland. Roast duck is so so. But we really enjoyed the desserts!\n\nHeard so much about Hai Tien Lo restaurant. Went there for dinner. Fine dining Chinese restaurant to be exact. We ordered the set dinner and we were surprised by each dish. Beautifully displayed in an artistic manner. Each bite of the dish bursting with different tastes and senses to the tongue. Each dish was painstakingly prepared and you could taste the real flavour of the ingredients. No flavour enhancer, natural, genuine taste from the combined ingredients brought out from the chef\u2019s skillful cooking. Check out the photos of the dishes I had.                                     The smoked fried chicken was excellent! You can smell the faint smell of smokiness. The skin so thoroughly fried and wafer thin, dipped into the special sauce, sour, sweet and a hint of spiciness, so freshing, a brilliant combination that brought out a whole new experience to my taste buds and senses. Other dishes were equally surprising and excites my taste and senses. Service was attentive and polite. I will make it a point to come again when the menu changes. I want to be surprised, I want my taste and sense to be excited!\n",

There is not much of service to expect from and they don't have service charge anyway.\n\nA cosy place to get your korean quick fix within the Bugis area.\n\nSpeedy allocation of seats. Efficient ordering system and wide variety of payment options available. Food ordered came reasonably quickly. \ud83d\udc4f\n\nThe quality and pricing of food is good, reasonable and affordable. \ud83d\udc4d\n\nOverall, a pleasant experience. I will visit again to try the other dishes. \ud83e\udd29\n\nThe Korean food is very authentic. We tried the Pork Deopbab, Tofu Soup Chicken & Kimchi Soup Pork. They exceeded our expectations and were full of ingredients. Prices are decent for Korean food. We tried a grapes bongbong drink even though it was good but it was too pricey (3 SGD), which could be easily bought cheaper elsewhere. A man (manager?) was really hospitable, gave us a table inside another area as we didn\u2019t want to seat down outside and also recommended us some must try dishes.\n\nFriendly Ajumma kindly presented the menu to my friend and I. Also, even offer to give us an extra chair to put our bags! Kamsahamnida \ud83d\ude46\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc96\n\nWent to order tofu stew with beef (SGD$11.70) and spicy cheese beef (SGD$16.50)\n\nHonestly speaking, their tofu stew is not so spicy and soup wasn't that thick \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb Beef is flavourful and soft to chew on it. Very easy to finish the whole soup by pouring the leftover rice into it which makes it very palatable as a soup porridge \ud83e\udd23\n\nDefinitely good for days that you have no mood to eat or not feeling well \ud83d\ude0a\n\n*Prices indicated include side dishes and a bowl of rice (P.S: The egg roll is a bit cold when served hopefully they can improve on it \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb)\n\nWill update if I tried any new dishes from the small eatery!\n\nBeen coming here since 2019 pre covid, decently priced korean food, with the ajjuma cooking the food. The go to food for me js the the grilled pork, kimchi pancake and kimchi jigge. Will def order this few when I am here.\n",

The taro dumplings and the beef meat balls stood out, but seriously, everything was delicious!\n\nHad a good experience dining here recently with my partner. The rich and cozy ambience, coupled with the food and service made our night. The jasmine tea pork ribs, four treasure soup and lobster noodles really stand out and I'd highly recommend them. Apart from that the service was on point, 10/10. Overall we had a great time dining, and the effort in each dish we had stood out. Nicely done!\n\nMy first time here, an amazing experience! From the ambience and decor being quite eye opening (read: unconventional for a Chinese restaurant), to the quality and taste of the food, it was excellent (albeit pricey - but you get what you pay for). Special mention to service staff Wilson, who was very attentive and friendly! Made the experience even better. Thank you, and I'd be happy to be back.\n\nGood vibe and tasty Cantonese food. The ala carte buffet menu has a good spread, from dim sum to staple and fusion dishes. Dished high recommended- striploin, Mayo wasabi prawn, salted egg fish, black steamed fish, lobster vermicelli and chilli crab bun.\n\nThe service was great, and it was a nice personal touch for staff to give a cake on house and sing a birthday song together. Thank you Adela for the wonderful service.\n\nNot impressed by the dishes. With the chef changed. Something didn\u2019t seem right with their dishes.\nSpicy Soft shelled crab was the worst i had in my life. The crab was over-fried. Very bitter burnt after taste from the crab. It tasted like oily bug taste. And yes I\u2019ve tasted bugs such as grasshoppers, silkworm.\nClaypot chicken was not cooked long enough. As such, the chicken was rather bland. Bbq pork puff was too sweet to my liking.\nAnyway, overall dishes were ok but not worth making the trip for it.\n",

It was still nice when I ate it cold at night.\nCelebrated my elder relative\u2019s birthday and the service and food is appreciated by all of us. As for the food, see my captions for must order Dim Sum. Will definitely come again to try other Dim sum we missed this trip. Currently there is free Peking duck (half) for orders above $98. Worth it.\n\nWe had a wonderful experience as I brought my wifey for her birthday dinner with close friends. The food was to us wonderful and to our liking. They gave a nice surprise for the birthday gal.. it will be out go to restaurant for Cantonese food. Next will try the dim sum\u2026\n\n14 May 2023: Awesome food with\u00a0great taste and at reasonable prices. They also served nice dim sum and if you need privacy; 4 private rooms are available for booking. Staff were friendly and Imperial Grand\u00a0Cantonese Cuisine\u00a0is a hidden gem in Sam Leong road...will return for more delicious choices\n\nCame here on a weekday for birthday celebration. The manager promptly made a surprise birthday free dessert.\nFood is good cantonese cuisine with wok hei especially the xo fried carrots and crab meat bee hoon.\nWill come back again for other dishes and dim sum.\nThey have private rooms too.\n\nNice rectro place with good dim sum! I was recommended by a friend and went to try today! Here's what we ordered:\n1) HongKong congee (5*) - smooth texture!!\n2) Egg tart (5*) - not cakey and pretty soft!!\n3) Fried carrot cake(4*)\n4) fried prawn fritters (3.5*) - a tad oily!\n5) Hong Kong milk tea (4*)\n6) Yuan yang (5*)\n7) Siew Mai (5*) - moist and juicy!!\n8) Appetiser (5*) - garlic and vinegar with fungus\n\nImho, the service is impeccable and the lady boss and server came and check with us a few times. It was obvious they have pride in their work and food! The lady boss asked if the tea was sufficient for HK milk tea and she will give me another brew if it isn't. You don't get such good service in FnB nowadays esp in malls. They also have some singing on Mondays and Tues nights and the male server even suggested the seats we can have for best experience! Haha mayb he is the real \u8001\u95c6 :)\n\nIt is a delight to find such good service in a rectro place! Do drop by if you are in the hood. Dessert was on the house too!! Wow. We did not drive there but took MRT. Nearest would be either Jalan Besar station(downtown line) or Farrer Station(NEL). Anyway we walked from Rochor station and it was still v do-able.\n",

Alex and Kim were friendly and was impeccable in their service. Food was amazing with unique combinations of fresh ingredients. Chef also came over to each table to interact which we felt was an awesome touch. Strongly recommended!\n\nWell deserved Michelin Restaurants.\nThe bread is so crispy on the outside and so so so soft on the inside. Pairing with the bordier butter, it is really exceptional.\nEvery dish of the food is amazing.\n\nThe service is so good. When the table is full of crumbs, the waiter will clean it up to sweep away the crumbs. The waiter are also friendly and knowledgeable about the dishes.\nWhen we found a bone in the fish and the chef came out to apologize. Felt the service was so good.\n\nThe atmosphere in the round room felt great too.\n\nOne of the best fine dining places I\u2019ve ever been to! I can\u2019t keep track of what was being served because there was just so many different courses, but each course was really tasty \ud83e\udd70 I don\u2019t think I\u2019m a small eater but I was so full by the last few courses, I don\u2019t think I ate any at all. Remember to pace yourself. I\u2019m most impressed by their bakes; their toasty black sesame bread was literally the best bread I\u2019ve ever had in my life.\n\nWhite Grass is a hidden gem, providing a distinctive dining venture with its fusion of Japanese and European flavors.\n\nEach dish is delectable, especially the bread, pastries, and desserts rank the finest that I ever tasted.\n\nThe real flower centerpiece adds a pleasant fragrance, and the stylish decor contributes to the overall charm, making it an excellent option for couples and hosting friends.\n\nOn my second visit, I can confidently say they consistently exceed my expectations.\n\nVery good ambience and attentive service. The bread is crispy outside and moist inside. Sesame bread is delicious too. Abalone is well done combined with the sauce and texture. The lobster meat is too soft for our liking. Everything is fine but no distinctive wow factor.\n",

We ordered the 2 course lunch with an add on of extra serving of potato bread & steak.\n\nWe enjoyed the potato bread that we ordered a extra serving. The steak was also yummy and cooked to medium rare. The steak came with oyster mushroom was also cooked to perfection. Special shout-out to to the beef tartare(lovely presentation!)& pork steak(burst of flavour!!)!\n\nThe duck breast was slightly too rare for our liking.\n\nThe service was lovely and friendly and they also surprised me with a apple tart for my birthday.\n\nA lovely place where we spent our anniversary lunch. Food was YUM. A mix of different cuisines rolled into something I'd call contemporary European. Presentation of dishes was spectacular with the beef tartar showcased in a delightfully unusual way!\n\nThis is a five-star experience all the way - Alma has a Michelin star in the guide that just came out for Singapore, and deservedly so. They were happy to accommodate vegetarian food for the prix fixe menu, which is great value. The signature tofu with black truffle was sublime, as were the Japanese tomatoes with tomato sorbet. The amuse bouche of tomato with a sour plum film was another delight.\n\nIt's a nice space too, with a beautifully designed interior and a superb selection of wines and in particular rare whiskies.\n\nThis one's going on our repeat visit list for sure!\n\nA lovely fine dining restaurant with great service and friendly people. Food was very unique and tasteful. Looks like they have many years of being a 1-star Michelin restaurant. Well deserved!\n",

Air- conditioning is way too cold and freezes everyone. Any warm dish turns cold too quickly. Dessert was also a star and did not let down the entire course of dinner. Felt the staff could have been more confident in introducing each course.\n\nCame here to celebrate our anniversary, a surprise dinner planned by my husband for us. The restaurant is intimate with only a few tables available, so you get undivided attention from the staff. It is also an open kitchen concept which I love so you can see the chefs hard at working preparing their masterpieces for us. I enjoyed pretty much every single dish, the abalone wellington was definitely unique and one of a kind. Overall had a really good experience here.\n\nOne - starred Michelin restaurant located within Voco Hotel (previously known as Hilton Orchard), serving Modern-Contemporary cuisine,established by Restaurateur-Sommelier Ignatius Chan in 2004. There is heavy influence of japanese ingredients used in the menu and served in the European way. Opt for the menu with two main courses for a wholesome dining experience. Food presentation is beautiful and tastefully presented, and what's good to look at is also good to eat.\n\nHad our belated anniversary lunch at Iggy\u2019s as we were having a staycation at Hilton. A lovely resturant with friendly and helpful crew. Love the fact that we are able to view how the chef and his team prepared our meals to the kitchen.\n\nAs the husband and I do not take raw fish, the chef was able to customize to our taste by searing the fish, love how the raw yolk enhances the overall taste of the dish. They did an interesting take on the sponge gourd which brought the vegetable to another level. The linguine was average. The roast beef has charred edges which was a nice touch. Overall we enjoyed the 5 course meal at $150++ per pax.\n\nCame here for lunch with 2 overseas guests who would like to taste a Michelin restaurant.  Decided to bring them to Iggy's as the restaurant has been one that has been keeping their reputation for years. Food was great as you can see in pictures.. perhaps ..some touch up to the interior may make the place feel warm and friendly.\nDamage : $200 (lunch)/pax\n",

We love the ambience that the rotating restaurant has to offer. I must say the view of Marina Bay Sands is stunning. A great place for celebrations. We went there for birthday celebration and they gave us a free birthday cake. The staff were so attentive and took so many nice candid pictures for us. We really enjoyed ourselves dining at Tong Le Private Dining. Thank you!!!!\n\nFood was really good for its price. We had the Colorful Cloud Dinner Set Menu. I will say it started out amazing and plateaued off around the main course. But for its price I am won't be too picky. Service was good, staffs were friendly and professional. The revolving platform gave a 360 view of the city which was a huge plus for me. Atmosphere was quiet when we came early on, but started to get a bit rowdy due to a huge party to our sides despite the closed-off rooms. But overall a pretty decent visit. Will recommend!\n\nI had the pleasure of indulging in an exquisite dining experience at T\u00f3ng L\u00e8 Private Dining, and I can confidently say it was an absolute delight for all the senses. The first thing that captivated me upon entering here was the stunning view. The restaurant's unique concept of a rotating dining room allowed me to indulge in a 360-degree panorama of the cityscape, adding a sense of wonder and spectacle to the already exquisite dining affair. The menu was a testament to the chef's creativity and culinary expertise. Each dish was a harmonious blend of flavours, beautifully presented and bursting with vibrant colours and textures. I must also mention the impeccable timing of the service. Each course was served with precision, allowing us to savor every bite without feeling rushed. The staff's attention to detail and their commitment to providing exceptional service truly enhanced the entire dining affair. Overall, my dining experience at here was an unforgettable journey of culinary delight and I cannot wait to return to experience their wonders once again :)\n\nMost rotating restaurants live off the gimmick of being exactly that - a rotating restaurant offering a 360 degree view of a location. Many times, the food in such restaurants isn\u2019t a priority, but the experience is. This restaurant, however, serves excellent food and offers a great view of Marina Bay Sands and the fountain and light show in front of the mall, as well as a nice view of parts of the Singapore skyline. The rotation is very slow and it take about two hours to do a full 360 revolution. If you are unlucky, you will be at the opposite side of the fountain show both times it occurs. For a period of the 360 tour you are very close to an office building - so close that you can see the monitors of the people working in the building.\n\nThe seating arrangement is varied, from two/four person tables, to separate dining rooms for larger groups. The restaurant has a very good bar which has a great selection of cocktails and spirits. The restaurant is quiet which makes it easy to have a business conversation, if that\u2018s why you are there.\n\nThe restaurant offers a seven-course menu which is perfectly timed for a two-hour dining experience. The wine menu is very extensive and there is a sommelier that can provide advice if you require so. The menu was extremely well thought-through and the various dishes were perfectly combined to provide a first-class dining experience.\n\nThe staff is very attentive and friendly, and made us feel welcome from the minute we set foot in the restaurant.\n\nWe would come to this restaurant again, and in particular for the dining experience. We were positively surprised by every course.\n\nLocation: 5/5 (in the financial district opposite Marina Bay Mall)\nAmbience: 4/5\nMenu: 5/5 (albeit a fixed menu)\nFood: 5/5\nDrinks/wine selection: 5/5\nStaff: 5/5\nPrice/quality: 4/5 (pricey but very high quality)\n\nQuality of food matches the price. The family all agreed it was a perfect place for a family celebration. The service was immaculate and staff very attentive to details. We didn't mention it was a BD celebration but when we clinked our wine glasses, they must have overheard us saying Happy BD, and they surprised us with longevity buns. They also understand Chinese etiquette well as our son discreetly wanted to foot the bill, but the attending staff came quietly to check with my husband who was the host if they should accept my son's card. That's so thoughtful as in Chinese custom the host foots the bill and they respected that.\n",

The ambiance felt like a page out of a Parisian romance novel, with soft lights and a melody of enchanting tunes. The menu, a poetic composition of flavors, offered a dance of taste that left me in awe. The waitstaff, dressed in elegant attire, choreographed a dining experience that was nothing short of a culinary ballet. Each dish, a masterpiece plated with precision, tasted like a symphony of harmonious ingredients. If you're yearning for a dining escapade that feels like a rendezvous with gourmet dreams, Les Amis is the destination to indulge your palate in a poetic feast!\n\nOrdered the dark chocolate cake and it was so delicious! The cake is placed on top of a tart shell which is very special. Almonds are super fragrant too.\nHope that delivery service can be included in the future and handwriting on the chocolate could be better \ud83d\ude05\n\nHad a very pleasant dining experience at Les Amis. Patrick, our server, was very friendly, attentive, and entertaining. He suggested a perfect wine to have with the steak. He also patiently explained every dish to us. The amuse bouche tartalette with bacon and mushrooms was a good introduction to the meal. Notable food from our dinner are the French egg, crab souffl\u00e9, simmered celery root, salted brioche, herb sorbet, and poached pears. The caviar that was thoughtfully used in some of the dishes is an interesting addition of a complex salt flavor; it did not overwhelm the taste of the other ingredients. The wagyu was tender but I expected a bit more flavor and it lacked a bit of surprise. The herb sorbet is most interestingly a refreshing palate cleanser. Overall, it was a memorable and pleasant gastronomic experience.\n\nTruly Michelin 3 stars! Excellent food with great creativity,  best service, excellent wine pairing, and the deserts are the best.  Not cheap but it is worth it!\n\nEverything was impeccable, the food was great and the portions were generous, great wine pairings and amazing service.\nToni and the team were very kind and took genuine care of us.\nThe Blu Lobster appetizer, their sour dough, the riz de veu and the cheese course were divine.\nHighly recommended.\n",

Would highly recommend getting the seven course menu as there were so many more elements in our dinner incorporated that made it all the more special. Flavours were all very well balanced and overall we left feeling very satisfied.\n\nVisited in Sep 2023\n\nBraci was on my list of restaurants to visit for over 4 years and I must say that it was worth the wait. It is no surprise that Braci has retained its Michelin 1 star for 6 consecutive years. The menu was a progressive one which is definitely inspired by Chef Mattie\u2019s Italian roots. There are 2 choices for people (5 course and 7 course). I would suggest people to go for the 7 course as the additional dishes in the 7 course meal are worth it. One of my favourite parts of the experience was trying out the 100 yr old balsamic vinegar.\n\nIf you\u2019re not taking the wine pairing, I would strongly recommend folks to try out a few of their cocktails, esp. their Negroni (one of the most unique ones I\u2019ve had)\n\nService was good. The restaurant is able to cater to some food allergies (like my shellfish allergy).\n\nA definite recommendation for fine dining lovers.\n\nLocation was not to my liking.\nGreat staff very welcoming and accomodating to our strict dietary restrictions.\nThey had to make a menu from scratch for us which gives them bonus points.\nFood quality was amazing and the ingredients exquisite.\nHowever, the taste of the food was confusing and frankly bland at times.\nBut i cannot judge the restaurant fairly as i did not try the actual menu items.\n\nAmazing time at Braci for a birthday celebration for my husband. The Italian food was superb with beautiful floral aesthetic to each dishes. Staff is polite and friendly too! Special thanks to Chef Matteo who is very engaging and make the day extra special! Love the black truffle \"hide and seek\" dish which is one of the highlights of all dishes! It so savoury and unforgettable\u2026.\n\nnice food nice atmosphere. i tot the service could be more positive. but i still enjoy the experience especially on a chill night in the rooftop. overall quite an expensive experience but they were very nice to add an additional anniversary dessert for us:)\n",

Food was good - subtle flavours that meshed really well together, and beautiful presentation. The lamb in particular was executed perfectly. I also loved the mignardises and that the kitchen was open but calm and not chaotic.\n\nHere for birthday lunch, cosy setting but nothing much to shout about for the interior. Had the lunch menu, food is good but nothing really outstanding that I can remember. Hmm maybe Cherry Gazpacho is quite special. Perhaps its a normal lunch menu, maybe should come back again for special collaborations when they have one.\n\nSome changes to the menu itself. Menu is very refreshing, akin like the Spring season. As always, hostess & chef hospitality are the best. To us, their food, restaurant atmosphere, relationships between staffs & us are what made us being their regulars.\n\nA very nice ambiance intimate dining room that caters to about 6 pax capacity and some counter seats for perhaps, Omakase? Set menus are definitely French and heavy on seafood.\n\nThe service was nicely paced, dishes was explained, and professional. Their wine recommendation was good as well.\n\nThe presentation of each dish is where the star is. The taste is ok, balanced.\n\nRecommended for date night, probably not the best suit for big  groups or business dinner unless you reserve private room.\n\nWe booked the restaurant to celebrate our 25th year wedding anniversary.\nWe took the $268 set dinner and added on foie gras ($20) for one of our dinner set, and changed one of the dessert to cheese truffle.\nAll the dishes are wonderfully made, and even the bread basket (uniquely in a cloth pouch) is warm and hot, with specially made bread spread.\nThe service is amazing and special mentioned to Louis who has made our experience really enjoyable.\nWe also had Yamanaka-san who personally served us for one of the dishes.\nThe downside for the place is that it is a small restaurant and seatings are quite closed to one another. It's no issue for us and we mingled with other patrons.\nHighly recommended.\n",

We did find ourselves waiting a considerable amount of time to place our order.\n\nThe restaurant offers a unique amenity: photo-taking services with free prints. However, we encountered a slight hiccup when our photo wasn't promptly printed. A bit of a delay ensued before we finally received our printed photo.\n\nOpting for the anniversary 4-course meal set, which comprised a starter, appetizer, main, dessert, and beverage, we were treated to a mix of flavors. The standout was undoubtedly the signature prime rib, a delectable dish that is an absolute must-try. On the other hand, the braised beef rib fell slightly short of expectations, with the sauce impressing more than the somewhat dry meat.\n\nWe indulged in the chocolate cake and strawberry trifle for dessert. While the chocolate cake delighted our taste buds, the strawberry flavor of the trifle didn't quite resonate with our preferences.\n\nAdding to the thoughtful experience, complimentary drinking water was a nice touch, as was the complimentary cake for those celebrating birthdays.\n\nGreat ambience, great service.\n\nOnly issue is the tenderloin which is too dry. Love their prime steak which is carved for us directly, and love the lobster tail. Salad that comes with each beef dish is magnificently tossed! The pudding is great too\n\nUsed the Amex love card and got 35% off for 3\nPax, if not the price can be rather hefty.\n\nI would say the experience in Lawry\u2019s is the best-ever service I have in Singapore. No matter before, during or after the wedding private function, they are keeping their standard very thoughtful, helpful, friendly and even more than I expected. The staff are very considerate and the signature dishes quality are excellent. It is value-for-money to book their restaurant as private function and enjoying the high ceiling with the natural daylight came into the room, which made the event photos came out nicely. Thank you the team who help us out with the background music and the room decoration. We are more than happy to come back again.\n\nLawry's is the epitome of old school.  From the colossal table-side serving carts to the waitress' uniforms, there is nothing at all modern about the experience.  Luckily for Lawry's , they pull it off where others don't.  How?  The decor, while dated, is clean and presentable.  The waitresses look like they belong in a 1950s TV show, but the service is friendly and impeccable.  So this is a case where old school is retro and kind of fun.  The food is decent, not as spectacular as the prices suggest they should be, but decent.  The spinning salad is a trademark and is excellent.  The Yorkshire puddings were just barely average... they definitely needed seasoning. If you are looking for a slab of beef in a throwback setting, and money is not a problem, this is the place for you.\n\nCelebrated my birthday here and I can say, the foods we ordered were nice! Of course we tried their prime rib which is the star of the night! Will recommend!\n",

The beef carpaccio course was also brilliant. The restaurant doesn\u2019t have a non-alcoholic pairing and that\u2019s probably a small area where they can improve their \u2018value proposition\u2019.\n\nService was top notch.\n\nA definite recommendation for a classy dinner experience\n\nWonderful culinary experience from the start till the end. The location and ambiance is welcoming and cosy, the staff is friendly and took great care of us, the food is delicious, high attention to details and wonderful ingredients from all over the globe. The chef is very talented and creative. The sommelier chose some amazing wines and champagne to pair the dishes with. Amazing experience.\n\nA sensational lunch which well exceeds its price point of $178++ per pax. The only criticism would be that the bread course was uninspiring, but who cares? It\u2019s free anyway. Canap\u00e9s started with their signature playful tomato soup. Using trompe l\u2019oeil to make it look like tomatoes it\u2019s actually a soft shell with tomato gazpacho encased within. The scallop tartare with avocado and tomato jelly was wonderfully light with all the elements working in harmony. The cod mousse taco was nice but overshadowed by its two counterparts. The first course started with a bang, yellowtail finished table side with a horseradish snow. Light, refreshing and full of flavour with an added air of theatricality for good measure. The second course was Mozambique langoustine which was the highlight of the menu. Sitting on top of a creamy anchovy sauce. The sweetness of the langoustine was a perfect complement to the (not-too) salty sauce. While the gem lettuce added some crunch to contrast with the soft and plump shellfish. This course was pure delight from start to finish! The pasta course was an elevated carbonara which utilised cured egg yolk. It was not too heavy which was a pleasant surprise. The main was veal with white asparagus coated in sabayon in a moscato sauce. The veal was cooked to perfection and the kitchen, once again, demonstrate their attention to detail by ensuring that each dish consists of an equal balance of flavours and textures. The palate cleanser was finished table side with a prickly pear granita, highly refreshing after two somewhat heavier courses. The dessert was the chef\u2019s take on semifreddo using Marsala grapes, dessert wine sauce and clotted cream. Wonderful and I loved the bitterness of the grapes and wine sauce. Overall a spectacular meal, one of the best michelin-starred lunches one can grab in Singapore that showcases high quality ingredients, inventiveness while also not ripping a gigantic hole in one\u2019s pocket. The setting of the restaurant is intimate and perfect for a date or a more private business meeting. Staff are warm, attentive and knowledgeable (and also take good photos). Definitely worth a visit.\n\nModern Italian restaurant serving interestingly innovative dishes especially the amuse bouches. Wine pairing was generous and well thought out - always a nice way to find new wines if a restaurant gets it right! Service was good. Small but well spaced and clean relaxed ambience.\n\n1st time at their restaurant for dinner. Nice colonial place. Restaurant itself felt inviting. Staffs were all smiling when greeted & warmed when serving food.\n\nFood were great. Wine pairing was generous.\n\nRecommended.\n",

Staff was friendly and attentive, and food was served quickly.\nCan't recommend enough.\n\nGives you a fine dining experience. Nice place with tall ceilings and a posh setup. The furniture was good and comfortable. The menu was decent and the taste was unique. Do try the biryani and restaurant recommended dishes.  Expect to spend $80+ ( with svc chr n gst). Felt a little shorthanded on staff and felt rushed towards the end.\n\nHigh end Indian restaurant in Pan Pacific . Went for lunch the set thali has a lot of variety and has unlimited refills . I would say some of taste could have been better . The service is great the staff friendly and very attentive.\n\nWe were there to celebrate our 21st wedding anniversary.  We ordered from the a la carte menu.  The service staff were very friendly and attentive to our needs and offered to help us in any way they could. What came as a surprise was a complimentary slice of cake from the restaurant to celebrate the occasion. Thank you for making the lunch a special one. Highly recommended!\n\nGood Indian Fine Dine, you can certainly experience the quality ingredients, but we as a family personally felt that the masalas have been severely mellowed down to cater to the masses and hence the drift of authenticity from the dishes.\n\nIndian food is all about spices, flavours and for sure calories. We weren\u2019t disappointed at all, just that some dishes could have beer better :)\n",

The entire set up of the restaurant ensures privacy and the spacing of tables creates a sense of luxury. We enjoyed the service and interactions with the staff who were helpful, Attentive and knowledgeable. The food was playful and creative with a distinct artistic language that embodied a circular motif seen in most if not all dishes. A feast for the eyes as well as the pallet an evening at ART is recommended for those looking for a slow evening in a fast city. The views of MBS are a plus too.\n\nBeen here a few times and the food has been consistently good. It\u2019s my go to place for a fancy lunch with friends / solo lunch. Every dish is absolutely created with so much care and is quite literally, perfect. The pastas here have been on point as well.\n\nThe dishes are very \u201cclean\u201d and a delight on the palate with the natural sweetness of the fresh ingredients shining through.\nHighly recommend.\n\nOne of the best restaurants we've ever had the pleasure of dining in. The location on the rooftop of the art gallery is ideal and offers a superb view of the bay. The dining room is refined and the atmosphere warm in a luxurious setting. As for the cuisine, it's magnificent, with a rich and varied tasting menu, same goes for the wine pairing, and a vegetarian version is available. Finally, the staff memers are at least as good as the food. We look forward to returning on our next visit to Singapore.\n\nThe view is fantastic especially by the window. The ambience is relaxing and welcoming. The food is delicious and the 7 course culinary experience brings you to taste many ingredients from all over the world all cooked with the highest level of care and attention to details. The chef Daniele is very talented. The staff is very friendly and took great care of us.\n\nOver 700S$ for such an underwhelming set of food. Although everything was executed and cooked well, it was a very standard and uninspiring menu.\n\nThe service was fantastic , extremely knowledgeable and fast but this doesn\u2019t make up for the value for money. When you go to a one starred Michelin restaurant and pay this amount, you naturally expect to have your mind blown with innovation and creativity. The taste was extremely familiar and standard, I do not recommend this place. There are other one starred and two starred Michelin restaurants serving better quality food for a lower price point. My suggestion would be to change the menu and offer different options, it seems like they\u2019ve stuck with the same menu for quite a long time, nothing exciting or new.\n",

The food was good but I can probably tick off this experience. Make sure you like seafood! A once and a lifetime experience!\nIt was pretty cool we got to meet the chefs after.\n\nI certainly had very high expectations of Odette, it having 3 Michelin stars and being #14 in The World's 50 Best Restaurants list at the time of the visit (november 2023).\n\nWell, fame is definitely not everything! From start to finish, what lacked was soul and personality, and the whole experience made me think reputation by terms of media and rankings might be increasingly decadent.\n\nTo start off, we were offered a small and uncomfortable-looking table right by the entrance door, even though I had reserved a table in the Private Dining Room over a month prior. We had to insist on being placed in the intended room.\n\nThe whole time, it felt like we were doing the restaurant a favor being there and I could sense so much pretentiousness in service, food and ambiance. The flavor and even the high quality ingredients were shadowed by this and the gimmicky presentations of the food.\n\nAt a USD 500/SGD 700 price point per person (without wine pairing), I most definitely cannot recommend\u00a0Odette to anyone.\n\nWhat a lovely and delicious evening out in Singapore. Service was what you would expect from a 3* establishments. All the dishes, from the butter to the pigeon, were out of this world. The staff was well orchestrated and did a great job of providing information on each dish and engaging us in conversation throughout the evening. Having been fortunate enough to dine at other 2 & 3* restaurants around the globe I would put this in my top 3 in a very close race with Mudec in Milan for number 1 and edging out French Laundry in terms of the menu. I will definitely try to secure another reservation next time I'm in Singapore.\n\nOdette has always been on my to-try list and this year I was treated to a birthday dinner here!\n\nAn amazing French experience savoring the 7-course meal. We were totally impressed by the presentation as well as the flavour of each dish. Not to mention the excellent and attentive service by the crew! It was also nice of them to gift a bottle of strawberry jam for every guest.\n\nAn unforgettable meal, or rather gourmet journey at this 3-starred michelin.\n\nTried the 7 course meal for a celebratory lunch.\n\nThe food was great - loved the Maryuko Uni, smoked organic egg and the desserts. \u2018Blanc\u2019 the dessert was phenomenal.\n\nHowever, service was quite average. The waiters rushed through explanations of their dishes. And while they tried to entertain our questions about the dishes, the way that they did it was quite cursory and generally seemed quite reluctant to hold a conversation.\n",

The ingredients for the starters are fresh but the sauce is a bit overly sour. The main are good with the beef cheek really soft and juicy. The salmon skin is crispy and not too dry.\n\nThe Fried rice was a bit oily and too filling for 2 of us to finish. As for dessert, the ice-cream tasted really nice but I can't identify the flavour\n\nThe Service staffs are attentive and bother to explain a bit about the food. As my table was between another 2 tables, I can't help hearing other people's conversations. Perhaps choosing exclusive tables inside the restaurant will be better.\n\nOverall, a happy dining experience with good quality food.\n\nReally enjoyed our meal here. We got the Too Good to Share set meal and the service and the quality of the meal. The attendants were quick to rotate our plates after every course. The food itself was amazing, it was all well seasoned and fresh. We left quite full and had to even take some of the food home. We've had set meals before in other restaurants and this one felt very well worth the price. The space is cooled to a very refreshing temperature especially if you've been walking outside in Singapore it can  start feeling cold after a while so it might be beneficial to bring a light sweater for those sensitive to highly air conditioned space (I enjoyed it personally haha) Looking forward to coming back in the future and trying more of their a la carte items!\n\nA perfect Sunday noon lunch sums up our first visit to Akira Back. Known for its unique menu, this place is a delight for Japanese food lovers. There is a separate veg menu which makes it appealing. Each dish was presented beautifully and tasted equally good. Akira is a great choice to dine with friends and family.\n\nThe moment we sat down, we were asked whether we want green tea or sparkling water. We did not ask for detailed and thought the green tea is complimentary (for sure I know we have to pay for sparkling water) and to my surprise the green tea cost $7 each (the most expensive green tea I ever had). Should have read the review at least I won\u2019t get a shock when I see the bill.\n\nFood wise we ordered the Two good to share, the starters were nice, but the salmon was average. Huge portion of Wagu fried rice to fill up your stomach.\n\nDessert is nicely decorated but it is kind of small for 2 to share.\n\nJapanese fusion food in a modern, swanky setting. Visited 3 times \u2014 pre, during and post covid, and I\u2019m glad to say that the food has remained consistent, from the quality down to the plating! The portions are generally medium-sized, and good for sharing between 2-4 pax.\n\nPls refer to the photo captions for more info.\n",

Our waiter took special care to ensure that we had really nice pictures for the \"birthday cake shot\".\n\nThe food was nice, but nothing too special.\n\nI would go back for the service and ambience alone.\n\nWent there for lunch for the first time. We had orchid lunch set. Especially love the soup, the smoked duck and the lobster rice/fish noodles. We didn't get to take any photo so just find some photos online to show some of the best dishes we had.\nYes it's pricey, but it's worth the money.\n\nGreat food and good service. There were just 2 of us and the restaurant was able to adjust the dim sum portion to 2 pieces each so that we could try more variety. Love that flexibility!\n\nGood ambiance with impressive crockery that have beautiful black brush ink paintings of flowers. Each diner was served your individual bowl of fried cashew nuts as appetisers instead of communal serving in most Chinese restaurants. Nice touch!\n\nWe had steamed live prawns that were served with very fine strips of ginger, scallions and chilli in a light sauce for dipping. A silver finger bowl with a lemon slice was provided. Nice touch!\n\nIngredients used in Sze Chuan Styled Stewed Sea Cucumber Fish Maw and Braised Bean Curd Bamboo Pith were fresh and good quality. However the flavours of both were not memorable and the gravy for the beancurd had too much cornstarch.\n\nFried Rice Crab Meat with Dried Scallops was full of \"wok hei\". The only dish that left a good impression.\n\nGood hospitality for there is no charge for warm water.\n\nI was here on a weekday afternoon (prior reservation is recommended). The place quickly got crowded at around 1pm, mostly with business folks who presumably were there for lunch meetings.\n\nExcellent place for dim sum. The food isn't cheap here, but what you get in return is high-quality food, in fact the best dim sums in town, and excellent service.\n",

Gnocchi, duck confit, penny bun (porcini mushroom), foie gras - Good, rich flavours.\n4. Himono grouper, mussels, greens, lobster foam, Giavieri osietra caviar - Just ok.\n5. Mascarpone tart, buckwheat gelato - Fine.\nBonne bouche - Enjoyed the raspberry pate de fruits. The orange and passionfruit canele, the madeleine, and the yuzu berry were fine.\n\nA visual delight and a treat for the taste buds. The 9 dishes were all more succulent than the others.\nThanks to Chef Roberto and his teams for this unique experience\n\nA wonderful find in Singapore. Italian-Asian food done exceptionally well. The fish was some of the best we have had, and Chef Roberto really knows how to mix seemingly simple ingredients to create flavors that really create an impact. Amazing service as well from the staff, and the Chef was really kind in accommodating our dietary restrictions in the last minute. We will definitely be back. Thank you for a wonderful evening!\n\nThe one Michelin Star unfortunately went away, along with the previous head-chef when he departed in January.\n\nWith the new captain at the helm, the food has fallen extremely short of expectation, bringing the experience further down as the subsequent dishes arrive one by one.\n\nThe Hamachi starter was too salty. Period.\n\nThe next starter, black angus beef tartare with quail egg and truffle was introduced with a supposedly \u201cmagic powder\u201d that is the dehydrated truffle. But no taste of truffle found. The caper-tartare ratio was skewed too much to the caper, which added an unnecessarily overly salty flavour to the dish (again).\n\nRisotto is extremely normal without any outstanding point but fortunately bland to counter the first two dishes\u2019 saltiness.\n\nThe himono grouper main dish was again, bombarded by too much salt again, and was sent back to the kitchen. The refired dish was more edible this time round, but at this point, we were already exhausted by the unpleasant experience.\n\nThe next main dish, wagyu beef cheek was the only pleasant dish that arrived. The meat was cooked to perfection and \u201csoft as butter\u201d is the perfect phrase to describe it. However, the truffle jus, similar to the earlier dish, had no hint of truffle at all.\n\nLastly the dessert and bonne bouche, which was meant to be a sweet ending, did not fulfill its purpose.\n\nThis is a restaurant where complacency after getting a Michelin Star, would eventually be its downfall.\n\nI visited this restaurant to enjoy lunch set menus.\nAll dishes are taste nice and looks beautiful. Most impressed dish is HIMONO grouper. HIMONO is one of the processes of dry-aging.\nThe grouper meat is chewy and it\u2019s surface is crispy. Those combination made me enjoying and satisfied.\n",

No kids under 14 are allowed.\nSkip the high heels, if you don't normally wear them daily though.\n\n78$ pp for free flow lunch. Brought a Thai friend as I heard many good reviews about this place. But sadly the food was very salty and chicken in the green curry was rather dry and tough. Beef was tough as well. Restaurant was quite warm. Total damage 185$ after GST. There\u2019s free parking around the corner for about 10 cars.\n\nYou will forget that you are in Singapore while you are here. You can be expecting tip top level of service while you enjoy your meal in the beautiful restaurant on the hill. Really love the architecture and chandeliers hanging in the bar area. The food itself I think is quite average as I had better Thai food elsewhere. Personally, I think they are a bit too heavy handed on the MSG as I usually feel very parched after eating here. Overall, I think it\u2019s a really good place to hang out and have drinks with friends in a more secluded area of Singapore.\n\nAttending a wedding event. Nice environment. Good for chill out. The food is just ok for me. But the environment is good for meeting and chatting people with people.\n\nThe building itself was beautiful typical colonial building. Inside was quiet and while there was 5 of us and we made our own atmosphere it was very quiet. We went on a Thursday so maybe at weekends it\u2019s busier?! The food was lovely.\n",

Crab pasta tasted like the non-spicy version of chilli crab which is quite unique. Would say the fish was the best. The fish itself is roasted very well and also love the layered potatoes.\n\nOverall, felt that it was Italian cuisine tailored to the Singaporean palate. Also, the restaurant is understaffed, there was only two service-crew serving everyone. Atmosphere-wise, it\u2019s on the top  level of the hotel but there\u2019s no views of anything. It was basically a poolside restaurant with the occasional crying / screaming of kids and babies in the pool.\n\nWould only recommend if you are hotel guest or looking for a casual restaurant in the area.\n\nWhen you're looking for a less crowded Italian restaurant on Orchard Road, this is a good place to hide. Nice small restaurant, located on the Rooftop of Voco Hotel. The food is good, but it could be better. Service staff were wonderful and knowledgeable of the menu.\n\nI\u2019ve visited with my mom during singapore trip. They served great dishes. I especially recommend Truffle Burrata Cheese Pizza. The staff who is Korean guy is very kind and professional. We had a good moment because of him. I want to thank you to he and rest of all staffs.\n\nLove the ambience of this roof top bar as well as the service received!\n\nThank you Cai Ying, Jeremy and Owen for the exceptional services during my dinner at il Cielo, thank you for making it easy and enjoyable for me and my 5 year old son.\n\nSpecial mention to Cai Ying, who was especially attentive to all my needs and food recommendations were superb (look at the photos!)\n\nOf course, thank you to Chef Marco and Chef Beh Li for making my foodie son crave for the food even more after we left the restaurant.\n\nWould definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who is looking to have a quiet evening with pool and view of Orchard!\n\nDo try the Burrata Purgilese and the Tiramisu! These 2 are my favourites!\n\nI had a really lovely lunch with my family. It was a special occasion to celebrate and the food and service was excellent (the pool view is great as well).

A major thank you to Joanne and her colleague who made our visit special.\n\nMyself and my wife went for the set menu.  It was exceptional, especially the black cod with the seaweed caviar.\n\nAlong with this the atmosphere was great and the views as you'd expect were fantastic.\n\nI would highly recommend guests to visit this restaurant, during their stay.\n\nWe had an amazing, professional and kind host. Chef prepared delectable meals. Spago provided a delightful and memorable experience for all the senses. We thank you for the very kind offerings for our birthday and graduation celebration. The dessert and cards were a meaningful touch. You have gone above and beyond and I would highly recommend your esteemed establishment. A wonderful evening all round with a sensational view. You have managed to keep in step with Wolfgang Puck\u2019s reputation and have done him proud.\n\nThe lunch set is really worth the money, even if you choose to do a top up for the more premium options. Mocktails were good too, but nothing spectacular. The service was great, despite the minor mix up with my salmon which didn't come fully cooked (we made a special note for no raw food since I'm heavily pregnant). That was quickly rectified and while waiting, my husband and I were happy to enjoy another round of their breads. Their breads are amazing, please don't skip them. Overall, I'd definitely return with my husband for special occasions. Do note that children below the age of 8 won't be able to dine here, so parents with young children may have to consider elsewhere.\n\nDefinitely an experience of its own. Came here for lunch and the staff are so friendly and professional.\n\nThe 3 course dishes was recommended by the staff and the food was cook to perfection with great presentation!\n\nAtmosphere was great with views of the sea and the other side of the city! Definitely will come again!\n\nBreakfast with a view: I enjoyed breakfast at Spago and loved how it\u2019s a semi-buffet concept. There\u2019s a small but adequate menu from which you can select items like pancakes, eggs florentine, dim sum, noodle soup and various juices, which are brought to your table. As I was pretty tired, I stuck to this service. However if you prefer, you may also roam the buffet stations for other items like yoghurt, which my energetic son did. I would recommend going earlier to avoid the crowd. This breakfast space opens as early as 7am.\n",

She is very friendly Taiwanese lady . she recommended some food for us & was really good. I am so pleased for their service . We really enjoyed our beautiful dinner , although that day was a heavy raining day . We also so impressive to get a complimentary Champagne & small cake for our anniversary . Thumb up \ud83d\udc4d for their service\n\nWe had the best time here on 27 Dec. Did a last min reservation for a family member's birthday. Service was good and the food was really tasty without it being overpowering. Ambience is nice indoors rather than outdoors imo and also since it was drizzling that day. After dinner, you could consider sitting at the alfresco area for drinks and admire the view of Marina Bay.\n\nThe food was really amazing! The starters are awesome with cheese and cold cuts. The source with sweetness and saltiness match perfectly. The ravioli was really good! I am a huge ravioli lover and not everywhere can be able to produce good ravioli pasta! One of the best I have ever had.\nAs for the desserts, tiramisu is my all time fav! And this place brought the A game for the dessert!\nBest thing is the view. You\u2019ll have indoors and outdoors sitting. If you\u2019re one looking for great view and great food please try this place. It is really amazing!\n\nAs I took in the panoramic view of Marina Bay Sands from my table at Dolce Vita Singapore, I was struck not only by the beauty of the iconic landmark, but also by the tranquil ambience that pervaded the restaurant. Despite its bustling location in the heart of the city, the peaceful atmosphere of the restaurant allowed me to fully immerse myself in the flavors and textures of the food.\n\ncouldn't help but feel grateful for the rare combination of stunning views and quiet ambience that Dolce Vita provided and delicious food - Overall, the pesto pasta dish at this Italian restaurant is a sublime culinary experience that is not to be missed. The balance of flavors and textures is a testament to the chef's skill and dedication to their craft. If you're looking for an authentic taste of Italy, this dish is a must-try.\n\nMy wife and I had a great experience dining at Dolce Vita. The food was well presented and tasted great, and the atmosphere complimented a romantic night out. A highlight of the night was the authenticity and personality of the staff. A special mention to Alex and Suzanne who were both welcoming, personable, and resonated the true spirit of Italian hospitality.\n",

If you feel like pampering yourself with a good meal. You can really consider this restaurant. We had a wonderful and memorable time there.\n\nCelebrating my husband\u2019s birthday \ud83c\udf82 great food, we opt for 4 course meal lunch and every dish has its surprise never to expect how delicious it was.  We sat at the table where were able to look at the chef prepare the dishes. We enjoy very much.  The price was reasonable too!  Will definitely drop by again. Thumbs up! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\n\nI recently had the pleasure of dining at Caviar, and I cannot say enough about the remarkable service provided by two of their staff members, Rahul and Harry. From the moment I walked through the door, it was evident that I was in for a memorable dining experience. Rahul and Harry welcomed me with warm smiles and a genuine enthusiasm that set the tone for the entire dinning experience. Their professionalism and attentiveness were truly remarkable. They made me feel like a valued guest from start to finish. What impressed me the most was their impeccable timing. My courses were served with precision, and they ensured that my water glass was never empty. Their ability to anticipate my needs and preferences was truly exceptional, making me feel pampered and well taken care of throughout. Rahul and Harry's unwavering commitment to delivering top-tier service elevated my dining experience to new heights. They went above and beyond to ensure that my experience was not just memorable, but truly exceptional. I am genuinely grateful for their exceptional service.\n\nWe opted for the Lunch Tasting Menu which offered  a 4-course menu (Baerii) priced at $88++ and a 5-course menu (Kaluga) for $139++. The menu included delightful selections like Amuse Bouche, Amaebi Tartare, Le Caviar Soup (exclusive to the 5-course option), Uni Pasta (my personal favourite), a choice of mains featuring Jerusalem Artichoke Risotto, Horse Mackerel, Wagyu Beef Short Ribs, and concluded with the delightful Orange Madeline. Every dish, including the Brioche served with kombu seaweed butter, was absolute masterpiece. While the first 3/4 courses left us utterly impressed, the mains, particularly the Horse Mackerel, leaned slightly towards an acidic note, which was not to our liking. We also had the Wagyu Beef Short Rib was braised and rather decent.\n\nIf you're looking for a dining experience that combines delectable cuisine with unparalleled service, be sure to visit Caviar and ask for Rahul and Harry. They are the true stars of this establishment, and they will make your visit one to remember. Bravo!\n\n\ud835\ude3e\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude6b\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude67 had an exciting new lunch menu. When we visited, the vibes there were cosy and chill - a contrast to the luscious metal tubs of fresh caviar which sat in front of us. We started off their 4 \ud835\ude58\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude68\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude61\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude5d \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude68\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude5c \ud835\ude62\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude6a with the \ud835\ude56\ud835\ude62\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude68\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude57\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a: a small pastry filled with beef, truffle mushroom, and creme fraise, right from the chef\u2019s selection!\n\nFollowing this, we were served their \ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude68\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude57\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude59 \ud835\ude6c\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5d \ud835\ude68\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude68\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude62\ud835\ude5a. As always, house bread tastes the best, especially so when paired with their creamy homemade butter with seaweed.\n\nThe \ud835\ude56\ud835\ude62\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude57\ud835\ude5e was a dish that featured fresh tiny prawns in a concoction of buttermilk and chestnut chunks. The sourness and tanginess paired well with the sweet seafood. The deep fried prawn head added a crispy touch!\n\nWe did not expect how rich (and how jelat D:) the next dish was. The \ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude5e \ud835\ude65\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude68\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude56 was drenched in an umami sauce that was a bit too much for our tastebuds. The salted lemon rind did not bring enough acidity to help either, but we must say that the uni was fresh.\n\nThe \ud835\ude6c\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude5c\ud835\ude6e\ud835\ude6a \ud835\ude57\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude5b \ud835\ude58\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude60 was cooked to a perfect medium rare. The miso mash potato, broccolini, and brussel sprouts though plated clumsily were well-curated garnishes. On the contrary, the beautifully crafted \ud835\ude60\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude65\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5e - better known as the yellowtail fish - was on the drier side. The fennel, fish broth, and trout roe were nice but not outstanding complements to the fish.\n\nTo top it all off, we enjoyed their \ud835\ude68\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude60\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude61\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude68 homemade ice cream. This was a pleasant dessert that was creamy, delightful, and not too sweet!\n\nOverall, the lunch tasting menu by Caviar was decent, but had nothing to shout about. With its fair share of hits and misses, we felt that one flaw was actually the lack of caviar. Perhaps a small little scoop would have sufficed - just for a taste! Nevertheless, we appreciated the effort that Caviar made in creating new flavours and bringing new items to the menu.\n\nFollow us on IG @toofoodtomiss for more foodie content!\n\nCaviar was featured in the soup and dessert for the lunch course set that we had. Main courses were decent and generally the dishes were cream based.\n\nGood for an experience.\n",

To highlight, the fish finger is too fishy.  Service team maybe need to be more attentive. Overall still a good place to hang out\n\nMy first visit to Dempsey project and it won\u2019t be my last for sure. Food is great not just taste but presentation and creativity! The ambience is perfect especially for pet lovers. Staff are extremely friendly, prompt in servicing and very helpful. Eg. gave us decent advice where to sit to avoid morn sun. Staff was eager to please. Very impressed with the crew professionalism and attitude.\n\nOnce in a while when I want to have a carefree breakfast/brunch - I am reminded of these place. The environment in Dempsey certainly helps - and the food selection for breakfast menu has improved tremendously since a couple of years ago.\n\nI do enjoy the breakfast\u2026 tasty\u2026 but the coffee is a bit of a letdown. For the price offering - I would expect a full bodied aroma coffee without the need of extra shot.\n\nPrice wise? Definitely on the pricier end - what is to say with the morning at Dempsey and a relaxing breakfast in an old colonial building.\n",

We got the truffle scrambled eggs and the prawn and scallop special scrambled eggs. The eggs was creamy, perfectly cooked and the combination of truffle on one dish and mixed seafood on the other was like an explosion of flavor in my mouth, simply amazing.\n\nFor dessert, we got the pandan cakes and ice blended salted caramel latte and ice blended mocha, which is the restaurant's signature and it was the best ice blended drink I ever tried. It was creamy, rich in flavors and just satisfies your taste buds\n\nThe prices are reasonable, especially for the service and the quality of the ingredients used, maybe I will be back one day\n\nThey have improved their food and drinks. Had a great time here. The wait of 30 minutes was worth it. Must try their rosti. Crispy and delicious. The staff are friendly and responsive. It will be one of my frequented cafes. Highly recommended. Their ice blended drinks is thick and flavourful unlike some of the franchise cafes.\n\nSuper crowded, with Queue. Had to wait a good hour before we could enter.\n\nFood is good. Notably the rosti, laksa pasta and pork cheeks.\n\nVisited Tolido\u2019s on a Thursday morning for brunch and it was packed with tourists!\nMy favourite was the Truffle Scrambled Eggs and Salted Caramel Ice Blended Mocha! Portion for the mains were big and damnn\u2026 it tasted amazing!! Best of all, pricing of their food and drinks were super reasonable as compared to other cafes.. 2 pax (2 mains  + 2 drinks) for only $56! They have lunch sets and promotions going on as well. This cafe is now my no.1 go-to cafe! Highly recommend!\n\nMy go-to cafe for reliably delicious and reasonably priced food. Coffee is a bit of a hit-and-miss (Douglas the boss makes it the best) so if the consistency improves, there is literally nothing else to complain about other than the long queues that are a testament to Tolido's popularity. Highly highly recommend their prawn laksa pasta. I've tried many others and they've all paled in comparison.\n",

Was there with friends and we had a good catch-up over brunch.\nThe portions of food were very big, enough for a full lunch actually, but this is reflected in the pricing.\nThey have a delightful policy of letting kids eat free on weekdays though, so you may want to consider some bonding with your child during the upcoming school holidays!\n\nVery tasty food with a lot of healthy choices available in the menu.\n\nThe interior is lush with greens and design is clean and minimal. The soft music in the background brings good vibes to the atmosphere.\n\nWe ordered the pancakes, baked Atlantic salmon and smoked salmon avocado sourdough toast. All 3 of them are great! Very reasonably price and the price in the menu is the nett price you pay (no GST and service charge).\n\nHighly recommend to try out this place and I will definitely come back again. The downside is, very hard to find parking if you\u2019re driving down.\n\nLazy Sunday perk up with Grab order.\nWe ordered a variety of brunch meals and it came up to be near 100 bucks on the bill.\n\nThe food kept its flavour despite taking out.\n\nNutty Banana Croissant\nPeanut butter with a generous spread of granola and banana held together by a lightly toasted croissant. Now for a good balance, they\u2019ve thrown in some berries! Lovely and filling.\n\nGrilled Chicken Burger\nThe fries was soggy. Now this is a global problem that requires attention. How the hell can you retain the integrity of delivery fries?\nThe buns was nice and the chicken patty was well grilled and juicy.\n\nMr Frank\nThis looks big and intimidating.\nNot sure if we got around to finish it but for 17 bucks it\u2019s something you can share!\n\nGood Day Breakfast\nThis was a mash up of everything you would expect in an English breakfast. There\u2019s salad, sausages, avocado and sourdough. I need a good cup of tea.\n\nWe\u2019ve been to the cafe before.\nBright and airy. Lots of plants - but I think they need TLC.\n\nIt\u2019s a safe bet guys. Go order and share the plates.\n\nStopped by for a simple drink and snack on a Sunday afternoon. The place had very nice vibes and the drinks were good.\n\nMy only wish was that we had space in our stomachs to try more of their food selection. Will definitely be back for another try the next time I\u2019m in the area.\n\nExcellent place for brunch . Neat and clean  setting . Food is great . Portions are big . Staff is friendly . What else can you ask for ? Keep it up team . Thanks \ud83d\udc4d\n",

                  "reviews": "\n\nThere is truly something special about this brunch place. Not sure if it's the decadent food, the superb service or the fantastic atmosphere and decor.\n\nI first ordered their homemade cold mocha brew, and it was very rich in flavor and literally the best way to start your day. For the mains, we ordered fried chicken topped on a crispy spring onion pancake and a giant croissant filled with creamy scrambled eggs and sizzling bacon. I loved both of them, not sure which one more. The pancakes with chicken was very hearty and the egg and bacon croissant is a classic. We ordered their walnut cheesecake for dessert to split and it was moist, but firm at the same time with a tasty frosting. The food prices may seem expensive, but for the great quality ingredients and inspired plates you are getting, it's totally worth it.\n\nThe restaurant is a bit small and can be very busy, so make sure to reserve before hand. The cooks are very talented, apparently they won quite a few competitions in the past.\n\nThe fried chicken on scallion pancake was excellent, the 3pc chicken thighs are stacked together and 2 time fried how your karaage comes out in izakaya. I couldn\u2019t taste much of the pancake but overall the spicy mayo drizsled on top was a good balance. Juicy tender dark meat, my absolute favorite of a chicken part\ud83e\udd17\n\nLamb shakshuka was quite mushy! But it was very tasty. Bread soaked the mushiness and stain, great balance of the wet and dry.\n\nMaple butter tater tots were quite an invention. It is sweet, I might prefer the good ol original tater tots. These are good to lunch on, the sweet taste spreads and overcome the potato and on some pieces you can taste the butteryness like a nicely soaked butter popcorn.\n\nHoujicha latte was one of the best lattes I\u2019ve had! I got iced. I think they used soy milk? Not sure but very tastey and not too sweet, just how I like it!!\n\nI can\u2019t wait to come back to try their lobster tail seafood linguine. It was too much fried stuff for my brunch today :(\n\nAmazing food overall. Ambiance very basic. Nice busy spot for a weekend catch up with absolutely delicious food!!!\n\nReserve ahead for the weekend, 75 min dine-in time as it\u2019s super busy. Came for the buckwheat pancakes and loved it. Blueberry compote with fresh fruits and crispy cornflakes crumble complement the  grainy and soft yet moist and fluffy pancake (sounds crazy). Very filling. Scrambled Eggs and harissa fried eggs with lamb are good too.\n\nWent for brunch on 5/8 and had a good experience there overall.\n\nFood: Had seafood pasta (which had an savoury and interesting taste that I like and hence devoured), truffle fries (your usual fries) and waffle ice cream! Okay not too bad but not like super fantastic.\n\nService: Very prompt, the servers noted our requests throughout meals and food arrived quickly too. Kudos to them for the good service!\n\nFood was meh.\nThe all day breakfast was too oily.\nThe beef was a bit too overcooked and was too tough.\nThe truffle fries didn\u2019t have much truffle taste.\nThe seafood pasta sauce tasted weird and didn\u2019t have much seafood taste.\n\nThe cold brew mocha was good. Hot mocha was too milky for our liking. The matcha was decent.\n\nProbably will not order their mains again.\n",

I personally like the cream sauce with the Macaroni. Very rich in taste. The nachos beef  was great, crispy thin tortilla. Food portion were great with lots of filling on the pizza.\n\nKeep it up! Thumbs up\n\nNice spot for a relaxing day! Outdoor or glass window seats are preferable as we can enjoy the greenery scene outside while having a meal. The staff is helpful. The food is not outstanding but not bad at all. Will definitely go back!\n\nHad their seafood pan. I must say the bread they served was amazing. It\u2019s crispy on the outside, soft and moist on the inside, more importantly, the bread was warm when served. A perfect combination to dip into the seafood pan.\n\nVisited before and tried the Lamb and Prawn Rose this time around. The Lamb was super soft but a little bland, while the Prawn Rose was nice.\n\nThere is a playpen for kids at the outdoor tables, hence we weren't able to enjoy much of the nature ambience. However, those with kids would enjoy it.\n\nFood will always be subjective but for us, it's good! Especially the shrimp aglio olio, calamari and the mini burger. Their breakfast is not bad as well, love the sandwich. Their milk shakes are tasty, must try the baileys espresso shake.\n",

Highly recommend each of them! Chill ambience with nice music. Want to give a special shout-out to our server, Chloe, who was super kind and attentive throughout our dinner, which made all the difference :) thank you Chloe! For making our birthday dinner a very pleasant one with your thoughtfulness and friendliness :)\n\nFood standard is great here \ud83d\udc4d\nWe ordered ceaser salad , crab spaghetti and aquapazza. Spaghetti and aquapazza are delicious.\n\nWe visited here for brunch around 11am for 2 pax walk-in.\nThere were few people inside. I requested bigger table as I got a lot of stuffs on my hand and not much customer inside, but a lady staff looks obviously not happy that I requested that.\nWe left restaurant around 1pm, but restaurant has not packed during our brunch. I am not sure why the lady was so unwillingly give us a bigger seat.\n\nOverall, although the price is not reasonable, it\u2019s still good restaurant in terms the quality of the foods and the atmosphere.\n\nThe cafe is part of hotel with separate entrance from mall. Very nice brunch spot. Ordered fish taco and baked egg. Baked egg is petty good because I love chorizo. But fish taco is slightly disappointing. Too much batter and lack of citric flavor\nTheir dessert menu is also limited. Thrifts, tried their tasting coffee set. MAD milk is naturally sweet from date, interesting idea.\n\nThis is an outlet I visited before with the missus and today I decided to invade Oriole with the 3 monkeys !!! The girls loved the overall decoration, they claimed it\u2019s cozy and homely haha. Anyway, all the dishes were ordered by them and they sang super high praises for \u201cwhatever-they-ordered\u201d (laughs). They loved the silky and smooth mushroom soup; THEY LOVED THE CHICKEN WINGS !!! They basically loved everything hahaha. We will be back for more Oriole, many thanks for hosting us well, till then !!!\n\nWe walked in on a Sunday afternoon and Jazzy assisted us. My aunt had a bad back and requested for sofa seat. Because most of the sofa seats were taken due to reservations, Jazzy mentioned she would try her best. After awhile, she came over and mentioned that the seat was available as they managed to get a sofa seat for us. Jazzy was very helpful throughout and her willingness shined through\n\nWe ordered the Sweet Soy Pork Ribs which was rather tender and the Smoked Salmon Waffles which was good. Overall a great experience and special shout out to Jazzy who was helpful, patient and an asset to the service industry :)\n",

We loved their banana porridge, avocado toast and early grey pancakes. All so well thought out  and so flavourful. The service was excellent as well. It\u2019s a perfect breakfast/brunch spot!\n\nOrdered Earl Grey Pancakes, Poached Eggs with Avocado, Grilled Cheese Sandwich and Reuben Sandwich.\nPancakes seems simple 3-piece with chocolate sauce, a half of pear and crushed nuts.  Nothing really wow\u2026 Find it super overpriced.\nGrilled cheese sandwich is pretty good and again, very simple toast bread with cheese, plus a simple light favoured tomato soup. Overpriced.\nPoach eggs with avocado (guacamole).  Simple taste.\nReuben sandwich is quite okay. Not anything above average.\nOverall, for the price tags, it\u2019s not up to the standard or delivering the worth it value.\nThe outdoor setting is nice though, but due to its a public holiday, dine in time is limit to 1hr.\nWell, it\u2019s not going to bring me there for a second time.\n\nWent for lunch. Laksa burger - Not much laksa taste. Aglio Olio - tiger prawn was quite small. Taste was ok. Coffee was good in general. We tried long black, latte and cappuccino. Tiramisu is not too soft and wet. Pricing is above average. Probably more suitable for breakfast, coffee and dessert. Reservation - 24hr in advance. Walk in ok\n\nSecond visit - made reservations. Service was still good. This time i tried the sandwich. It was good n filling. Better to share \u263a\ufe0f\n\nThe food was okay. Overpriced considering the portion size. Limited indoor and outdoor seating available. We came close to opening time so we had no wait. Service was friendly.\n\nWe had a decent meal but not good enough to repeat.\n\nFood was okay. I ordered french toast but i found it was quite dry and not a lot of sauce. I ordered their Avocado toast dish and this ine was better.\n\nPlace was quite lively and staff was very friendly. I can tell they are really happy when customers come and they welcome you readily. Aunty serving was also very attentive.\n\nI do hope they become more successful in the future!\n",

I do love Wild Honey at Mandarin Gallery as the customer service and the Manager named Ms Jocelyn Abrahan is amazing. However, the Manager at Scotts is a business focused that she forgot the human-touched. But overall is good as per Wild Honey standards but they can do better in customer service.\n\nWonderful get together lunch. Food was perfect and service was impeccable with good ambience. My only complaint is the expensive parking in the building. Coffee ice cubes with milk is unusual drink. Ice chocolate was perfect without being too sweet. They were also able to help split the bill so we didn\u2019t hv to do a separate split among ourselves.\n\nWe were here over the weekend 12Nov  to celebrate a special milestone birthday for a loved one. The service was excellent right from the word go! Everything was done with much care and thoughtfulness by the reservations team (special thanks to Diana for attending to my queries ever so patiently) as well as the whole team at the\nrestaurant - manager and staff, on the day of our celebration. We took the suggestion to pre-order from the set menu for our big group and that worked out well because the staff were ready with our 'personalised' orders when we arrived. Food was really good, especially loooove the Coconut Cake which I ordered in advance. The birthday boy had a memorable day. THANK YOU!! We will definitely come back again.\n\nLove this restaurant! A lot of variety and food is always good. This location is really great! Love the ambiance. It tends to get busy any time so make that reservation!\n\nThis Wild Honey branch is located at Scotts Square, Level 3. The path upwards was scenic with many shops below this cafe.  We ordered the Norwegian fish and it was yummy! For the drinks, we ordered Chai latte and Pink Flamingo (green) hot tea by TWG. The tea was ok. The ambience was nice and cosy. It was a quieter lunch as it was the school holidays. Reserved seats but saw that there were extra table/seat spaces if were to walk in. Unfortunately, both my friend and myself had mild food poisoning from eating the same dish. Hope the kitchen will look into this.\n",

We ordered the eggs Ben and French Toast Brioche, latte and flat white. The food and coffee were excellent, the portion of eggs Ben was a bit small though. A great place to chill!!\n\nMy first visit to Merci Marcel and my friends and I had a good time bonding over the food and the servers were great, especially Marilyn who was patient in giving us and overview of food selects and sharing the specials of the day. Soft yellow lighting gave it a nice cosy family/friends evening gathering atmosphere vibes. Thumbs up!\n\nGood services. Food is presented artistically.\nLatte is nice with a cute pattern, although this pattern is not very stable.\nThe French toast is okay. A bit pricy but understandable because this is Orchard.\nGood environment with sunshine.\n\nVery good! Although we didn't have a reservation, they managed to fit us in. The staff were all friendly and provided a fast and efficient service. The food and coffee were amazing, not to mention the cafes' atmosphere was very relaxing. It was a lovely breakfast and experience.\n\nAmazing place, nice atmosphere. Food was excellent but the portions are small (unless you ordered pizza). Also on the higher price range, so do take note. Great for special occasions though!\n",

As expected coffee house food is what you expect, price around 20 and above. It\u2019s a reasonable portion though the steak hash is really more worth it than their everyday breakfast. Thank goodness water is free and most services are digitalized so no need to take order. Food arrived quite timely too so no need wait too long. Maybe will come back again when I feel more willing to spend but generally not my style of dining. Service was quite mediocre cos it\u2019s a young crowd servicing.\n\nbanana bread was a 10/10! super moist, came slightly warm, and very strong and satisfying banana flavour. the cream on top (tasted like coffee), together with the tartness of the berries and crunchiness of the nuts gave a good variance of taste and texture.\n\nthe wurst rosti was also satisfying. the potatoes were crispy and the sausage was bursting with cheesy goodness. though, the default egg option is sunny side-up, and we paid $1.50 to have it changed to scrambled. the eggs were texturally perfect, though a bit bland. but when paired with the saltiness of the sausage, it was okay.\n\ni\u2019ve seen a lot of rave reviews about the carbonara but unfortunately i found it average at best. it was creamy and the mushrooms were good, but overall the flavour just felt flat. could use a bit of salt to make it more\u2026 moreish.\n\nwe also ordered a mocha and a filter coffee. the mocha had a strong chocolate flavour and a thick, luxurious mouthfeel. the filter coffee was interesting. it\u2019s also great that they have so many filter options! (8)\n\noverall a bit pricey ($86.84), but it was a pleasant dining experience with good food. we sat outside on a cloudy day and it wasn\u2019t hot at all.\n\nPretty decent food and coffee, a little pricy. Scrambled eggs are nicely seasoned and cooked to perfection. Rosti could be crispier and flatter, a little too thick for my liking. The waffles was great, fragrantly toasted and soft in the inside and crisp on the outside. Avocado can add a little more seasoning. Truffle fries, average. Ice latte was nice, pretty decent coffee, freshly roasted and aromatic.\n\nI ordered the Gentlemen's Relish which is a popular item here. Liked the compound butter and honey cream that comes along with the bread.\n\nMy wife opted for the Avocado Toast with Mushrooms and Eggs, and she couldn't have been happier. The scrambled eggs were cooked to perfection, and the combination of avocado, mushrooms, and eggs created a harmonious and satisfying dish.\n\nTheir iced coffee, and it was a refreshing and flavorful companion to my meal.\n\nWhat truly sets Atlas Coffeehouse apart is their commitment to quality and consistency. The staff was friendly and attentive, adding to the overall pleasant experience. Whether you're a coffee enthusiast or a food lover, Atlas Coffeehouse is a must-visit. I'll definitely be returning to explore more of their menu.\n\nHad the Rosti and gentleman\u2019s breakfast. The Rosti was good and crispy, texture is just right and sauce that accompanied was delicious. O would order it again.\nThe gentleman\u2019s breakfast was abit on the sweet side but overall still good.\n\nHighly recommend to try the hazelnut coffee as it has a berry aroma to it.\n",

The ambiance was enchanting, with soft lighting and tasteful decor that set the perfect mood for the evening.\n\nThe menu was a culinary masterpiece, offering a wide range of mouthwatering dishes that catered to various tastes. I started with the recommendation and it was an explosion of flavors that left me craving more. their signature dish was nothing short of perfection. Every bite was a delightful journey for my taste buds.\n\nThe service was impeccable; our server was knowledgeable about the menu, attentive, and made excellent recommendations.\n\nFood, Service, Ambience, everything was simply AMAZING. Bong was a super friendly host ( he posed with us too). I highly recommend this place to folks looking out for a wholesome and healthy meal. Lookout for the portion sizes, they are pretty huge.\n\nWe were amazed from the entrance. The place has the soul, every detail of the decoration matches. Waiters were really helpful as we weren\u2019t sure what we want to eat. Food arrived in few min, we took veg options- very fresh and tasteful. Burger was a monster and it\u2019s my favorite if I have to choose!\n\nWould give the service here 6/5 if we could because it was excellent. We came here for lunch with the kids and they enjoyed themselves tremendously. Special shout out to the service staff here. It is not easy to find a place that is hip, trendy yet so welcoming to kids and we felt right at home. Food was also yummy, healthy and clean but tasty. Highly recommend!\n\nLove the bake duck confit, pineapple cake, love the friendly staff, love the environment, love the recycling school table and oil tank (outdoor, as a standing table) love the old tcm medicine cabinet as a deco,\n\nWanna celebrate your birthday? It's not an issue. Ask for sparkler on the cake\uff0c(do note it is chargeable ya)\n\nHighly recommend.\n",

                  "reviews": "\n\nWe held our magical wedding dinner at Nassim Hill Bakery and Bistro Bar in late 2021 and it was an absolute dream in spite of the Covid restrictions.\n\nAudrey, our point of contact, gave us personalized attention and we could feel her genuine excitement to commemorate our special day. She made the entire process of planning seamless and we are really grateful for her thoughtfulness and going the extra mile.\n\nFrom the initial menu discussions, where her recommendations were tailored to our needs, to the meticulous preparation of a range of wedding favors for our guests, the experience was exceptional.\n\nEach dish was meticulously crafted with evident care and it left a lasting impression on our guests, who were also consulted for their feedback by their thoughtful chef.\n\nThe cozy and serene ambiance added to the charm, making it a perfect setting for our celebration. What's more, the great value for money was evident in every aspect of our experience.\n\nThe team's impeccable service, support for preparing our wedding favours and flexibility in accommodating our setup time for our event truly exemplified their dedication. Our guests thoroughly enjoyed themselves, making it an unforgettable evening.\n\nWe highly recommend Nassim Hill Bakery and Bistro Bar for any special occasion or simply a delightful dining experience.\n\nAlways received friendly service and good food here. A four star is given because the portions of the food seemed to have shrunk for the same (high) price charged.\n\nStill one of my go to places when I crave for a quality and wholesome salad - The Nutty bird. The salad is made up of specially curated individual ingredient dishes (such as marinated beetroot, dressed salad leaves, smoked chicken, homemade granola mix etc. The homemade (I believe) pesto sauce was a divine pairing with this salad!\n\nWas recommended a steak & eggs dish and it did not disappoint. Quality ingredients used at Nassim Hill Bakery!\n\nWould have visited more often if it\u2019s a little more affordable.\n\nNassim Hill Bakery: A Cozy Haven for Bread Lovers\n\nBrussels Sprouts - 8/10\nExcellently prepared sprouts that strike a rare balance, avoiding the common pitfall of over-salting.\n\nTruffle Fries - 4/10\nA letdown, with the fries not living up to expectations and the truffle essence failing to enhance the dish significantly.\n\nSteak & Eggs - 8/10\nA pleasant surprise with the steak expertly cooked and complemented by a well-matched sauce.\n\nBread Collection - 10/10\nA bread lover's paradise, with an array of loaves that promise a return visit to sample their baked offerings.\n\nOverall - 7.5/10\nThis charming bakery and cafe exude a rustic allure and welcome four-legged friends. Ideal for a relaxed visit post-stroll around Botanic Gardens or in town. Make sure to sample their delightful breads and pastries!\n\n#Ong2TheNextBite\n\nLocation a little hidden behind the Singpost on Nassim Hill, quite a spacious bistro for coffee and bites.\n\nWe chose this location as it is about 7min walk from TEL stations Napier or Orchard Boulevard.\n\nPortions are quite big, hits and misses in quality and taste.\n\nHits :\nWarm salmon Ni\u00e7oise salad as recommended. Salmon is crisp and moist, everything is on point.\n\nAlio olio is also nicely done, al dente pasta, fresh prawns & delicious.\n\nMisses:\nWaffles & pizza looked really good in photos.\ndisappointed with biscuit like crust and waffles are a little dry, nothing stands out for this dish.\n\nCoffee drinks are ok, not particularly outstanding.\n\nThere is generally 2 prices for mains on menu e.g. $20/28 and wait staff said child or adult? Naturally we went for adult and most mains are $24-$28.\n\nWe paid $168 for 4 dishes and 4 coke drinks after a 10% UOB discount.\n\nNassim Hill Bistro is a fantastic brunch spot serving delicious comfort food in a modern atmosphere.\n\nLet\u2019s start with my favorite thing about this place:  There is a floor-to-ceiling sized stained-glass Phoenix on one wall. I love this thing. I regularly threaten my partner that I\u2019m going to purchase it and place it in our home. For whatever reason, it is one of my favorite conversation pieces and bits of restaurant decor that I have seen in awhile.\n\nGushing about the Phoenix aside, Nassim Hill produces solid food. I have been here a number of times, and tried a number of dishes, from the cheddar bacon waffles to the chili crab pasta. They do a great job with whatever they make. I would say that none of the dishes are particularly different or inventive from the many other brunch places in Singapore; however, this place is very consistent with the food quality and I do appreciate that.\n\nService has always been prompt and friendly as expected.\n\nOverall, this is a great place to grab brunch with a date, or your friends or family, really any occasion. You likely will not be disappointed.\n",

We really enjoyed their coffees too, I think they are better than those that you can get from regular cafes on the street. We had the chicken salad and club sandwich, and they were actually really good! Wanna come back and try other menus too.\n\nVibes, service, and food were amazing as usual. The best thing about Providore is their unwavering consistency in the quality of food across all outlets. Both of our beverages were well worth the money. As for the food, we ordered the English breakfast and baked rotolo. The English breakfast was a solid 10/10. However, the baked rotolo was extremely cheesy, and beyond a certain point, it was tough to eat. (Hence the 4-star review for Food)\n\nFood was superb. Fries was so good which huge bits of salt - it was freshly fried and goes really well with the chipotle mayo which I finished every single drop of it.\n\nI asked for a burger patty to be medium rare and it was not only juicy, it was also very well seasoned - just the way I liked it.\n\nNothing about this place is disappointing\n\nI\u2019ve ordered from this outlet several times, both in person and for delivery. The food is very high quality and fresh and is always delicious.\n\nThe restaurant has nice vibes, very modern feeling. The staff are friendly and attentive.\n\nI recommend the sweet potato wedges and the grilled chicken salad.\n\nI will definitely be ordering from here again!\n\nA unique standalone space at Raffles Place, easy to spot. Love the crab linguine there however was informed that item has been unavailable for a month or two. Enjoyed my wine there, ordered Pinot Noir that's light and easy to drink. Overall very polite service by the team, as we stayed till closing, team member YY packed and offered tarts, one each for me and my friend, sharing that pastries are freshly baked daily, and rather than disposing any leftovers, they prefer to spread the love. Very awesome move and team (Ali waited patiently for us as well before we made a move and exited the restaurant). Keep it up :)\n",

Held our wedding there (approx 80 Pax) and it was one of the best decision with ample space and kids-friendly facilities for the kids to run around. Place was basically a blank canvas which allows us to be as creative as we wanted it to be. Coordination with Melinda (Event Manager) and Alex (Outlet Manager) was a brisk task as they provided suggestion based on their experience which greatly assisted us. Staff were excellent, professional and accommodating which greatly exceeded my expectation by meeting some of our weirder requests. We choose the buffet option which had a nice spread and all my guest greatly enjoyed it.\n\nMy second visit here. My friend threw a party here last time and we really enjoyed the food and dessert, so decided to come back with the kid again. The staffs were busy but warm. Although short staffed if you managed to get their attention they would attend to your requests. Chicken parmigiana was delicious. Kids menu looks average but my daughter finished the whole thing! Had a good time here keeping the kid busy with the outdoor area. Other than the bouncy castle there are also balls and Lego which seem to be new.\n\nLove the play area outside that is for kids. Food is good too. However bouncy castle was dripping with water and had many black patches, looks dirty such that my daughter didn't want to go up.\n\nTop spot for kids.\nThe new chap who\u2019s managing it is doing a magnificent job to be attentive to all customers. They seem a little short staffed on most days but that\u2019s just F&B in sg.\nIf you\u2019ve got a few hours on the weekend to kill and don\u2019t mind 6/10 food, this really is a top spot for kids.\n\nCafe Melba at the Goodman Arts Center off Mountbatten Road is an F&B oasis for neighborhood residents and their young children. The local government repurposed the campus from its former use as a public school. The cafe is spacious and is right next to a small grass field that doubles as a play area for young children.\n",

The mix of textures that the brownie has just gel together so well \u2014 the coolness of the ice cream, the dense, sweet brownie and the soft marshmallows.\n\nFood was generally good. There is room for improvement in terms of service, would be nice to see smiles on their faces.\n\nFood is always amazing here and the atmosphere is great. I was a little disappointed by the lady serving us who was not the most cheerful but except for that it was great!\n\nWe ordered a bottle of Prosecco which was great and then for mains we had the Thai Basil Chicken Bowl, the Chicken Schnitzel special, and the Club Sandwich. All 3 were great, very big portions though!\n\nI came here on a Saturday for a birthday dinner. We managed to book alfresco dining with a view, so be sure to call the concierge to arrange it! There were several light shows in the MBS area during our dinner. The food was alright. However, one particular thing that really stood out was the service staff named Remy. He was incredibly friendly and even helped me surprise my mom for her birthday with the cake I had specifically called in to book before dining. He also recommended food and drinks when we were having a hard time choosing from the extensive menu. He truly enhanced the overall dining experience. This is a great location with a wonderful atmosphere for date nights and family gatherings!\n\nThe view is really amazing, though my dish was quite average, the Seabass risotto.\nIt was a good crowd on a Friday afternoon.\n\nWould come back again for the view, probably try something else on the menu.\n\nPS Cafe at One Fullerton serves an exceptional Sticky Toffee Pudding that left me delighted and satisfied. Here are the highlights of my experience:\n\nIrresistible Taste: The Sticky Toffee Pudding is an absolute delight for dessert lovers. The cake is moist, rich, and perfectly balanced with a luscious toffee sauce. Every bite was a heavenly treat.\n\nCozy Atmosphere: PS Cafe at One Fullerton offers a warm and inviting ambiance that enhances the dining experience. The comfortable seating and charming decor create a pleasant and relaxed environment.\n\nAttentive Service: The staff at PS Cafe were attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable. They provided excellent recommendations and ensured that my dining experience was enjoyable from start to finish.\n\nBeautiful Location: PS Cafe at One Fullerton is situated in a picturesque location with stunning waterfront views. It's the perfect spot to enjoy a delicious dessert while taking in the breathtaking scenery.\n\nOverall, PS Cafe's Sticky Toffee Pudding at One Fullerton is a must-try dessert. The combination of flavors, cozy atmosphere, and attentive service make it a wonderful dining destination. I highly recommend indulging in this delectable treat.\n",

Beef cheeks melting in my mouth as I remembered it. Sea Bass crispy on outside and fluffy melt in your mouth on the inside. Baked Brie had a nice texture and matched well with the tangy pomelo. We ended off with something new for us in the menu - Pandan Souffl\u00e9. Heavenly light texture and fluffy. Tinge of gulamelak and Pandan flavour with vanilla was a perfect match. \ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95 will be back ! Thank you Chef Ratha! \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude0a\n\nWe have been dining at Black Sheep from their days at Jalan Kelulut, happy to find out that Chef Ratha has re-opened at Norris Road.\nWe had the 3-course set lunch, every bite was exquisite.\nSalad had delectable flavours mixed with pineapple, mango to give an exciting twist to each bite.\nNot much more to be said about the main course except that it was as good as we remembered.\nDon't leave without trying the flourless lava cake.\n\nHad tried foie gras toast, escargot, French onion soup , Brie for bites. Oh and the bread roll is served warm with nice soft (but not melted) butter.. it\u2019s always the details that counts.\n\nand main I had the duck confit which is fry to perfection, well marinated. Souffl\u00e9 is definitely the way to end it with a good note.\n\nBought a bottle of Chardonnay and brought along red wine to pair with the food.\n\nAmazing food with great company. Thanks chef!\n\nMs.Cloud is an amazing hostess, very attentive made great suggestions and above all very welcoming and warm.\nChef Ratha fixes a scrumptious menu and the food is amazing.\nHighly recommend\n\nwe paid about a hundred plus each as we had a bottle of wine. (2pax dine in)\nWithout it, costs per pax would have been lower. Overall pleasant meal and reasonably priced.\nMust get the baked brie starter\n",

The food was amazing and the service here is superb!\n\nI had the most incredible experience at Super Loco, and it's all thanks to the exceptional service provided by Jenny. From the moment we walked in, Jenny's warm and welcoming demeanor set the tone for a fantastic evening. She not only made sure our table was perfect, but she also went above and beyond to recommend the most delicious dishes on the menu. Kudos to her \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\n\nThey also gave us free churros and mexican lover shot as part of our birthday celebration here.\n\nSurprisingly, even though the food looks so nice, NONE of them (ordered 3 types of food) were tasty. \ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffb\n\nThe staff was NOT friendly/polite at all. Even though there was miscommunication, i didn\u2019t get apologies which made me feel uncomfortable.\n\nThe atmosphere is good as they allow lovely dogs outdoor.\n\nOverall, not recommend. :) Thanks!!\n\nNice and open air spot to hangout, visited after a downpour with the weather nice and cool.\nWe had chips and guacamole to start.\nBuffalo wings and quesadillas were great with the right amount of spices.\nCrabmeat tacos were a tad unwieldy, turned soggy when left out awhile.\nThe food can be a little salty so drinks and frozen margaritas were a nice respite.\nIt was nice to have 3 different salsas available by the table, the mango habanero does pack quite the punch.\nWill revisit for the laidback atmosphere and great food.\nStaff were attentive and offered water.\n\nDelicious, modern Mexican cuisine. Great menu with lots of meat and veg options as well as a decent kids menu. Favourite was the cauliflower dish as well as pumpkin tostadas. Service was a little non attentive but otherwise a great experience in a comfortable environment by the river.\n",

The waitress  said my daughter popped a balloon so she got scared and dropped a glass.\n\nThe owner's service level is exceptional, he was going around pouring wine for every table and was honest to return the extra bottles after the party ended.\n\nThere is only one bathroom which isn't very clean but it's not too bad.  The bathroom didn't have toilet paper though.\n\nThe place was kept surprisingly cool regardless of the number of people there.\n\nThe drinks are also expensive but quite interesting and creative.\n\nWow. Legit authentic cafe vibes here.\n\nWe happened to stumble into this cafe after running an errand. Loved the atmosphere with the unique antiques and deco.\n\nThere's a table for two in a car!\n\nThe staff are really friendly, and the atmosphere is so calm and comforting.\n\nGenerious food portion and quality is comparable to high end restaurants.\n\nDefinitely coming back here with friends!\nHighly recommend trying this place out. It's worth it!\n\nGreat place for a brunch experience. The coffee is up to standard and did not disappoint. Ambience is rustic with a touch of nostalgia. I would definitely come back again!\n\nI like the western foods and the deco. Good place for photography. The dessert and  coffee also good.  This is my second time visiting. Already try the tuna during my 1st visit, today I try the Salmon taste good too. The service are good. My personal view the pricing are slightly on the high side.\n\nWas around the vicinity, visited the cafe together with wife for get our brunch fixed. Interesting decorations they have spending effort. We didn\u2019t have any reservations and luckily enough there were seats. Noticed they have a extensive menu for a cafe. Staffs were friendly and attentive, food taste good too. Pricing is reasonable. Will definitely be back. Thank you\n",

As for the taste, not much of surprise in any way.\n\nThe Arrabiata pasta (not fresh pasta) didn't gave the woah effect in any way as well. Saving grace was the fresh prawns.\n\nMy wife tried the Gnocchi with gorgonzola. Pasta (fresh) texture wasn't good, sauce not really to our likely.\n\nAnother disappointment is the dessert from the set lunch, which we had ordered the flourless Chocolate cake. Look at the picture and you will understand. Taste, so-so, maybe due to the presentation.\n\nLastly is the Tiramisu, saving grace to not get below 3 stars.\n\nOverall, not a place which we would be considering to go again.\n\nThis is my 5th visit to Poco Loco. Each visit I am always bowled over by the great food . This is a hidden gem at Upper Thomson. I have eaten at many Italian restaurants, I have to say the pasta here are extremely good, full of flavour and really satisfying . Not sure where did the chef previously came from but I dare say it is even as good as some of higher class restaurants like Etna. Highly recommend.\n\nValue for money! We tried PocoLoco for the first time and we really enjoyed our meal. We ordered 1 dinner set ($45), which consisted of an appetiser, 1 pasta dish, 1 main course and 1 dessert, there\u2019s an option to order a glass of wine for $8. We ordered an extra pasta dish with lamb as well. Portion was good (not too small/big) and our favourite was the pork collar main course (part of the dinner set). Price was nett and drinks were reasonably priced as well ($2 for jasmine green tea and other soft drinks). Overall it was enjoyable and value for money.\n\nGenerally the food is fresh and not too bad. We had mushroom soup, calamari, spaghetti carbonara, spaghetti arrabbiata, spaghetti vongole, Panna Cotta and chocolate flourless cake.The first 2 items and the last are worth trying. Could give the calamari a miss though. The restaurant is within 5mins walking distance from tel station exit 4.\n\nJun 2023. I always loved pocoloco Italian food. We got mushroom soups, seafood pasta and lasagne.\nNothing to complain about.\n",

The meat is really tender and well flavoured. Went well with the garlic and mashed potatoes. They do their mussels and clams really well. Mussels were juicy and cooked to perfection.

Tried it with my girlfriend for lunch.\n\nWhen entered, we were welcomed warmly by one of the servers and he ushered us to our table.\n\nMenu had a fair selection of food choices for us to choose. We each ordered a main and light bite to share.\n\nFood ordered:\n1. Pork Bulgogi pizza\n- lovely and tasty\n- thin and crispy regular base\n\n2. French Toast\n- portion was good 2 to share actually\n- bread was fluffy (think Brioche was used)\n\n3. Lazy Lizard wings (chef's recommendation)\n- honestly when it came was little disappointed to see it was like regular fried wings.

The highlight of the meal was the seafood stew. All the breads were also exceptionally delicious. However, the sea bass tasted very ordinary and the sky high price tag went to the showy \u2018performance\u2019 by the chef. Restaurant was too dim and had a funky smell.\n\nThe staff are very friendly and the food is also tasty. The portion is surprisingly big and we ate till our hearts content.\n\nStaff very helpful and polite. Atmosphere is chill with soft music. Food serve just in the right timing.  Of cause the price is not cheap. But it worth the price overall.\n\nLastly thanks for the birthday cake. Love it but we were too full to finish it.\n\nBooked Sunday afternoon to have their set lunch, only to find out they only serve buffet that day at $78++ per person. Opted in anyway and didn't regret it, given the fresh ingredients, great taste of Italian and friendly staffs! Personally I love the dessert section especially Panna Cotta! If I had to pick on something, it'd be the dim lighting. No discount on the bill even with Shangri-la Circle membership, but you do get extra points.\n\nRemember, when you get into the lobby, you are on 3F. You need to take an elevator to get down to 1F where the restaurant is.\n\nThe restaurant has decent ambience for a semi chic and comfortable dinning experience. The salt crusted fish is delicious and if you want to see some fire show. The winner for me is the crab pasta. Yum!\n\nWe celebrated our anniversary dinner here and it was a great decision! They generously presented us a complimentary cake, thank you for perfecting the night.\nAmong the dishes, we absolutely love the Porchetta. It was tender, yet crispy and flavourful, Highly recommended! While on the other side, we didn\u2019t like the potato pur\u00e9e in the braised lamb leg dishes. It may have ruined the experience with that main dish. Despite that, this would not stop us from giving 5 stars because the other aspects (service/ambience) make up to it. A great dining place for celebrations.\n",

Told to wait 5 minutes till they get the table ready.\nJoseph (manager) was really nice to manage us to get a standard table instead of a high table (where we placed earlier)\n\nGood menu for kids and adults. Ordered fish and chips for kids. They loved the fish, very light battered and crispy.\nWe ordered the hanger steak, and steak can only be  served as medium cook. Which is quite annoying when someone may prefer medium rare or other options. The steak portion is literally three pieces, not worth $42. Extensive drinks menu, ordered a lemongrass cocktail, which was very refreshing.\n\nOverall service, ambience is nice. Bit disappointed with the steak portion and pricing.\n\nThis place is always booked out, so advanced reservations are highly recommended. It's a great weekend family brunch place with a sizable playground and sand pit for kids to have some outdoor fun. The compound is big with lots of areas for kids to explore. It's a nice space with high ceilings and lots of natural light. The service is on point with a very attentive and warm team of wait staff. However, the food is not as good as I'd hoped, especially for the prices they charge. Overall, lovely space, good service, very kid friendly, OK food, high prices.\n\nMe and wife went for birthday and anniversary, staff was super amazing seeing we have baby they help us move seats inside. The ambiance was cozy specious and service was top notch. Food was a different style which we never had before and desert was just purely amazing too. We will come back again :)\n\nMade a reservation for 12:45pm lunch. Was slightly late but they called to double check and kept our reservation. Was for a birthday celebration and it\u2019s my second visit here. Their menu changes time to time and I have not tried their current menu before. Ordered 3 mains and all 3 mains are VERY good. Come and try for yourself. Staffs there are friendly and welcoming, one even joined for a birthday song for my friend. Overall, another good experience with Open Farm.\n\nWas here for a wedding a couple years back and been wanting to return\u2014 finally did! The atmosphere was great for a quiet and intimate dinner catch-up with friend. Dishes were great but rather small in portions; ordered 4 dishes + 2 desserts for sharing to have just filled the two of us up. Nonetheless, absolutely beautiful dishes! Hoping to be back soon for more!\n",

They served different alcoholic drinks, including their craft brew.\n\nDiners can view part of the golf course in this unenclosed establishment. The food wasn't spectacular but wasn't shabby too. One could get the typical western dishes here, besides the finger foods. No particular dish stood out to me or I haven't tried enough of them.\n\nThe atmosphere was good in the evening with the warm lighting but there were the occasional annoying insects.\n\nService was fine but it could be hard to get the staff's attention sometimes. It seems popular for families too. The location is inaccessible unless one drives. But there weren't enough reasons for me to drive all the way here just to dine.\n\nEver been to an eatery where you have relaxing ambience close to Mother Nature, coupled with great tasting food, throw in some nicely house brewed beers and background music? Yes this is the place - all rolled into one!\n\nTheir pizzas are very thinned crust with great cheeses and sliced salami. Another dish is their hummus and pita - came with four soft yet crusty pitas. Love their pasta and burgers too. Did I say the flamb\u00e9 waffles lit with flaming vodka and contrue liquor? Nicely done.\n\nWill come back again during the day to soak\nin the nature atmosphere.\n\nMicrobrewery restaurant at a public golf course is a good establishment. The IPA tasted  nice, but not all its brews were available, so I couldn't compare if others were as good. Humus was okay for bar bites, but $5 charge for additional pita would make the price a bit steep. Having the pita warmed was a nice touch!\n\nMy family all time favourite restaurant! We love their pizzas, steak and fries (which finally made its way on the menu again) and their deserts. The best part for us was the walk after our meals to the Rider's Cafe just around the corner where we call our cab from. It's a dark walk at night but we enjoy the chat along the short walk as we occasionally see some horses in the stable. It's all gone sadly and I hope the same fate doesn't befall upon this and the Thai restaurant across from them.\n\nCame here for coffee and dessert (apple crumble) which was nice.\n\nEnvironment: Nice spot to have a meal or drink as its surrounded by nature, that happens to be the downside as well. The place is literally crawling with insects and mosquitos are aplenty. Do bring some sort of repellent, i got bitten a fair bit.\n\nFood: The coffee ive ordered was strong and the apple crumble came adorned with fresh fruits and was quite nice.\n\nAccessibility: The parking is free and onsite. You probably wont consider this place unless you drive.\n\nPrice: Not fantastic but you have saved on parking anyway\n",

The menu price does not match the computer screen. Its hard to use not friendly user. But food came out ok lah. Nothing spectacular but it's what I expected for tourists trap places like this.\n\nI rate this place as the \u201cworst eatery\u201d in Singapore. in Salad for 15 sgd with salmon there is 10 grams of salmon itself! The cutlets in the burgers look like they were cooked yesterday, all the salt in the world was put in the fries, the freshly squeezed juices have no taste.\n\nAverage food quality with decent amount of serving. I would say it's like a cozy coffee shop with different varieties of food to choose from.\nIt's like HANS concept with affordable food and ample space for even big groups to dine in.\n\nGood food nice cozy place to sit! We ordered quite many things only thing is I didn\u2019t like the chicken nuggets! It was really weird textured on the other hand every other thing we ordered was good. There is a play area too so kids stay busy and let you eat in peace! One more thing there was just 1 host in day time so things were processing very slow.\n\nThe food menu needs alot of work. It's really a big mess now and ordering through the POS is very limiting.\n\nFood was ok, mostly packaged food taste. Basi lemak was but dry chicken. Lucky the Chili was good and rice ok.\n\nCoffees are in tiny cups and feel expensive. Tea was not bad.\n\nReally wish we could do add-ons. Kaya toast set comes with drinks but no soft boil eggs. At least that's what it says on the POS. So we didn't order.\n\nMac and cheese all box type. Although next table has the little pizza which looked decent for kids. Mushroom soup was surprisingly good.\n\nBeautiful space, air con, indoor and outdoor play area for kids. just really hope they get their menu together. They have the staff for it just need to get organised.\n\n3 adults and a kid we spent $50+ for a 'light breakfast'. Many other items not shown in photos.\n",

Despite crowded, food serve was quick and doesn't have to wait long.\nWe ordered the seafood horfun and beehoon, bitter gourd black bean pork ribs, mince meat fried egg, hotplate tofu, cereal soft shell Crab and baby Kailan. All the dishes were delicious and flavourful. Not very salty and everything were fresh. Good food happy customers.\n\nThis place is quite popular with the locals. While the area is being upgraded, it is not very accessible. I do like the Prawn Minced Meat Rolls and Sweet Sour Sliced Fish are excellent options. Baby Kai Lan is too hard for older people. Coffee Pork Rib is a bit bland. Cereal Prawns are pretty lovely. Home-Made Tofu with Minced Meat is disappointing - while the meat is flavourful, the tofu doesn\u2019t absorb the flavour, so you get a too salty feeling from the meat, but the tofu is tasteless. The salted fish fried rice is well received, so do try it.\n\nLovely place to it Hongkong food, such as Assam Fish Head, Cereal Chicken, Chicken Wings, Prawn Paste Chicken, Tofu with Minced Meat, etc. Located in Novena area, this is a lovely restaurant to visit for sure if you like Chinese/Hongkong casual food. Affordable price also.\n\ngreat zhi char food.\nassam fish head is very nice. the paste is homemade.\nxo beehoon fish soup\u2019s soup is refillable.\nfried prawn roll is crispy and lots of fillings.\n\nA reasonably priced restaurant with good tasting Chinese food. The oil soaked croaker fish was super crispy. We crunch crunch crunch almost every part of the fish. The sauce was not too salty and just nice to eat on its own without rice. The braised brinjal was really flavouful and umami, best to eat with rice. Will definitely go back again.\n",

                  "reviews": "\n\nWonderful service by a group of young and well trained staff (all females waitresses!) the place is very kids friendly, kids can enjoy outdoor play freely while parents can watch over their meals. The patio is huge can host long tables and it's airy even on a hot day. Like the simple but tasty food choices.\n\nStopped for coffee after lunch, very cosy cafe placed in dempsey.\n\nOpen level cafe with indoor and outdoor settings. They have a small play area for kids to play, which is equipped with swing, hanging  rods, etc. Staff is attentive and service with a smile.\n\nWe ordered cappuccino and fresh juices for kids. Coffee was delicious, right temperature and good flavour.\n\nDefinitely recommended to check out if in the dempsey area.\n\nIt's a really nice spot for a family weekend brunch at Dempsey Hill. There is a playground with really rustic contraptions for kids to enjoy and for parents to snap some nice pictures. There is a second playground, but a paid membership is required to access the exclusive area. A prepayment of $20 per diner is required to secure a reservation. The food tasted fresh, and the portions are sizable. The service staff are very friendly and welcoming. Overall, it was a great weekend brunch experience for the family with good food and excellent service.\n\nLate update but it should be recorded. Had a really nice Christmas lunch there in last Dec!!\n\nFood, decor and service are all good! Just like went to a cozy restaurant in an European city! We like the appetizers much! Salad sauce is fresh with great balance on the portion. Pizza is crispy and yummy. Main courses are coming with different side dishes. All tasted great. Just the dessert a bit below our expectation.\n\nThey served gingerbread cookies to us which is unexpected. And the Santa and Elf family visit really surprised our kids! They can pick a small gift from the Santa\u2019s bag!\n\nThere\u2019s little playground and IG photo spots for the kids in outdoor area. It\u2019s nice whatever you\u2019re sitting in indoor or outdoor area.\n\nI\u2019m thinking to come again in Easter Holiday and see what program they will have.\n\nAT feast Singapore, Dempsey venue and the Private Dining space were apt for our occasion. Staff were pleasant and supportive. It is a kids friendly venue. Food was amazing. Kids had a wonderful time and they loved it which is the ultimate barometer of satisfaction.\n\nOverall a wonderful experience for us and the kids alike. Would highly recommend.\n\nSpecial kudos to\nDiana- Events Supervisor for all the communications, arrangements and coordination\nAzrin- Operations Manager for all the support during the event\nAn- Service staff for \u2018Going the Extra Mile\u2019 support.\n\nThank you.\n",

Ordered their all-day breakfast and it was really awesome! Great place for gathering. The interior decor are filled with vintage items. Super love this place, will definitely visit again. Not forgetting the staffs who are friendly and attentive!\n\nIt\u2019s one of my family\u2019s regular haunt. A rustic place that is tranquil, rejuvenate us from strained. Food is considered exorbitant though but hot beverages and deserts are reasonable. My buddy from Malaysia is amused with all the antiques/retro displays, nostalgic.\n\nCelebrated our birthdays here just this evening and really enjoyed the entire experience. First of all, because this place is located in such a cosy and exclusive part of Changi, the surroundings were serene and peaceful. Ambience within the cafe was very good too - Lighting, furniture, and decorations were very unique! Service and food was of high quality! I appreciate that we had a table with a nice corner and view! The wagyu cubes, octopus salad, and mussels / clams pot were delicious! Lamb chops were tasty too, but the cut we had was slightly too fat. Been here before some years ago, but only tried the breakfast and brunch. Will be very happy and excited to come back to try more food! Also happy that there\u2019s beer on tap! Parking is free as well!\n\nThis charming and peaceful location is perfect for enjoying a delightful brunch. Tucked away from the main road, it requires a leisurely 7-minute walk from the nearest bus stop. The restaurant offers both indoor and outdoor seating options, and we opted for the latter. While their brunch menu is limited, the dishes are of high quality, albeit a bit on the expensive side. Nonetheless, the food is delicious, and the romantic ambiance makes it an ideal spot for a date.\n\nSlightly pricey but with good ambiance. Restaurant has a lot of rustic stuff for u to explore. Fried chicken not worth ordering. Kids meal taste relatively blend but healthy perhaps. Overall there can be better place out there in terms of price and food quality.\n",

Also the vegetable on the side was delicious.\nFor the drink, I ordered tea(forget the name, but it's a no-sugar tea). It was refreshing!\nIt's worth coming if you'd like to have dining with a museum view :)\n\nIt's a really lovely space in the National Museum of Singapore to be having your meal. It feels like you are dining outdoors, but indoors. It's bright with natural light, and you get to enjoy the building's architecture from the inside. The service is good, but the food is mediocre at best. Food was not bad by any means, but it was just normal. I would definitely go back because the ambiance makes it quite the experience, and it is really kid-friendly. My daughter had a blast!\n\nMore than just a casual spot to nip into for coffee and light bites after your museum visit. Attended a private event here some months back and was pleasantly surprised by the finesse of the cooking. Both mains were memorable and very well executed.  Lovely and competent staff as well.\n\nDidn't try the food but I must say it smells good from the other tables. However, the coffee is a disappointment. Sour after taste even on a latte. The black coffee make it unbearable to swallow. Nevertheless, price is reasonable. Overall a good place to chill & rest after a long walk at the museum.\n\nGreat environment! Feel like alfresco dining but in an aircon environment. Not enough service but the overall feel is still as long as one brings a great partner. Can't complain.\n",

                  "reviews": "\n\nToday, I came early for the birthday celebration. I witness a horrible event, there was a boy saying about the cafe owner smoking in the compound where there is a kindergarten and he didn\u2019t report it. The cafe owner slammed the door. In my view, although I enjoyed the celebration but this shouldn\u2019t be the case. There should be rules and regulations in place. I was reading the comments. The uncle is really hot tempered person.\n\nIf I can give a zero star I would. After my swim, I went to the left most side of the multi purpose room next to the brick wall and switched on the lights at that corner. Chatting with my friend in not more than 10minutes, the cafe uncle came and rudely interrupted us. He said in a harsh and unfriendly tone \u201cwho ask you to on the lights? I\u2019m paying rent you know?\u201d. Excuse me, but there is no sign saying not to switch on the lights at this corner as far as I know the cafe\u2019s corner is next to the glass wall. How I know? Because the first time I patronised this space, the same uncle scolded me for using his table next to the glass and told me to move to the side of the wall. Today, 17/10/2023, 9:13pm, he is again at his rude behaviour. I told him I didn\u2019t know that this area is part of his tenancy, there wasn\u2019t any sign stating anything of what he claimed, and as far as I know the clubhouse is open till 10pm. So I told the uncle why not you put a sign so that would prevent such things from happening in the future. But he, again rudely dismissed me saying if you don\u2019t want to listen then don\u2019t la, gesturing as he said that. My goodness I have not met such a rude old person before. You would think that age makes a person mellow. I would suggest people to be careful for this man and his attitude. Nothing against the food just the person working here.\n\nI have been living in Braddel for the last 5 years and the clubhouse area used to be for residents to use as a place to eat or socialise. Other condo I have visited also have such facilities for people to gather, whether it is for people to sit and chat, read a book, study their subject, throw a potluck or have a Mooncake Festival - the whole point is that such a space is multi-purpose. I share some of the views of the reviewers about the lack of service standard/poor attitude from the uncle of the shop. His behaviour is harsh and rude. The incident happened a few months back, I didn\u2019t want to bother writing it here but I bumped into him again and I\u2019m just surprised that the cafe management is not helping him improve his behaviour. Thinking that the multipurpose hall was what is it, and there wasn\u2019t any no outside food sign anywhere or is there is line demarcating the cafe space from the public space and what more the tables were all different. My friend and I sat at a corner studying then the uncle came and said this is not for us to study and use his electricity (in a rude tone). I told him as the operator he should put up signs to tell people at least, have that courtesy and not just blast people with his unruly tone. He then defended himself by saying the condo manager should be the one putting up the signs. Effectively pushing the responsibility to someone else. If the tables belongs to the operator, then the operator should at least put sign stating their policy. It is what most cafes or eateries do- \u201cno outside food\u201d, \u201cno using of tables without making any purchase from Jio Makan\u201d, etc. there are many ways to prevent misunderstandings, so why leave potential customers this sour experience? Also, there weren\u2019t many people on that day too maybe just 4 tables mostly occupied by students, it is not like we are hogging the place and disrupting their business. This uncle and the cafe operator couldn\u2019t see the long term gain, that while we are studying we might get hungry or thirsty and people may patronise them. Totally short-sighted. So be warned if you visit this place, the uncle is very sensitive.\n\nNice chill place in Bradell heights which I come to know that outsiders are permit to patronise. The snacks are nice and reasonable in price and the sour plum drinks are perfect to take away the greasy food.\n\nOtah fries with dip was unique and yummy. Hot tea was fairly good to my liking. But for those who like it thick, you might need to tell them gao.\n",

Maybe it\u2019s the Japanese families dining around you, but it feels exactly like Japan in this place. Although the food isn\u2019t the best, there is a warm homely flavour to the dishes. Had the seasonal special Hamburg rice with demi-glace sauce and was pleasantly surprised by the huge portion, with the beef being tender and not too gamey. Special shout-out for the salmon head which also comes in a generous portion for a very reasonable price!\n\nDo take note that only members may gain entry or bring guests to dine at the restaurants within the Japanese Association.\n\nWe adjourned here for desserts and coffee after lunch at Akane.  The staff here are friendly and helpful.\n\nIf possible, request for the private room at the end if you are a large group.  There is a $10 surcharge but this can be waived.\n\nThere are special offers which include free flow beverages for $3 each if you order a mains or dessert.  It was well worth it, as we could try their cold brew coffee, cappuccino, mango juice and teas etc.\n\nWe enjoyed desserts like matcha ice cream, coffee with vanilla ice cream, mochi and cheesecake cup.\n\nYou need to be a member or signed in by one to enter Akane or Donguri.\n\nHokkaido milk soft serve is the best.\nRestaurant closes at 8.30pm.\nMember only venue.\n\nThe service and taste must be good because it\u2019s the Japanese restaurant in the heart of Japanese Association... did look fine to me.\n\nThe dishes like set menu, donburi, and assorted sushi are around $20 should be good pricing. I actually felt like ordering Unagi Bento with a free drink bar for $27 or so...\n\nThe problem is, only the Japanese Association members or the escorted guests can dine there and I had to leave the place just before ordering like a guy in a wrong place.\n\nRestaurant is located inside of Japanese Association building, and need to be accompanied with member. Variation of food is quite good, covering from Japanese, Chinese to Western option. Quality of food is also good. Location could be a challenge as no MRT nearby (accessible only by bus).\n",

Staff was attentive and helpful (despite the busy evening). Only let down was that the mains were not served together and the soup served was different from what was included in the set). Would have been great if this was relayed earlier.\n\nCame to dine on a weekend, so had to wait for table as it\u2019s crowded. The food is nice and value for money. The beef is done to the medium I wanted, chicken chop also tastes good. And they have Stella beer on tap at a very good price. Will definitely come back again.\n\nHidden in the heartlands, this restaurant serve excellent western food at affordable prices. The meat of the lamb shank was tender. Fish and chip was value for money as the fish slices were thick and not thinly sliced. Cheese oyster was excellent. An overall excellent experience.\n\nA nice and cozy neighborhood western restaurant shop. More like German than Nepalese.Quite crowded during holiday, make reservation. Food is good. Steak ribeye taste better than A***n. Oxtail is best. Pork Knuckles is huge and need to wait for 1/2hour or pre-order.\n\nI chanced upon this old restaurant and read good reviews on this restaurant.\nThe restaurant was almost full but the staff managed to get us a table for 6.\nWe ordered the western food set lunches and the food was generous and good.\nAll the lunch sets comes with soup of the day, drinks, mains and desserts.\nWill come and try their Nepalese specialty the next time.\n",

Went there for lunch with wifey as we wanted to grab some fresh meat at butchery. Ordered 2 soup to go along with our main. She ordered potato soup and onion soup for me. Before the soup arrived, we were served with their in house baguette and butter. It was so so good especially the butter. Main were served hot from kitchen, portions were good for the price and we left the bistro with our happy stomach. Wish they can offer ribeye in time to come. They were having Oktoberfest menu too. Do drop by! Will definitely return. Thank you\n\nHad an outdoor seating which was sooo hot. They gave a time limit of 1 hour but was happy to let us hang around if there wasn\u2019t too busy. Food wise was ok but nothing spectacular. Has a children\u2019s playground at the side so lots of family groups were there. would recommend the onion soup and creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e but sirloin was underwhelming. Great that it had lots of vegetables at the side.\n\nHad fresh onion soup that warmed us up . Thereafter we shared the mains of short rib and pork cordon blue .\n\nThe short rib served tender w mixed flavour between savoury meat and sweet caramelised onion, and tinge of horseradish . And pork cordon blue toughen up texture in breaded form and broaden the palate w some greens .\n\nEnjoy the meals as much as the shopping later .\n\nThis place have very good beer and western foods. I highly recommend as service are good and foods are excellent. Only downside are the outdoor seating only got small wall fans and the downlight are too strong and sharp make me felt warmer on a sunny day dinner. Last to mention that the portion are quite big.\n\nNice food!\nRevisited, food n service are great \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\nPlants in the garden were healthy, nice to have plant labels.\nAlso playground for kids while waiting for seats.\nSupermarket offers wide selection of meat, snacks, fresh vegetables etc!\n",

The steak was served dry and raw which when we complained was taken back, warmed and served back. 18$ truffle fries were soggy and salty. We paid like 250$ for 3 dishes and dessert.\n\nA romantic place for lovers. Surrounded by nature and good food. There's nothing to not like here.\nAmidst lush greenery and pristine forest air, it's truly \"Love's in the air\".\nYou can't help falling in love after this.\nFinish the meal with a kiss \ud83d\udc8b to seal in the memories. \u2764\ufe0f.\nBy the way, menu is also halal.. \ud83d\ude0a\n\nThe place is great. Not noisy on a weekday. Staff were excellent. Food options was good. Pricing felts a little on the high side. Restaurant has kids menu option - one of the pasta choice didnt taste great. Serving portion is good.\n\nIt was a work dinner where we pre ordered the items of the set menus. I had the Wagyu rump steak which was really good, no gamey taste and very juicy. Dessert was Valrhona chocolate tart which was so sinfully good, very chocolatey. The Halia also served complimentary matcha and banana chocolate macaroons.\n\nThe place was very nice, covered with greenery.\nService was great, staffs were attentive and food was served timely spaced out.\nNot a place that\u2019s very accessible unless you drive or take a hired ride. If you don\u2019t drive, it\u2019s a little hard to get a ride out.\n\nThe food here is fantastic. They are masters with flavour and use of herbs. It\u2019s so in line with the whole experience of dining in the Botanical Gardens. For starters, the Octopus and duck are a must try. For Mains, get the scallops (they come with Barramundi). Both are great and served with beautiful balsamic vinegar (not the supermarket kind).\n",

Delicious \ud83d\ude0b\n\nVery decent Thai food for its price. Used to be cheaper and came here a lot when studying at a school nearby. Prices went up since 2017 but the food is excellent. The Thai Beef green curry is a must get, so is the basil sauce fish fillet. It is closed from 3-6pm so take note. Recently they seem to start taking reservations, so if you have a big group might want to call earlier to get seats. The Thai milk tea and lemon grass drinks are very nice!\n\nComfort meal with decent Thai food.\nWe\u2019ve dined at this outlet several times, good quality food is served here. If you enjoy milky curry, do give their green curry a try, tastier when soaked in the pineapple rice. Their appetizers are all good too, prawn cake is our favourite. Yummy Thai iced tea and green milk tea, sadly the mango sticky rice is always sold out. Take note that Jai Thai doesn\u2019t serve Thai pork dishes.\n\nDecent Thai food with reasonable price. I personally love their fried \u201cKang Kong\u201d and clear tomyam soup. Will try out other Thai dishes, green beef curry, pandan chicken, etc in the future\u2026\n\nBeen eating here for many years, maybe my own taste buds have changed as well but the food doesn't seem as good. A bit too sweet like every other generic thai food chain.\n\nOther than that the prices have gone up and portions have gone down, but that can be said for most places since COVID so it's understandable\n",

Alfresco was cooling and chill vibes.\nTruffle mushroom pizza is one of the best I have ever eaten. Not too creamy, just nice. Truffle has a complex taste, nothing monotonous like the cheap gas smell.\n\nSeafood pasta was also great, strong umami taste with a touch of spicy\n\nAmazing food, one of the best dinners I've eaten, ever.\n\nBoth crabmeat pasta and truffle pizza were delicious and exceeded our expectations. Thin crust pizza paired with mushrooms and truffle oil, mmmm.\n\nOur lava cake took a while as the first had an incident. That was fine. However, the second one came and it wasn't lava'ish. No chocolate flow and it was just warm which is disappointing.\n\nAnother issue is no free tap water which I had an issue with. It's $2 for water which is non-refillable.\n\nStaff service and the other two food were impeccable. Will definitely return to try other dishes, probably skip the lava cake.\n\nFood is above average. Atmosphere is great and not overpowering. Dog friendly. Staff are generally attentive, younger staff tends to be more casual and overlooking details. Indoor is ac, outdoor is open and dog friendly.\n\nA quiet dining place within the bishan park. Easy to park your car and short walk to the restaurant. Food were nice and a variety of wine and beer with happy hours will 8pm. A good place to chill, happy and drink.\n\nRelatively standard menu. Limited vegetation options. I ordered the Margerita pizza.\nThe service of food was prompt and the staff was quite polite.\nThe taste wasn't bad but not exceptional and gave me the feeling that the menu is a bit overpriced.\nThe indoor seating can get a bit noisy due to the canopy styled roof and echo. There is an outdoor seating option that also allows you to bring pets I think.\nOne thing I wasn't too happy with, was the cleanliness of the toilet.\nIts a nice option to go with if you are in the vicinity but keep expectations moderate.\n",

However, after consulting with Feast with JJ on what I would like to achieve based on my training goals and training scheduled - they recommended a meal plan to accommodate my needs and most importantly within my budget.\n\nWhen the meals were received, it was very different as the meals were very focused on a balanced diet vs \u201chealthy\u201d or \u201cnutritional\u201d diet which surprised me at first.  After trying it for a two weeks, I noticed the differences it made an impact on my body and how it helped with my training.\n\nNot only do Feast with JJ focuses on providing balanced meal plans for individuals or for the general - they are also able to accommodate customised meals accordingly to individual needs within the shortest amount of notice (that\u2019s customer centricity, flexible and agile).  They customised a meal plan for me immediately for a period of two weeks to achieve my goal for a scheduled event.\n\nFeast with JJ has changed my perspective on the diet and nutritional requirements for any body type.  They have earned my trust and confidence in providing balanced meals for my needs (or anyone) and would highly recommend reaching out to them if you are ready to make a change to your diet and nutritional requirements.\n\nLastly, I have stopped choosing my meals and left it to Chef Jade to decide on my daily meal despite being picky with my food.  Lastly, for those who feels like having a cheat day - hands down to their Tiramisu and Banana bread.\n\nThanks to the team at Feast with JJ\nIG: fs2992_fitness_journey\n\nReally awesome experience! Needed a specific diet to recover from some medical issues, was initially very doubtful that healthy food would taste good, and even more doubtful about certain cuisines that I already know that I dislike.. but gave it a shot and totally love the food! Jade is very knowledgeable and is able to cater the diet to specific needs even for a very picky eater. The best part is not needing to choose what to eat because that will result in ordering the same old stuff repeatedly. There is a good rotation of meals, meats, cuisines and cooking styles so it doesn't get boring. Been on it for 3 weeks and just signed up for another month. Also recommended to my friends! :) Thank you for healing me with food, Jade!\n\nRepeated so many times,bundle menu, all the menu are superb! Its taste so good and very pleasant.\nThank you to Jade for the very friendly response and always helps to served the best for me and my friends. The party menu also super duper delicious.. nyummmphhhh...!!\n\nI'm a Fitness professional with pretty strict diet requirements. I had tried several other meal prep options before but none I could stick with for more than 2 weeks. Either the food would be too old or utterly tasteless or the measurements suspect. However once I've started doing my meal preps with #FeastwithJJ it's just been absolutely great and bang on with the taste. Needless to say,  I'm quite picky and demanding when it comes to food and Jade has always been able to meet my demands and surpass them. Keep up the awesome work and God bless Jade, the awesome chef \ud83d\ude0a\n\nRepeated orders with FeastwithJJ for my family and got them to deliver to friends as gifts too.\u00a0 Delicious wholesome food, good portion, healthy and Halal. Love their selection of pasta and bowls. My personal favourites are the Bolognese Ragu Bianca and the Mexican Beef bowl. You must try their decadent Tiramisu,\u00a0 a family recipe prepared by the Italian Chef Jade. FeastwithJJ is highly recommended.\n",

                  "reviews": "\n\nAn unassuming prata shop but one of the best prata I've had! Coin prata is a must order, love how crispy it is. Plain prata is flaky and egg prata is soft and pillowy. The fish curry here is so good. So flavourful and can get free refills. There's usually a queue, it's quite an okay queue, about 15 mins. Definitely coming again!\n\nOverall, I feel that the prata is not particularly outstanding. However, their gravy is definitely above average. Very flavourful but also very spicy. In fact a little too spicy for me. Mutton is quite tender.\n\nThe coin prata is very crispy and I believe they are famous for it.\n\nTotal damage is $16 which I thought is quite pricey although they gave a generous amount of mutton.\n\nEasily one of the BEST Prata! Crispy on the outside, chewy on every bite. You have that balance of crispiness and the doughs chewiness. Everything is well cooked and left the pan at the right timing.\n\nThe magic complimenting the prata is the savoury sauce, curry... Yum yum!\n\nMust EAT!\n\nHidden gem in a coffeeshop!\n\nSin Ming Roti Prata serves up very well done pratas in a coffeeshop that has a decent selection of foods. Their menu is extensive boasting 19 different sorts of prata (whether they are available all day, I'm not sure)!\n\nOrdered 1 egg and 1 kosong today and paid $3.30 for that. A look at their cooking process shows 4 people around the prata grill, 2 'shapers' and the main prata-flipper whom I assume is the boss, leading his other subordinate over the grill. They also seem to cook it slower, and with less oil used compared to other establishments.\n\nThe kosong was served fluffed up, whilst having a decent enough amount of crispy parts. The egg prata felt like i was biting into a soft pillow of dough and egg. Very enjoyable indeed! Their dough has a tinge of sweetness to it too - I would know since I have my pratas without sugar or curry. Honestly, they are one of the better prata shops around, and their daily morning crowd is proof of that.\n\n@goodfoodwrite - instagram & YouTube\n\nOne of the best if not the best roti prata I have tried in Singapore. The coin prata was crispy and fragrant, and the plain prata was equally crispy with slight chewiness. The curry has a hint of tangy taste. Overall a nice combination.\n",

As for the taste, not much of surprise in any way.\n\nThe Arrabiata pasta (not fresh pasta) didn't gave the woah effect in any way as well. Saving grace was the fresh prawns.\n\nMy wife tried the Gnocchi with gorgonzola. Pasta (fresh) texture wasn't good, sauce not really to our likely.\n\nAnother disappointment is the dessert from the set lunch, which we had ordered the flourless Chocolate cake. Look at the picture and you will understand. Taste, so-so, maybe due to the presentation.\n\nLastly is the Tiramisu, saving grace to not get below 3 stars.\n\nOverall, not a place which we would be considering to go again.\n\nThis is my 5th visit to Poco Loco. Each visit I am always bowled over by the great food . This is a hidden gem at Upper Thomson. I have eaten at many Italian restaurants, I have to say the pasta here are extremely good, full of flavour and really satisfying . Not sure where did the chef previously came from but I dare say it is even as good as some of higher class restaurants like Etna. Highly recommend.\n\nValue for money! We tried PocoLoco for the first time and we really enjoyed our meal. We ordered 1 dinner set ($45), which consisted of an appetiser, 1 pasta dish, 1 main course and 1 dessert, there\u2019s an option to order a glass of wine for $8. We ordered an extra pasta dish with lamb as well. Portion was good (not too small/big) and our favourite was the pork collar main course (part of the dinner set). Price was nett and drinks were reasonably priced as well ($2 for jasmine green tea and other soft drinks). Overall it was enjoyable and value for money.\n\nGenerally the food is fresh and not too bad. We had mushroom soup, calamari, spaghetti carbonara, spaghetti arrabbiata, spaghetti vongole, Panna Cotta and chocolate flourless cake.The first 2 items and the last are worth trying. Could give the calamari a miss though. The restaurant is within 5mins walking distance from tel station exit 4.\n\nJun 2023. I always loved pocoloco Italian food. We got mushroom soups, seafood pasta and lasagne.\nNothing to complain about.\n",

Delicious \ud83d\ude0b\n\nVery decent Thai food for its price. Used to be cheaper and came here a lot when studying at a school nearby. Prices went up since 2017 but the food is excellent. The Thai Beef green curry is a must get, so is the basil sauce fish fillet. It is closed from 3-6pm so take note. Recently they seem to start taking reservations, so if you have a big group might want to call earlier to get seats. The Thai milk tea and lemon grass drinks are very nice!\n\nComfort meal with decent Thai food.\nWe\u2019ve dined at this outlet several times, good quality food is served here. If you enjoy milky curry, do give their green curry a try, tastier when soaked in the pineapple rice. Their appetizers are all good too, prawn cake is our favourite. Yummy Thai iced tea and green milk tea, sadly the mango sticky rice is always sold out. Take note that Jai Thai doesn\u2019t serve Thai pork dishes.\n\nDecent Thai food with reasonable price. I personally love their fried \u201cKang Kong\u201d and clear tomyam soup. Will try out other Thai dishes, green beef curry, pandan chicken, etc in the future\u2026\n\nBeen eating here for many years, maybe my own taste buds have changed as well but the food doesn't seem as good. A bit too sweet like every other generic thai food chain.\n\nOther than that the prices have gone up and portions have gone down, but that can be said for most places since COVID so it's understandable\n",

Amano's does great pizzas which are generously sized with a nice crunchy crust and fluffy dough.\nThe rocket and prosciutto pizza is reliably good. Prawn and bacon was also excellent.\nLook out for their weekday promos which are an exceptional deal for the taste and quality of the food.\nStaff were polite and kept our water glasses topped up.\nGood place for a nice and laid-back weeknight dinner.\nParking can be tricky since it's in a residential area, but normally don't have to walk too far to get one one weekdays.\nI find the tiramisu a tad cloying on the sweetness, would give other options a go next visit.\n\nAs this place is quite hidden amongst the private estate enclave, there is little crowd and no need for reservations (even on Friday evening).\nDecent Italian food with oven baked pizza! The best dish was the seafood risotto! Yummy!\n\nAmano is probably one of the best kept secrets for those looking for budget (relative to the usually more upscale options) Italian food. One of the main reasons for this is its location - it is located deep inside a private estate at a standalone row of shophouses. Unless you drive, you'll probably have to do a fair bit of walking to reach it. If you drive though, you can park for free along the road just outside. The food itself is really nice, especially the pastas and pizzas. Despite being a relatively small joint, they do have one of those huge traditional pizza ovens and I understand that their dough is made in-house. Can't comment on the other types of dishes on the menu but the pastas and pizzas are generally a safe bet. Do not that the pizzas are huge so you can definitely share one among two, or even three persons! The place itself is usually empty so you can just pop by and eat without too much fuss. Strongly recommend if you're willing to travel abit!\n\nA hidden gem in the middle of a neighborhood. Only way to get there is to drive.\n\nFood in general is a good variety and decent quality. Prices are much friendlier than the other Italian restaurants in the Bukit Timah area. And service has been excellent.\n\nDinner for 3: Had 2 starters (burrata/ prosciutto platter and bread basket), 3 mains (1 pizza, 1 seafood pasta and 1 lamb gnocci), 2 glasses of wine.\n\nEnjoyed the food, though I thought the gnocci was a bit too salty - probably won't get 2 tomato based ones next time. Whilst generous with the cheese on the Pizza, I reckon the restaurant can do better with a better selection of parmesean topping for pastas.\n",

The highlight of the meal was the seafood stew. All the breads were also exceptionally delicious. However, the sea bass tasted very ordinary and the sky high price tag went to the showy \u2018performance\u2019 by the chef. Restaurant was too dim and had a funky smell.\n\nThe staff are very friendly and the food is also tasty. The portion is surprisingly big and we ate till our hearts content.\n\nStaff very helpful and polite. Atmosphere is chill with soft music. Food serve just in the right timing.  Of cause the price is not cheap. But it worth the price overall.\n\nLastly thanks for the birthday cake. Love it but we were too full to finish it.\n\nBooked Sunday afternoon to have their set lunch, only to find out they only serve buffet that day at $78++ per person. Opted in anyway and didn't regret it, given the fresh ingredients, great taste of Italian and friendly staffs! Personally I love the dessert section especially Panna Cotta! If I had to pick on something, it'd be the dim lighting. No discount on the bill even with Shangri-la Circle membership, but you do get extra points.\n\nRemember, when you get into the lobby, you are on 3F. You need to take an elevator to get down to 1F where the restaurant is.\n\nThe restaurant has decent ambience for a semi chic and comfortable dinning experience. The salt crusted fish is delicious and if you want to see some fire show. The winner for me is the crab pasta. Yum!\n\nWe celebrated our anniversary dinner here and it was a great decision! They generously presented us a complimentary cake, thank you for perfecting the night.\nAmong the dishes, we absolutely love the Porchetta. It was tender, yet crispy and flavourful, Highly recommended! While on the other side, we didn\u2019t like the potato pur\u00e9e in the braised lamb leg dishes. It may have ruined the experience with that main dish. Despite that, this would not stop us from giving 5 stars because the other aspects (service/ambience) make up to it. A great dining place for celebrations.\n",

With every pride and passion possible, each dish is carefully prepared with excellent taste. The service is exceptionally pleasant with an original Italian taking you through their signature dishes.\n\n2 recommendations here. Reserve your table way in advance. Parking is ample at Guthrie House behind.\n\nThe Italian food here is very authentic. They use fresh ingredients. The ingredients look simple but the aroma and taste of the dishes are very flavourful.\nIt was super busy and packed during mother's day, but the Italian owner was very approachable and friendly, and tried his best to get us our reserved table as soon as possible as the previous seating was late.\nLove their pistachio gelato with bailey shot. It's really \ud83d\udc4d.\nWill definitely visit again!\n\nVery pleasant Italian cuisine! The food is the attraction here, wouldn't rate the ambience and the service as 5 because it's just not there. However the food served was really scrumptious. Highly recommend the lamb steak. Would come back for the food again.\n\nIt was a pleasant visit, although I expected more as this is an authentic Italian restaurant. It was for a girlfriend\u2019s birthday treat and we were served 2 slices of plain bread after ordering. It came with olive oil and balsamic vinegar but no side nor small plates were provided. So we ended up pouring the dips onto our main dining plate. No butter was served either.\nThe $58 mixed grilled meat platter was delectable. The lamb and pork belly were enjoyable. The salad was served was limp and there was no crunch nor freshness\n\nWe asked for mint sauce and the server wasn\u2019t sure and said would check if available. Few minutes later, she served us brown sauce instead. We didn\u2019t want to trouble the crew and decided to stick with the brown sauce. The meat was already tasty and we wanted the mint sauce to balance the taste. Nonetheless, I wonder if mint sauce was available as this is an Italian restaurant. I totally respect the original taste of the meats and used the brown sauce only sparingly. Service was friendly. Paid $123 for 2 mains (a pasta and mixed grill) and a bottle of sparkling water.\n",

Nevertheless, we still patronize them as the savings on the 10% service charge as member helps to defray the costs of the meal. In addition, the roast duck is nicely done - crispy skin and juicy meat on the inside.

The food, service and atmosphere are nothing short of excellent.\n\nFor those who like spicy, find the chicken in the chill is a must order! The barramundi dish left a very good impression in my dining experience.\n\nOverall, highly recommend for you to come down and try! I will definitely come back again to try the other dishes.\n\nYou have to give this restaurant a try. This is my 3rd visit. I have always enjoyed their food. Presentation is top notch, like a piece of art. Though it's fusion food, the flavours of East and West are cohesive. In my opinion, the people who created the dishes have a profound knowledge of flavours and texture. Who would have thought of grilled octopus and feta cheese? Amazing flavours!\n\nSome of the best modern twist to Chinese food. I absolutely loved every dish I tried when I was there. Here are two of my favourite dishes.\nI spent my 18th anniversary there with my wife and we were absolutely impressed! I will definitely dine with you guys again! Unforgettable\n\nA very carefully designed location for a well-balanced preparation of such a lavish selection of appetisers, entrees, and desserts. Not to mention the coffee and cocktails they offer.\n\nService was also top-notch, from greeting us to showing us to our table, taking our orders, taking our pictures, and repeatedly checking to make sure everything was okay on our end.\n\nYou get the impression that everyone is catching up and having a good time, which somehow makes a romantic dinner seem more informal. Friends catching up and couples enjoying a good supper together make up 80/20 of the crowd.\n\nEverything about the experience was wonderful, including the ambiance, the cuisine, the service, and even how clean the restrooms were.\n\nWell done Birds of A Feather team and management. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK! SINGAPORE needs more places like yours. Congratulations for a job well done!\n\nFood - super good. Must try pork belly\n\nService - unsatisfactory. The staff appeared rushed and lacked patience. Despite our attempts to get their attention on four separate occasions, our efforts were disregarded, leaving us feeling overlooked and undervalued.\n\nAtmosphere - persistent noise and the intrusion of smoke odors\n",

Woooooow\u2026\u2026..\n\nMasala Dosa: was getting full after 2 dishes above\u2026 but still i enjoyed it\u2026 crispy layer and soft and chewy inner dough\n\nMasala tea: thick. customised sugar level adding sugar prepared on the table.\n\nwill visit many more times\u2026..\n\nMust visit place of you love South Indian cuisine. Be prepared for some waiting in the queue since it is very popular. But the turnaround time is very fast. Just love their Thalis with so many flavours, podi dosa, khali dosa, idli.\n\nThis is my all time favorite Southern Indian restaurant in Singapore! As a vegetarian, I always come back here for their dosas and idlies. If you find yourself in Little India/Farrer Park, you have to try here at least once!\n\nWell, I can\u2019t really find words to discribe the taste. It was just delicious and heavenly feeling to have this comfort food after a long flight.\n\nMTR has been best at what they do, I love their products \ud83d\ude18.\n\nSuper duper authentic South Indian food.\n\nPrice: $6.50 (Plain Thosai 1st Picture)\n$7.56 (Pudi Masala Thosai 2nd Picture)\n\nPlain Thosai: 5/5\nThe usual thickness of a thosai but was extremely crispy. Thosai was flavourful and slightly nutty.\n\nPudi Masala Thosai: 5/5\nCrispy on one side and soft on the other. Cheesy taste from the thosai likely from ghee. The pudi spice blend is savoury and quite spicy. The potato filling was really flavourful, soft, slightly sweet from the onions, very tasty.\n\nSambar: 5/5\nThe sambar was flavourful, bright, spicy and slightly sweet.\n\nChutney: 5/5\nGreen chutney was flavourful, coconuty and slightly minty.\n\nTotal score: 15/15\n\nAdd-ons: Uddin Vada ($3.24) was extremely delicious. Insanely crispy thin outer shell and soft inside. Filter Coffee ($3.20) was fragrant, tasty and a wonderful way to end the meal.\n\nI first ordered the Plain Thosai, finished it before I made my order for the remaining Pudi masala thosai, Uddin Vada and filter coffee. Not sure if it was coincidental or just amazing service but the Pudi masala thosai came next, and when I was just about finish, the Vada came. And shortly before I finished the filter coffee came. I was extremely impressed at the end of my meal.\n",

Maybe it\u2019s the Japanese families dining around you, but it feels exactly like Japan in this place. Although the food isn\u2019t the best, there is a warm homely flavour to the dishes. Had the seasonal special Hamburg rice with demi-glace sauce and was pleasantly surprised by the huge portion, with the beef being tender and not too gamey. Special shout-out for the salmon head which also comes in a generous portion for a very reasonable price!\n\nDo take note that only members may gain entry or bring guests to dine at the restaurants within the Japanese Association.\n\nWe adjourned here for desserts and coffee after lunch at Akane.  The staff here are friendly and helpful.\n\nIf possible, request for the private room at the end if you are a large group.  There is a $10 surcharge but this can be waived.\n\nThere are special offers which include free flow beverages for $3 each if you order a mains or dessert.  It was well worth it, as we could try their cold brew coffee, cappuccino, mango juice and teas etc.\n\nWe enjoyed desserts like matcha ice cream, coffee with vanilla ice cream, mochi and cheesecake cup.\n\nYou need to be a member or signed in by one to enter Akane or Donguri.\n\nHokkaido milk soft serve is the best.\nRestaurant closes at 8.30pm.\nMember only venue.\n\nThe service and taste must be good because it\u2019s the Japanese restaurant in the heart of Japanese Association... did look fine to me.\n\nThe dishes like set menu, donburi, and assorted sushi are around $20 should be good pricing. I actually felt like ordering Unagi Bento with a free drink bar for $27 or so...\n\nThe problem is, only the Japanese Association members or the escorted guests can dine there and I had to leave the place just before ordering like a guy in a wrong place.\n\nRestaurant is located inside of Japanese Association building, and need to be accompanied with member. Variation of food is quite good, covering from Japanese, Chinese to Western option. Quality of food is also good. Location could be a challenge as no MRT nearby (accessible only by bus).\n",

The prata is more doughy, less crispy so those who like doughy kind, will prefer this. Regular curry can be improved, quite watery. Price is higher probably because it is a standalone shop.

The food worth 2 stars. The meat was pretty hard, the starter was too sour. The dessert was really not able to match our taste. The house wines was tasteless, but the red wine taste better when it pair with the meat. I will strongly recommend you only order the red if you want to have their one for one house wine promo.\nOur bill was $128, you can get a much more better grilled meat platter and better food at other restaurants. :)\n\nLe Rida has a rustic ambience somewhat akin to an old time eating house in a small town. Quaint and homely\nFreshly baked pita bread with lemon chick pea hummus was delicious and filling\nMains of Lebanese lamb kafta kebab had the right balance of flavour and crunchiness.\nWash it all down with 1 for 1 Heineken draft at $17.90\n\nManager Sanjiv was both friendly and helpful in his recommendations and unlike in some establishments, he did not push you to over order.\nDefinitely worth a return visit!\n\nA quaint no frills dining place with excellent food and good service. The staff are simple people but are very hospitable, often checking in on the food quality and our experience. If you are looking for a good meal away from hustle and bustle, this is the place to go. Oh.. U can definitely have a conversation with your company and hear them loud and clear\n\nDidn't think the food was thaaaat amazing. Nor was the service. But at least they let us drink outside drinks.\nHOWEVER, i requested for no garnishing on my hummus. When the guy brought it over, there WAS parsley on it. And all he said was \"just pluck it out\". --.--\nSo if i was allergic to that, i should just pluck it out.... nice. The hummus wasn't good either. I've tasted better. Like a friend who went with me commented... it isn't creamy enough. Also, comments about the baklava was that it was too hard... and wasn't good.\n\nAbsolutely loved the food, I am heavily into Mediterranean food. I have tried most of the places around Bugis as well. The food here was so fresh, with perfect taste and presentation. It was completely worth it travelling from East.\nThe service was quick, the portion size was generous . We ordered mezze plateer and tabalu salad. They were scrumptious loved the customised heart shaped Pita bread. Hummus, was so creamy and so were all other dips.\n\nWould strongly recommend.. It has become one of my favourite place..\n",

                  "reviews": "\n\nThis is a nice restaurant tucked away in the SIM building. The restaurant was quite full for dinner as it appears there may have been a corporate function at the location which is not surprising. Nevertheless, the service was excellent and the staff were quite attentive despite the number of dinners. They have a good mix of Asian and Western food. The Nasi Kuning platter was good with lots of variety. Will come again to try the different dishes.\n\nHad a lovely and delectable time on a quiet Saturday night. Standouts were definitely the burrata tomato salad, buah keluak beef cheek with truffle risotto and the kaya banana crumble with gula Melaka ice cream. The burrata was fresh and creamy and paired well with the sweet and juicy tomatoes. Beef cheeks were cooked to perfection - soft, tender and melt in your mouth - and the buah keluak sauce doused over it was subtly nutty and moreish. The kaya banana crumble was the perfect ending to the meal; kaya custard layered with caramelised bananas, all encased within a crisp and delicately thin shell, topped with coconut crumble with gula melaka ice cream on the side. We\u2019ll be back for more!\n\nI had the privilege to enjoy a wine paring meal with Glug Glug Wines and Table at 7. The meal was well thought of and the wine pairings elevated the dishes. I am hard pressed to choose my favourite course but if I had to, it would be the scallop and uni dish.\n\nBesides the amazing meal, I was greeted with amazing and warm service from the team. Lastly, my glass and plate were never empty; a testament to the amazing and attentive service.\n\nWhat a joy, I am looking forward to my next meal at Table at 7!\n\nA friend organized lunch here and, overall, it was a good experience.  I liked the beef soup starter, even when the wagyu oxtail was changed, and I thought it was the best dish of my lunch.  A close second was the gado gado, with its fresh ingredients.  We also liked the sambal belachan which came with the empeng and keropok.\n\nThe mains were nasi lemak, mee goreng Java and ikan woku.  The nasi lemak was nice, but the chicken was too dry and difficult to cut, even with a knife.  The otah was okay, if a tad bland.  The noodle dish was pretty tasty, as was the fish rice.\n\nDessert was profiteroles, Indonesian bubur chacha and iced chendol.  The missus liked the chocolate profiteroles, while I found the chendol to be bland.  It had diced up jackfruit pieces and the attap chee was sliced into thin slices, but it could have used more gula Malacca and stronger coconut.  The banana in the bubur chacha was sour and past its used by date, so they were kind enough to replace it with a chendol, which was much better this time with more brown sugar.\n\nOur server, Joe, was friendly and even took the time to help groups with photo taking, even when he was the only waitstaff.\n\nParking is free, and the eatery is in rather a quiet spot.  Do note that some parking areas are reserved for faculty members.\n\nFirst time at this restaurant and it was an interesting experience. We had the Martell pairing dinner, which worked out to over $700 for 3 pax. The restaurant is located within the SIM campus along Namly Road, and it's quite an intimate setting, as the restaurant is pretty quiet. I imagine it to be a great place for a date. The food was tasty, but I had to have a snack after dinner. Service was really good. Attentive and friendly.\n",

Staff was attentive and helpful (despite the busy evening). Only let down was that the mains were not served together and the soup served was different from what was included in the set). Would have been great if this was relayed earlier.\n\nCame to dine on a weekend, so had to wait for table as it\u2019s crowded. The food is nice and value for money. The beef is done to the medium I wanted, chicken chop also tastes good. And they have Stella beer on tap at a very good price. Will definitely come back again.\n\nHidden in the heartlands, this restaurant serve excellent western food at affordable prices. The meat of the lamb shank was tender. Fish and chip was value for money as the fish slices were thick and not thinly sliced. Cheese oyster was excellent. An overall excellent experience.\n\nA nice and cozy neighborhood western restaurant shop. More like German than Nepalese.Quite crowded during holiday, make reservation. Food is good. Steak ribeye taste better than A***n. Oxtail is best. Pork Knuckles is huge and need to wait for 1/2hour or pre-order.\n\nI chanced upon this old restaurant and read good reviews on this restaurant.\nThe restaurant was almost full but the staff managed to get us a table for 6.\nWe ordered the western food set lunches and the food was generous and good.\nAll the lunch sets comes with soup of the day, drinks, mains and desserts.\nWill come and try their Nepalese specialty the next time.\n",

Haven't tried.\n\nIt was told food taste is really good , so came here and Waitress told to make an order from app for discounts and I did. Waited for 45 minutes food didn\u2019t arrive. Very lousy service. I don\u2019t recommend this place.\n\nGreat non Indian ambience with fantastic Indian food and crafted beers. Recommended.\n\nBeen there multiple times and loved the food almost every time. They have awesome lunch sets which are very reasonable as well.\n\nThe right match of quality and quantity. Would definitely recommend for lunch and snack fare.\n\nFor dinner, I would not recommend as I have found the food losses it's freshness when it was prepared during the lunch time.\n\nNevertheless, a do try.\n",

My kids LOVED them.\n\nAnd the garlic bread has a surprising twist to it. Not your everyday garlic bread.\n\nSeating is limited so reserve if coming in a group >4.\n\nThis is my 2nd time here and both times Rao was super friendly and helpful. He provided us with recommendations and also offered to change up the ingredients for my dinner companion who had some food sensitivities. There's also good music and a good menu. Love the garlic bread with mozzarella cheese here!\n\nWe'll probably be back again!\n\nI thought this place is already closed as most of the GrandStands shops are closed.\nIt\u2019s a quiet lunch with only one table filled.\nFood was good, but it give me a feeling that these are prepared in the factory.\n\nI wanted to go to Da Valentino, but did not want to brave the heavy rain as the entrance was unsheltered.\n\nInstead, I decided to try this place due to the good reviews but my heart sank when the pizza was delivered. The thin crust was the best part, but honestly the $24 pizza tasted as cheap as the chicken sausage topping. It was decent. The Paulanar lager tasted better. If you are happy with Domino\u2019s, you will be happy here. Except Domino comes with 2 pizzas for almost the same price.\n\nThe staff was friendly. The place is quiet as most shops are empty due to the impending demolishing of the Grandstand.\nFood: 3 | Service: 5 |\n\nIt was full house over the weekends, waited a while for the food to be served. There\u2019s a peculiar sour taste on the Caesar salad but it taste good!\n\nOrdered a pizza & the granchio pasta which is done to perfection (to me). Staff were super busy, yet they managed to put on a friendly smile.\n",

I think the first dish, the desert, and the risotto were very good! And the drinks were very special too! The people next to me had the vegetarian options and they said it was really good. I love the experience though and if you want to impress you vegan friends I would still bring them here just for the view and service.\n\nJoie is an absolute gem for vegetarian dining in Singapore! The elegant ambiance, coupled with impeccable service, sets the stage for an unforgettable culinary journey. Each dish is a masterpiece, beautifully crafted with fresh, flavorful ingredients that redefine vegetarian cuisine. The creative menu offers a delightful fusion of tastes and textures, leaving me astonished with every bite. The attention to detail in presentation is exquisite, elevating the dining experience. Joie isn't just a restaurant; it's a celebration of vegetarian gastronomy, and I can't wait to return for more culinary delights!\n\nI had a fantastic experience at Joie Vegetarian Restaurant! The Monkey Head Mushroom Steak was a true culinary delight. The flavors were exquisite, and it's clear that the chefs put a lot of thought and care into their dishes. What impressed me the most was the affordability of the 5-course meal. It's not often you find such a high-quality dining experience at such a reasonable price. The service was impeccable, and the ambiance was lovely. I can't wait to return for another delicious meal!\n\nWe dined at Joie today, July 16, 2023, and it was an outstanding experience. The service was excellent, and the food surpassed our expectations.\nThe attention to detail in dish presentation was evident. The staff's timing and coordination were impeccable, ensuring a seamless and enjoyable dining experience. The relaxed ambiance with soft lighting and comfortable seating added to the inviting atmosphere.\nIn conclusion, Joie offers an exceptional dining experience with attentive service and delicious food. I highly recommend it to anyone seeking a memorable culinary adventure. I can't wait to visit again.\n\nMy first time trying vegetarian fine dining, the foods were surprisingly good! The waitress , Kelly, was very professional, she explained the dishes to us and also show us the right way to enjoy the dishes. The main dishes , mushroom steak and risotto were very impressed too. I will definitely come back again.\n",

Vegetarian but meat eaters will enjoy this place too.\n\nMezze platter was quite big even for 2 pax.\n\nReally enjoyed the moussaka and the Spanakopita.\n\nIf you pay by cash there is some free ice cream.\n\nFirst time visiting due to friend\u2019s recommendation. Did not disappoint. Lots of options that don\u2019t make you feel you\u2019re eating vegetarian. Drink menu is extensive but on pricey side. Service was good.\n\nAmbience - The restaurant has this very European, relaxed vibe. Good for families but I don\u2018t see why you can\u2019t go for a date either \ud83d\ude01\n\nFood - my friend and I ordered the halloumi salad and lasagna. We really enjoyed the meal, the ingredients were good quality and food was prepared with care. However, did feel the halloumi was a bit too salty. They have a variety of Mediterranean and Italian options and can make it vegan too. Didn\u2019t really enjoy the rose though.\n\nService - prompt service and the staff were polite and friendly\n\nWould definitely return again.\n\nYou won't believe how rare it is to have a Mediterranean vegetarian place that has so many allium free options, including the Pizzas. Glad to see original sin survive the pandemic when many didn't.\n\nThe Moussaka and Mediterranean pizza were good, though a little too salty but that's probably just me. Nice ambience for a date with friends or the significant other, especially over a good conversation. You pay for the quality. Enjoy!\n\nWonderful and classy vegetarian restaurant. Had dinner here with the wife on a weekday evening. Food was wholesome, good service and atmosphere. Recommended!\n",

You have to order also at the counter and pay upfront.\n\nThis place looks... ordinary... in fact a little plain and obscure. But, the food is phenomenally good. Seriously they should be awarded a Michelin Star.\nCame highly recommended by my partner, and despite a long work day, we chose to go for dinner. We ordered what you see in the pictures--and we were blown away. Really, very good, no it's outstanding.\nEverything is good, and I particularly like the dumplings, the Nonya laksa, Lasagne, especially the Korean noodle Jajangmyeon, I must go back there and eat again! And the cheese cake is to die for! They have a reputation for THE BEST VEGETARIAN LASAGNE in Singapore, voiced by Food Critics, and I can tell you, you would have wasted your trip if you did not try it!\nThe service is personal, plain, direct and friendly (no airs). The people here are just down to earth, and the food service is fast. It's best to go in the evening, because it's in the CBD area, and therefore day time it would be crowded.\nThis is a vegan place, so for those of you are allergic to milk or preservatives, you can eat with a peace of mind.\nI would highly recommend this place, give a 4.5 Star. The 1/2 star missing is for them to include more local favourite like the Char Kway Teow and perhaps Hor Fun. Really all they serve there is very very good. Go and thank me later. Just go!\n\nOne of the trusted place for vegetarian food. Always enjoy the simple but nice offering there... Assam fish has the sour kick. Nasi Lemak was great with the chilli.\n\nSmall menu yet you can definitely find something you\u2019ll like! Has a range of local food and western food - Nonya laksa, chicken rice, dumplings to lasagne and salads!\n\nI have tried the laksa, very rich not too spicy soup. The chicken rice made from beancurd is very meaty and the chilli sauce has a kick!\n\nMy favourite drink to order is their homemade almond milk - very thick (might not be for everyone), rich and filling.\n\nIt is at basement of havelock II, it has limited seats due to the small storefront, and can be a good place to catch up with friends as the area is not too noisy\n",

Super recommendation coming from a pure meat and seafood lover.\n\nPetai - great sambal chili fried with a whole plate of goodness\n\nOlive fried rice - we had two plates, one after the other, enough to justify the deliciousness of the dish\n\nCurry 'mutton' - good curry but something seems to be lacking in the flavour\n\nSalted egg yolk - we had two plates of this too\n\nGlutinous yam (suan pan zi) - delicious? We had four plates of this.\n\nIt is in my personal humble opinion that you are missing out on very good food if you have not tried this as a vegetarian.\n\nFood is OK. The grilled mala fish is good! Impressive imitation of the texture very close to the real fish version.\nSatay is also nice.\nThe rest are so so. Kids says favourite truffle fried rice that is usually fragrant at other places has no truffle taste. Frankly, I prefer the high tea at their other outlet.\n\nVery delicious meal here! Portion is big price is reasonable. The fish is a must have! Very tasty \ud83d\ude0b I\u2019m a meat lover and I thoroughly enjoyed myself at this vegetarian restaurant. Good job to the chef! Staff was attentive.\n\nCelebrated our friend's birthday dinner at Lotus. It was indeed a great choice we've made and no regrets too. Food was well prepared and delicious. Atmosphere was chill and clean. Will come back again.\n\nWe came just to try the Grilled \"Fish\" and we were not disappointed albeit the flavour we chose does not resemble much of the original \u70e4\u9c7c. It was still tasty and we would want to return to try the other flavours. The other dishes were also pretty good. The tofu box was really interesting with some diced mushrooms that provide an unusual taste and texture. The spinach in superior broth was done really nicely it tasted so premium. Tau Kwa Goreng was perfectly fried but a little spicy for me.\n\nWe were seated near a cabinet and discard trolley where staff kept walking to & fro, sometimes talking over our heads as they reach for stuff. Pretty unpleasant and lack of service etiquette.\n",

The food portion is not so big, my friend and I ordered 6 course each and it feels very filling.\n\nOk so here is the deal, this was my last restaurant during my stay in Singapore and I almost didn't come because I thought it was only vegetarian but they have 2-4 options for every course and it was BY FAR THE BEST vegan meal I've had on my trip. I even had the potato salad and as a black man, I'm very picky about this, but it was unique and really good! The pasta, the bread stick, the drinks, the miso soup with surprises at the bottom. I mean if I wasn't leaving tonight, I would come back tomorrow! Please come here if you are VEGAN!!!! and I told the owners to please advertise that they have vegan options because they are so delicious \ud83e\udd24\ud83e\udd24\ud83e\udd24\n\nOnly two set meal options are available (6 courses or 8 courses ) No \u00c0 la carte option. No sharing of meals is allowed, meaning all dinners must ordered one set meal.\n\nThe starter are not bad and the salad is good.\n\nOrdered the following dishes for the mains:\n\nOlive fried rice\n\u96f7\u8336 Spaghetti\nStar pizza\nBaked Cauliflower\nBaked Rice\n\nOverall, the food was just ok, not really fantastic and worth the price.\n\nCompared to another similar restaurant \"Element\", which I think it is much better and slightly cheaper \ud83d\ude00.\n\nThere are new dishes. \ud83d\ude0d\nStaff friendly and the food is delicious\nToday Main Course ~~Cheesy Lemon Zest Liguine with Balsamic Vinegar (they can help removed onion garlic) and Lion's Mane Mushroom Steak with Crispy Mix Veggie. Love it. \u2764\ufe0f\n\nI visited for lunch and was initially informed that only the lunch set was available, and individual dishes couldn't be ordered. This left me disappointed as I wanted to sample various items from the menu. However, I later learned that the set menu allowed me to select dishes from the \u00e0 la carte menu.\n\nDuring my visit, I tried the following:\n1. Wholefood trio appetizer - a delightful starter that truly whetted my appetite.\n2. Rosemary breadstick with mustard dip.\n3. Mulberry cider - quite enjoyable.\n4. Baked butter mushroom with garlic butter - a tasty dish.\n5. Double-boiled cordyceps white fungus soup with black garlic.\n6. Peppery golden quinoa risotto - although good, it lacked the desired level of peppery flavour, so I requested additional pepper to enhance it.\n",

The experience started with their signature Afterglow Maki Rolls, a perfectly balanced spicy and tangy treat that set my taste buds alight, though they were a bit dry; however, upon request, the waiter kindly offered me some complementary almond spread as a dip.\n\nNext came the Cauliflower \u2018Steak\u2019. It was nothing short of a culinary marvel, turning a humble vegetable into a dish bursting with flavor and texture, both hearty and delightful.\n\nFinally came the Acai Bowl, a dessert that defied all my expectations. It wasn\u2019t just a simple bowl of fruit and granola; it was an artful blend of fresh, juicy fruits, the crunch of granola, and the velvety smoothness of acai sorbet. Each spoonful was a celebration of taste, striking a rare balance between indulgence and health. This dish wasn\u2019t just the end of a meal; it was the highlight, leaving a lasting impression of how incredibly satisfying and diverse vegan food can be.\n\nAfterglow isn\u2019t just a restaurant; it\u2019s a testament to the beauty and richness of vegan cuisine. It\u2019s a place where every dish is crafted with care, not just for the flavors but for the story it tells about plant-based eating. For anyone who cherishes vegan food or is curious about it, Afterglow is a must-visit. I loved it and will definitely be back!\n\nHad a very attentive server explaining the ingredients behind the dishes. The menu is well marked for common allergens such as nuts, gluten, alliums, etc.\n\nWe absolutely loved the vegan meatballs. Each dish was flavorful and even our non-vegans friends had an enjoyable experience at this restaurant. The salads are also nicely seasoned. Would like to come back for their desserts next time.\n\nThe place is quite cozy and intimate but perhaps not suitable for larger groups (6+ people) as it is hard to navigate between tables.\n\nFirst time visited with a friend for a lunch. The ambience and atmosphere is relaxing. The food portions are quite big and very satisfying. Really grateful for the kind lady who explained us and asked us if we had any allergies etc and notified us of the dishes that have nuts at the same time gave some good recommendations. Very attentive, detailed and the food was delicious. Such a heartwarming experience.\n\nSome of the dishes are very nice, but overall too pricey. I like the vegetable pur\u00e9e, tomyum zoodles and cold lasagne very much. The beetroot hummus is good too. Kimchi roll is decent as well.\n\nThe atmosphere was cozy and inviting, perfect for a relaxing meal. The staff members were incredibly friendly and welcoming.  They took the time to give us detailed explanations of the dishes and provided us with their recommendations.\n\nEvery dish we've tried was bursting with flavors even though its vegan.\nOne dish that really stood out to me was the mushroom balls.\nIts packed with savory umami flavors and the texture is on point.\nThe cauliflower steaks were also perfectly seasoned and had a delightful char that added a smoky depth to the dish.\n\nThe friendly and attentive service combined with the incredible food made for a truly memorable dining experience.\n",

There were alot of insects in the restaurant on the day of my visit but it could be because of the rain.\n\nOrdered via grab food. The kimchi jiggae healed my flu. The bulgogi fries were addictive.  The tteokbokki had the perfect chew.  Can't wait to actually eat at the restaurant to have a full experience.\n\nI enjoyed my dish Army Stew which as you can see from the photo was bubbling away for minutes. My wife was rather underwhelmed by her dish though unfortunately.\nThe Kimchi Jeon (pancakes) were nice enough though not better than Indian flavoured breads/uttapam in that the flavour was not as storied/flavourful as we expected.\nStaff were very nice and I'm sure if we had visited it when busier then we would have probably enjoyed it more. Their sister branch we happened to pass one evening and had a completely different feel, more intimate and cosy so we may try that another time. Very nice man on the reception.\n\nThe rare place that my daughter who is a vegan to enjoy Korean food. Surprisingly it's quite good even for a non-vegetarian like me.\n\nExceptional Korean food at a decent price.\n\nFood is excellent & service is prompt. Tofu soup is delicious and flavourful, with the ingredients generously portioned. Omelette & Kimbap are also great.\n\nThis is also one of the few Korean places I've encountered where the Kimchi pancake can be shared between 2 people, which is great if you aren't dining in a large group.\n\nDefinitely give this place a try if you get the chance! Be warned you may have to queue during lunchtime.\n",

Two plates and small noodles was more than enough for two to share and almost finish. Drinks were quenching, and the service was outstanding. Thank you!\n\nI got invited for lunch by work friends to this wonderful vegetarian restaurant. Being a vegetarian, I was delighted to see the vast options in the menu. Each dish we ordered was unique and with distinct aroma and taste. I particularly recommend signature olive rice, Garden Medley, Tempeh Long Beans with Olive to name a few. A very satisfying experience and look forward to next visit.\n\nMy very first visit to a vegetarian restaurant.  Service was great. They let me in a few minutes earlier than the opening time when they saw me waiting outside.\n\nStaff were professional, proactive, and helpful.\n\nI appreciated it when the staff told me that the number of dishes I ordered was already a lot, and previously informed me that the dishes I ordered were all mushroom-based and recommended different dishes for variety.\n\nFood was tasty, especially the Thai green curry and the rendang. One of our companions was amazed when he was told the \"chicken\" in the dish he ate was not meat.\n\nPortions were sizable and work well for group diners.\n\nWhole Earth should be considered as the best restaurant serving plant-based food in Singapore. The location is in the Tanjong Pagar neighbourhood, just a short walk from the MRT station. They serve incredible vegetarian food. I\u2019d say it\u2019s quite unusual in a meat country such as Singapore.\n\nVegetarian food is hard to find as many eateries only offer a very small number vegetarian food on their menus. (usually pizza, sandwiches or soup).\nThe place is nicely renovated. The interior with its decor is simple & uncluttered. The establishment seems more keen on focusing on the food rather than a flashy interior. I\u2019d suggest to book a table in advance.\n\nThe service is fast. The menu consists of classic dishes that\u2019s a mix of  Peranakan & Thai. The restaurant is Singapore\u2019s first & only plant-based restaurant to be awarded the Michelin Bib Gourmand for 6 years from 2016 - 2022. That, if anything, should make you curious & eager to visit.\n\nFor you who\u2019s not vegan | vegetarian, don\u2019t let the fact that this is a plant-based restaurant dissuade you from eating here or order food for take away. The quality, the taste, textures & the variety of flavours is second to none.\n\nGenerous portions\nQuick and good service\nU may want to make prior reservations since it is very busy during evenings and not much  place to accommodate walk-ins.\nNeat and chique ambience. Easily accessible from tangong pagar MRT.\n\nPretty elaborate menu to cater to all taste buds. Amazing smokey aroma from the rice. Eat food while still hot. Once it cools off, taste no good\n",

                  "reviews": "\n\nPerfect if you visit with friends/family as you can order various things from the menu and share them together. Our favorites are the biryani and butter naan. Read many reviews saying that the carrot cake is a must try but it didn\u2019t really suit our palettes. The samosas are tasty but not very special. The lychee drink is refreshing, really helps after a long walk exploring the city. Would definitely visit again on our next trip to SG.\n\nPrice: $6.54 (Plain Thosai)\n\nPlain Thosai: 5/5\nThosai was very crispy, savoury and slightly sour.\n\nSambar: 5/5\nSambar was flavourful, savoury, hearty and had a good lentil taste.\n\nChutney: 5/5\nOrange chutney was tangy, sweet and spicy. White chutney was coconuty and spicy.\n\nTotal score: 15/15\n\nAdd-ons: Masala Tea ($4.16) was fragrant from the spices used and warm and comforting to drink.\n\nThere was a little waiting time but it was definitely worth the wait as the plain thosai was very delicious. From the thosai to the sambar and the two different chutney. Service team were really responsive to requests and new orders.\n\nThe place was brightly lit and a cozy place to have your Indian vegetarian classic as well as your familiar Singaporean dishes with a vegetarian twist.\n\nThe first time I went there, I had the vegetable briyani, Gobi 65, Aloo Gobi and mango lassi. The food was good and the lassi was awesome, don\u2019t fade the lassi.\n\nThe second time that I went there, I had the fried carrot cake, murtabak and Gobi Manchurian and I\u2019ll say to skip the Gobi Manchurian as the cauliflower was almost non-existent and I was just eating a lot of batter. The fried carrot cake is decent for an vegan take as it is not commonly available and the murtabak is alright but can be skipped.\n\nFood was really nice. Enjoyed the dishes! The service can be improved, we were more or less asked to leave the moment we finished our food. We understand that they have limited seating and a queue but just felt rushed.\n\nGood variety on the menu but I do find it moderately highly priced. Service was typical yet they really do have interesting things on the menu with Chinese and muslim influence. It has its own character but I do very much prefer pure Indian cuisine. It\u2019s nice for the occasional change. Location was good, walking distance to the Little India train station and restaurant is clean and cool with air conditioning.\n",

They could have much better crowd comming in with that.\n\nVisited Anand Bhavan, opposite to Mustaffa after a long time few years later. I always recommend to visit and try their menu. This is Indian Vegetarian Resturant, better to try their tiffins items rather than rice items. Service will be quick, though there was a huge rush, served within 10 mins. Tired their Masala Rava Dosa, Mini Sambar Idly, Sambar Vada, Onion Uttappam and Poori set, and all\nOf them tasted good. Sambar have lot of Brinjals only instead they can add lot of other vegetables also.\n\nWrong decision to visit this place and worst was to ask for take away. Just wanted to get idly set take away and thought that it would be fast. But unfortunately, waited for about 30 minutes after payment was made. The place has kitchen next to the washroom entrance and it was smelly and very unpleasant to stand there to wait for my order to be delivered to me. Overall, not very clean place to visit. Observed many foreigners there who might be looking for only vegetarian food and had limited choice rather to be there. I am sure it could be managed better in terms of cleanliness, service, order management for simple stuff. However, I was there after many years and may take me another few years to step in again.\n\nPrice: $3.60 (Plain Thosai)\n\nPlain Thosai: 5/5\nThosai was savoury, crispy, soft and had a good sour flavour.\n\nSambar: 4.5/5\nSambar was savoury, flavourful, a little sweet from the vegetables and familiar tasting.\n\nChutney: 5/5\nThe orange chutney was flavourful, tomatoey and a little spicy. The white chutney was quite gingery and sweet from the coconut. The brown chutney tasted peanuty, savoury and was rather spicy.\n\nTotal score: 14.5/15\n\nAdd-ons: Masala Tea ($2.60) was fragrant, warm and comforting but could use more spices.\n\nService was fast and I received my thosai within 5 minutes. It will be quicker to get your drinks directly from Counter 1 at the restaurant as they seem slightly short-handed in the drinks area. The lady managing counter 1 is really nice and makes your drinks after seeing your receipt. I saw this as a good thing since I could decide when I wanted to have my masala tea instead of having it served while I was having my thosai.\n\nThe place was air conditioned and the place can get crowded and is a really bustling place near lunch time.\n\nAll in all, I enjoyed my brunch of thosai and masala tea at Ananda Bhavan Restaurant (Vegetarian). :)\n\nOne of the popular South Indian breakfast places of Singapore. The food preparation is Tamil style and quantity is apt.\n\nOverall the taste, quality and hygiene was good and rates were genuine.\n",

Unique dishes not seen elsewhere and the set meal allowed us to have a taste of all the great dishes. Most dishes were made from scratch, even the ikan bilis! All made with minimal or no seasoning and all natural ingredients. Yum! \ud83d\ude0d\nVery worth it and I'll definitely be back again!\n\nGreat for celebrations. Remember to make a reservation. We were a group of 11 people and service was great. They made special provisions for parking because we had a family member with mobility issues. We also had a birthday cake and celebration.\n\nFoodwise, in my opinion \u4f5b\u6709\u7f18 serves the most unique vegetarian cusine in Singapore. The best is still Miao Yi (for personal reasons) but it closed down \ud83d\ude22 Forget about the \u81ea\u5728 \"empire\", Shu and coffee shop zizar, it's always the same old thing.\n\nWe had the cold dish with \"ice vegetable\" salad, which is really good. The yuzu monkey head mushroom is always a hit. The sugarcane flower is unique. And last and not the least, the humble bee hoon - is always a family favourite.\n\nA Delightful Vegetarian Culinary Journey at Fo You Yuan Vegetarian Restaurant\n\nApart from the outstanding food, the service at Relocate Vegetarian Restaurant was impeccable. The staff members were friendly, attentive, and eager to cater to our needs, making us feel welcomed and valued throughout our dining experience.\n\nOverall, Relocate Vegetarian Restaurant has truly impressed us with their diverse and mouthwatering selection of dishes. Whether you\u2019re a vegetarian or simply looking to explore plant-based alternatives, this restaurant is an absolute gem. We highly recommend it to anyone seeking a memorable dining experience with top-notch vegetarian cuisine.\n\nThe delicate strands of noodles were expertly stir-fried with an assortment of fresh vegetables, creating a harmonious medley of taste and aroma.\n\nThe Rendang was a true masterpiece. The rich and aromatic coconut-based curry was impeccably spiced, resulting in a tantalizing symphony of flavors.\n\nOne of the highlights of our meal was the Vegetarian Shark\u2019s Fin Soup. It was a delightful surprise to find a cruelty-free alternative that retained the essence and texture of the traditional dish.\n\nThe Sweet & Sour dish was a perfect balance of tanginess and sweetness, complemented by succulent mushroom and an assortment of colorful bell peppers and pineapples.\n\nTo end our meal on a sweet note, we indulged in the Yam Paste with Gingko Nuts. The smooth and velvety yam paste was flawlessly cooked and paired beautifully with the tender gingko nuts\n\nOld school vegetarian restaurants good not too salty good service. Friendly staff. Must try for old school vegetarian restaurants. They have moved a few times already hopefully they can stay here. Finally found them again. I have been eating at this restaurant over 15 years now...still as good as the first time I tried....\n\nI'm super glad that we have a Chinese vegetarian in Desker Road, stone throwaway from Mustafa. Food was authentic and feeling good old days. Fantastic and thank you for opening an outlet in Little India.\n",

Staff were helpful but clearly busy.\n\nThey also have a bread bar and small grocery corner selling fresh vegetables and interesting and healthy foodstuff. The coconut bun was tiny but so delicious. Ask for it to be heated up for you.\n\nA tip: it can get really packed so you might end up with a sofa seat rather than a dining table. Try booking a table!\n\nCompared to typical Chinese vegetarian restaurants, which serve mainly fried foods , this restaurant serves many greens options, and the salad really tastes good.\n\nOrdered three different types of pizza, and the odd one is the \"Tom Yum.\" Pizza tastes really a bit weird.  The taste of Yum ingredients does not blend well with the pizza \ud83d\ude05.\n\nWe also ordered two burgers, and they are very nice.\n\nOverall, this is a very nice restaurant for both vegetarian or non vegetarian persons who like to have a healthy meal \ud83d\ude0b\n\nVery pleasant ambience and super polite staff! I was so pleased to see that there were so many vegetarian options on the menu! :\u2019)\nThe turmeric risotto was quite interesting, it tasted and looked a lot like an Indian dish, ahaha! The pesto noodles were also quite good.\n\nA healthy vegetarian restaurant that serves great food along Orchard road. The ambience is very cosy and quite with separate sections.\nThe food is very fresh and delicious. Dumpling was served hot with a lot of ingredients inside. The salad is huge and I love the sauce so much.\nThis restaurant also provides nutrition count in their menu which is very convenient for anyone who is on diet or care about fitness.\nDefinitely will come back to try more if I'm around this area and want something fresh in a hot day.\n*water is charged.\n\nI find the restaurant a bit dim. The food was fabulous. Everything was nice, except for two. Tom yum pizza and the broccoli pizza. The taste was exotic and overwhelming for my wife and I. Rojak is a must try, and I love the varieties of Tea  in the Menu. I heard the dumping was good, it was sold out during my visit, will try next time.\n",

Overall, a good place for a meal if you are vegetarian or want to eat vegetarian food.\n\nFriendly services provided by the staff.The staff were accomodating to our seat and food request. They also offered to help us take a group photo. There are a wide range of food available on the menu. When we were undecidable on the pizza flavours, the staff recommended two of their most popular flavours - BBQ pizza and pesto pizza. We thoroughly enjoyed both pizzas. Overall, the food was delicious even for some of us who are non-vegetarians. Highly recommend iVegan!\n\nI had few different mains here from asian to western.\n\nI would recommend their black bean burger. The house made patty goes very well with the rest of the ingredients. See picture. The sauce pairs well too. The sweet potato fries are seasoned  just right, not too heavy. Salad refreshes the palette. I also tried their bbq mushroom sandwich with the same sides and different sauce (mayo). It was decent.\n\nFor the guacamole sushi, it is unique and worth a try.\n\nFor the Asian mains, I have tried rice and noodles for the set lunch. I feel they are on the bland side. However, you can request to add more salt and pepper on your order. The peach gum dessert is also very less sweet and taste very healthy.\n\nThe staff is very friendly. Sometimes, complimentary appetizer would be served. Expect to spend close to 20 dollars for a meal here.\n\nGreat flavours, great aesthetics and vibes, great service! Staff kindly gave us a heads up that their food is towards the lighter side but all the dishes we ordered turned out so flavourful and satisfying hmm so didn\u2019t face the issue of food being bland at all. Service was great too!\n\nWe tried the salad, mushroom soup, sushi and grilled broccoli/mushrooms. All were served promptly and were delicious.

Waiting time can get up to 30mins or longer after ordering. AVOID peak period.\n\n2. Staff generally have no smiles on their faces all the time. I believe they are rushing and too busy.\n\n3. Food ordered may not be prepared by the kitchen table by table, hence do not wait for all the food to reach first before starting your meal.\n\n4.

Food portion is considered big and decent. Becareful not to over order.\n\nLastly, I do recommend to try the orh luak if you are visiting.\n\nPretty generous portion for their food! And taste prettily good. Tried their curry baked rice and will say the curry tastes awesome! I can\u2019t take spicy so it\u2019s a little too much for me.\n\nOrh Luak is super hard to find now and theirs tastes awesome!! Super love!\n\nThey are kids friendly too, have 2 different kids meal in a car shape plate set.\n\nEnjoyed a meal with the Burpple 1 for 1 deal (the redemption process is easy but do take note of the restrictions on menu items that qualify for this deal)\n\nThe laksa pasta is as flavourful as many people describe it to be! Very rich and creamy sauce.\n\nThe basil pesto was savoury and creamy, but a tad too oily (see photo). Would recommend all to get the less salt, less oil option\n\nWe had our lunch here for a colleague farewell lunch. This is a small restaurant at Funan Centre B1. No reservation is allowed, it\u2019s quite crowded during lunch time but we managed to secure a table. Office crowd starts to come in during lunch time. There is a wide variety to choose from the menu, the laksa pasta is flavorful, which came as a surprise. Food is served within 10min after ordering. Nothing worth mentioning about the ambience or service. It\u2019s typical of a resultant in a shopping mall. Importantly the food is tasty and I would definitely return again. Highly recommended.\n\nExtensive selection of green goodness. The black kut teh was surprisingly tasty and satisfying. Exceeded my expectations. The cheesy lion mane was addicting with generous globs of oozing cheese sandwiched within a crunchy shell. Just wished there was a bit more mushroom. Carrot cake was a really huge serving. It was fine though felt like it missed a bit more meaty bite. Would be keen to try the other items on the menu.\n",

While it may be slightly pricier than other options, the quality of their ingredients is top-notch. And just take a look at how luxuriously thicccc and velvety that soup is. It's unlike anywhere else.\n\nOverall okay place to have a quick meal.\n\nThunder tea rice was good, but the tofu nugget is a miss as it was quite dry. Mostly just 'instant food' that didn't require much cooking as the chef just had to put the ingredients together.\n\nDining area is just your usual quick eating place, sitting on stools instead of chairs. Pretty small space with the use of a mirror to make the place seem bigger. Dining area is clean.\n\nWould say that service is good as there was food recommendation when I was placing my order, and service staff were friendly.\n\nTried this vegetarian restaurant few times, there is quite a number of choices as well, so far all that I tried was nice. Love it!\nWill definitely visit again and try the others food. \ud83d\ude01\n\nGood quality food\nNice place for Vegan food\nService might be slow but it takes time for good food.\nLaksa is nice.\n\nHave been craving for Thundertea rice, so my nice colleagues took me here.\n\nThese are 100 % vegetarian. Thus, the lack of the Ikan bilis is evident. Still decent but really at $10 a bowl, I find it too pricey.\n\nGenerally, a decent bowl overall. The biggest lack down was the sambal; sweet with no kick.\n",

                  "reviews": "\n\nSO glad my husband and I stumbled upon this place! Our only regret is finding it on the last day of our trip here in Singapore. The menu had so many different options making it so hard to choose. We both got a burger suggested by our server that was phenomenal. The vegan egg tasted SO real according to my non-vegan husband. My iced Thai Tea absolutely hit the spot. We also tried the crispy spring rolls and they were so flavorful! We had to end the meal with some ice cream. I got the chickpea coffee flavor and my husband got the purple sweet potato. Both were to die for! Highly recommend!!\n\nMy wife and myself are vegetarian and we celebrated our 30th wedding anniversary here. Food was good. The vegan egg was a new experience and surprise, tasted rather good. Made reservation citing Anniversary and requested for a table with a good view but apparently no one noticed the message, that's why gave only 4 stars for service.\n\nWent on a Monday evening - it was surprisingly quiet yet pleasantly peaceful. The waiter was friendly and helpful - told me it\u2019s usually quiet on Mondays evening but very busy during the week especially on weekends. The burger menu set was generous and delicious, so was the lemon-passion tea. I also got a slice of the banana bread and a chocolate muffin to take away. It was so good that I came back the next day to try out another amazing burger. 100% recommend - definitely a must tryout!\n\nDelicious vegan food with lots of options to pick from. We got the truffle pasta and truffle fries. Passion fruit tea is amazing and I got a double omni toona burger.  Such a nice restaurant with an amazing atmosphere.  Would definitely come again.\n\nThe service was great and the waiter was very attentive and helpful.\n\nBut the food was below average. The spring rolls and mushroom fritters were ok. The burger and pasta was disappointing,  pesto linguine  was quite soggy over cooked. The star dish was the purple sweet potato smoothie. Very pricey maybe cos its vegan food. If you are vegan and have strict dietary restrictions you will come but i will not be back again though.\n\nThanks to the waiter who assisted us on our table last Sunday, 25 June!\n",

                  "reviews": "\n\nI want to preface this review by mentioning that I'm not a professional food critic, and my thoughts are based on how I felt during my family dinner experience for my grandfather's birthday.\n\nOur dining experience was unfortunately not up to our expectations. Firstly, the food left much to be desired as everything tasted very bland. We had to request salt and pepper, and even after adding a generous amount, it didn't do much to enhance the flavours.\n\nTo make matters worse, the servers missed out on serving the APPLE CIDER, which was supposed to be part of our 8-course meal. Instead, they brought it to us at the end of the entire meal while we were already packing up to leave soon. This left us feeling quite disappointed.\n\nOn a positive note, I must say that the atmosphere was pleasant and contributed to the overall experience. However, the lackluster food and the timing of the cider service were significant drawbacks to what should have been a special family celebration.\n\nCelebrated my birthday here with my friend :) We were served by Mr Peter who did a great job in service and even gave me a surprise birthday treat towards the end.\n\nThe service here is impeccable and food is absolutely delicious! The set meal offered is very affordable, about $80 for 2 pax (8 course meal) \ud83d\ude0a\n\n10/10 will visit again. Thank you Mr Peter!\n\nWell done vegetarian restaurant with lovely set meals.\n\nCame here for lunch, and loved the decor and set up. Ordered the 5 course set meal and was delighted at the selections available.\n\nI was however abit let down by the portion of the mains. The food was done very well, I loved the appetizers, but the mains was abit of a let down, portion wise. Taste was good and I really hoped the portion could be bigger as it was such a minimal serving that I was not even full after the 5 course meal. Service was ok but the servers did appear quite busy.\n\nIt would be worth coming over to try the dishes and experience vegetarian done in a very classy way.\n\nThe waiters had an average attitude and felt like they wanted to finish their work quickly, you could tell they were busy. Despite having booked a table a couple of weeks ago, we were placed close to the kitchen and the entrance to the restaurant, we did ask for a change of location but were refused. The food was average, nothing particularly good, the value for money is okay.\n\nWe have been patronising this Elemen outlet at the Millenia Walk since 2017, and never once have we been let down by their service or quality of food.\nThey serve a wide variety of fusion vegetarian cuisine at an affordable price. The food are flavourful to the palate and their presentation are pleasing to the eyes.\nThis outlet is helmed by Manager Peter and Asst Manager Cheng Yee who are friendly, accommodative and customer oriented.\nHowever, due to manpower shortage and during peak hours, slowness in service may occur.\n",

From the moment I entered, the staff (Syed) made me feel welcome and attended to all my needs with a smile. The menu offered a wide variety of flavorful options, and each dish was expertly prepared, showcasing authentic Indian flavors that delighted my taste buds. I was particularly impressed with the attention to detail in presentation and the use of fresh, high-quality ingredients. I can't wait to visit again and savor more of their delectable offerings. Highly recommend for anyone seeking top-notch service and delicious Indian vegetarian cuisine!\n\nThis review is for the outlet at City Hall. By faaaar the best Indian restaurant we went to. Bit expensive, but literally every single thing we ordered was damn tasty and authentic in taste. Liked it so much that we went back for next day breakfast as well. Highly recommend\n\nIt\u2019s a good place to visit for vegetarian people. They have good options and combos for both South Indian and North Indian food items. I visited this place with my family, we enjoyed the taste as well food preparation and presentation. Kids loved the Pav bhaji and we liked the South Indian platter. We had a good dinner time during weekend.\n\nThe waiters were friendly; the setting suited well for family dining; and the food was authentic, flavour rich, and remarkably presented. The Cheese Naan was lovely and paired nicely with the two types of gravies we ordered - Gobi Manchurian and Paneer Butter Masala. The bombastic-looking Channa Battura was above our expectation. The Dahi Puri was a hit or miss kind of food; some of our taste buds couldn't tolerate the sourness of it. Though most of the food were a success, their Podi Masala Thosai failed to shine; it tasted like chinese medicine to us, who were foreign to the cuisine. Lastly, they should either upgrade their offline menu book or subscribe to a better web domain as it was very laggy to open the online menu. Please put more pictures :)\n\nStaffs: Poobalan and team. Keep up the warm service!\n\nAbsolutely wonderful food. Came here by myself on a Sunday night. Staff was wonderful in accommodating for vegans, and clarified to add no butter or ghee in my meal. I got the Aloo Gobi (Cauliflower and Potatoes in a Tomato Masala sauce) with Basmati rice. The Aloo Gobi was simply incredible, the flavor was so strong but not overwhelming, just perfect really. It\u2019s clear they care a lot about the food here.\n\nThe atmosphere was wonderful, very classy despite most guests being in shorts. The staff were dressed very nicely and were very attentive and quick. My server was Kathiravan, and he was quick to check up on me when I needed anything. It was not super cheap for a meal, but the price was well worth it to me, especially considering how expensive Singapore is. Highly recommend if you love flavorful Indian food!\n",

Not worth the price\n\nDissapointed with their quality of food. My chicken was underweight and cold when served. The meat was dry, full of bones and not crispy, and the standard was a far cry from when they first opened in Singapore. Though there was only one staff attending to the walk-in counter orders and collection, the staff was also looking at her phone, not paying attention when I walked up and stood in front of her to request for chilli. I'm certainly not going back to this outlet again.\n\nTried the fried chicken for the 1st time. Its pretty decent\n\nQuite nice but seems smaller portion than other fast food chain's. also the parts are not as meaty.\ngot two tubs of unknown sauce or gravy along with the chicken n fries. the coke zero tasted dilute than from bottle. wonder if they put ice cube in container to chill the drink.

Service is almost non-existent, need to do everything yourself from ordering at the kiosk to collecting.\nThe rest are standard fare like most fast food restaurants. The place is reasonably clean as it is off peak hour when we visited.\n\nWas a tad disappointed that their staple and popular corn soup and fried chicken was sold out on a weekday lunch timing\u2639\ufe0f\nDo take note that the wait is usually quite long at this outlet during lunch and dinner timing.\n\nStandard dropped so much. Dirty table and chair. Nobody clean. Maybe expect customer to self clean. The rice burger got no sauce . Hamburger is cold. The Japanese brand owner need to come in otherwise brand spoil by francheee\n\nWow this has got to be the best mosburger I\u2019ve had so far. The beef patty is grilled so nicely that I can taste the crisp of the charred meat! So nice, I love it. The sauce complements it too.\n\nThe bbq sauce came on the side which was a nice idea as you can adjust how much you want to put it in your burger.\n\nOther than that, the staffs are all near the kitchen and nobody were at the counter. While we can order at the self-counter it\u2019s weird that human interaction is decreasing.\n\nThe outlet was rather empty too, oh wells, it\u2019s centre point.\n\nFood quality has dropped tremendously. An order of 2 cheeseburgers took 30mins. Portion was small and price increased! So disappointed.\n\nService and hygiene at this outlet is bad. Counter staff used gloves to take orders, touched money, grabbed the mop and touched the dustbin and finally, packed my cheeseburgers and tissue into a takeaway bag at the kitchen. I followed her there to see if she would throw away the dirty gloves but she used the same ones to pack my food. Absolutely disgusting. Outlet was clearly understaffed.\n",

So fresh so juicy. I like veggie in my burger so this combination hits every spot.\n\nThe free flow drink and free flow salsa were the cherries on top. But the salsa condiment station may need some more attention, it ran out quite fast.\n\nThe price is on the high end of a chain but not too much and is quite reasonable for the value.\n\nWill come back!\n\nCame on a Sunday late morning. Not too crowded. The promo on angus burgers for two was worth it. Nice meat cut, soft and juicy. Quite filling for us. The curry fries are interesting to try. A little on the salty side. Overall good food and atmosphere.\n\nFriendly staffs.  Food quality was average. They provide self-help drinks kiosk for us to replenish our beverages. The restaurant was clean and tidy for this fast food chain.\n\nCrowded n service was slow, despite not understaffed. Cashier was \"mechanical\" with his standard qns. Guess he cld have overworked.\n\nMany drinks were oos. No iced tea. No pink lemonade. No plain water. No sugar syrup. Drinks area was wet, dirty n messy. I was actually quite shocked but d diners ard me just made do with whatever drinks that were available.\n\nIt took ~10 min for my burger n fries to b served. Burger was made well n fresh. Patties were hot n crispy, so were d fries. Once d crowd at d counter cleared, staff stepped out to clean tables, clear trays n push in d chairs. Sugar syrup was replenished. Impressed.\n\nStaff service was extremely disappointing and very unprofessional and with no work attitude. When food was served as well.\nBut other then the exceptionally poor service food standards have been kept somewhat the same which is good though today the fries were a little  undercooked.\nHad the portobello burger as I\u2019ve had it for years still great nothing wrong with that and the onion rings which tasted good and  the breaded chicken burger was good and flavourful always liked the self service salsa though there were no jalape\u00f1os now which is rather sad and the drinks area.\nOverall still good food and the burgers were not wrapped properly also sadly but the SERVICE needs to be improved. As one staff was on the laptop infront of the counter as well.\n\nEdit: this is a few hours later I possibly have food poisoning and a very bad diarrhoea might be from one of the ingredients of the burger or salsa I\u2019m not too sure.\nAs of 02/08/23\n",

Even the hawker center western food can do a better job.\n\nEven the super market frozen fried chicken is better with the air fryer.\n\nThey encouraged us to use the website to order but it hung and was super buggy.\n\nStaff here is decent I think. Minimal contact. 1 extra star for them.\n\nAvoid KFC. So many years but you decided to cut cost and lose.\n\nKFC tasted the same as usual.\nFood served hot.\n\nUncle Kuan at the cashier was really friendly and helpful.\n\nMany people waiting for their food. The staff worked quickly . But i really disapointed because when arrived home, i couldnt find my potato fries even there was printed in the slip. It was $4.5. Lesson : You must check by opening the box there before you go home.\n\nHello! After my morning appointment, I strolled around the mall deciding what to have for lunch. The staff members, who were all seniors, welcomed me with their smiles and made me feel truly valued as a customer. It's heartening to see that despite the rise of automation, KFC Novena maintained the human touch over the counters.\n\nI am writing this review to encourage both KFC Novena and the senior staffs member! Thank you KFC Novena\n\nPlus:\n- The app deal is truly value for money. Kudos to the Marketing team.\n\nMinus:\n- Poor service crew, lacking in common sense.\n\nSituation:\nTakeaway orders require customers to fill their own drink with the cup provided. With my hands full, I requested for the staff to help fill my drink in their kitchen instead. Staff rejected, and insisted I had to fill it myself despite explaining.\n\nLong story short, I stood firm. She caved in, got an elderly colleague to follow up. Sign of her unwillingness to do it herself.\n\nImprovement opportunity:\nIt would make more sense (e.g. for efficiency) and bring an enjoyable experience to customers if takeway customers can have their drinks filled by the staff instead. It will not make sense to have an outlet looked pack but in reality having dine-in and takeaway customers queuing to fill their own drinks, thus turning away potential customers.\n\nFood for thought:\nI dont see delivery riders having to fill drinks for their customers. If the crew can do it for delivery orders, why not takeaways too? Both are essentially takeaways, arent they?\n",

I got the set with a crispy chicken burger, fried chicken, fries and a drink. The crispy chicken burger was not spicey at all but the size was good. The fried chicken was juicy, but not spicy as claimed. Fries was very small. Drink was not refillable. Service was a bit slow and could be improved. The restaurant was maybe half full at the time. So, easy to find seating. Overall, pretty good but a bit underwhelming compared to my experiences at Jollibee in the middle east. Portions are a bit bigger there and the drinks are always refillable.\n\nFried chicken is excellent!\nDining place is not well lit enough.  40 minutes of waiting period on non peak hour.\n\nFirsr time here in 10 years\nSelf service kiosk menu was useless, spagherti was not available however at the counter it was, store does not accept visa or mastercard and thats a massive disappointment.\nFood took a while to be served, everthing was just warm\nThe uncle incharge of bussing tables were chucking all the left overs on a separate open trash bag instead for using the bins itself and that's unhygenic\n\nDissapointed!\n\nThe line was insane\u2026.. probably 30 mins in line and then 40 mins waiting for our order to be cooked because there was so many people BUT they did not lie about the chicken because how was it so juicy even with breast meat my mind is blown?? Skin was so crispy it was delicious. The burger was also really good, typical spicy chicken burger there was nothing not to like about it. Spaghetti was yummy too, yes it was sweet but not overwhelming, peach and mango pie was great!!!\n\nChicken joy and palabok is very delicious.. good for family and friends. Very spacious..\n",

As an onigiri lover who tried various ones in Japan and Taiwan, i had to say that it was a disappointment. Primarily the rice was too soft and mushy that it could hardly hold its shape together. The tuna filling was fine. Not gonna buy again. The express outlet did provide a convenient quick stop for a bite and service was ok.\n\nBBQ Cheese Wagyu Burger doesnt taste like bbq... taste like tomato sauce... parfait the mochi is frozen... horrible..\n\nI don't know why they are rated so low, but as someone who treats Mos like their macs and eats it super frequently, this place produced the best fish burger I had from MOS overall. I didn't get the name but the slim man with specs had such a sweet and polite service. What a lovely spot for a quick meal!\n\nWhat I like. This is a good place to stop, get what you want, and go. There are limited seats. The milk/lemon tea comes with syrup separately which is good since you can adjust. There is also an auto machine. There is customized salad in a cup.\n\nWhat I dun like. They dun have the normal cheese burger in the menu. Everything is a tab more high class and expensive. But subjected to change. The small shop has few people manning so expect longer waiting time.\n\nThat\u2019s the actual corn soup after ordering. Totally different from the pic and little amount and the taste is even worse.\nThe beef burger sucks, beef is hard.\nDon\u2019t walk into this place in the morning and it\u2019ll only ruin your day!\n",

What sets them apart is the thoughtful touch \u2013 providing gloves for customers and a convenient sink for post-meal handwashing. This attention to detail enhances the overall dining experience. Kudos to Arnold's for keeping both taste and customer comfort at the forefront!\n\nI'm trying Arnold's dining in for the first time instead of ordering in. The experience is more enjoyable with enhanced flavours. They offer disposable gloves for convenient eating and provide basic soap for handwashing - a considerate touch.\n\nFinally tried the well-known Arnold\u2019s Fried Chicken that has been raves about by many and they certainly didn\u2019t disappoint. I went with my wife on a Saturday afternoon for lunch and surprisingly, there was no queue. Waited a bit to make my order at the counter and ordered a 4-pieces meal for 2 before making payment. FYI, only Nets or cash is accepted. Service was relatively fast and everything was ready on a big serving tray. The chicken meat is juicy and tender. I like the seasonings and marination on the meat which are way better than other chain fried chicken outlets. The fried buns are an interesting and delicious side which complement the mashed potatoes and coleslaw. All in all, a very satisfying meal and I would definitely return whenever I crave fried chicken\n\nAs an Eastie for over 50 years, I must have been living under the rock. Today is our first time ever visit Arnold\u2019s Fried Chicken. Singapore\u2019s very own KFC.\n\nWhat can I say? Move over, KFC !\nAFC is way yummier. The chicken is moist (I suspect the chicken might have been marinated with milk or Yoghurt) and the \u201csand\u201d-blasted chicken skin is crispy.\nEven the coleslaw is fresher than KFC\u2019s.\n\nAll I can say is that AFC has won a new fan !\n\nHappily enjoying 39 year old chicken recipe with family. Great eatery concept. Simple food queue system way of ordering. It\u2019s tender chicken set will get your fingers wanting for more. Brilliant coleslaw for all to share. Here we go for fried chicken goodness.\n",

Corn soup was still hot.\n\nSo , I' m sorry to say , do not order their buns burgers, only Ebi Rice burgers or beef rice burgers is ok.\n\nAs for their soup it cost me $3.50 , you better buy Campbell soup from the can now ntuc promotion selling 3 cans for $5.20 is way much better than Moss Burger corn soup.\n\nMoss Burger in TBP , I wish your branch all the best and I pray your management read my review.\n\nI won't be surprised, they might close one day if this type of standard goes on.\n\nAunties and uncles working there are very friendly.\nThey will help to order when the kiosk is having a long queue. Also help to clear the tray.\nIf any customisation of the item, they are willing to help.\nTried the new Wagyu brown rice burger, it\u2019s just simply so nice.\n\nPlaced order at 6:27pm and waited for 35mm a for now. And I haven\u2019t get my food yet. If the store can\u2019t cope with the order please do not take delivery order! That is UNFAIR for those who place the order at the shop and ended up waiting for hours!\n\nVery disappointed with this Mos burger branch. I waited an hour for my order and the fries and burger were not hot at all. I will never buy from this branch anymore and strongly encourage not to eat or order at this branch. The company should do a periodic checks on the quality of food and the long waiting time served. Atmosphere smell oily too.\n\nBought the beef mos cheese burger. The patty was really cold. I continued eating to realise it was raw in the middle and tasted bad. I threw the whole thing and told them it was raw to which Victor made me an entirely new one and checked on me after to see if it was okay. He\u2019s absolutely excellent and gives great service the standard of high class restaurants.\n",

Unacceptable.\n\n***PLEASE DO NOT BUY***\nIf possible I would give 0/5 star.\n\n-Bad Customer service.\n-Dishonest Staff.\n-Chicken is not Crispy.\n-Chicken is Dry like powder.\n\nOn 15th Aug 2021, Sunday at around 9.00pm. My Kids wanted KFC, I placed my order using the KFC app. Ordered the new 5pcs Cereal Crispy Chicken meal, with additional 3 set of cheese fries at Junction 8, KFC.\nUpon my collection I requested for Thigh, drums and wings meat as my kids doesn\u2019t like the Breast meat. I was served by a Malay Aunty wearing scarf. Her name tag was unclear and I won\u2019t mention her name here. Moving on, She immediately told me that she\u2019s has packed the meat which can\u2019t be changed. I asked why? She told me it\u2019s packed accordingly and she included all the different kind of meat cut. Which I assumed a mixture of \u201cThigh, Breast, wing and drums\u201d. So I trust her and didn\u2019t insist to change.\nShortly, a Malay uncle came to collect his order. He speak in Malay, requested for certain meat cut, she immediately unbox and rearrange accordingly for him. I felt very unfair by her action which is not ethical and unreasonable. I didn\u2019t want to create a scene there as my kids want KFC badly.\nNext, she packed my cheese fries in a mess, with disrespect, box wasn\u2019t covered properly and fries were sticking outwards. This is too much and I told her for prepare a new set of cheese fries for me. She gave me unpleasant tone \u201chave to wait ahhh\u201d I was like fine. Please go ahead.\nThe preparation took around 8mins, she prepare for me in a well manner as I think she realised that she might get into trouble if I raise a feedback.\nWhen I\u2019m homed, I prepare the meal for my kids, the cheese fries were fine. But the Cereal chicken was horrible and it\u2019s all breast meat accept 1 drum. My kids were very disappointed and I\u2019m very disappointed by the service. This is the last time and I won\u2019t recommend anyone to go there. Bad experience and some sort of racists service given.\n*This is not a made up story, you can feel free to contact me personally and my Invoice number is  9174. I will not delete this post and review as my statement is true. Thank you!\n\nMake sure you TRIPLE CHECK your order before leaving the store. Encountered a very bad experience today where 2 zinger burger sets are missing! Total of 30mins and $10 wasted, just to receive an incomplete order.\n\nWhy does this KFC consistently fail to stock new items? Is the Bishan outlet an afterthought for KFC headquarters? I simply want to try out the new Cheesy Mushroom Zinger Double Down. My lack of enthusiasm for KFC stems from experiences like this. The management leaves much to be desired.\n\nWorst horrible KFC I've ever patronised! Waited damn long for a simple riser meal. Ended up those queuing after me got their order before me! I ever went there when there's no crowd but they're still super slow! The staffs were all slow and sluggish. And the worst part was their poker face acted like nothing happened! Might as well close down the outlet!\n",

Eating at Jollibee as a filipino comes with a feeling of home.  I grew up with eating this crispy and juicy fried chicken and am glad that the same quality was carried over here in Singapore.  The secret sauce aka gravy makes the already tasty fried chicken more delicious.  This branch at suntec is not too crowded and im glad they they have a self service kiosk.  Just wished they accept contactless credit card payment.  Fried chicken portion is just right for the price.  The restaurant is clean and is spacious enough.  The Uncle who let me in was very courteous in helping me find the washing station and exit (I rarely find helpful uncles in fastfood chains these days).  So overall, a great experience for me and of course chicken joy never fails to fill my tummy!  The jolly spaghetti is equally good!  Sweet cheesy and served hot.. just how I like it!\n\nSeems to be a great place for lunch. But the experience is terrible. There is only 2 self service kiosk and the queue was super long. We wonder why?? When we reach our turn and after input our orders, then we only realise that they only accept NETS. And not visa or master. This is ridiculous. After ordering, again it took about 10 minutes before our food was served. The chicken is nice but not that nice that warrant us to go back again and join the ordering queue and using the kiosk that only accept NETS.\n\nThe first time I ate there and I thought it was delicious, minutes after eating I had a stomach ache... I thought it wasn't the food but my immune system, but 5 days ago I ordered delivery because I liked the chicken with the portions and now I'm 5 days with a serious intestinal infection.. I'm very disappointed and sad about it..\n\nFriggin tiny chicken the size of a wing drumlet. Not even half the size of a KFC drumstick. Pathetic.\n\nBoycott this brand at all costs.\n",

Maybe because wanting to close outlet quick.\n\nOrder from self order kiosk for extra lettuce can no lettuce.\n\nWorst is the McSpicy burger patty has a bone I suppose they couldn't care much and slap a McChicken spicy inside\n\nnot my first time patronising and having a bad experience. previous time food took way too long and tasted spoiled. today i ordered from mayflower grab via because it was the only macs available. milo was spilled all over which could be the drivers fault. caremel frappe was extremely melted with no signs of whipped cream at all. both meals (big mac and double cheese) were missing. found out from driver that the workers forgot to pack it in. i havent got my refund from grab yet. this needs to be improved.\n\nMcdonath has been always everybody favourites including myself. I love their nuggets. apple pies. corn and esp their French fries. You cannot find anywhere that give you the type of French fries that Mcdonath have. You must have it there to get the most of it. Once you pack back though still taste good but not as good as you have it there. I also love their chicken nuggets. Both my hubby and me love to have our Mcdonath meals in house. We never pack back to get the best of it. Service provided at most of its store are good and tip top. Keep it up Mcdonath.\n\nLove the new breakfast bagel! Shld keep it permanent on the menu, pls! Perfect.\n\nThe team works very slowly, food is subpar. Service needs some work to say the least. Ordered food at a non peak period and it took pretty long to get my food ready. This is regardless of dine in or take out. And the outlet has been this way for awhile. I honestly have no idea how it has sustained business this long\n",

We brought some ourselves also. A hot beef patty is first for us, at a fast food restaurant!! Well done BK TEAM at Kallang Leisure Park! All other items were also on point. Crispy fresh fries and onion rings. Nice comfortable environment, too. Going forward, this outlet will be our go to BK joint. Cheers!!\n\nLove their fries. Tried the rendang beef burger, didn't like the raw onions inside, sauce is ok - but can still improve on it.\n\nEfficient service. Crispy and warm fries. Good quality and delicious burger. Simply amazing. Simply the best fast food I've ever had.  It is unfortunate that the best I can give is a 5 star review. It deserves so much more.\n\nThis the best fast food ever! Never have I ever eaten food which have given this much enjoyment. Service is EXCELLENT, no wait for food and servers who attend to your every need. It's a shame that I can only rate 5 stars, it deserves so much more.\n\nRecently went here w my friends. The customer service was great and the food was absolutely delicious. (I recommend the chicken burgers).\n",

Recently, I had the opportunity to taste their truffle mushroom chicken burger which was only available for a limited time. The burger was delicious, with a crispy chicken patty and cheese covered generously with truffle sauce.\n\nDeserve a 0 rating! Dirty tables, extremely poor service, and surprisingly rude people, especially, Thava  who claims to be the manager. Such ineptitude is disgraceful for a manager. She handed us the tray, instead of the take out bag as we had ordered. Moreover, 25% of our order was missing. When asked her about the poor service, she remarked rudely that she was busy. No apology, zero finesse. Shame on you Burger King! Folks don't go here unless you're itching for a bad experience!\n\nThey managed to mess up even with the simplest order. Ordered tempura chicken nuggets with curry sauce, and somehow, they didn't give me the sauce. The chocolate Sunday with mint candies in the picture tasted so bad. The soft serve is too sweet but not milky. The candies are stale as if they were old. They gave very little chocolate syrup (compared to McDonald's), which made it even worse. It's definitely my last visit of BK, especially for this outlet.\n\nAbsolutely horrible crew service. I see my order prepared and it cons the the counter. Crew checks and calls pit a number. I inform them that this is my order and she insists it is not. It is a number she called a while back. I asked again as she continues to call out the same number. She then decides to check and finds out its my order and just simply says yours and walks away. No apology or any form. I guess this gives me another reason to avoid fast food like Burger King and to eat at home. Foe the cost, triple the amount of food. Thus happened at 11.05 am today at CLARK Quay Burger King.\n\nOrder thru Grab food for a Spicy Chicken Bundle. End up missing a spicy chicken burger. Call the branch but no one answer.\n",

Process was fast, though you'll fill your own drinks at the dispenser at the corner.\n\nI loved the Angus beef mushroom burger, but the juice did get all over my hands. They do have napkin dispenser at the tables so that helps a bunch.\n\nThe higher seats were a bit uncomfy, but it's OK if you just want to eat and go. Decent parking in the area, and it's also right at Paya Lebar MRT, so about 4 mins walk in and up the escalators.\n\nOrdered the cheeseburger set, paid $7.50.  Ordering process was so user friendly, find a seat, plong yourself to the seat, scan the QR code, start to order, pay and you will be served.\n\nThe sets make sense as you can opt for a refillable cup and help yourself to the drinks - unlimited! Salsa bar also UNLIMITED!\n\nIngredients and food tasted good, you can really taste the freshness in their veg.\n\nGiven the price point, this is a no brainer.  So, forget Macs or BK, this place should be your defacto burger fix!\n\nCame here for lunch using the coupon we bought from Q0010. Got the california classic set meal at $6.99 instead of $13 full price. We paid another $8.99 for 5 pieces chicken tenders.\n\nThe beef burger was more premium compare to M brand. However, we still prefer M's fries. The chicken tenders were served with 3 sauce options: mustard, mayo or bbq. It tasted alright but not as tasty as K brand.\n\nThe restaurant was spacious and servettes are available on each dining tables.\n\nstopped by the Carl\u2019s Jr branch at Singpost for a quick snack, and I was thoroughly impressed by the exceptional service provided by one of their staff members. Their friendly demeanor and excellent service made my visit truly memorable.\n\nIt was my first time trying their pork burger, and I was pleasantly surprised by its incredible texture and mouthwatering sauce.\n\nIn addition to the main course, I also ordered the sweet potato bites as a side, and they turned out to be a delightful choice. Crispy on the outside and perfectly soft on the inside, these little bites were packed with sweet potato flavor.\n\nI would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to the staff member at Carl\u2019s Jr, Singpost branch, for their exceptional service during my visit. Their friendly demeanor, attentiveness, and commitment to delivering a satisfying experience truly made a difference.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a quick and delicious snack option, I highly recommend visiting Carl\u2019s Jr at Singpost. The friendly staff and their dedication to providing excellent service will make your visit memorable. And of course, don\u2019t forget to try their All Star Meal\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\n\nOne of the best burger chain that you can find. Drinks were free flow and service was prompt and good. The burger was nicely wrapped and easy to eat.\n",

Other bks their burger and meat is always too hard and taste bland. But this one is pretty flavourful. Fries is alright kind of on the soft soggy side. I love the burger and I hope it will stay this way!\n\nEverything is not bad, and this is quite a quiet Burger King outlet. The generous cheese on the fries is commendable and worth applauding. Overall food tastes like your typical fast food restaurant, and is decent. The speed of service can definitely be improved. Prices so far with the deals are quite friendly. Burger King also cannot use ezlink card fyi\n\nWe had to drive back to collect the missing burger. It\u2019s not the first time this has happened during our BK take-away. Happened at the ARC and Orchard Cineleisure and our orders were not event big. Imagine how frustrating it is to have to return to collect the missing items when you are hungry.\n\nBK management, teach your staff to count! Or to be more attentive at work!\n\nI went to counter to order my food as im paying using cash. No one was there at the cashier. The Indian guy with tattoo saw me and did not take my order. Another guy went pass the cashier. When i nod to my head showing i want to order then he took my order. Hopefully the indian guy with tattoo have a better customer service.\n\nA few times the meat hasn't been cooked properly in the burger as can be seen in the photos\n\n\ud83d\udc4efood can be hit and miss\n",

Food was good - subtle flavours that meshed really well together, and beautiful presentation. The lamb in particular was executed perfectly. I also loved the mignardises and that the kitchen was open but calm and not chaotic.\n\nHere for birthday lunch, cosy setting but nothing much to shout about for the interior. Had the lunch menu, food is good but nothing really outstanding that I can remember. Hmm maybe Cherry Gazpacho is quite special. Perhaps its a normal lunch menu, maybe should come back again for special collaborations when they have one.\n\nSome changes to the menu itself. Menu is very refreshing, akin like the Spring season. As always, hostess & chef hospitality are the best. To us, their food, restaurant atmosphere, relationships between staffs & us are what made us being their regulars.\n\nA very nice ambiance intimate dining room that caters to about 6 pax capacity and some counter seats for perhaps, Omakase? Set menus are definitely French and heavy on seafood.\n\nThe service was nicely paced, dishes was explained, and professional. Their wine recommendation was good as well.\n\nThe presentation of each dish is where the star is. The taste is ok, balanced.\n\nRecommended for date night, probably not the best suit for big  groups or business dinner unless you reserve private room.\n\nWe booked the restaurant to celebrate our 25th year wedding anniversary.\nWe took the $268 set dinner and added on foie gras ($20) for one of our dinner set, and changed one of the dessert to cheese truffle.\nAll the dishes are wonderfully made, and even the bread basket (uniquely in a cloth pouch) is warm and hot, with specially made bread spread.\nThe service is amazing and special mentioned to Louis who has made our experience really enjoyable.\nWe also had Yamanaka-san who personally served us for one of the dishes.\nThe downside for the place is that it is a small restaurant and seatings are quite closed to one another. It's no issue for us and we mingled with other patrons.\nHighly recommended.\n",

The kids devoured the sweet & sour pork and the shredded pork in sesame buns that looked like mini-burgers. There was also a spectacularly presented appetiser which was an intricately carved bitter plant (maybe a gourd?) that came in a swirling cloud of dry ice. If you need something sweet to balance out the bitterness there is a tiny pot of honey that comes with it.\n\nIt was absolutely delicious. No wonder it has so many awards year after year.\n\nThe bun in the pork bun is baked almost to perfection and the sweet and sour pork with lychee was great (a tiny bit to sweet for me).\n\nMy two favorites though are the garlic prawn and the crispy beef. I will definitely be going again.\n\nThe food at Putien Kitchener road is amazing and I enjoy my meals here every much especially when Ah Lian is here. Ah Lian has been an amazing host to my family and I all these years, and we\u2019ll always come back to Putien for our birthday dinner.\n\nHad a very good dining experience here, the staff Ah Lian very attentive and the manager Fenny also recommended the well option for two pax, which we felt so comfortable. The eggplant with floss is highly recommended. They constantly make sure the patron having their food without worrisome ;) would come and visit here again!\n\nThe service was fantastic, and waiters are very helpful. Putien cuisine is not my favorite honestly, but this restaurant makes it so tempting and I can tell dishes were made with fresh ingredients, quite great compared to other Chinese restaurants in Singapore.\n",

We were treated to the most wonderful waiter in Arvin whose wine knowledge and food explanations were the highlight of the day. He answered all our questions and was forthcoming and generous in sharing his food knowledge. All the dishes were fantastic and very flavoursome. I can\u2019t wait to come back again! We had the amekase menu.\n\nHaving dined at this Peranakan restaurant upon a family member's recommendation, we were eager to experience its Michelin-acclaimed cuisine. Opting for the tasting menu, we were treated to an exceptional culinary journey. As someone with Southeast Asian roots, I might be a bit biased, but I must say this restaurant truly stood out. It exceeded my expectations and proved deserving of its Michelin accolade.\n\nHad this slightly less than a year back. Food was delicious, staff were attentive to all our requests. Restaurant was nicely located at Dempsey with free parking. Knowing that we were celebrating a birthday, they gave us a small dessert (kinda) which I felt was very thoughtful of them. The staff were also patient in taking countless number of picture for us. Definitely deserving of the one Michelin star. Will definitely be back again in future!\n\nI believe this brings the best of Peranakan fine dinner to the guest. Dishes are true to the original flavors yet giving a refreshing new twist. Great place to bring visitors to try our local delights but elevated.\n\nFantastic experience. The food was both friendly and approachable, given these were ingredients I've never tried before. Think elevated family meals cooked perfectly. Patrick and the rest of the staff were professional and genuinely proud of the food. Dessert stole the show.\n",

We ordered the 2 course lunch with an add on of extra serving of potato bread & steak.\n\nWe enjoyed the potato bread that we ordered a extra serving. The steak was also yummy and cooked to medium rare. The steak came with oyster mushroom was also cooked to perfection. Special shout-out to to the beef tartare(lovely presentation!)& pork steak(burst of flavour!!)!\n\nThe duck breast was slightly too rare for our liking.\n\nThe service was lovely and friendly and they also surprised me with a apple tart for my birthday.\n\nA lovely place where we spent our anniversary lunch. Food was YUM. A mix of different cuisines rolled into something I'd call contemporary European. Presentation of dishes was spectacular with the beef tartar showcased in a delightfully unusual way!\n\nThis is a five-star experience all the way - Alma has a Michelin star in the guide that just came out for Singapore, and deservedly so. They were happy to accommodate vegetarian food for the prix fixe menu, which is great value. The signature tofu with black truffle was sublime, as were the Japanese tomatoes with tomato sorbet. The amuse bouche of tomato with a sour plum film was another delight.\n\nIt's a nice space too, with a beautifully designed interior and a superb selection of wines and in particular rare whiskies.\n\nThis one's going on our repeat visit list for sure!\n\nA lovely fine dining restaurant with great service and friendly people. Food was very unique and tasteful. Looks like they have many years of being a 1-star Michelin restaurant. Well deserved!\n",

Air- conditioning is way too cold and freezes everyone. Any warm dish turns cold too quickly. Dessert was also a star and did not let down the entire course of dinner. Felt the staff could have been more confident in introducing each course.\n\nCame here to celebrate our anniversary, a surprise dinner planned by my husband for us. The restaurant is intimate with only a few tables available, so you get undivided attention from the staff. It is also an open kitchen concept which I love so you can see the chefs hard at working preparing their masterpieces for us. I enjoyed pretty much every single dish, the abalone wellington was definitely unique and one of a kind. Overall had a really good experience here.\n\nOne - starred Michelin restaurant located within Voco Hotel (previously known as Hilton Orchard), serving Modern-Contemporary cuisine,established by Restaurateur-Sommelier Ignatius Chan in 2004. There is heavy influence of japanese ingredients used in the menu and served in the European way. Opt for the menu with two main courses for a wholesome dining experience. Food presentation is beautiful and tastefully presented, and what's good to look at is also good to eat.\n\nHad our belated anniversary lunch at Iggy\u2019s as we were having a staycation at Hilton. A lovely resturant with friendly and helpful crew. Love the fact that we are able to view how the chef and his team prepared our meals to the kitchen.\n\nAs the husband and I do not take raw fish, the chef was able to customize to our taste by searing the fish, love how the raw yolk enhances the overall taste of the dish. They did an interesting take on the sponge gourd which brought the vegetable to another level. The linguine was average. The roast beef has charred edges which was a nice touch. Overall we enjoyed the 5 course meal at $150++ per pax.\n\nCame here for lunch with 2 overseas guests who would like to taste a Michelin restaurant.  Decided to bring them to Iggy's as the restaurant has been one that has been keeping their reputation for years. Food was great as you can see in pictures.. perhaps ..some touch up to the interior may make the place feel warm and friendly.\nDamage : $200 (lunch)/pax\n",

The ambiance felt like a page out of a Parisian romance novel, with soft lights and a melody of enchanting tunes. The menu, a poetic composition of flavors, offered a dance of taste that left me in awe. The waitstaff, dressed in elegant attire, choreographed a dining experience that was nothing short of a culinary ballet. Each dish, a masterpiece plated with precision, tasted like a symphony of harmonious ingredients. If you're yearning for a dining escapade that feels like a rendezvous with gourmet dreams, Les Amis is the destination to indulge your palate in a poetic feast!\n\nOrdered the dark chocolate cake and it was so delicious! The cake is placed on top of a tart shell which is very special. Almonds are super fragrant too.\nHope that delivery service can be included in the future and handwriting on the chocolate could be better \ud83d\ude05\n\nHad a very pleasant dining experience at Les Amis. Patrick, our server, was very friendly, attentive, and entertaining. He suggested a perfect wine to have with the steak. He also patiently explained every dish to us. The amuse bouche tartalette with bacon and mushrooms was a good introduction to the meal. Notable food from our dinner are the French egg, crab souffl\u00e9, simmered celery root, salted brioche, herb sorbet, and poached pears. The caviar that was thoughtfully used in some of the dishes is an interesting addition of a complex salt flavor; it did not overwhelm the taste of the other ingredients. The wagyu was tender but I expected a bit more flavor and it lacked a bit of surprise. The herb sorbet is most interestingly a refreshing palate cleanser. Overall, it was a memorable and pleasant gastronomic experience.\n\nTruly Michelin 3 stars! Excellent food with great creativity,  best service, excellent wine pairing, and the deserts are the best.  Not cheap but it is worth it!\n\nEverything was impeccable, the food was great and the portions were generous, great wine pairings and amazing service.\nToni and the team were very kind and took genuine care of us.\nThe Blu Lobster appetizer, their sour dough, the riz de veu and the cheese course were divine.\nHighly recommended.\n",

What I found extra special was who each dish was beautifully presented with such intricate details.\n\nFood was hands down beating expectations. I knew it would be amazing for a Michelin star restaurant but I actually thought it was better quality than just a 1 star. Also appreciated the large diversity in courses and in between tasters for the full menu. If anything there can be too much food you get full!. The smaller space feels more intimate and nice to look into the kitchen area. The option to choose your tasting size was also nice\n\nCons\n- entrance door is difficult to find for building\n- wine list is long\u2026but not high diversity in selection. It seemed like the median price was $800-$1000 for any wine bottle. Not many options for simpler but quality,  less exclusive wines. Also although wine is \u201cthe\u201d thing for most of these places, still wish there was more spirit friendly options\n\nMy favourite fining dining experience in Singapore. The food was exquisite, delicately well-balanced and carefully served. The ambience was intimate and soothing. The butter and bread was heavenly tasty, soft and aromatic.\n\nIt was a birthday celebration for us and we had a wonderful time. Definitely recommended for a special occasion.\n\nStunningly well presented and proportioned lunch taster menu. From the first perfectly warmed brioche and seasoned butter, through an exquisite selection of canap\u00e9s, fish, duck and desserts the team provide culinary delights that will challenge your vocabulary to do justice to the experience of your tastebuds.\n\nWe had the lunch tasting menu (SGD 148) and it was absolutely amazing. Their Parker house roll with Shio Kombu butter was packed with intense umami, and I would have demolished the whole bun (6 servings) if I didn't have breakfast (haha).\n\nThe menu is French, with a pretty heavy Japanese influence. Appetizers came in small bites that piqued the palette. The small bites were:\n\nAnkimo glazed in Ponze with Katsuoboshi cream and salted radish\nSmoked Eel Riletter with apple and marigold\nSpring pea tartlet with smoked cream crue and marinated Ikura\n36 month aged comte cheese cornet\n\nThe main appetizer was a picturesque feature of aged Hamachi with fennel, shiso and N25 Kaluga Reserve. Superbly refreshing and slightly salty, it set up the tone for the next heavier main course - the Roasted Venison with green asparagus. I could say that this is one of the best roasted venison I've ever tasted - so tender and flavourful, with no gaminess to it. Beautifully executed!\n\nI was also immensely impressed by their dessert - to be honest I feel a lot of fine dining restaurants are a letdown when it comes to desserts, like falling off a sharp cliff in the tasting experience, but I was super super happy that their desserts allowed us to end the meal on a high note. The warm and light pistachio souffle was a perfect complement to the cold and rich Abinao chocolate with espresso cremeux.\n\nThe only part I felt they could improve on was the petit fours, not bad but a tad bitter for the earl grey tart and the canel\u00e9 was way too hard. But look how pretty the Choux is with white chocolate butterflies on top! There was definitely a lot of effort from the pastry chef.\n\nOverall an amazing experience and I think well worth the price tag!\n",

There are 3 options/dining experiences you can choose from. I went for the most comprehensive one - 3 starters, 1 main with chef\u2019s premium ingredient and 1 dessert.\n\nWhile I can see how Rhubarb has been able to maintain its 1 star for so many years, I struggled a bit to find some key differentiating factor versus other French contemporary Michelin places. Good food nonetheless.\n\nService was really good. The dishes kept coming fast and I was done with my entire dinner in an hour.\n\nAll in all a very good dining place. If you haven\u2019t been there, it is definitely worth going.\n\nThe 4-course lunch Omakase was very very satisfying, with interesting notes and flavours that I\u2019m pleasantly surprised by. I also really enjoyed my chat with Joseph as a solo diner, so that my lunch was a little livelier. I had an absolutely lovely time and would return again.\n\nDecided to go last min as I suddenly met a long time friend. She said she didn\u2019t want to eat something too heavy. The starters were mainly seafood and fruits, which opened up her appetite after a full day of hard stress work. The main was a tender slowed cooked beef. Dessert was a coconut sorbet I think (?). Accompanied the meal with a Riesling. We quite enjoyed the night.\nFunny note, one of the appetisers is a mix of fruits and seafood, I confused the apple with an olive. The taste was good though. Please don\u2019t change the dish because of my comment.\n\nFood are all tastefully plated and delicious. They were kind to ask me if I have dietary restrictions and I told them I would like to have all cooked food. So they made changes for me to replace the lightly torched scallops to cooked crab stick for appetiser. Really appreciate it:) every dishes were all well explained and executed.\n\nOutstanding food, worth its Michelin star. Service is friendly. The atmosphere is a little bit let down by the lighting and impersonal musical background. Overall a very nice place to have an amazing meal. Prices very reasonable.\n",

Alex and Kim were friendly and was impeccable in their service. Food was amazing with unique combinations of fresh ingredients. Chef also came over to each table to interact which we felt was an awesome touch. Strongly recommended!\n\nWell deserved Michelin Restaurants.\nThe bread is so crispy on the outside and so so so soft on the inside. Pairing with the bordier butter, it is really exceptional.\nEvery dish of the food is amazing.\n\nThe service is so good. When the table is full of crumbs, the waiter will clean it up to sweep away the crumbs. The waiter are also friendly and knowledgeable about the dishes.\nWhen we found a bone in the fish and the chef came out to apologize. Felt the service was so good.\n\nThe atmosphere in the round room felt great too.\n\nOne of the best fine dining places I\u2019ve ever been to! I can\u2019t keep track of what was being served because there was just so many different courses, but each course was really tasty \ud83e\udd70 I don\u2019t think I\u2019m a small eater but I was so full by the last few courses, I don\u2019t think I ate any at all. Remember to pace yourself. I\u2019m most impressed by their bakes; their toasty black sesame bread was literally the best bread I\u2019ve ever had in my life.\n\nWhite Grass is a hidden gem, providing a distinctive dining venture with its fusion of Japanese and European flavors.\n\nEach dish is delectable, especially the bread, pastries, and desserts rank the finest that I ever tasted.\n\nThe real flower centerpiece adds a pleasant fragrance, and the stylish decor contributes to the overall charm, making it an excellent option for couples and hosting friends.\n\nOn my second visit, I can confidently say they consistently exceed my expectations.\n\nVery good ambience and attentive service. The bread is crispy outside and moist inside. Sesame bread is delicious too. Abalone is well done combined with the sauce and texture. The lobster meat is too soft for our liking. Everything is fine but no distinctive wow factor.\n",

But trust me, the food is worth the chaos in getting the food. Plenty of seating including upstairs.\n\nTheir specialty is the spicy squid in squid ink sauce. It\u2019s quite spicy but flavourful. Other classic dishes like fried tofu with egg, chicken curry, beef rangdong and variety of fried dishes are all done well.\n\nIt\u2019s Michelin bib, and we are fan of nasi Padang. The black squid samba was great.  The rendang chicken was a little over cooked but the flavourful gravy help.  The the handout anchovies potatoes chilli was ok. Asam fish was well done with perfect ladyfingers.  The samba chilli provided was very fresh and right amount of spiciness and flavour. Cuttlefish was forgettable. Tahgay long bean salad cannot go wrong. Yes I will be back again.  Here there is more consistency than many other NP restaurants around the area.\n\nStayed nearby and came to eat here almost every day! Food is authentically Indonesian and tastes absolutely delicious, they accept credit card payments as well which is quite a novelty in small shops in Singapore (dont know why). Everything we tried was good \ud83d\udc4d\n\nLike what many claimed, this was one of those long saved but not checked off places in my books too - finally found a day in which we are craving for some spicy food and decided to head down here!\n\nAt 1:30pm, the queue was still stretching out of the store, although it does move relatively quickly, it\u2019s pretty hard to get a table even with second level seating - somewhat like a hawker centre if I may.\n\nThe selection was in abundance compared to the other Nasi Padang stalls (which really isn\u2019t in the same league), from the normal begedil to the rare tahu goreng.\n\n\ud83d\udcb0 the price point is okay - though the tahu goreng at $8 was pricier than the fish and chicken which were $5 a piece.\n\nFood was really good in general! The tahu goreng, grilled chicken and fish are a must order when you visit \ud83c\udf57 \ud83d\udc20\n\nDefinitely will revisit when I\u2019m craving for a good Nasi Padang with a wider variety!\n\nDecided to give them a try because of good reviews. There\u2019s more seats available upstairs and it\u2019s air conditioned.\n\nThere\u2019s one shared toilet upstairs too.\n\nOrdered some dishes to share for 2 paxs and it cost us $26.60.\n\nHonestly speaking, beef rendang and fried chicken is tough and dry. Brinjal was bland.  Begedel is soggy. Asam ikan taste okay.\nAlso, food wasn\u2019t served hot.\n",

These folks have real flair, making the visit enjoyable from the moment we arrived. I think that I can relate to the chefs \u201ccross roads\u201d concept, an amazing set menu with elements from across the globe. Great wine pairing, loved hearing the story lines.  Loved the casual, relaxed atmosphere. Everything presented with confidence and fun.  Well deserving of its Michelin status.  Each course was remarkable, but I was particularly taken with the chocolate fish ball!\n\nI recently visited Nouri and I must say, the experience was outstanding. The food was absolutely delicious, with a unique blend of cross-cultural flavors that truly impressed my taste buds. From start to finish, every dish was beautifully presented and expertly prepared.\n\nThe renovated space is also fantastic, with a modern yet elegant atmosphere that adds to the overall dining experience. There is also a renewed chef table.\n\nThe service was top-notch and the staff was incredibly attentive. I highly recommend Nouri to anyone looking for an exceptional dining experience in Singapore.\n\nThank you, Nouri, for an unforgettable evening!\n\nThe owner did a wonderful service. We went in for lunch before our flight and the service was prompt and the food came out in a nice pace for lunch. The food was ok and this is my second time here. It has been consistent during the years. This is a nice spot to bring business guest for lunch as it is usually quiet during lunch in the area where most of the comparable restaurants may only open for dinner.  Yes, it is quite pricey.\n\nFood was great, service was great, atmosphere was great. It was relaxed and we had a good time over good food. All the options were presented to us so well; tea, opening drinks, etc. I was just slightly shocked that the selection of tea to end the meal costed $30ish per pot. But other than that, I enjoyed dinner.\n\nUnique flavors, warm, friendly service, beautiful plates, reasonably priced. Staff generously explained every dish and ingredients and an energetic open kitchen made for a memorable dining experience.\n",

The contemporary symphony of aromas and textures through a vegetarian focus was fresh, exciting and new. Every dish is meticulously crafted to bring a delightful balance of flavors. The wine pairing was on point. Compliments job to the chef.\n\nExcellent service. Attentiveness and professionalism exceeded our expectations.\n\nThe atmosphere was warm, friendly and cosy. We felt welcomed and in optimal conditions to savor our dinner.\n\nWe recommend this restaurant to anyone passionate about food.\n\nBeautiful vegetarian cuisine, beautiful ambience, beautiful service and staff. Just take that leap for tastebud and exquisite ingredients discovery. Presentation of the food, attention to your dining experience made it such a pleasant experience. Do come by each season for different culinary exposure.\n\nChef Jeremy and the team did a fantastic job championing seasonal vegetables. The wine paring was beautifully done for each course to highlight the taste of the food with a great balance.\n\nThe ambience of the restaurant was intimate and lovely but the light was slightly dark. It was a birthday celebration and we had a great time throughout the night.\n\nThe menu was exceptional, a great variation of vegetables and herbs tastefully balanced and beautifully presented. The choice of courses was perfectly matched. The staff was very attentive and friendly. The chef introduced himself to all the guests and was very accommodating.

Catching up with friends\n\nThank you Team 65 for your hospitality  \ud83e\udef6\n\nHad the most fabulous opportunity to dine in table65 a couple months ago and was presented with exquisite 3 course lunch by Chef Dayal and team.\n\nI must say the experience was way beyond.\nEvery plates served was a taste of wonder and every bites and sips worth the savouring\n\nWill definitely come back for more of these splendid treats.\n\nShout out to Kevin for being such an awesome host with some mean mixology skills :)\n\nA truly unforgettable first Michelin star experience. Dayal and his team curated a spectacular dinner with bold flavours and world-class ingredients. Was lovely chatting to the staff about table65's history and what led them to where they are now. Definitely worth a second visit, not to mention situated in extraordinary Sentosa.\n\nThe food was a surprise with the presentation and the food was very tasty especially the amuse-bouche, starter and the dessert. I picked the venison, the dressing for the sauce and roasted pumpkin were well combination too.\n\nBooked this restaurant with great anticipation of the dinner.  There is no a la carte menu to order only set menu, and the price is steep at $288 per pax for a 6 course dinner.  However, we still went for it reading that they are a Michelin restaurant.   But the overall experience there was not very pleasant.\n\nWe were greeted and shown to our seat by a waiter? Bartender? Sommelier? He spoke loudly and in a fashion like those at the market place which was rather rare in a fine dining restaurant.   We were seated and I asked if we could change our seats to a more private adjacent small table for 2.  He rejected saying the restaurant is full and that the 2 seats would be in the way of their work traffic... and we took his words that the restaurant would be full on a Wednesday evening...\nThe restaurant is nicely renovated but had a cold feeling in spite of the fact that we were seated at a counter around the kitchen.  Maybe because there were only 4 crew in the kitchen. the place lacked some vibe.\nWe were given a small pad with the smallest lettering of the menu.  Having aging eyesight and the dimness of the place is commented that the wordings are really small.  And he laughingly said \" can expand mah..\" and turned to go.  We asked for the wine list, and he said inside here also and pointed to the grading wine list.  We clicked in, but being not savy with gadgets, we could not find the list and so asked for help.   And he instructed us how to go into the pages. The prices are really steep for the wines and so we decided to do the wine pairing at a price tag of $188 with wines from Portugal, Germany, French and Italian...\nFood was good..  Ah, I must say the bread is really good.\nFinally we are done with our dinner and ask if they have camomile tea.  Yes, of course, but we weren't told that there is a charge for it.   We were charged $18 per cup.  And we only had one cup and it was a Chinese tea cup....\nThe night finally come to a close for us and there were only 4 couples....\ud83e\udd14 I thought we were told the restaurant was fully booked and our request for a change of table was rejected because of that....\ud83e\udd14??\nWell..\n",

Overall an enjoyable afternoon spent, will worth the leave from work we had to take just to make the lunch sitting.\n\nI have tried many restaurants in Singapore and this is the best in my opinion. Usually in such restaurants I\u2019ll always have 1-2 favourite dishes that blew my mind, but here I can\u2019t choose. Perfect amount of flavour and texture in every dish. Service was exceptional too.\n\nA little more contemporary than Korean though that\u2019s perhaps (rightly or wrongly) influenced by my expectations of a Korean fine dining experience at Meta and hence left with a slight disappointment of what it could be.\n\nThis probably explains why the standout dish is the abalone from Jeju that sits on top on the flavorful porridge/ risotto. It\u2019s superb - something you could have everyday. If there\u2019s one most indulgent comfort food ever, it\u2019s that. Not even the KBBQ with A5 wagyu could up seat that.\n\nOverall, there wasn\u2019t a dish that disappointed per se - execution was great, especially the Striped Jack - the accompanying squid and surf clams were perfectly cooked and the tuna with avocado was a nice surprise/ twist. But as I alluded to earlier and I am not sure if my expectations were misplaced, the disappointment was perhaps I was looking more for the Korean influence in the food that I didn\u2019t quite get.\n\nOne of the best restaurants I\u2019ve been to in Singapore. The scallop was my favourite dish. Overall, it was an amazing dining experience and I highly recommend this place.\n",

I found the service a little stiff, as the evening progressed the staff loosened up a bit which was nice, everything was so extra, the presentation of the food was so interesting and exciting. The food was good but I can probably tick off this experience. Make sure you like seafood! A once and a lifetime experience!\nIt was pretty cool we got to meet the chefs after.\n\nI certainly had very high expectations of Odette, it having 3 Michelin stars and being #14 in The World's 50 Best Restaurants list at the time of the visit (november 2023).\n\nWell, fame is definitely not everything! From start to finish, what lacked was soul and personality, and the whole experience made me think reputation by terms of media and rankings might be increasingly decadent.\n\nTo start off, we were offered a small and uncomfortable-looking table right by the entrance door, even though I had reserved a table in the Private Dining Room over a month prior. We had to insist on being placed in the intended room.\n\nThe whole time, it felt like we were doing the restaurant a favor being there and I could sense so much pretentiousness in service, food and ambiance. The flavor and even the high quality ingredients were shadowed by this and the gimmicky presentations of the food.\n\nAt a USD 500/SGD 700 price point per person (without wine pairing), I most definitely cannot recommend\u00a0Odette to anyone.\n\nWhat a lovely and delicious evening out in Singapore. Service was what you would expect from a 3* establishments. All the dishes, from the butter to the pigeon, were out of this world. The staff was well orchestrated and did a great job of providing information on each dish and engaging us in conversation throughout the evening. Having been fortunate enough to dine at other 2 & 3* restaurants around the globe I would put this in my top 3 in a very close race with Mudec in Milan for number 1 and edging out French Laundry in terms of the menu. I will definitely try to secure another reservation next time I'm in Singapore.\n\nOdette has always been on my to-try list and this year I was treated to a birthday dinner here!\n\nAn amazing French experience savoring the 7-course meal. We were totally impressed by the presentation as well as the flavour of each dish. Not to mention the excellent and attentive service by the crew! It was also nice of them to gift a bottle of strawberry jam for every guest.\n\nAn unforgettable meal, or rather gourmet journey at this 3-starred michelin.\n\nTried the 7 course meal for a celebratory lunch.\n\nThe food was great - loved the Maryuko Uni, smoked organic egg and the desserts. \u2018Blanc\u2019 the dessert was phenomenal.\n\nHowever, service was quite average. The waiters rushed through explanations of their dishes. And while they tried to entertain our questions about the dishes, the way that they did it was quite cursory and generally seemed quite reluctant to hold a conversation.\n",

The umami and creamy sea urchin balanced with the sweetness of the shrimp and slight saltiness of the caviar to produce a full flavour profile with each mouthful. Loved the perfectly (teppanyaki) seared abalone with risoni and the A5 Kobe wagyu dipped in the egg yolk (it was so silky, tender and flavourful from the marbling). Service was excellent as well; they were jovial and attentive and made the experience delightful.\n\nThis is a late review. I came here during valentines weekend. Both my friend and I had food poisoning and I was bed ridden for three days. Only decided to review now because my friend told me that her group of friends also got food poisoning from the same group of restaurants. So totally not worth it even tho the food was great. Spent 750 per pax to get food poisoning.. really ridiculous..\n\nWe had some Izakaya food and beer before going for show. Food must be good considering the price is not cheap for beer food, but its a tad a bit too salty for me. Service is great of course. My favorite will be the lobster spaghetti, a bit of fusion.\n\nWorst Omakase I ever had. Decided to leave a review. Anyone who thought of coming, read this.\n\nFor the $700 dinner omakase menu, their special additional dish is only a plate of \u2018otoro\u2019. (Picture 2) Yet they didn\u2019t even remove the sinew of the tuna properly, causing it to be extremely chewy and tough to eat. Have to chew for very long time and yet some areas we just puke out.\n\nOther omakase restaurants I\u2019ve been to, the otoro basically melt in your mouth.\n\nAlso, when they show you the ingredients (Picture 1), as you can see there\u2019s a lobster. At the end of the course, there\u2019s no lobster provided and was not in the menu as well (Picture 3)\n\nIf that\u2019s the case. Why put the lobster on the ingredients plate, I don\u2019t get it. The other dishes taste so-so only. Not memorable or outstanding.\n\nNot just a dining experience; it\u2019s a culinary journey through the intricacies of Japanese cuisine, but with a touch of modern flair. Made with the best quality. Pricing is on the higher side (tried both of the $550 and $700 omakase) but for a special occasion, it\u2019s worth every penny.\n",

The restaurant is exactly as advertised - chefs take on Singapore food - however I didn\u2019t think it was necessary better than hawker stalls (especially if you consider the price). The other thing with the menu is it switched between hot and cold dishes too often (cold as in frozen). For example, the salad was cold, then the frog pie was hot, then the chili crab was partially cold, then switched to hot prawn mee, then the fish was even cold (I think the sauce not the fish itself)\u2026. And so forth.\n\nIt\u2019s so apt that this 1 Michelin starred restaurant is located within the Esplanade \u2014 Singapore\u2019s National performing art centre.\n\nHaving dinner here is like being treated to the whole Singaporean experience\u2026 not only showcasing the cuisine, but our culture and way of life. Will not spoil the surprise for u, but they go all out with the props here!\n\nIf u are visiting Singapore, I highly recommend this dining experience, which is not only delicious but highly-entertaining! We left the restaurant with our bellies full and very happy.\n\nLocals may balk at the high price we are paying for local favourites, but I think the creativity and presentation is worth a visit.\n\nCreative spin to local dishes, knowledgeable staff. Definitely an experience not to be missed!\n\nAlthough I\u2019d have preferred lesser influence from Japan, got confusing for a bit when dishes tasted like it\u2019s from Japan instead of Singapore.\n\nOverall a great experience and highly recommend!\n\nCrazy off the hook amazing experience at Labyrinth Restaurant. Singapore is blessed with so many incredible places to eat and Labyrinth is right at the top. The food is impeccable in terms of flavour and presentation, the service is on point and close to perfection, but it is the story and creativity that is infused through the entire dinning experience that transcends the gastronomic journey. I loved every minute and can\u2019t wait to go back for more. I now know why Labyrinth is #11 on the best Asian restaurant list for 2023, was awarded the highest climber award in 2023, and have 1 Michelin star.\n\n[Late review]\n\nVisited in May 2023\n\nA truly fantastic dining experience which beats some of the \u2018higher star\u2019 restaurants in Singapore (from a flavour and cuisine creativity perspective) quite comfortably in my view. Labyrinth\u2019s rise in recent Asia Best 50 rankings is well justified.\n\nThe dishes are a tribute to some of the classic Singaporean flavours and the menu does justice to the various inspirations (hawker food, old SG restaurants). The starting course (Roti Jon, Otah, Satay) set the tone and it just kept getting better. Every main course item from Chili crab to Prawn Noodle Soup to the Sizzling Plate Steak was exquisite. Among the dessert dishes, the Orh Nee preparation was fantastic.\n\nFor drinks, I did not go with the wine pairing and just ordered a few cocktails. Average cocktails and nothing exemplary.\n\nA 200% recommendation for all SG residents and visitors\n",

Would highly recommend getting the seven course menu as there were so many more elements in our dinner incorporated that made it all the more special. Flavours were all very well balanced and overall we left feeling very satisfied.\n\nVisited in Sep 2023\n\nBraci was on my list of restaurants to visit for over 4 years and I must say that it was worth the wait. It is no surprise that Braci has retained its Michelin 1 star for 6 consecutive years. The menu was a progressive one which is definitely inspired by Chef Mattie\u2019s Italian roots. There are 2 choices for people (5 course and 7 course). I would suggest people to go for the 7 course as the additional dishes in the 7 course meal are worth it. One of my favourite parts of the experience was trying out the 100 yr old balsamic vinegar.\n\nIf you\u2019re not taking the wine pairing, I would strongly recommend folks to try out a few of their cocktails, esp. their Negroni (one of the most unique ones I\u2019ve had)\n\nService was good. The restaurant is able to cater to some food allergies (like my shellfish allergy).\n\nA definite recommendation for fine dining lovers.\n\nLocation was not to my liking.\nGreat staff very welcoming and accomodating to our strict dietary restrictions.\nThey had to make a menu from scratch for us which gives them bonus points.\nFood quality was amazing and the ingredients exquisite.\nHowever, the taste of the food was confusing and frankly bland at times.\nBut i cannot judge the restaurant fairly as i did not try the actual menu items.\n\nAmazing time at Braci for a birthday celebration for my husband. The Italian food was superb with beautiful floral aesthetic to each dishes. Staff is polite and friendly too! Special thanks to Chef Matteo who is very engaging and make the day extra special! Love the black truffle \"hide and seek\" dish which is one of the highlights of all dishes! It so savoury and unforgettable\u2026.\n\nnice food nice atmosphere. i tot the service could be more positive. but i still enjoy the experience especially on a chill night in the rooftop. overall quite an expensive experience but they were very nice to add an additional anniversary dessert for us:)\n",

Crab pasta tasted like the non-spicy version of chilli crab which is quite unique. Would say the fish was the best. The fish itself is roasted very well and also love the layered potatoes.\n\nOverall, felt that it was Italian cuisine tailored to the Singaporean palate. Also, the restaurant is understaffed, there was only two service-crew serving everyone. Atmosphere-wise, it\u2019s on the top  level of the hotel but there\u2019s no views of anything. It was basically a poolside restaurant with the occasional crying / screaming of kids and babies in the pool.\n\nWould only recommend if you are hotel guest or looking for a casual restaurant in the area.\n\nWhen you're looking for a less crowded Italian restaurant on Orchard Road, this is a good place to hide. Nice small restaurant, located on the Rooftop of Voco Hotel. The food is good, but it could be better. Service staff were wonderful and knowledgeable of the menu.\n\nI\u2019ve visited with my mom during singapore trip. They served great dishes. I especially recommend Truffle Burrata Cheese Pizza. The staff who is Korean guy is very kind and professional. We had a good moment because of him. I want to thank you to he and rest of all staffs.\n\nLove the ambience of this roof top bar as well as the service received!\n\nThank you Cai Ying, Jeremy and Owen for the exceptional services during my dinner at il Cielo, thank you for making it easy and enjoyable for me and my 5 year old son.\n\nSpecial mention to Cai Ying, who was especially attentive to all my needs and food recommendations were superb (look at the photos!)\n\nOf course, thank you to Chef Marco and Chef Beh Li for making my foodie son crave for the food even more after we left the restaurant.\n\nWould definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who is looking to have a quiet evening with pool and view of Orchard!\n\nDo try the Burrata Purgilese and the Tiramisu! These 2 are my favourites!\n\nI had a really lovely lunch with my family. It was a special occasion to celebrate and the food and service was excellent (the pool view is great as well). The staff Owen made our day and we genuinely enjoyed our time there. Thanks team!!\n",

Anyway the waiter was very nice to let us have a table for outside area.\n\nThe happy hour oyster attracted me and to my surprised, the $2.50 per oyster is large and creamy. They did not give some miserable quality for promotional price. Commendable for this!\n\nOrdered the blueberries rosemary smash and they put real jumbo size blueberries and a fresh sprig of rosemary. A very refreshing drink served in large size in my opinion. It lasted me the whole entire 2 hours of conversation.\n\nAn ideal place to chitchat in a nice environment that is not too noisy. The service of the staff is very attentive too. The young crews are super friendly.\n\nOysters are great - super succulent and pair perfectly with hot sauce and lime. Pizza is quite average but the sweet potato fries are something else. Cocktails were average. The interior is beautiful and I heard there a live band plays occasionally.\n\nThis restaurant is packed on weekends and the attraction is probably the live band and mostly female crowd. The food is actually pretty decent but I\u2019d say the pizza was better than the Vongole pasta (which was rather salty). Service can be slow due to the large number of tables the waitress needs to attend to.\n\nSides would be more suitable for big groups to share. The food were great. The cheese fries had mozeralla and nacho cheese which provides different layers of taste. The portions of the mains was very filling too. It might get a little crowded even on weekdays dinner so it would be better to make a reservation first.\n\nAttentive service, great atmosphere and quality food. I\u2019m always a bit skeptical of eating non-Asian cuisine in Singapore but I was pleasantly surprised by the food here at Supply and Demand. We dined as a large group and ordered several appetisers, pizzas and pastas. There were some Asian fusion flavours/dishes but also standard Italian flavours. Would recommend the vegetariana pizza, the calamari, and fig and prosciutto starter. The service was excellent and we enjoyed a nice bench seat off to the side of the restaurant. Would happily return.\n",

Taste is just like how the other Saizeriya branches are around Singapore. Simple, a huge variety of pastas to choose from. All in all.. it's comfort Italian food for the masses.\n\nQuick and basic Italian style food is what to expect here. No white linen table cloths although you can get a small decanter of white or red wine to create more of a moment. They offer a number of vegetarian options, I tried both the mushroom soup and the pumpkin soup. The mushroom is the better of the two with a nicer thick consistency and hearty flavor. If you are a soda drinker like me - recommend adding the free flow drinks to satisfy your cola craving.\n\nSaizeriya is like the Italian food joint for those of us craving Italian food on a tight budget, serving Italian fare fit for discerning peasants.\n\nThe standout dishes at Saizeriya include their affordable Escargot and Garlic Focaccia. These offerings provide a garlicky explosion that will destroy your breath for the remaining day. The food quality can be somewhat inconsistent, the pasta sauces were a bit on the runny side in my latest visit.\n\nStaff were fast and alert. They were friendly too. The food was delicious and cheap! Delivered really quickly to the table. There\u2019s also a lot of vegetarian options! Love it there!\n",

We had the melon with ham as well as the octopus which were really cooked well and tasty.\nThe main dish today was a miss. The beef was really tough even cooked medium. Tendons were striped across the entire steak which should never be the case with a ribeye.\n\nSo far one of the two best pizza's I have had beed eating in Singapore. Great tomato passata, decent salami and cheese. All ingredients are fresh and good quality. I was really surprised with short waiting time, just a couple of minutes and all three pizza's have been served. Very friendly and helpful Staff.\n\nThe portions match the pricing, so rest assured that you'd be full! I got 2 mains (iberico pork and pesto pizza) for sharing and were beyond full. The food was flavourful and good but was a tad too rich/salty to finish. Come with more friends for a bigger bang for your buck.\n\nVisited Lino 2 weeks ago for dinner, so yeah this is a long overdue write-in. I didn't manage to reserve a table online, so my friend and I just do walk-in. Unfortunately that day the restaurant had quite a few of big groups, hence we got the smallest table there - a little wonky and cramp.\nHowever, I must say that the experience was delightful. The standout dishes that I tried were the Burrata Pizza, Truffle Fries, and Scallop Risotto.\nThe burrata pizza was a true masterpiece. The combination of the creamy burrata cheese with the freshness of tomato and pesto sauce plus the perfectly crust, not only visual appealing but also bursting with flavour. It's a must try for any pizza enthusiast. Truffle fries - excellent. The risotto was cooked beautifully with a creamy texture that complemented the succulent scallops.\nThis restaurant is definitely one of the top choices for those looking for Italian food in central Singapore.\n\nFirst time trying this place on a weekend late dinner. Crowded but with available seats. Decent customer service. This place is nicely renovated with nice background music. Ordered 2 mains + 1 side. Price is decent for restaurant setup in orchard. Personally i feel the portion is slightly smaller. The pasta for the carbonara is abit hard for my liking. The duck confit taste good and meat is tender. Something i will recommend. Overall a good dining experience.\n",

I started with Tasmanian baby squid as antipasto, followed by two plates of pasta of the day, namely lamb pasta as well as pumpkin ravioli. Normally, I don't include dessert in my review, but the yuzu sorbet from the restaurant is truly commendable.\n\nWell located in Orchard. Oysters fresh and sweet. Family liked the bolognese and thin crust pizza.\n\nPumpkin soup was standard, it reminded me of blended baby food.\n\nMy personal favourite is the uni pasta, the cream base sauce on the Uni pasta is just right, not overwhelming, savoury enough to also enjoy the  uni. I didn't  taste the yuzu in the sauce but I did enjoy the ginseng leaves as part of the flavor.\n\nAll the pasta are generously portioned,  so it's good to share.\n\nOne of the best restaurants in Singapore! We have been to many Michelin star restaurants but we think LaD'oro definitely deserves the recognition because it is better than many of them. The food is great in terms of taste, look, creativity, combination, presentation and portion. The chef finds every opportunity to surprise you and show you the difference between Italian and Japanese ingredients. The effort from the chef and experience as a guest is flawless! The menu we had is Autumn and we will be back for the next season. The Sendai Wagyu is the most impressive dish but unfortunately I forgot to take a photo.\n\nPretty nice and grand Interior, and initially I thought the price will be exorbitant but it's not. Def not cheap but I think it's acceptable to me. 3 of us spent around 50 each for 1 uni pasta (this costs the most but worth it as the sea urchins are quite large), 1 pizza and 1 side (yummy baby squids!), and we were very full. They taste good as well.\n\nwe booked dinner for 6.30 pm on a Sunday and there were only 2 other tables occupied. soft music and lighting made the atmosphere pretty romantic for dates! we ordered truffle fries (but they ran out of fries, only had wedges - we still prefer truffle w fries though), Pizza Bismarck and Tagliatelle Hokkaido Snow Beef A5 Bolognese. BOTH the pizza and the bolognese were SO GOOD. we loved it so much. they have really nice and pretty cakes too btw but we didn't get to try as we were very full but will def return to try those!\nservice by the staff was really good as they were very attentive to customers' needs - they even offered to split our pasta into 2 portions as they guessed we were sharing it!\n",

Not only were the sides and pasta absolutely delicious, with a wide range of options to choose from, but the service was impeccable. The staff was attentive, friendly, and made sure every aspect of our meal was enjoyable. I truly appreciated the excellent service that accompanied the delectable pasta dishes. The olive oil cake was excellent as well. A little cramped in terms of the seating but nevertheless I'll definitely be returning for more memorable meals!\n\nMost memorable anniversary dinner that I've had. Food is generally good. What stands out most is their service. It's impeccable. Do take note that they have strict dress code requirements. I was rejected initially due to not wearing covered shoes and have to wait till the customer who is using their loan shoes is done with his meal. Having said that, I'm still very satisfied with the overall experience. This shows how good the service was. Special mention to Kishore for his great service and for providing a Polaroid photo of my wife and I to remember the night. Will definitely be back!\n\nMy second time here and the food and service is still as great! Special thanks to Margie who took care of us for tonight. She recommended us a few dishes based on our preference and everything was good! My favourite would be the  grilled octopus as it was not chewy or tough but of right firmness. Would definitely visit again! Thanks Margie!\n\nWe recently dined at this fantastic restaurant and had an amazing experience. Their pizza (only available for lunch), mussels and pasta were both outstanding, bursting with flavor. The service was top-notch, with Winson going above and beyond to ensure a delightful dining experience.  Who gave us food and desserts recommendations we really enjoyed\n\nSister and brother-in-law brought us here for a birthday celebration\nThe food was excellent! Even a Caesar salad was unforgettable. Mussels starter with delicious buttery bread. Beef tagliatelle was very moreish too\n\nService was top notch!! Super attentive, constant water filling and checking in on us if we needed anything. Was most impressed when they gave us a card with a handwritten note from every single staff on duty + a Polaroid for keepsake. This is service like no other.\n\nHighly recommended please do come here for an awesome Unforgettable dining experience\n",

All the dishes we ordered were outstanding except for the mushroom soup which was too watery.\nWe really love the Caesar Salad, Burrata pizza & seafood aglio olio.\nDefinitely will be back to try other items on the menu.\n\nGreat service! Very helpful attentive crew who recommended the Chianti wine which went down great with the pizzas. Good price too for the bottle at $60. Pizzas freshly made, indeed try the burata. Calamari also went down well and overall a very nice atmosphere and casual dining place to hang out/gatherings along Orchard Road. And they open on a Monday night too! Enjoy.\n\nThe pizza is OK, crusty chewy edges on a thin crust, 12 inch, good for 2 to share. The surprise fav here was the Caesar salad.\n\nThe rest we had were somewhat disappointing, especially the chicken wings that felt like they were double fried leftovers from last night. The fusion pasta of Salmon and Ikura was a failure too, there was a strong fishy smell in the dish. Can't find fault in the Tiramisu, but can't find praise either.\n\nService was prompt. Reservations recommended.\n\nvery cosy atmosphere, simple and quiet. staff was friendly and attentive too. be sure to make your reservation before coming down because the place is filled during meal times.\n\nsweet potato fries are done very well and not overcooked. truffle mac & cheese had the right proportions of cheese to pasta and truffle goes very well with this dish too. aglio olio had full prawn so and sufficient ingredients to go along with, fresh and well made!\n\nhave yet to try their pizzas and it looked so good and portion seemed to be decent too. worth coming and trying!\n\nUpdate: ended the night throwing up multiple times, will be reporting to the relevant authorities.\nThe horlicks tiramisu dessert is sour and taste extremely bad. We ate just one mouth and gave up. There was zero attempt of service recovery even after alerting the staff that the tiramisu is sour. Stick to their mains if you plan to dine here\n",

The steak is soft and juicy but pity the tomahawk is a bit dry. Roast lamb is great as well. Didn\u2019t really ate too much of the pasta though its very good cos need to save space for cheese and desserts!\n\nAll the food was excellent, the service was courteous and friendly, and we had a great time. (Honestly, the quality of the Asian food wasn't that great.) The chefs came around during the meal to give us tastings, and it felt like we were at a friend's party. It was a great time. Thank you:)\n\nDelicious brunch with an extensive selection of Italian cheese. The Lasagna was also extremely delicious! The service was perfect as well. Money well spent and a very fun afternoon thanks to wine/prosecco free flow as well.\n\nWent for Sunday brunch. Cheese room is lovely with a wide selection of cheeses. Loved the unique chocolate cheeses and burratas. Mains selection is ok, could be larger. Lamb stew was nice. Desserts are good as well.\n\nThe restaurant offers an array of \ud83e\uddc0 cheese.\nIf you are a cheese lover, this will be the restaurant for you!\nWe had buffet but the selection is limited unlike the conventional buffet.  However, food is delicious.\nThe service is good. Mr Muru / Mr Nuru (Manager) is very helpful & friendly.\n",

The highlights for me were the robust flavours of the bolognese sauce, richly portioned with beef , reminiscent of what might have come freshly prepared from an Italian kitchen, as well as the four cheese pizza. The truffle-scented toppings sprinkled with a generous portion of caviar and the blend of cheeses made this a sheer delight and were a crowd pleaser. The kids were very happy with their meal too. Will definitely order again to try the other items on their menu.\n\nWe ordered the 4 cheese gourmet pizza, the premium burrata and the pasta bolognese for our sons' birthday. The food flavours were outstanding. We loved the rich truffle flavours for the pizza, the caviar provided the opulence for the burata. And we were so surprised by the strong beef flavours of the bolognese, with its rich tomato flavours. Absolutely delightful! :)\n\nOrdered the burrata pistachio, 4 cheese gourmet pizza, black truffle pesto pizza and diavola pizza for a group lunch. Reviews all round were positive, especially in relation to the freshness, quality and generosity of the ingredients (e.g. heaps of caviar which complemented and did not overwhelm the flavours of the dishes). No compromises here. Will definitely order again :  )\n\nIf you like the idea of \u201cPita bread filled with Indian cheese cubes, sour tasting salami, lettuce with salad dressing and tomato\u201d then please order Italian Focaccia Panini from them. Otherwise nothing Italian bout this!\n",

Dripping in oil \u2014 taste gets one dimensional, feels like a chore to finish it after the first few bites. Commendable item would be their calamari. Overall, there are way better options in the area\n\nperfectly adequate! was feeling like a simple chicken aglio olio, and this hit the spot. relieved to report that the pasta wasn't too oily per the other reviews - might be dependent on the chef.\n\ndefinitely try their potato croquette - it's sort of like a portable rosti with a mash / cheese centre.\n\ns/o to the staff too (for sunday lunch), who were friendly and helpful.\n\nThe aglio olio was well seasoned & like what many other reviews shared, had super generous helpings of prawns. However the carbonara was a little more like spaghetti in a really creamy soup, bacon bits on top generously sprinkled altho a little tough to chew. Probably won\u2019t try the calamari again..\n\nAffordable And Delicious Italian Fare To Go!  I tried their Beef Piadini and was surprised at how good it was!  The flat bread was crunchy with generous serving of beef and fresh zucchini!  At $7.90 definitely worth it.  Service is great!  Lots tables around to enjoy your food.  Can\u2019t wait to try their pasta!\n\nBeen a regular since they opened and I have really been enjoying the food! My favourites would be the calamari, chili crab pasta and chicken piadini with grilled veggies - its so crispy yet juicy especially if you eat it on the spot! Prices are also very reasonable and service is fast even during peak hours. Strongly recommend!\n",

The wine here is reasonably priced as well so get a bottle as you enjoy the food. What struck me the most is on the usage of the different kind of cheeses in the dishes, so for cheese lovers, you will be delighted here.\n\nFantastic food with wine!

There's something really special about that crispy and ultra flavourful crust that keeps me coming back again and again. The state fair fries is another notable mention. They're fries and more than you could ever want (maybe except for a larger portion). Service is always warm and fun, and I look forward to my next visit already.\n\nService is top notch, the type that you find in places that tip. Decor is posh American diner style. Don't be deceived by the blue exterior wall and lack of windows, it's actually quite homely once you sit down and start to enjoy yourselves.\n\nFood is very good. Pizzas are thin and crispy and even the bread is flavorful without the toppings. There's definitely pizza preferences here, so choose carefully and explore after you've had your favorites.\n\nGood for dates and friend groups.\n\nI brought my partner here to celebrate his birthday. The food was amazing. Thought the service wasn\u2019t the best 5 star but was an acceptable 3.5 - 4 stars. But the food made up for it. The ambience is amazing I love it so cozy and intimate.\n\nWhat a classy American style pizza parlour. Love the leather seats and the music. Pizza was great while the Kale \u201cWaldorf\u201d Salad and Buffalo Chicken Wings were OK. The Blue Ale on tap was great but was in such a tiny glass, overpriced at $10 even during Happy Hours (till 7pm). Take note there is a promotion for ALL pizzas going at $20 each on Tuesdays.\n\nAbsolute fav pizza. Have dined in a number of times. Have ordered for delivery/pick up - countless times! Dough is so different from other pizzeria. It\u2019s soft, chewy and tasty! Super love the White Label and Green Machine. Will definitely be having more of this in the coming future!

Only the potato salad with mentaiko - the potato was undercooked and underseasoned. The sake is very well priced, and we had an enjoyable dinner here. I went back to ask for a lost receipt and the manager was super helpful and super nice - very memorable \u2764\ufe0f\n\nThe friendly staff help to make this small bar welcoming.

If this place keeps charging these prices (and not give much value in return) it\u2019ll be out of business very quickly.\n\nI was astonished when the price of my salad bowl (quinoa with kale, mushrooms, pumpkin and salmon) came up to $30.50! Is it due to inflation? I think other salad bars like Dailycut is only half this price for a large bowl but twice the variety, yet not compromising the taste.\n\nI am so shocked by the price $38 for just salad ?! This is overpriced for just a cafe. This is not a high end restaurant and I don't know why I have to pay for this price especially just for a small piece of salmon?!\nI wouldn't recommend anybody to patronise this shop!\n\nThe sweetest mocha I\u2019ve ever had.

Suitable only for short dine-in. Accept cashless payment only.\n\nThe work hours are highly convenient. However, there's room for improvement in the food quality.

Love it that it\u2019s relatively quiet and a good spot for catching up with friends.\n\nTruffle fries is so good that 2 of us almost finished the entire plate while waiting for our friends, and had to get a 2nd serving. Pizza and pasta were good too! For about $28 per pax, we left feeling full and satisfied!\n\nBeen wanting to try this place but only now finally did. For starters we ordered the Antipasto and I love the bread. The pizza is the thin crust kind and really good. Had the Etna. And pasta as well (excuse the photo as nearly forgot to take a pic so it\u2019s been eaten two mouthfuls lol) it was well cooked and the prawns are succulent. Had a latte as well but didn\u2019t take a pic. It was really good latte. Will definitely come again.\n\nWe loved the casual vibe of the Pizza Express outlet at Scotts Square. The area was clean, spacious and comfortable with prompt service. The table was also nicely laid out when we arrived. Complimentary water is also served at no additional charge\u2026\n\nFor the pizzas, we thoroughly enjoyed the Parma Ham & Arugula Romana Pizza which had the fresh rockets texture with a tinge of bitterness along with the flavourful Parma Ham. There was the signature \u201ccrackling sound\u201d of the crust upon each bite that made Romana pizzas our option of choice at Pizza Express. Overall, it was fresh, crisp and delicious. Pizza Express does serve up authentic pizzas, the way it should be.\n\nFor more details, visit 2bearbear today!\n\nI love this place. everthing is yummy, all service staff are very friendly.\nthey have selectable kids set menus and give kids menu book and coloring paper.\nI recommend you should go there together with your family.\nMy kids love dough ball!\n\n2023 May\nUnfortunately, I have to decrease the star for this restaurant.\nThey were busy for delivery orders. Not only our orders but also other diners' orders seemed be ignored. Delivery was their prioity. I must have leave here while cancelling my orders after we waited for 40 mins. It's my worst experience.\n\nWe ordered takeout on Tuesday night, August 29th.  We ordered 4 pizzas a salad and an order of dough balls. The dough balls were for our young daughter. I took a dough ball from her order and as I was chewing, I immediately felt something hard in the dough so I took it out and inspected it and it was a metal nail head!!!\n\nMy husband contacted the restaurant to notify them of what we found and the gentleman who answered his call was dismissive and told my husband to contact Grab delivery service with any issues.  We are disappointed in the lack of concern over finding a piece of metal in the food! No responsibility was taken or even an apology or solution offered to address the issue.\n\nI am just glad it was me who ended up with the nail in my food and not my daughter, who could have either really hurt her mouth or ingested it.\n",

We have been here twice already and will definitely be coming back again!\n\nThank you very much for your amazing service, definitely recommend for anyone who loves an amazing pizza base and pasta!\n\nFood quality can definitely be improved. We took one set lunch and one extra pizza. For parmigiana, portion is a bit small but the taste is okay. The two pizza are okay but not the dough I prefer as they didn't let the dough rise enough. For tiramisu, it's okay but a bit tasteless. With the high price, food is not amazing but the service is. The staff is quite helpful and attentive.\n\nFood ordered:\n- Burratina con datterini\n- Orecchiette della zia\n- In piazza\n\nAll dishes ordered were fantastic, we were nodding our heads truly appreciating every bite. Will visit again for sure.\n\nNice place. Good setting/environment and service was good too. Went with the family and so got to try abit of the menu. The pizza was good a solid 8/10 I\u2019d say and was definitely the dinner highlight. The pastas however while good were not great and I\u2019d say a 6/10. All in all a pretty decent place if you\u2019re looking for Italian food around the area.\n\nSuch authentic Italian food served here! Enjoyed all the food and dessert that we ordered. It has a nice ambience with helpful and friendly staff. Will certainly come back here again!\n\nWe did come back here again after 3 years. The previous review was done before the pandemic and we went there as a family. This time round, only the two of us. The food, service and ambience were just as impressive if not better. The first 3 dishes from the right were what we had on 29 July 2023. This restaurant provided us with free bread with olive oil in black vinegar and warm water too. If you are craving for Italian food, this is a good place for you to try. You will certainly enjoy it!\n",

Looked nothing like in the pictures (attached for reference).\n\nThere was not a single basil on the margherita and it was served with tomato slices instead of cherry tomatoes. The crust was doughy & dry. There was barely any sauce on the pizza too.\n\nThe truffle pizza was just as bad with some slices having plenty of cheese and others having hardly any. The mushrooms looked dry and shriveled and the crust was a little too bready for my liking. Your money would be better off elsewhere.\n\nClaymore connect now has grab kitchen on its second floor. It has 20+ food options to choose from.\n\nI chose volt pizzeria for my love for burrata cheese. I ordered for $18 with 25% discount on self collect. So essentially $13 for this salad.\n\nBurrata was about 100gms. Salad was fresh and had tomatoes. All good for the price.\n\n4 stars, because you do have to go in this heat to pick up.\n\nI ordered the Hawaiian pizza for gathering, although the delivery came late, but I still received the pizza in good condition and it still hot and crispy!!\n\nNo regret in recommended to my friends!\n\nOrdered from grabkitchen @hillview. Pizza itself was ok but the service was not ok.  Way off track in estimating the time needed to get the order ready for collection. I collected the order 45 mins after it was \u2018ready for collection\u2019\n\nAwesome truffle pizza! Colleagues all loved it. Could smell it before I opened the box. Could even see the black truffle bits. Wish I can get it near my home, haha\n",

The highlight of the meal was the seafood stew. All the breads were also exceptionally delicious. However, the sea bass tasted very ordinary and the sky high price tag went to the showy \u2018performance\u2019 by the chef. Restaurant was too dim and had a funky smell.\n\nThe staff are very friendly and the food is also tasty. The portion is surprisingly big and we ate till our hearts content.\n\nStaff very helpful and polite. Atmosphere is chill with soft music. Food serve just in the right timing.  Of cause the price is not cheap. But it worth the price overall.\n\nLastly thanks for the birthday cake. Love it but we were too full to finish it.\n\nBooked Sunday afternoon to have their set lunch, only to find out they only serve buffet that day at $78++ per person. Opted in anyway and didn't regret it, given the fresh ingredients, great taste of Italian and friendly staffs! Personally I love the dessert section especially Panna Cotta! If I had to pick on something, it'd be the dim lighting. No discount on the bill even with Shangri-la Circle membership, but you do get extra points.\n\nRemember, when you get into the lobby, you are on 3F. You need to take an elevator to get down to 1F where the restaurant is.\n\nThe restaurant has decent ambience for a semi chic and comfortable dinning experience. The salt crusted fish is delicious and if you want to see some fire show. The winner for me is the crab pasta. Yum!\n\nWe celebrated our anniversary dinner here and it was a great decision! They generously presented us a complimentary cake, thank you for perfecting the night.\nAmong the dishes, we absolutely love the Porchetta. It was tender, yet crispy and flavourful, Highly recommended! While on the other side, we didn\u2019t like the potato pur\u00e9e in the braised lamb leg dishes. It may have ruined the experience with that main dish. Despite that, this would not stop us from giving 5 stars because the other aspects (service/ambience) make up to it. A great dining place for celebrations.\n",

Chewed a piece of it for a few minutes and still not broken up. Give up.... need to cut into very small pieces to swallow whole earlier. Good exercise for the jaws though.\n\nStay away from the iberico yuzu koshio yaki. The pork belly is just too tough. I had many meals there. Their butadon pork bowls are generally OK. Good value for the taste and price, but this was the worst meal i had so far.\n\nSuper yummy and service was great. We changed our order after submitting and the service staff helped us change it manually!!! Really grateful. There's also a promo for this signature loin set (in the picture) for GSS! Its my 2nd time here and won't be the last ;)\n\ni love katsu curries and the ones here don\u2019t disappoint. the freshly fried cutlets are tender and juicy, and the curry is a nice balance of spicy and sweet! recommended for a comfort meal\n\nCame during weekday lunch. Not very crowded, managed to get seats for 5 with 0 waiting time. Ordered their cheeses pork cutlet which taste awesome! Pork skin is crispy and meat is very tender. Set comes with soup and mixed vege. Price is $17++ so after GST and Service charge is about $22\n",

Services are excellent and prices are slightly on the medium high end. Appreciate their complimentary birthday ice cream and also farewell sorbet for every guest.\nSpace is a bit tight and got a table of ladies that was virtually talking in a shouting volume that made our visit quite a displeasure one.\n\nBest dish - charred Brussels sprout and saut\u00e9ed mushroom\n\nHad a great time here. Food was great and unique. We had the burnt butter prawns, lobster croquette and charcoal chicken. Would reorder the first and last for sure.\n\nService was fantastic - best service I\u2019ve had in a long while. On my way out after the meal, I mentioned it was my birthday and Joan, the kind waitress, made me come back to the table to serve me really good ice cream with a candle and sake. Really sweet of them.\n\nWe had the set for 2 (Wagu Sirloin version) and added on pork jowl and sashimi platter $39. We paired our meal with Akai Umeshu and Earl Grey Sake. The eggplant and edame was ok, the foie gras chawamushi was rich and delightful and the wagyu and pork was perfect 10/10. The skewers were alright except for the chicken piece which was a tad too hard and mainly bones. The truffle caviar noodle was aromatic but we felt the caviar was abit too much and truffle abit overpowering for us. The complimentary birthday hojicha dessert and yuzu sorbet was on point. Service was warm and prompt when i feedback on preference for lower chair and the aircon. I spent almost $270+ for 2 pax for a very filling and overall satisfying meal. Highly recommend and would definitely return again.\n\nSimply amazing food.. we had 9-10 dishes and there is not a single one that we concluded as \"so-so\" .. Every dish was so tasty and different! I can't even tell you what's the highlight because they were just so good..\n\nProbably the most memorable was the prawn cos we were all wanting extra serving of bread to soak up the sauce . It was full of flavor~\n\nSuggest to try their sets if u are unsure..\n\nLastly, don't drive there as its in those alley on Chinatown.. parking is good Ng to be difficult.. it's only a few mins walk from China town MRT.. very accessible\n\nThe bar was full on a Thursday night.\n\nThe service was warm & friendly, and they constantly checked in for orders, or ensure that our sake glasses were full.\n\nThe menu was extensive for a small restaurant. We mostly had skewers last night - loved the off menu Wagyu skewers, miso butabara, and my fave yuzu infused tsukune ball. The other recommended dishes like Brussels sprouts & lobster croquette were unique as well. Will be back to try the other dishes next time!\n",

The set came with the beans,  soup,  rice and some pickled veg.\n\nThe pork tonkatsu was rather mediocre.  The crust was over done.\n\nHowever, the price is not too expensive.  Quite affordable and will surely fill you up.\n\nAmbience is quite nice with great lighting.  Service was also alright.\n\nOverall,  but too bad.\n\nMy favourite ramen place in Singapore - excellent choice of ramens at a very reasonable price and great flavours.\n\nCame here on a weekday evening, and the place was half-full.\n\nWe ordered the following -\n\n1) Premium Kiwami Tonkotsu Ramen - Nice robust broth of ramen that comes with toroniku cha-shu (tender roast pork cheek) and Okinawa ramen egg. Meat was so tender.\n\n2) Hokkaido Oyster Fry - Tender oysters baked that are so cripsy. The sauce pairing is on-point.\n\n3) Cheese Teppan Fondue Gyoza - Grilled Gyozas on a bed of fondue cheeze. This was a really good combination. Gyozas were packed with flavour.\n\n4) Hokkaido Snow Crab Fried Rice on Tonkotsu Gravy - Silky smooth tonkotsu gravy that is served with snow crab fried rice. A little bland, but quite tasteful.\n\n5) Kiwami Freezer\n\nDIsappointed by this restaurant that is in my point of view over rated.\n\nThe food was good but not exceptional.\n\nThe service was not good and we food bad to be interrupted during the dinner and be asked to go to the cashier to pay.\n\nVisited during off-peak for dinner. Wait staff were friendly n attentive.\n\nFood is well-prepared. Beef is tender n juicy. Marinade n seasonings aren't too overpowering.. Tomato cheese gyoza is an interesting combi. Teppanyaki set meal is value for money. Will return for more!\n\nOnly complaint, d air-conditioning is a little on d warmer side.\n\nFood was lovely and tasty but staff were just a little shorthanded at times and it was just a bit hard to get their attention.\n",

                  "reviews": "\n\nAverage price of $5-$6 for Japanese cuisine located in Chinatown, probably the most value for money meal you can find. I\u2019ve been supporting their business for at least 5 years, the boss/chef is very friendly, always serve the customer with a big smile. The quality of the food is good, love their tempura dishes. The only thing I don\u2019t really recommend is their red miso, but it\u2019s subjective to personal preference, the sauce taste like Chee Chong fan\u2019s sauce. Other than that, I really can\u2019t find a reason not to dine here.\n\nAmazing Curry Pork Katsu Rice Set (SGD6.5)\n\nFreshly fried crispy pork katsu, sliced into thin enough slices for both the young and elderly.\n\nGenerous amounts of carrot and potato inside the curry with the typical delicious Japanese curry taste you are looking for \ud83c\udf5b\n\nThe kind owner even reminded me to not touch the hawker centre provided trays as they may be not the cleanest. Very quick wait today \u263a\ufe0f\n\nIt is the best japanese cuisine I have ever tried ! The couple serving you is super nice and will remember you if you come back. They want you to enjoy their meal and you feel it. I am absolutely fond of this restaurant and I strongly recommand this place for everyone who goes to the Chinatown Complex to try it !!\n(My favourite plate is number 30, th\u00e9 don set, but all the dishes are awesome)\n\nI'm surprised that such good Japanese stall is there. My family and I ordered Katsu curry, Teriyaki chicken and Karaage sets. All of them are carefully cooked and very nice. Quality of rice and miso soup as well. Price is affordable too! I will definitely come back.\n\nReally affordable Japanese food at Smith Street Hawker Centre.\n\nWent during dinner time and it wasn\u2019t crowded. The stall did server the dish to my table as well. Though it\u2019s gets very crowded during lunch time.\n\nOrdered the Katsu Teriyaki Set with comes with rice and soup. May not be restaurant standard but it\u2019s really value for money.\n",

Was not very long since time is still needed for food to be prepared.\n\nHowever, the dessert took awhile.\n\nThe last time I was at a Genki we had to press a button to send the train back. Here the trains go back themselves. Food is not bad. The minimal service was also friendly - someone told us about the day\u2019s special offer. Price wise it is the same as Sushiro but there\u2019s more variety in terms of rice bowls and noodles.\n\nMy favourite branch. The staff are always friendly and patient even when it is crowded and busy. A female server patiently helped an elderly man who didn\u2019t know how to order using QR code. During peak hours there is some wait time but it is understandable.\n\nThe salmon felt still frozen and not properly thawed but otherwise the food was decent and value for money.\n\nAs usual I will remind that the 5 star rating is given within the expectations of a fast casual sushi place. Expectations are not the same as  a 3 Michelin star restaurant. That said, the food, service, and atmosphere were all comfortable. There is a dining time limit of 60 or 90 mins (I can't remember), and they don't take reservations but beyond that there are no problems. The staff at the Chinatown point branch are lovely and very helpful.\n",

Food is not great, staff is not knowledgeable and reservation got bumped.\n\nOne of the omakase experience is having the staff explain to you every dish that you\u2019re eating and what order to eat them. 50% of the meal, the staff didn\u2019t even say a word and just told us to eat in any order you like.\n\nFood didn\u2019t feel expensive even though we went for the top range.\n\n3 stars because it\u2019s a small and quiet place. Nice ambience for a get together. Come but don\u2019t come for the food and service.\n\nThe food was just ok for the price you pay. Tempura set is at $30. But they serve ice cream which gives a bit more score but overall, taste is just ok.\n\nThe service was bad though. The servant asked us to leave even if we were yet to finish our meal.\n\nA wonderful little place in town that seats 16. Marukyu serves up with a rather good Japanese Omakase selection, making them stand out from the bevy of Korean BBQ shops spattered across the area. Great attentive service from their wait staff. Checking frequently to make sure our cups are filled and promptly clearing away emptied dishes. Will help speed things along if the staff were familiar with their own menu. Thankfully their super friendly head chef was moving around the front of house to make recommendation of the seasonal catches as well as his yummy specials. Food coming out from the kitchen was beautifully plated up, a feast for the eyes. Did not disappoint.\n\nA traditional Japanese restaurant with lots of sashimi in their menu. Lunch set prices is very reasonable and most of the sets includes sashimi. Wanted to order noodles they have none when we were there. Ordered some set lunch to try also some sushi. The taste is at most \u201cacceptable\u201d but sashimi is fresh. Server is really going through the motion didn\u2019t feel right to dine at such environment. The place is rather small but clean.

Good service too\n\nOverall good, but poor service from a singular staff.\n\nWe had a mixed experience at this outlet. The food was decent, but the service was uneven. Our waitress, [didn't catch her name but she tied her hair up, wore specs, and wore a red uniform] was very polite and attentive. She displayed great service and was efficient.\n\nHowever, another server, [Sebastian/Cebestian?] was relatively rude and unhelpful. He wore a black uniform and had a black face mask. When we asked about store policy & promotion items, he seemed annoyed by our questions. He also appeared to be not well service trained to answer such questions, as he could not give proper and polite answers to paying customers. He also spoke unclearly to customers. He displayed a poor attitude and was condescending to the patrons. Hope that management can consider training him more.\n\nWe were very disappointed with the service from him. His rudeness and lack of knowledge made our dining experience unpleasant. He also gave his staff member the wrong form for patrons to look at when they're signing up for the 8-minute challenge.\n\nHowever, we would like to commend the lady waitress, for her excellent service. She was a pleasure to deal with and made our experience much better. The food was great as well.\n\nGood service from the service staffs, polite and friendly. Foods were serve fast and hot. Taste is good. Comparing to Novena and Bugis Junction outlets, here in Chinatown Point is better in terms of services and food quality.\n\nThe chicken taste better than the pork i feel, cause the pork taste harder but the curry is so on point and the service here is amazing.\nMust try the salmon bites, recommended!!\n",

Passionate about delivering high quality Japanese cuisine, Mitsu Sushi Bar ships in fresh seafood and produce in small batches five times a week from two of Japan\u2019s most well-known markets, Kyushu and Hokkaido. This ensures optimum freshness and the best selection of fish for all of you Japanese cuisine lovers out there!\n\nDuring my visit, I ordered the S$38.00 Wagyu Steak Set from their Dinner Set Menu, which consists of Wagyu Beef Steak, Sashimi, Steamed Egg Custard, Pickles, Miso Soup, Rice, and Salad. I also had the opportunity to try their S$26.00 Dragon Maki, which consists of a spicy soft shell crab cut roll with crispy crab stick.\n\nIn my most honest opinion, the Wagyu Steak Set at Mitsu Sushi Bar is an absolute killer. You simply must try it. The close to melt-in-your-mouth juiciness of the Wagyu Beef will turn most of you beef haters out there into a beef lover, while leaving any fan of Japanese Wagyu Beef feeling satisfied. For the price that you are paying, the portion size of the Wagyu Steak was unbelievably generous.\n\nFor a lack of a better description, the salad was the true black horse of this dining experience. When I took my first mouthful of the salad, I was truly caught off guard with how well-prepared and delicious it was. The tastiness didn\u2019t overshadow the Wagyu Beef but serve this in any salad store and I guarantee you it will do tremendously well on its own as the star of the show. Just try it. You will know what I mean when you visit and taste one for yourself.\n\nUnfortunately, the Dragon Maki felt quite lacklustre as compared to the Wagyu Beef Set. Perhaps this just simply shows how good the Wagyu Beef Set was, but the flavour profile of the maki was very flat even with the ikura, and I could hardly taste any spiciness on the rolls.\n\nI personally love their business executive set lunch which has everything packed nicely in bite size. Easy to eat (and talk) and easy to try alot of stuff together. Their sushis are really good. A nice place to meet and gather if you can get the tatami room. Will come back and try again!\n",

We hold an event here, our guests like the food and Japanese highballs. :) thanks\n\nLove this new japanese bar right in the middle of chinatown. All the food are so delicious! The drinks are very affordable and the GIN drinks are the best ever.\n\nA small shop with beautiful ambiance makes it an ideal place to dine with friends. Affordable and delicious Japanese cuisine, especially the Unagi don, it's just $16.\nThe food we order\n1) Unagi Don \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nI am a Unagi lover, and unagi needs special preparation. They're grilled and basted with a sweet sauce, and served with eggs and preserved garlic. (OMG...is so yummy)\n2) Chicken Don \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\nMy boyfriend had this, and he like it.\n3) Fried Oyster \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nMy boyfriend had this too, he loves this, so we order another place of this. Its very fresh.\nBasically, the food over here is above average. Its worth to try and definitely will come back again.\n\nThis staff there is so nice and polite and accommodating. Their oysters are super thick and juicy and worth the money. I would highly recommend this place.\n\nMust try! Good place for food, drinks and chilling. Highly recommended\n",

Good selection of Sake.  Been here a couple times and enjoyed each time.\n\nSkipped the alcohol and was still blown away by the quality of food here. Their prices are extremely reasonable and their dishes comprise of very fresh produce. Can\u2019t got wrong with sashimi and their hot soups are comforting for rainy days. It\u2019s a great place to unwind after work or for celebrations, or if you simply want to indulge in good izakaya fare.\n\nDo not that they don\u2019t really accommodate children under 12.\n\nI've been to this restaurant a few times.\nFood is always delicious!\nThere's a good variety of Sashimi, Sushi and other cooked food.\nI personally love that the restaurant offers isakaya.\nChicken heart & gizzard are my favourite!\nThe restaurant offers a good selection of Sake.\nThe service staff are also friendly and helpful.\nA good Japanese restaurant to hang out with friends. I will recommend this Japanese restaurant if you like to impress your guests/ friends from overseas.\nDo make advance reservation for weekend.\n\nBeen a regular patron for a while, absolutely mind-blowing delicious food. Authentic Japanese atmosphere, ingredients are super fresh.\n\nCan't recommend this place enough, I've already referred all my friends here and they all love it!\n\nPicture is their chicken nanban don, my all time favorite!\n\nQuality seafood and sashimi! Came back second time for the sashimi as i remembered that it was so fresh. Ehire and kani miso is a must-have here. Tried the pork skewers and was blown away at how tasty and juicy it was. didn\u2019t expect that from them as they seem to be specialising in seafood sashimi. Legit almost everything they have on the menu is fantastic. Can add up to quite a hefty cost but it\u2019s worth every cent.\n",

Perhaps the best Unagi don in Singapore. Will come back definitely!\n\nSmall little restaurant tucked away from the busy road, where you have to access is from a inner yard.\nWe arrived about 1 hour before they close, so we didn't have to wait. Good for late night dinner.\nThe food was great and delicious.\nThe staff were also very friendly and kind.\nHaving to grate fresh wasabi was a nice experience.\n\nOverall experience was not bad. Went in for a quick lunch with wife. Not much queue probably due to the light drizzle. Separate sauce for u to add if you like it on a sweeter note. Go for the bigger portion if you are a big eater. The place is tucked away at a corner.\n\nHave been visiting Man Man the past few years whenever I get a craving for Unagi \u263a\ufe0f their queue has since died down over the past few years and it is a lot easier to get a seat / walk in. They are famous for their Hitsumabushi set which offers you 3 different ways to eat the grilled eel with rice and additional condiments. The grilled eel is always tender yet crispy! Yesterday\u2019s portion might have been a tad bit over grilled as it was quite dry / more crispy. Nonetheless still a good meal.\nThey also serve Japanese beer at $5 a pint (Japanese pint size).\nYou might want to try their tamago egg as well - it\u2019s really good!\n\nService was surprisingly fast, and the food came within minutes of ordering. It almost felt as if they had prepared them in advance.\nThe unagi were well-seasoned. There weren't overpowering sauces being poured over and had a slight charred taste that elevated the flavour experience.\nThe ikura was fresh and generously served.\nAlso, I tried the unagi liver, which was quite a unique dish. There weren't any strong iron tastes normally associated with eating liver. It was really well prepared and slightly charred, which made it easy on the tongue.\nHowever, it was slightly on the pricier as they used fresh live unagi. It's worth a try nonetheless.\n",

I love the freshness of the sashimi, fried burdock salad which was amazing. The staffs ensure you have each dish at the right temperature. I had the unagi which tasted meh as the quality of the eel wasn\u2019t too great. There was another dish that did not meet my expectation, the cold tomatoes which was priced at SGD8. I thought it will be those lovely sweet Japanese tomatoes but what I got was the normal slices tomatoes which was overpriced. Overall was an ok meal for me.\n\nHad very great dinner here. The food are delicious. We have ordered chicken cutlet rice, cold soba, sashimi don, prawn tempura and karage and it is juicy. Sadly they don\u2019t have steam egg.\n\nWe ordered pork katsu don, saba miso, potato salad and karaage.\n\nKatsu don is taste good but the pork is very hard. Not nice.\n\nSaba miso is good.\n\nKaraage taste and texture like reheated the day before cooked one. Not nice, a bit disappointed.\n\nSalad is fresh and I like their potato salad. Taste good.\n\nOverall, I don\u2019t really recommend to go. I think I\u2019m not coming back unless I really can\u2019t find other place to eat. It\u2019s not my Japanese food standard.\n\nAll restaurants along this road was so crowded, found there was an outdoor table available so we decided to try our luck.\nFood quality was good. Japanese common izakaya dining.\nIt would be hot if you get the outdoor seats and a bit difficult to get staff\u2019s notice.\n\nCame here for lunch and the place was packed! The atmosphere is pretty lively and loud and great if you want to have a nice get together lunch with colleagues.\nThe menu is pretty wide in variety though I do wish we had more options for soba and udons.\n\nI ordered the \u306d\u304e\u3068\u308d\u4e3c Minced Tuna Don bento for $23 and I suppose it\u2019s expensive but for this area, it\u2019s quite standard. Comes with soup and a small pickle salad.\n\nWould probably come back again to try the other stuff next time.\n",

Long Que during peak lunch hours, so go early.\n\nHave been going to katanashi an for lunch once every few months since I started working in Telok Ayer in 2017. The food is great and the price is so reasonable. Over the years, many eateries in Telok Ayer have increased their prices, but Katanashi An has kept their prices the same. My favourite to order from there is the Hokkaido set, the salmon ikura don, or the fried chicken. There are a few ways to eat it, with dry or pour the dashi to make dashi chazuke. The place is small so have to go make reservations or go early before the lunch crowd. It opens at 1130am on weekdays.\n\nGood place for sake lovers. ideal for meeting up with friends and colleagues for drinks or meal. Good food, good selection of sake and affordable price. Operating from Monday to Saturday : 1130am - 1430pm and 5pm - 1030pm\n\n1st time trying this Japanese tapas place. We ordered about 10 items in totally. What I like is the chicken Karaage, fried chicken wings, and pork stew. The rest of the food  are just ok for me. Overall for food, I give it a 3.5 stars. Staff are friendly and helpful, and the food are served pretty fast.\n\nLove the how cosy the place is. The food was really good and worth the money paid. Every single dish impressed me truly, I\u2019ll definitely be back here again and recommend others to come.\n",

Price wise it\u2019s reasonable too. Our dinner order of the mid Omakase is both delicious and fresh. Worth every dollar we paid.\n\nMy friend celebrated my birthday here for dinner omakase. we had the middle options  for 3 of us and there was only us in the whole night, hence, we had quite alot of interactions with the senior chef. the food are superb and fresh, the combo mix of the sushi are surpringly good. Have a great night there.\n\nGreat place to chill and enjoy the omakase. Small place but was the only one there on a friday afternoon. Everything was delish, but obviously, some are better than the rest.\n\nCame here for a birthday lunch celebration. The sushi were fresh and very tasty. Prices were reasonable for the quality of sushi. Service from the waiters were good however the chefs were only engaging their regular customers and not new customers. Overall pretty good omakase.\n\nHad the lunch omakase which was very good! Great service as well! Will be back to try the dinner omakase.\n",

Waited for quite a while before someone noticed me because another customer wants to pay the bill.\n\nNo frills lunch with different protein Dons to choose from with various pork/beef grades.\n\nFulfilling lunch set that comes with a salad and miso soup.\n\nWould be back and food is decent enough. Service is through qr ordering so it\u2019s a 3 stars while atmosphere is normal.\n\nthe chicken don taste average. the mentaiko loin don is the sellling dish and the one to go for. highly recommend ! overall i would give it a five star but for that slight high price i will give it a four star . but it is worth trying occasionally\n\nCame to the Chinatown point outlet for lunch. They showed us to our table quickly, however it seems like the AC wasn\u2019t working that day. Staff was attentive and shifted us to another table quickly.\n\nWas craving ramen and surprised at how well the ramen is done despite it being a buta don place.\n\nPretty reasonable size and pricing considering the location.\n\nHowever we felt thirsty after, may have too much msg\n\nFood was great and the ambience of the restaurant was nice too.

Doesn't have the typical briny, flavour explosion. Probably not fresh. Salmon belly and salmon were ok.\n\nSteak cubes - worse than kopitiam western, skip.\n\nChawanmushi - bland\n\nRamen - milky and light, no real broth flavour. Tastes like it was made from a packet.\n\nThe only saving grace were the stingray fin and kawa ebi but as you can imagine these are snacks to accompany alcohol.\n\nI know Izakayas are meant to have subpar food usually as the focus is on drinks and snacks. But for the same money you could eat at another Izakaya with better dishes. Take your money somewhere else.\n\nP.S: They did give us 10% off for JUST the salmon moriwase. It was kinda strange I don't know any other establishment that pulls out just one item to discount on and kept emphasizing our savings lol \ud83d\ude02\n\nDecided to drop in for a dinner on weekday. Outdoor seating are reserved and hence was ushered to upstairs. Very authentic Japanese place.\nService was bad... Lady staff cant even pronounce the food.. And worse of all another male staff can to collect our empty plates without asking...i am startled!!\nFood and drinks are reasonable priced.\n\nGreat service from the staff, super friendly and warm. The set lunch is great value as well. Conveniently located in Chinatown, this place is a gem. They have offers every day as well, from discounted sushi rolls to discounted chirashi bowls. Do look out for the day's specials.\n\nCompliments to chef Li! Had dinner on Friday night and we liked the cosy ambience. Good quality food, reasonably priced, with great service by Jane! Really enjoyed everything and will definitely be back again \u263a\ufe0f\n\nWas walking around scouting for food on the day of check-in to the hotel and noticed this stall! My favourite Japanese food! So the very next day, dropped by for lunch! Quite disappointed that they served our food with such a great separation apart. Food is decent however, even though their teriyaki chicken is nowhere near appealing to the unagi-don.\n",

Maybe one of the best sushi restaurants in Singapore.  Keep up the good work!  See you next time!!\n\nPoor food quality and service, won't be returning and will avoid as well. Got the 200 omakase meal and totally not worth the price. Freshness of fish is not there, uni doesn't taste fresh as well, nothing taste exceptional throughout the entire meal (as what u would expect when u are getting the more premium omakase set). The waitress shared that they have changed their menu one year ago probably that's explain the poor recent reviews, and have been in business for 10yrs.\n\nStaff is poor in explaining the dish as well, and is not receptive with feedback. Feel disappointed and cheated at the end of the meal.\n\nRyo sushi, miyu located nearby are way much better with fresh and quality food.\n\nWent for dinner and they only have omakase menu. It was awesome. I picked the $130 umi omakase.\n\nThe service was amazing. Since I was alone, the only people to chat with are the chef and waitress so they took their time to explain the dishes to me, how to eat them and pair them with the sauce, and they even teach me about their ingredients, where it comes from, how they cooked it and how they maintain their quality. Jeffrey was the sushi chef serving me and he was very patient. The supporting staff aka waitress were also very quick to react, to refill my drinks and to clean my table and clear my plate.\n\nAs I was sitting at the counter, The chef even noted what I preferred and served me slowly as I wanted to enjoy my food with pauses in between.\n\nOverall, I loved the food, the people there, the ambience, the service and will definitely be back.\n\nThe variety is substantial and the quality is awesome too.\n\nUnderwhelming.  We\u2019ve been to Mitsuya since its early days and enjoyed their omakase.  This recent visit the quality and selection of fish was below par for the expectation at this price point.  While the presentation is still top notch, there are  better options (especially in this area) at this that are worth patronizing.\n\nPictures don\u2019t lie guys! There to celebrate my daughter\u2019s birthday, so aside the awesome fanfare, chef Harada San also made a \u201csushi cake\u201d, which is greatly appreciated!\n\nProtein is fresh and marinated where it matters. And every bite is like a heaven sent. Will be back soon. Be warned, you need about a month plus to make any reservations!\n\nGem indeed!\n",

Everything was quite good, specially the starters. The scallop and tuna tataki tasted really good. Had a bara chirashi bowl and my friends had the Wagyu bowl. The chirashi I thought can have more raw fishes. They were cut into too tiny pieces it\u2019s hard to tell what I\u2019m even eating.\n\nHad dinner here. Everything was good till there are large group of people sitting behind us and we had difficulty talking to each other. The tables are too close. If you are around the area can give it a try their food quite good but abit expensive. Happy hour 6-7pm!\n\nCosy place located on the 2nd floor and felt a bit like a speakeasy. Went on a Thursday evening and it was fairly empty.\n\nThe crispy kurobuta pork was really good and came with pickled apple.\nThe Kani miso kourayaki was really rich and I loved it.\nBut the Bara chirashi don was disappointing. It was covered in a lot of sauce except for the uni which was on top and I couldn't really taste the seafood.\n\nAlso, the sake was served with some sort of wine glass instead of the usual sake glass. But maybe it's because of the bottle what I ordered.\n\nBut I loved the ambience and staff were attentive. If I go back, I'll try the cooked menu items instead.\n\nFood and service was good!\nThe chirashi bowl was amazing - will try the beef bowl next.\nAlso had the pork (main on its own) and I went to heaven on my first bite. The fat and meat ratio was perfect & it just melts in your mouth. Was tempted to order another plate but we were stuffed by then.\nHad the donut dessert and was surprised by how good it was! Definitely a good way to end the meal.\n",

Rated it 4 stars was cos despite its a Friday evening, the restaurant allowed us to stay on for our gathering without pushing us to make more orders. This is a hard to come by experience these days where the restaurant either limits the dining time or \u201cpressure\u201d you to make more orders.\n\nFood was great too! Mostly of what we ordered was delicious! Especially mentai rosti, crab gratin and the pork jowl. Missed to take some of the photos cos was too hungry!\n\nAtmosphere is a 3 largely cos it tends to get a bit too noisy that we had to shout on top of the noise in order to be heard. Haha but well, we are also contributors of that atmosphere then. Otherwise, all good for an Izakaya.\n\nThe food was tasty and you know they use fresh oil to fry their fried item dishes. There was no \u201cjelat\u201d taste and the karaage and tempura tasted light and crispy. Another dish I liked was the fishcake stuffed with cheese (forgot the actual name), but I wished there was more cheese pumped within! However, ratings lowered for service as the beers/drinks took forever to be served. Overall the tasty food validates a return.\n\nHad a delightful experience here. The atmosphere was casual with authentic Japanese decor. The standout for me was the mentaiko crab, which was creamy and flavorful.\n\nService was attentive and friendly, adding to the overall excellent dining experience. Highly recommended for anyone craving genuine Japanese cuisine.\n\nA great option for tasty and authentic Japanese fare with hard-to-find dishes available on their menu! Particularly enjoyed the negitoro don here \u2013 it had a great mix of lean and fatty tuna, was seasoned well and had great texture. Loved the mentaiko salmon sushi and the mentaiko crab gratin as well! Service was very prompt as well, was shown to our tables and served food very quickly.\n\nGreat atmosphere and the staffs were prompt and efficient in serving us food. Food served was tasty as well. Ordered the chicken bites, guy don, river prawns, chicken meatballs and garlic fried rice. Didn\u2019t expect the river prawns to be so small but they were deep fried and crunchy. Loved it more than I expected.\n\nMy favourite was the big and crispy chicken bites\n",

The dish was honestly incredebly delicious due to very well cooked beef and rice as well as its tasty sweet sauce. The atmosphere was alright for a normal lunch/dinner, although I would say the main disadvantage of the place is that the indoor area have no closed doors and no air conditioning, hence, all sitting areas are fully outdoors which made my experience slightly uncomfortable, as I am someone who prefers to eat food in chilly environments with air conditioning. The service was decent and the food was cooked in a timely manner. Overall, I am quite satisfied with the place and would recommend anyone interested to try out Thai food in Singapore. I will definitely come back again.\n\nI don't usually eat Thai food but I have to rate this one highly. One of the best Thai food places I've been to. As I don't usually take spice very well, I ordered less spice for everything. Everything we ordered came shortly even though the restaurant was packed. Lastly, the dessert was also amazing.\n\nGreat pricing, and yummy! No service charge just 8% tax. The papaya salad was fresh, and enjoyed the pad thai and minced pork basil \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d Thai ice tea was refreshing too!\n\nCooking of the food is good but the ingredients are not fresh, frozen chicken prawn pork really spoilt the taste. Grilled pork neck not even well grilled and got the smelly aftertaste, disappointing\n\nIt's a little bit pricey but the food is good. Tom Yum fried rice is quite spicy but if you like Tom Yum, this one is a must-try. Stir-fry Kalan with roasted pork is one of my favourite Thai dishes. Overall the food here is authentic and they have many choices. Better come with a group so you can try more dishes.\n",

Mango sticky rice is a bit disappointing..\n\nMy intention was to eat Thai food, ended up eating western food instead. Ordered half spring chicken and jumbo fish and chips. Took around 25 minutes to arrive. I enjoyed the fish especially the tartar sauce, great with the fish and also the chips. The garden salad was not available and replaced with coleslaw which I preferred.\n\nNot much crowded at my visit for dinner. Crowd quite building after but still have seats left.\n\nvery good food and even better service. definitely will be back ! everyone was very polite in greeting u when u enter or exit the place, in serving food or replying when u thank them, and very prompt to service when called. food served relatively fast! really enjoy the service here, sharing plates given without asking!! sticky rice cld b more flavourful i felt but the mango was nice and sweet. fish is definitely a must try, sauce really packed a punch n tasted like clear tomyum. spicy, very tangy and appetising. fried rice can be passed. spring rolls are nice and crispy, basic side dish. vermicelli is a must try. very flavourful and bouncy well cooked noodles. loved everything about the meal!\n\na bit pricey but the foods real good, however, honestly could work on their customer service because the staff do seem quite cold not to mention that they have service fees\n",

Overall it\u2019s flavour is good!\n\nFish maw soup with quail eggs: 5/5\nThai basil chicken rice w egg (no spicy) : 5/5\nI love the fact that they added long beans and onions to give different layers of crunch and flavour to it! And they accommodate to my request for non-spicy a spicy rice.\n\nGreat place for families. For those dining I. Big groups I recommend you make reservations first if you want to sit indoor with air con.\n\nSoo 47 is a casual Thai Street food style restaurant that offers robust Thai cooked food at reasonable prices. Don\u2019t expect the original Thai food taste as fish sauce is missing or at much lower levels in several Thai classic dishes like Pad Thai, perhaps in response to a healthier lifestyle or just a preference of consumers these days. I do miss the heavy the \u201csavory kick\u201d from Nam Pla and Thai condiments. However the dishes are still delicious and I recommend the egg \ud83e\udd5a dishes, prawn \ud83e\udd90 cakes and Thai simmered fish \ud83d\udc1f (add in fish sauce if you like). Service is good and prices are considered reasonable in pricey Singapore.\n\nOperations seems to be a bit unstable. Staff were rushing and appear to be quite chaotic.\n\nThe food was decent, and the fish was on point. Will order again when I am back. If you love fluffy omelette, this is the right place. Beansprouts with salted fish was underwhelming, can't seem to bite into any salted fish.\n\nOverall, still a good experience. Hopefully less chaotic.\n\nThe dishes are small and you can order a variety of it. Prices are reasonable. We like the steam fish in lime juice. Tom yum clear soup is good too.\n\nCame on a Friday night, had to wait 5-10min for a table.\nThe steamed seabass was delicious. Highly recommended, the soup of the fish is very tasty as well. The salad was great as well, nice starter.\nThe staff were friendly and came with our orders relatively quick. The vibe is fine.\n",

Enjoyed majority of the dishes. Just found the onion omelette too oily so would not order next time but noodles, stir fries, papaya salad and veggies all excellent.\n\nNice decent Thai food, decent pricing as well. Fried egg with minced meat is nice. Service staffs are friendly and environment are kept clean and neat. Parking available at nearby multi storey carpark.\n\nFood is ok, some dishes are nice while some are so so. The egg oyster omelette, coffee pork ribs are quite nice. However it\u2019s an affordable and family dining place.\n\nThe food is superb, chef is Thailand so the food is the original Thailand taste, make me feel I am eating at Thailand. The red tomyum soup is the must order food when you are here. Others food is tasty too. The important thing is the price is standard price which is value for money\n",

                  "reviews": "\n\nWhile I enjoyed the food for the most part, I found the ordering system a bit wasteful. The stall requires customers to write down their order number on a piece of paper and pass it to the staff, who will only take the order if it's presented on the paper. While I understand that this system can be helpful during peak periods, it seems unnecessary when there are only a few customers.\n\nThat being said, the food was quite good. I tried the tom yum soup, olive fried rice, and pad Thai. The tom yum soup was generous in its ingredients and tasted decent. The pad they had a good flavour and wasn't dry. The olive fried rice was okay. While the prices were a bit expensive for a hawker stall, I understand that in this economy, the prices are reasonable. Overall, it was a decent experience.\n\nSolid Thai food store at the corner of Tiong Bahru market. Tom yum soup with so much seafood is only 6.5 (whaaat!) but a bit watery. Green curry is the best in my opinion\n\nHad the garlic chicken and the serving was generous. The garlic has no bitterness so kids should find it acceptable but it lacks the strong garlicky flavour. $6.50 for the dish, add 50c for rice. The portion of chicken is like what you would expect in tze char for small or medium. I will come back and try the other dishes.\n\nYummy Thai fried kway teow and green curry. Lots of healthy vegetables\n\nThis is one hawker stall tucked right in one of the corner of Tiong Bahru Market. It's just located beside the famous Jian Bo Chwee Kueh stall. The decor of the stall is very interesting. After lunch hour, while most of the stalls are either closing or their food items are sold out, this is one of the stall that still served proper meal. I ordered their Phad Thai. I was really happy when they dished out the phad Thai serving on a piping hot ceramic plate which not many hawkers have ceramic cutleries now. Food is nice and the serving is generous, for the price of $5.50.\n",

Unfortunately, I forgot to submit photos as the food smelt so delicious and we were eager to eat.\u00a0I thought all the items we ordered were excellent and tasted great.\u00a0 Definitely thumbs up! It's definitely worth a try but don't expect a long menu.\n\ngreat Thai food and fantastic value for money. omelette, steamed fish, kai lan and basil pork were all excellent.\nExpect longer waits at peak meal times as the stall is helmed by one gentleman by himself - major respect\n\nNew Thai Food stall in this neighbourhood. Generally the food is good, most are quite authentic Thai style. Exception would be the Tomyum soup was not spicy or sour enough as it seem to be mellowed down in taste to more sweetness. Steam Seabass was excellent.\n\nI stay nearby and always pass by this stall. Today I give it a try and never regret. I ordered basil chicken rice. It tastes delicious! The portion is big and price is cheap ($5.50).\n\nDefinitely will try other dishes next time!\n\nsaw queue and thai peep also ordering so order basil pork and fried kailan. Taste good, for very long time i didnt taste basil pork with fats in it, spicy too. The fried kailan superb - just nice of seasoning, good crunch and it is thin type. good variety of thai food available, option and reasonable price.\n",

Good location as there are ample parking space and most of the stalls are close with many tables available. Overall it\u2019s still a decent mookata, not enough for the 4 star rating but good enough to give it a try. Chili, fresh meat are pretty average and the rest mostly consist of frozen food.\n\nOne of the best Thai mookata places. Love the lamb option alot. Their pork belly original and black pepper is very good too! Came here a couple of times alr and the lamb and pork belly are the regular dishes that I order! Definitely worth a try.\n\nBBQ buffet is the main highlight of this new restaurant near by the lake. 59 dollar for 2 people for food. The only restriction is for items priced 4 dollar and above. Rest all items in the menu including ice cream is unlimited. The quantity and quality of the meat is great. The meat or what ever we use for the bbq provided are very fresh and so it\u2019s very tasty as well. The bbq stove is a gas stove and so the time to prepare the bbq is very less. It\u2019s more of a instant food rather than traditional bbq. The staffs here are so friendly and very attentive. Two things which are the base of this bbq is the quality and taste of the sauce they provide and the base liquid or soup provided to boil in the bbq pit. It can be a good place for any kind of people like couples or even family. A very well recommended place.\n\nCame here for dinner because we were craving for Thai mookata for dinner. Food are reasonably priced at range of 2-5 dollars per plate depending on what you order. In total two of us spent around 38 dollars.\n\nDownside: Meat quality is definitely those which are not high quality. Don\u2019t expect much for the price point.\n\nMookata lovers... must come and try. So much variety for chilli. Meat so fresh n seasoning so good. Price is so affordable and reasonable. Even if you are first time eating mookata, this place is never a mistake. I'm a satisfied customer and will return again for more.\n",

Lucky us.\n\nI will keep the remainder 1 star till I have tried the Thai food. $22.90 for the steam fish sounds value for money\n\nOrdered a Chicken Mushroom Baked Rice. End product came out to be egg fried rice with popcorn chicken and cheese. No cream sauce at all. Not baked either. This is the first time in my life eating a chicken baked rice in a restaurant with no white sauce. Asked the staff and yeah they said it is like that. At least the fries came out right. Paid $12 for all this. Western food got no standard.\n\nTotally unacceptable! After ordering my food, i waited 15mins and then the staff said the food is not available. Rubbish service. Not worth paying for it.\n\nCalled so many times at the restaurant to make reservations from 11am till 2pm no one picking up the phone..this is very bad reputations for the restaurant outlet\n\nFood is alright but customer service is really bad!!\n",

We ordered the drunken noodles as we saw that it was highly raved, and be warned that it is flavourful but very very spicy, even for someone like me who can usually take spicy food (so pls ask for less spicy if you can\u2019t take spicy food). The pork basil rice was a steal at $6.90. Chicken wings were juicy, and the steamed tapioca was delicious! Overall the quality of the food is good for the price point. Worth a visit!\n\nThai Kha is by far the best Thai restaurant in Singapore! Consistent quality & taste of food and great service will convince you to return. Having ordered in the first time during the pandemic, this is my go to place when it comes to Thai cuisine. Order online or visit their restaurant, a beautiful and well maintained space. \ud83d\ude0a\ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffb\n\nWent for dinner on a weekday, very quiet. Ordered through QR and food cooked fresh, but contrary to great reviews, our food was so so. Truly not bad. Drunken noodles was still a bit wet, but tasty enough but lacking oomph. Boat noodles not bad. Egg not crispy enough but tasty. Portion quite large. Spent 37.20 sgd for these 3. A viable option if around the area. Vegetarian options available for most dishes.\n\nCasual place with good food. Tried the drunken noodle, prawns, fried rice and morning glory - liked the spicy kick but prawns were ok. Good food with reasonable price - would come back for casual lunch if nearby!\n\nVisited Thai Kha at Havelock 2 (#01-01/48) for lunch recently!\n\nFood:\n\n- Had the Pork Krapow ($7.90 before tax, asked for less spicy) as my main dish. I personally thought that the pork was soft, tender and well-seasoned. Overall, the dish was well-balanced and tasty, although I wish that the egg was runny - it was cooked through.\n\n- I also had some Chicken Wings ($8.90) to share. Felt that they were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. My only gripe with this was that they could have been bigger.\n\nService/Atmosphere:\n- There were 6 of us who went for lunch together, and we all ordered Krapow with varying levels of spiciness and/or additional meat.\n\nThere was some miscommunication on the part of the service staff and they mixed up some of our orders. However, I don't deem this to be a serious shortcoming on the part of the staff - my only wish is that they would be better prepared for future orders!\n\n- The restaurant wasn't crowded during lunchtime and is a good value for money option if you're willing to travel to Havelock 2 mall. Seems like a hidden gem to me, if I'm honest.\n\nI will be back again. Very impressed with the quality of the food here.\n\nKudos to @cravings_satisfied_jay as well for suggesting this place!\n",

Definitely the place to go if you want delicious catering for a home party without fuss and a unique, exotic experience!\n\nThai food craving today! Decided to do a takeaway cos of the unbearably hot weather lately. Friday, so decided to have pad thai seafood and tom yum soup.

Usually feel sleepy after lunch but with the soup, I was wide awake and feeling rather refreshed!\n\n- value for money\n- authentic Thai flavour\n- really accommodating staff\n- very professionally run as I can see the counter and kitchen being cleaned up all the time!\n\nTerrible attitude from the staff. Asked for less spicy, I think they intentionally made it even spicier than usual.\nFood is really bland, not worth it.\n\nAwesome food!\nGreat price point and best of all, made by real Thai people:) They\u2019re really friendly and recommended their yummy sauce for my noodles.\nI had paad woon sen (fried glass noodle)\nWould return to try their Mama noodles as I rarely see that at other Thai places.\n\nOrder thai hor fun for dinner.. it was served room temperature.. the \"cook\" blanched the ingredients and mixed in w the noodles and sauce.\n\nZero flavor, smelly chicken.

Everything tasted great.\n- My only gripe was the serving size for some of the items. The churros in particular, were extremely little.\n+/- Overall the service was friendly but as the place became more packed into the night, it was hard to get the servers' attention.\n\nAte early evening. Was leaning towards tacos but saw the Al Pastor Red Snapper and had to try it. Glad I did - it was sensational. Would have been 5 stars for atmosphere apart from the sticky table. Will definitely be back for more.\n\nFood was pretty good. We were able to hang out for extended time as there was not a lot of people on a Friday night. Only downside is there\u2019s no air conditioned area. It was very hot and humid. A bit uncomfortable.\n\nA nice Mexican restaurant with different tiers of happy hour prices depending on the time of the day. Their frozen margaritas are delicious and a great accompaniment with their food. I recommend sitting outdoors by the Riverside if you don't mind not having air conditioning..\n\nWe chose the table outdoor because inside is a bit suffocating for me when there was crowded. Decoration with Mexican vibe is cool.\nQuesadillas and nachos were so so.\nBaja fish tacos was good but not really impressed.\nTried the mango margaritas and vodka soda. The drinks are lack of alcohol in my opinion, specially my friend\u2019s vodka with 80% soda and 20% vodka I think \ud83d\ude02\n",

While this is not Chipotle, it sure beats the measly burrito bowls at GYG (the worst!).\n\nOrdered the Pulled Beef Burrito Bowl, pretty good quality stuff. Loved the jalapenos amd portion is decent.\n\nThis is sad. There's literally only 4 small chunks of chicken in each taco. And there isn't any other channel to feedback this to. I bought this as a set meal for close to $20 (inclusive of delivery).\n\nI can't tell the difference between the burrito bowl and the nachos other than the bowl has rice and the the nachos are often stale. I like their wings but I've ordered delivery several times now and almost every time there's something missing (paid extra for cheese, or jalapenos but amount is exactly the same as an order without extras), mismatched order (chicken added instead of beef). Enough is enough, I won't order from here again.\n\nOrdered herbal chicken quesadillas. Paid for extra cheese but the extra is not noticeable at all. With Guzman, without topping up for extra cheese, it has way more cheese. Part of the Herbal chicken doesn't seem fresh as it is abit mushy n we tot it was fish initially.

Mexican and Turkish Fusion! Food is priced at a very affordable rate and service from Ajay & Kelvin was amicable. Thanks Los Amigos we had a fruitful evening at your cosy restaurant. Will definitely be back for MORE!!!!!\n\nOn a picturesque evening, my friend and I sought a place to unwind, and serendipitously, we stumbled upon Los Amigos Mexican restaurant. The ambiance, adorned with vibrant decor and a backdrop of lively music, immediately caught our attention.\n\nOur culinary journey commenced with an array of delectable choices, including the signature Prawn Ceviche, spicy pork belly, rib-eye steak, and a sweet finale of churros drizzled in rich chocolate sauce, all paired with my beloved margaritas.\n\nThe Prawn Ceviche emerged as the star of the show\u2014a harmonious blend of succulent prawns and zesty lime, delivering a medley of sour, juicy, crispy, and tender sensations all in one bite. The spicy pork belly added an extra kick to our palates, which I relished, though my friend found it a tad too fiery.\n\nRegrettably, the rib-eye steak didn't align with our taste preferences; its flavor and texture left us disappointed, slightly dampening our dining experience. However, we concluded our meal on a sweet note with the heavenly churros, perfectly complemented by warm, velvety chocolate\u2014a delightful treat.\n\nIn essence, Los Amigos offered a mixed dining experience with highs and lows. While some dishes soared to culinary perfection, others fell short of our expectations. Nevertheless, the lively ambiance and attentive service ensured an enjoyable evening overall.\n\nHola!\nLove the vibes of Los Amigos!\n\nStaff are all extremely friendly and helpful!\nA shoutout to Boss, AJ, Vinod and Black for making our experience extra awesome!\n\nWe had Tacos, Quesadillas, Ceviches\u2026 everything was just perfect.

Adios!\ud83c\udf7b\n\nHad to order 3 times. Half the food didn\u2019t arrive. What did arrive was terrible! Want fluorescent sour cream that tastes like garlic and guacamole that tastes like sugar? Eat here. Want food that tastes good, is what your ordered and delivered timely? Go somewhere else!\n\nIt was a team dinner & drinks event.\nWe had a great time at Los Amigos  with lively music and ambience followed by tasty food and drinks.\nWith the long list of cocktail options, the Margarita stood out.\nThank you to the owners and the staff for making the evening memorable.\n",

                  "reviews": "\n\nAmazing food and place. Went here for my birthday.\nI got the tacos,pizza and nachos. The paneer nachos were scrumptious. It had amazing cheese and melted in your mouth. It had sprinkles of olives and had a handful of nacho cheese.\nThe tacos were mediocre but it tasted fine. It had a mixture of vegetables dowsed in sauce.\nThe pizza was thinly crusted. It had a lot vegetable and the sauce was tangy and scrumptious .\nThey also gave me a complimentary cake which was scrumptious. It was soft and fluffy.\nThe customer service was really good. I recommend this place to everyone.\n\nI ordered chicken manchurian and they served vegie manchurian after I complaint they served chicken one. But it is not the same as the menu picture\ud83d\ude12 moreover plates are dirty you may see the fingerprint of the waiters in the last photo\n\nSet menus rate 5 stars. They combine good food and value. Mexican and Indian sets both offer vegetarian and non-vegetarian choices for $11-16. I thought the Indian food and the Mexican food were both good. Yes, hawker stalls are cheaper and your mother\u2019s food might taste better to you, but check out the view. If you don\u2019t want crowds, don\u2019t come at 6:00 on Friday or Saturday. We had a late lunch riverside and no waiting. Deep fried items freshly cooked. \ud83d\udc4d\n\nI LOVE THIS PLACE. THE LADY IS EXTREMELY NICE ITS A BEAUTIFUL RESTAURANT. OMG THE FOOD IS DELICIOUS, COME AFTER A GOOD NIGHT OF DRINKS AND FUN AND YOU WILL BE IN HEAVEN. I RECOMMEND THE REFRIED BEANS AND SHRIMP QUESADILLA AND BIRRIA TACOS.BEEN HERE 3x IN ONE WEEK. NO COMPLAINTS\n\nThe restaurant outlook, ambience, seating and food were good. We had some reservations before walking in to the restaurent as Kids demanded but believe me - It is worth spending time and money here. We ain\u2019t any real Mexican to gauge the authentic Mexican taste but when it comes with Indian flavours and thats when you love the taste.\n\nOrdered all kids choices from the menu but all of us adults got surprised too with the taste of all.\n\nKudos to the servers as they taken care of the order very well and our appreciations to the chef.\n",

                  "reviews": "\n\nMy team mates organise this dinner session and it was my first time having Mexican food.\n\nWe had fish taco, potatoes and beef taco (not sure what is the dishes names). I also thought taco is crispy type but it is pretty similar to peking duck wrap that I am familiar with.\n\nIt was a new experience and I enjoyed it.\n\nI understand the restaurant is pretty popular so reservation is needed. The restaurant ambient is nice too.\n\nVery good Mexican restaurant (and it is my favorite food in the world). The cocktails are well balanced and they are able to go off menu. The food is great, and the wood grill is bringing good flavor. Negative points: Cocktails are a bit pricey\n\nEvery single dish that we ordered tasted sooooo good. Tlayuda de la Casa was something super unique which I have been eyeing on ever since I found out about this restaurant and wasn\u2019t sure which one it was in the menu but the wait staff was super helpful and recommended that we add the lobster meat. It was sweet and savory in all the right balance.\n\nWe managed to make it early for the happy hour which has tacos and drinks. However, we ended up in the first dinner seating and couldn\u2019t keep the table past 8pm and we had to pack most of our food to go\u2026\n\nFood was impeccable, as much as the service was great, we believe that it could be better since there was a hefty price tag to this restaurant.\n\nNixta. Coming from the word \"nixtamalization\", a process by which maize/corn is processed by an alkaline solution. #TIL.\n\nWhat can I say? The food here is pretty good but make sure you wallets are thick. Best dish is the Tlayuda de la Casa, a crunchy tortilla with corn all other ingredients. We opted for the additional lobster but the super sweet corn is all I can remember of this dish. The whole dish is just perfect.\n\nNext best is the giant churros. Amazing soft and hot churros topped with cinnamon sugar. The sauces were only a distraction.\n\nThe fingerlings cooked in duck fat were pretty good with the cheese and sour cream too. Duck and pork belly tacos were decent but the portions were kinda small. My other friends seemed to like the chicken. While I admit that it was pretty juicy and tender, I find it a bit too salty. Like salt baked chicken.\n\nService staff were very competent and friendly. One of them even offered to help us take photos.\n\nWe did end up going elsewhere for more food.\n\nThis place has quite the star attraction \u2013 their grilled chicken. The catch? You're best off pre-ordering it, unless you fancy an hour of patient anticipation. We opted for half a savory grilled chicken and also ventured into Tlayuda de la casa, a crispy tortilla dough creation reminiscent of a pizza, generously topped with corn. To kick up the spice, we had to try their Seafood Cocktail Veracruz, a fiery, flavorful seafood soup. And for a sweet finale, we couldn't resist the Churros.\n\nBut here's the secret sauce: The Seafood Cocktail Veracruz is the real showstopper. It's so good that you'll find yourself dunking nearly everything in that soul-warming broth. As for Churros, they're an absolute must-order, arriving hot and crispy, a pure delight. The other menu items? Well, they don't quite hit the same high note, so you can safely skip those.\n\nFor anyone fortunate enough to find themselves in this neck of the woods, remember this golden rule: Always order the soup \u2013 it's the heart and soul of the experience! \ud83d\ude04\n",

On a Sunday it was quiet and we had booked a table outside overlooking the Marina.\nIt is recommended to visit during sunset, there is a refreshing breeze and slowly the marina lights up all happy and colourful - a perfect way to gear up for the new week.\nWe were served by Danial. He gave some unbiased suggestions highlighting what he likes and why and some other items why his colleagues like\n\nBased on that we ordered\nA Bottle of Pineapple and Calamani Margarita - It was light & refreshing\nTrotilla chips with salsa roja\n\nFor the main course we had\nWagyu Steak - juicy bite sized on a taco\nBeef Quesadilla - quite tasty\n\nThis should have been enough for dinner but for us it was not complete without a dessert so we indulged in\nChocolate Lava - as mentioned by Danial, the Mint ice cream and choco-lava cake made a super combo.\nPanna Cotta - personally I liked this the best. The tang of lemon sorbet balanced the sweet Oaxaca cheese topped with the crunch of pistachio crumble. This is an item to return for.\nThanks Super Loco\n\nDon\u2019t be surprised by my 5 STAR ratings\ud83e\udd23 I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s not because of my birthday\ud83c\udf1d\n\nSo I celebrated my birthday at this restaurant and it was on a Saturday\ud83d\ude0a I love went to other restaurant before but not this location. The VIEW is superb even at 6pm(before sunset)\n\nI ordered Chefs Recommendation $48/6 dishes.. I would say the portion is not too much and just nice for my appetite\u2026 So, as I put in the reservation remark column, they gave me a hat that night with a complimentary citrusy shots\ud83e\udd23 Ok, it\u2019s a bonus drink, what do you expect? A glass of beer or wine? \ud83e\udd23\n\nSo.. If you like to enjoy beautiful view with nice Mexican food, you should consider here and make your reservation early at least a week before your selected date\ud83d\ude09\n\nAbsolutely delicious and satisfying Mexican fare in a chill, laid-back setting by the Bay. No complaints and would definitely return! The chips and dips are a must-order!!\n\nDropped in just before last call for orders at 9pm on a weekend, but the staff were friendly and helpful even though we were latecomers. We ordered a selection of tacos, tostados, the nacho chips and a salad - everything was served very quickly, tasted fresh, balanced, overall just really delicious.\n\nThe nacho chips with the range of dips was probably the star of the night. It\u2019s usually a starter that I take for granted but the sauces here pack a punch - so so good and deceivingly simple-looking. I may not be a regular diner at Mexican restaurants but I\u2019d imagine that it would be hard to top this off. Can\u2019t wait to go back!\n\nWe got an outdoor seat beside the Bay Area with the backdrop Marina Bay Sands.\nThe view was awesome, there were a lot of people gathering around the area just to take photos in the evening.\n\nEverything we ordered tasted fantastic, and the plating was colourful. The service was warm, friendly and attentive. It rained halfway and Solihin quickly relocated us indoor, and offered to leave the door open so we can enjoy the view, until the rain got heavier.\n\nOverall, it was a unique and warm five star experience!\n",

Start off with some chili con carne nachos which is NOT-CHOS everyday chili and spice. The nachos were really crispy and tasty\n2. Beef steak was amazing. The rub was delightful and tasty and just something really different. The salad on the side had mango dressing and elevated it to the next level\n3. Baja fish tacos were big and sufficient to divide into 4 portions for a refreshing taste as well as crispy.\n\nOverall, something to look forward to it you would like a blend of flavours\n\nSadly, another Mexican place where the food barely resembles Mexican food. The owners should plan a trip to Mexico to see what it is really like. The food is not at all spicy. (we were served the \"spicy\" version so I can't imagine the non spicy version). The margaritas were ok. I wouldn't go here again.\n\nI thought the food was pretty good, even though it was overpriced. Drinks were very average and overpriced too. Their mango magherita came with sugar, and was far too sweet. Atmosphere was pretty chillax and nice. Service was quite bad. Although staff were responsive, they were quite unfriendly. There were no smiles at all. And when my Mexican friend told them one of the dishes was prepared wrongly, the staff just responded impatiently, self-righteously and with a look of displeasure. We spent around $70 per person so I feel service could be better.\n\nThe food was ok the portions are very small. It is in a great location but like most places we visited in Singapore overpriced and underwhelming\n\nGreat position on the River...\nGreat Mexican food.\nQuick and gentle service.\nReccomended.\n",

Service is polite, food is slow but acceptable as we can understand there seems to be a shortage of manpower. Tacos need to improve as it\u2019s small and not crispy enough.\n\nNice spot for hang out with friends over cocktails and drinks while deludge over Mexican food.\n\nThe Food:\nQuite close to authentic Mexican cuisine, especially their tacos. It's a must try.\nThe beverages are amazing. Get those!!!\n\nServices:\nThe waiter who served me was subpar in services. Lack of patience and giving a feeling like we are wasting his time. But foods and beverages are served quick. So it deserves a star.\n\nAtmosphere:\nNice, cozy, chill and outdoor spot. Not noisy and great place to chat with friends. I only wish it open till late midnight haha\n\nThe ambience is fantastic, it\u2019s open air and you get a nice view of CHIJMES. The food is great, but slightly different to what we had before. The quesadillas now have bell peppers/capsicums in them which is a change. Salsa, chips and the guacamole were very tasty and actually worth buying as a whole side. Also the fly on the plate is just a picture.\n\nIt was a Tuesday afternoon and so grateful for the incredible staff to take our big request booking for lunch of 40 people in such a short time. Shout out to the lovely staff who served us and we had the best time! Great food too! We recommend and will be back!\n\nAuthentic Mexican food in Chijmes in a beautiful setting. There's a few vegetarian options (impossible taco, salad, vegetarian enchilada or quesadilla), but some favorite options are missing (no huitlacoche, taco de champignones, flor de calabaza, tamales). I assume the ingredients are hard to get.\nOutdoor seating in Chijmes is nice, with lots of space for kids to run around.\n",

At first, they told us there were no tables available, but thanks to some smooth talking by my colleague and a stroke of luck with a no-show party, we snagged a great table for our group of six.\n\nHats off to George, one of the waitstaff, who was an absolute delight, super friendly, and full of great recommendations.\n\nWe indulged in some blueberry margaritas, chicken and beef enchiladas, lamb tacos, chips, and eggplant tempura, and let me tell you, they were scrumptious.\n\nI\u2019m already planning my next visit because there\u2019s so much more on their menu I want to try. We left with satisfied tummies and big smiles. \ud83d\ude04\ud83c\udf2e\ud83c\udf79\n\nFood is really good! Very happy they have a good selection of vegetarian dishes. Definitely order the elotes and the tempura flower courgette. The courgette flower was a shell that was filled with tasty liquid cheese. The lion mane taco was tasty but I thought the mushrooms were a bit on the tough side. That said, the texture was so close to meat you could be fooled.\n\nHighly recommend the tempura zucchini flower with black beans.\n\nWas served by George. Professional, attentive and helpful. As it was my first time having mexican food. He was able to address my questions and willing to share more about Mexican food. Thanks for recommending the sauces!! Esp the green sauce. Super love the crab dish with amazing flavours. Highly recommend blue corn cake for dessert! Ambience was really nice and great for dating/ gatherings!\n\nFood ordered: Fried Papas, Tostadas Crab, Quesadillas Chicken and blue corn cake\n\nFood is not bad, don't be fooled by the portion. It looks small but it is definitely filing. Two of us had cauliflower, tacos and Zucchini flower. We were really full halfway. We had churros anyway, too sweet to decline.. George was servicing us and he was really looking after us, and recommended us the items or else we would have ordered too much. He even got us fee margarita shots. Thanks George! We enjoyed our time there.\n\nGreat tacos, especially the prawn tacos.\nI think 2 tacos is enough for 1 person along with some small shared dishes.\nThe staff were all friendly, they came by for some small chats.\nWe sat outside the entrance and it was relatively warm especially with some alcoholic drinks.\n",

Maybe people go for the drinks but their food menu leaves much to be desired. Taco prices are per piece.\n\nAmazing tacos! Absolutely loved their fish and pork tacos! Each one was done to perfection and loved how friendly the staff were as well. Great ambiance to hang out with friends and chill. Only downside was that tacos are pricey. Portions are small for the prices they charge and drinks are much more expensive than the bars around CQ.\n\nBad service and tacos. I ordered the Al Pastor chicken tacos. On the menu it shows that the order comes with 2 tacos \"x2\" for take out. The waitress says it's not true and only comes with 1 taco because they just changed the menu today. I don't mind spending $14 for 2 chicken tacos but these tacos were bad. The chicken and corn tortilla were very dry with no flavor. Not sure if they had flour tortillas but the waitress didn't ask. I waited patiently at the table for 20 minutes. I walked up to the counter and the waitress realized my order has been ready awhile ago and forgot to give it to me. Don't waste your money here. Vatos tacos is much better and only $6 a taco that is worth every dollar.\n\nIt is difficult to find authentic mexican food and this is as good as it gets! Really loved the tacos. The salsa was very refreshing with flavours bursting in your mouth in every bite. Love how the tacos are served warm. The best thing is that they are on the Entertainer app so many of the items are one for one if you subscribed.\nThere is a dance floor in the middle of the restaurant - I presume that there could be performances in the night? Not sure but it made the place look really spacious. There is both indoor and outdoor seating. Will recommend you to sit inside if you want faster service because the staff might have some blind spots due to the walls etc. if you sit outside.\n\nOrdered tacos and chips for taco Tuesday. We are quite disappointed at the food.\n\nThe salsa (in the round container) comes with the chips is very very watery.  And it costs 7.8 together with the bag of chips. The salsa (in the rectangle container) bought from supermarket is way better.\n\nThe taco skin is a bit dry. Don\u2019t want to o there and eat at all.\n",

The breakfast burrito is great if you love sweet and savoury flavour combos as it comes with a syrup dip to have with it! Ambience is nice and casual, staff are always cheerful.\n\nHaven\u2019t tried many Mexican cafe/restaurants around but this was pretty good!\n\nHeard that they have  just rolled out new additions to its All-Day Menu as well as a brand-new Brunch Menu.\n\nHere\u2019s what we tried for their All-Day Menu:\n\ud83c\udf64 Fried Shrimp Tacos\nA crispy, zesty delight!\n\ud83c\udf5c Birria Ramen\nThe ramen was rich with a savory, spicy, sweet, sour, smokey and unique Mexican flavor.\u00a0Imagine tasty cooked beef shreds and the birria consomm\u00e9 which is a rich stew with flavors of chillies, adobo, herbs and spices dressing up cooked noodles. As simple as this sounds, it\u2019s also just luscious! You can\u2019t miss it!\n\ud83e\udd64 Milkshakes\nAvailable in Vanilla, Chocolate, Strawberry\n\ud83c\udf69 Churros\nWith White Choc or Strawberry Choc sauce\n\nWe tried some brunch menu items as well:\n\ud83c\udf73 Huevos Rancheros\nThis is a big hearty breakfast that\u2019s packs with loads of nutritious goodness! I myst say, it can get a tad messy to eat, but hey, that's the charm of a true Mexican meal \u2013 messy, delicious, and satisfying!\n\ud83e\udd69 Country Fried Steak with Mashed Potatoes & Gravy\nComfort food at its finest.\n\ud83e\udd5e Buttermilk Pancakes with Maple Syrup\nFluffy stacks of pure joy.\n\nProbably one of the best casual Mexican food joints in Singapore. Really up there on top of my list. The place is small and could be crowded during peak hours, but the location is not near public transpo - so it\u2019s not that packed quite often.\n\nThe food is top notch; I especially recommend their burritos and buffalo wings. One thing to take note of is that they offer a unique selection of beverages which are quite good, so if you\u2019re not adventurous and the type that sticks with the usual soda maybe you should bring yours.\n\nWe tend to always overindulge at this place, but on an average it\u2019ll cost you around $15-20 per person at Muchachos.\n\nGreat Mexican flavours in Downtown Singapore.  Tried tortilla chips and tacos. Got the soft one, not sure if hard tacos is available. The vegetarian option has only two possibilities: pepper, onions and tofu. Prefer to have more options. But the food was really good\n\nVery big portions. Good flavours, meat well cooked, fries crispy. Lacks something fresh light or crunchy. Every dish very heavy.\n",

The food is amazing!\n\nRoast chicken: Mild spicy level, breast is slightly drier; would be better if they could make it more succulent & juicy.\n\nFish taco: personal favourite, love the tangy chilli mango salsa sauce.\n\nGood vibes, good food. Good ambience to have a fun time. Food wise, not bad. Roasted whole chicken is great. Their margaritas are not bad too. It\u2019s ice blended so pretty unique.  Would say though, price point pretty high for low income earners like me.\n\nDisco lights to turn on after the sun has set. If you or your friends birthday, can ask them sing happy birthday. They will stop the music and get all their staffs to sing for you. Plus, you get an Mexican hat.\n\nDropped by because the Korean BBQ places we wanted to go to were fully booked on a Friday night.\n\nDeep fried fish taco - 4.75 stars\nBest of the lot.\n\nGrilled barramundi taco - 3.5 stars\n\nCauliflower taco - 3.5 stars\n\nChicken - 4 stars\nGets spicier as you eat it.\n\nThe broccoli side for the chicken was raw. The other salad was average as well.\n\nThe rotisserie chicken was well marinated and the meat was tender and juicy.\nThe \u201cNot your average nacho\u201d was indeed special, the topping and dips went so well with the tortilla chips.\nThe dishes were a bit salty though.\n\nPretty packed on a Friday but we managed to get a seat without reservation.\n\nOverall, the fish tacos as other reviews were good. The nacho and chicken was average.\n\nThe main disappointment is the level of service seems lacking, and one particular server didn't look like he wants to be there, and it shows. We saw a group of diners behind us leave their table without ordering after no one attended to him for a while.\n\nFor the price point, I do expect a better level of service and food.\n",

A wide variety of food and drinks choices. The baja fish tacos were simply mouthwateringly amazing.\n\nChecked out Vatos' new place at City House and tried their new dish, the Roasted Bone Marrow Platter. First time trying something like this, and I was pleasantly surprised\u2014I loved it!\n\nThe portions were big (almost too much for me), the place had a cozy vibe, and the staff was super friendly and helpful. Excited to go back and try more dishes soon!\n\nThe honey chicken wings were cooked just right, perfect combination of sweet and tangy taste. The shoe string fries were crispy and the cheese quesadillas were appetizing. Finally, drinks OG margherita mix was good :)\n\nI\u2019m impressed! Vatos is a whole package of unforgettable dining experience. Totally love the ambiance of the restaurant, it\u2019s brand new, spacious and the bar is sparkling with array of choice drinks aim to fulfil to one\u2019s liking. It also artistically designed with beautiful painted mural on the wall which provides ideal spot for selfies and group photo to capture the memorable experience together. The food is fantastically fresh, delicious and creatively fusioned. In Vatos, I find this quote really summarise my dining experience \u201cAnybody would enjoy the first bite of a dish, but only a real food would let you enjoy the last.\u201d\n",

Quesadillas were delicious but the dips were too small. Beer selection is limited though.  The fried chicken wings were crunchy and went well with beers.\nGood crowd even on weekdays.  Both indoor and outdoor dining areas are available.\n\nQuite a famous place in Arab street with a long stretch outlet. Food is pretty good, drinks are good, price is pretty alright. Probably recommended for family during noon and early evening. Place has the vibes for friends and couple during dinner time and late evening. Their tacos is really good. Plenty of tables to sit and they have indoor and outdoor seats. Worth the try in a famous place as such.\n\nGreat ambient, the decorations and music.\nWe were 7 of us there on national day for dinner, ordered quite a lot of different kind of tapas and main course.\n\nThe portions were all quite large, the mozzarella cheese stick was so tasty, the pepper was too spicy somehow. The tacos with hard shell was crispy and I love the full loaded vegetables and meat perfectly with the sauces. Grilled chicken chop was well prepared, juicy and tender.\n\nFlan is different then what we have in kopitiam, this texture of flan was not smooth or silk.  Not recommend to order ice cream as it taste so cheap..\n\nFantastic hard shell tacos, freshly smashed guacamole right at your table. Burger is juicy and my kid says, flavourful.\n\nThey even helped light a candle on the dessert for my kid's birthday.\n\nOne of my all time fav Mexican bar. The great vibe hasn't change. Colorful, lively, vibrant.\n\nGreat service too from the team especially Sunil. Thoroughly friendly and super helpful.\n",

Chili pakoras are no joke though, super spicy!\n\nUsed to be my go to for Indian food but finds that recent visits are less pleasant. Staff not able to describe properly the dishes seems they can\u2019t speak English well. The food are just ok not fantastic.\n\nLove the bread basket, butter chicken and palak paneer! The chicken biryani is so so. The place is air conditioned with good hygiene. Quite a lot of tourists in the restaurant.\n\nButter chicken is good, but the tandoori chicken is okay but proportion is small, overall is pricey, and they have too many take away orders that took very long to serve our food, the outdoor tables are close to street where is not so good when raining\n\nAbsolutely brilliant food.

Equally the dal maklani was too salty and buttery albeit managed to finish quite a big helping. Pricing is bonkers tho with rice and dal dishes being close to 15 dollars. Service was excellent and I would come back and try a few other dishes. One issue is the lack of bathroom facilities or washbasin in the restaurant. You have to exit and do a couple of doors down and my nose never did recover from little India\u2019s more underground smells !\n\nI had a great experience at this Indian restaurant\n\nThe food was great and I enjoyed the service, the staff were friendly and helpful.\n\nI like the atmosphere, and I appreciated how quickly the food was served.\n\nWhile I haven't explored many Indian restaurants yet, I'm looking forward to returning to try more dishes in the future.\n\nSo far the best chaats I have had in Singapore. Nice and proper place to sit and enjoy the food. Prices are not exorbitant. One thing I dislike is that they don't have a proper hand wash inside the restaurant. Have to go out to wash and come back using the swing door, which defeats the purpose of washing hands. Indian food must be enjoyed by using hands, so hand wash point in the restaurant is a must.\n\nUpdate on 18 Sep,\nSince I liked the chaats, I thought of having at airport as I saw it was at T1 terminal @ L2. When I went there, they said it was moved to different location. Management must take out the signboard from T1 as it gives wrong information.\n\nVery good option for Indian vegetarian food. Was seated very fast and the service was also good. During peak dinner time 8-9pm place will be crowded and generally there will be waiting.\nVast Manu covers most of the Indian variety food. Food is really tasty, especially all the chat items are very nice. If you are looking for   Indian vegetarian food definitely worth a try.\n\nGreat North Indian cuisine. Service was slower than expected, however food was good. Be careful when ordering more sides as they charge for everything\n",

Amazing food and service! Definitely coming back!\n\nLots of options, portion is just nice as well \ud83d\udc4c\n\nPersonal favourite tonight was the Goan Fish!\n\nA really homely establishment serving delectable Indian dishes at affordable prices relative to other places.\n\nThe paneer masala was rich and perfect with the Naan basket. The mutton biryani was rich and tender. Accompanied with the Malai chicken kebab, which was served on a sizzling hot plate that oozed rich flavours. Finally, the Gulab Jamun was rich and fragrant without exceedingly sweet. Topped with the Mango milkshake served with passion, the food was downed with great enjoyment.\n\nCome on down if you are in the vicinity, you won\u2019t regret it.\n\nThe food was excellent, the service exquisite. Thanks to the waiter we ordered incredibly good food. The Goan fish curry was probably the best I ever had. The mint chutney was very strong in taste, hence it was the first time I ever really appreciated it as an appetizer sauce.\n\nWould definitely recommend, way better than expected.\n\nLove their lamb rack briyani. The briyani was not too oily, flavourful and lamb rack was succulent. Lamb was not gamey at all. Their lassi and dal makhni were very rich in flavour. They have a variety of sauces to complement different dishes which pairs very well. It's affordable for such quality Indian food.\nService crew were very polite and attentive.\n",

I think my favorite dish was the butter chicken, but honey everything we tried was lovely. The samosas and the tandoori chicken were also great. Yum!\n\nWOW! Where do I even begin\u2026 easily one of the best, most delicious places to eat out I\u2019ve ever been to! Great and authentic setting, delicious Indian cuisine and lovely staff to make you feel like home. The spicy challenge is so fun and the taste of the food there is simply out of this world! A must visit if you happen to be in Singapore!\n\nHad an incredible time here! My group stumbled in not knowing at all what was in store for us.\n\nWe first of all were impressed that this place made the Michelin List so many years in a row, and then we saw the hilarious Spice Challenge and were intrigued with all of the fun events this place hosts like the Full Moon Nights & the cooking classes. The owner/chef was so awesome. He was so funny and sarcastic and also encouraged us to get out of our American-Indian comfort zone and wouldn\u2019t let us all just order Tikka Masala as we originally planned, and because of that, it turns out I found authentic Indian food I loved even more! I really wish I lived here so I could take the cooking classes with him!\n\nMany thanks for providing our group with such an entertaining experience and pushing us out of our comfort zones. It was truly a time!\n\nAn amazing and authentic environment with unique deliveries of classic dishes. They have a sauce heat sampler platter to see what heat level you like.  There's a challenge wall for those seeking immortality as well. But the naan and sauces are too notch. A must try. The proprietors are amazing and have a fun sense of humo(u?)r.\n\nChanged my perception of Indian food in Singapore : well-curated, small portion size, so I didn't feel stuffy while digesting and a bit pricy. Masala tea was better than I had in Mumbai but it would have been perfect if the sugar was on the side.\n",

The restaurant holds the legacy with not just the location, the interior but also to the taste with food. We tried a few variations including the famous meal and biriyani. A must try will be the meal combo, served hot. We had to wait for around 30 mins to get seated but it\u2019s worth the wait.. ground floor and first floor has seating capacity. The prices are very reasonable for the quantity being served. Will definitely recommend this place for all South Indian vegetarian fans!\n\nFood here is good, not that very bad. Service got to improve. Environment can be cramped and noisy. Pricey but still okay, you pay what you asked for. I was served food first, even finished up eating the foods but drinks were served after 5-10 after finishing up my meals. Masala tea arrived 30-40 minutes late upon ordering. This is not acceptable at all. And never even apologized for serving the drinks late. I ordered one ice tea and one masala tea. Also, I personally feel the standard of the food have dropped a lot. Used to patronize here often but I think it's about time that the service and food taste is falling apart.\nOverall food is 7.5/10.\nService is 3/10.\nEnvironment is 4.5/10.\nThis review is based on my honest opinion.\n\nI saw this on a food travel show and immediately wanted to try it out.\n\nThere was a short queue but seated after 5min or so wait. Service was friendly and no fuss. Dining area is simple but as expected.\n\nDefinitely lived up to expectations with amazing, fresh, authentic and tasty food. I had the dosai meal which had 3 curries, some chutneys, Daal, sambar, and even a sweet sago coconut pudding. Amazing flavours, colours and spices. A generous meal which was thoroughly enjoyable.\n\nFor a sweet finish I tried the almond hawa and milk kova which were both new to me. Very sweet but had their own unique taste and texture which hit the spot.\n\nOne improvement would be to use less plastic for serving food - lots of little plastic containers on my meal set and for sweets.\n\nOverall a great experience and will definitely be recommending and be back.\n\nThe food and service is always good in Komala Vilas. We stay nearby so we can walk to this restaurant during our jaunt in Singapore.\nI wish they include an elevator to go upstairs for lunch.

The quaint place had nice decor and a good vibe. We had the butter chicken, lady finger vegetable curry, fish tikka, garlic and cheese Naan as well as a starter which was a flatbread filled with a spinach style filling and a curry on the side to dip the bread.  For drinks we had a mango lassi and lime juice. Everything was delicious and the service was delightful and friendly. Recommended to make a reservation as it got quite busy on a Thursday evening.\n\nExcellent dinner at Mustard on Race Course Rd. Restaurant is small and intimate and service is excellent and attentive.  They have a huge menu with tons of choices so we ordered way too much to try many things. Everything was wonderful but especially recommend the house special Chingri Maacher Malai, the Aloo Jhuri, Mutton Biryani and the kathi kababs.\n\nLocated in the Little India neighborhood. This restaurant has friendly staff, of which unfortunately not everyone speaks English.\n\nFood menu is extensive and you don't have to wait very long on your food. Not everything was of my personal taste, but I am sure the food was nice. Also enough dessert choices and even typical Indian drinks.\n\nDo note that the air conditioning is very cold here, somewhat too cold (heard the same thing from a co-worker who visited earlier).\n\nExcellent food!\n\nWe arrived at opening at 11:30 specifically bent on enjoying authentic Bengali food\u2014we left satisfied and glad we came early!\n\nThe waiters are able to make excellent recommendations. We opted to go straight for mains:\n\n- Kosha Mangsho: tender chunks of mutton in a fantastic thicker gravy\n\n- Chingri Maacher Malai Curry: delicate shrimp and coconut curry presented in a tender coconut\n\n- Maacher Paturi: boneless fish fillet smothered in mustard, gently steamed in a banana leaf\n\nRice bread does not come with each main, and does require separate purchasing. We opted for:\n- Luchi: aka puri, lightly fried and crisp\n- Roomali Roti: one roti is rather large, and folded in on itself; delicate with a great chew\n- Plain white rice\n\nFor dessert, we enjoyed Rossomalai (aka Rasmalai), a dessert in most areas of India, but theirs is fragrant and richly flavored with cardamom, almonds, and cream.\n\nAll in all, a fantastic visit for those who enjoy Indian food and are looking for something different than what most restaurants serve. They do include Punjabi items in their menu, which is typically what most people think of when they think \u201cIndian,\u201d but venturing off to possibly \u201cunfamiliar\u201d dishes won\u2019t disappoint!\n\nIt\u2019s a shame they are not awarded Michelin Star, all the dishes were on point. Highly recommend for anyone wish to taste good authentic Indian cuisine. Try all the signature dishes, all is a hit!\n",

Makes me feel like I've been eating nonsense for a long time. The VIP Thali is also absolutely delicious! Likewise the dosai. Service was o-k, the waiter actually got two out of 5 orders wrong, but was quick to serve us the correct item after that.\n\nDidn't get to try the appam where they make it freshly on the spot. Can't wait to come back here again.\n\nTime to enjoy a nice breakfast with an appam set and a madras tea (small).\n\nAppam was soft on the centre and slightly crispy on the exterior. Served warm. It goes really well with the orange sugar and coconut milk. Madras tea was thick & creamy, and you can add sugar as you need.\ud83e\uded3\u2615\n\nThe place was packed in the morning, but no queue at my time (8.30am, Sunday).

White chutney was coconuty and creamy.\n\nTotal score: 14.5/15\n\nAdd-ons: Madras Coffee ($2.90) was fragrant and milky. Very standard and good filter coffee.\n\nService was quick and the service staff were very polite and friendly.\n\nThe appam is to die for. Coffee was good. The vadai is crispy dosa not bad. Cost around $21. For the coffee and appam I will definitely come back.\n",

It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve been here and sadly to say, I\u2019ll not come back again.\n\nI ordered the curry fish head, chicken tikka and chicken biriyani. The expectation of the curry fish head was high but was the biggest disappointment. Not much taste, more towards blend with lots of unnecessary spices. Chicken tikka was not bad but the biriyani was also terrible. Rice was cold and stale.\n\nLet\u2019s come to the service. The server, an Indian guy who took my order was kind of rude and distracted. When taking my order, he was also at the same time talking loudly to other Indian servers. I had to repeat my order thrice. He didn\u2019t seem to be happy working there. He was very uninterested when I asked him a question about the menu and gave the \u201cwould u hurry up\u201d face. When he came back with the glasses and water, he slammed it on the table loudly. Only when i stared at him, he retracted back. I didn\u2019t get his name though but I could recognize him. Ironically, the friendliest server was a Chinese lady server that day.\n\nFor the price you are paying, it\u2019s definitely not worth it for the food and the service. Both are terrible. The management should do something about most of the servers there. Their attitude seems that they own the restaurant or they are not interested to receive any customers.\n\nI urge anybody or tourist or what\u2019s to visit this restaurant to try other authentic Singapore Indian food elsewhere. You will be getting better food and service elsewhere\n\nGood Indian food here. Fish head curry is a must. Quite a big portion of fish head here. Butter chicken was also good.\n\nIt was getting mire crowded at dinner time. Reservation might be required at dinner time. Luckily we came slightly before dinner time.\n\nPrice was expensive though. 4 adults cost me SGD 200+\n\nMy first visit to this restaurant was a memorable one. The food was remarkably tasty, and the staff\u2019s friendly and attentive nature added an extra touch of warmth. I will definitely be returning for more delightful meals and their top-notch service.\n\nfood was very authentic and service was quick. although the pricing will definitely be slightly higher than ur usual indian street spot. this restaurant is well air conditioned and has proper plating and service so price is definitely what you get. staff also abit too eager... clearing plates before we leave the table even. the place wasn't packed so i feel like such etiquette should be rectified to enhance customer experience\n\n22/07/23\nHave higher expectations for Michelin restaurants. Fish head curry is average. The curry has full flavour of curry spices but lack of savoury. Curry chicken has similar taste too. Overall food is only slightly above average.\n",

The Tandoori Prawn is a succulent masterpiece, charred to perfection. The vibrant atmosphere and friendly staff enhance the experience. Whether you're a foodie or a spice enthusiast, Apollo is a must-visit for a mouthwatering journey through Indian cuisine. This place is a true gem that satisfies cravings and ignites a love for authentic Indian flavors. Don't miss out on this remarkable culinary adventure!\n\nWent to Banana Leaf for dinner with my colleagues while on a business trip in Singapore, we really enjoyed the authentic Indian food. Our food was served on banana leaves which was a really cool experience plus the food was exceptional and tasty. The service was also good.\n\nRipoff ! The rice which was supposedly free flow is so expensive!\n\nGive it a try when you are in little India. Our bill was about $100.\n\nWe ordered medium fish head curry, tandoori chicken and we got the portion of rice which comes with vegetables and gravy.\n\nMasala tea was bad- skip. Overall a nice experience and you can bring your family and friends if they are from out of town!\n\nHowever it\u2019s not worthwhile to order the rice if u r not a big eater !\n\nFirst time at banana leaf on a Friday evening. Atmosphere was great. Gotta say the fish head curry packed a punch with the rich, tangy flavour of the gravy. Perfect match with the biryani rice.\n\nMy parents and me were there for lunch, ordered the medium sized curry fish head with briyani rice and lime juice. The curry and side vegetables were flavourful, of acceptable spiciness . Medium size fish head portion was just nice for 3pax. The bill came up to $80+.. Feel that their food is over-priced. Go to them  if u don't mind paying a bit more\n",

Hope to come back again soon, I was in Singapore this January\n\nAroma's is a great place to try out indian food! The owner is extremely warm and enthusiastic and he would recommend special items off the menu if you make specific requests. I have been coming with my family for a year now and have become great friends with the owner.\n\nI would personally recommend to try their chaat (light snack) items as well as the indian-chinese fusion items such as gobi/chicken manchurian. Aroma's also does excellent biryanis which are so well flavoured/seasoned, you would not even need any gravy to accompany it.\n\nI highly recommend all folks to come and give this restaurant a shot! :)\n\nIt's our first visit to such a specialty restaurant. We\u2019re not sure if we\u2019ll like it, judging from some of the low reviews. But wait!! We had such a great meal and experience with the owner here!When we first arrived, the signage was pretty small and not so eye-catching among the rows and rows of Indian food along the stretch of shophouses.\n\nThe menu was pretty big; we had no idea which to order until the owner approached us and we asked him for some recommendations. Firstly, he recommends some items to see if they suit our taste, and the more he asks, the more he knows about our food preferences.\n\nSurprisingly, when the food came, the curries blew my mind! The different kinds of curry to match with different kinds of carbs are so suitable that they do not overpower each other. They are so flavorful! I specifically recommend the mixed vegetables; they're so flavorful with the briyani! The garlic nann is topped with REAL bits of chopped garlic and fragrant butter. It's so good with the curry the owner recommends! We wanted to order another nann, but we were so full because of the delicious briyani and curry. All the food was served hot and warm.\n\nWe were served papadam with a special mix of mint and many other spices and yoghurt green sauce. The sauce is so good that you want to keep dipping in it. He also recommends dipping the fried fish into this sauce. Yum!!\n\nDo not hesitate to ask them for recommendations, as the owner did it very well! We will definitely go back for other dishes, especially butter chicken and prawns.\n\n**This is more of a specialty restaurant than the other Indian food restaurant, which serves large portions of food. According to the owner now, they have only been open for 6 months. Some of the reviews from a year ago were definitely not from the same owner. Give it a try! You\u2019ll not be disappointed.\n\nRecently eating AROMA'S restaurant ,Race course road(near banana leaf appollo) Little India. Mutton Dum biriyani,chicken Dum Briyani ,Gobi manjurian,chicken 65,mushrooms cream soup,baby corn pepper fry,Masala tea taste fantastic and fabulous \ud83d\udc4c \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c\n\nPerfect respite after a warm morning walking tour of Little India.  Muthu welcomed us, very nice (cool) setting, very cold drinks and the food was great!  We'll be back!\n",

It was my first time having a South Indian cuisine, I really have no idea what to order so I kindly requested for recommendations and everything was pleasing to my taste bud. The person who took my order yesterday was really patient as well.\n\nGiving my layman description, I\u2019ve ordered meen pollichathu (Marinated spicy boneless fish wrapped in banana leaf), gobi manchurian (fried cauliflower sauteed with special sauce), kozhi porichathu (fried chicken marinated with various spices), porata (its like local roti prata but less oily), fish curry with mango, malabar mutton biriyani, mango lassi (yoghurt drink) and lemon soda. My favourite got to be the gobi manchurian as I have never tasted cauliflower done like this before. Biriyani portion was great for 2 pax sharing or for 1 hungry person, the mutton was yummy as well. Meen Pollichathu needs no explanation as it is one of their best seller and portion is reasonable for their price. The kozhi porchathu was probably my least fav as the chicken felt like its double fried since its a little hard, otherwise the taste is really good. Food were all served within 15mins upon ordering and the temperature was hot (everything is made fresh). Total bill came out to be around ~$87 for 2. I personally think its reasonable as I was extremely full by the end of the dinner and have no stomach for dessert haha.\n\nWould definitely being my Kerala colleagues to try their dishes one day.\n\nThis place is special in its way of treating your taste buds with the kerala food in Singapore. The service is good, and the ambiance gives you the picture of the land Kerala.\n\nWent for Onam Sadhya.. all the items served were cold and tasted like cooked in the morning and served for dinner. Taste was also bland and not worth Sadhya. Nothing special in the \u201cSadhya\u201d served and definitely not worth $24!\nBetter have Andhra meal at any restaurant, its better taste and value for money.\n\nAmazing food\ud83d\ude00!!!. Excellent service. It\u2019s an authentic place to get typical South Indian food.Especially Kerala cuisine. \ud83d\ude0bHighly recommend !!!\n\nI've only had lunch meals at this restaurant. The  quality of the meals is inconsistent. When it's good, it's really good.\n\nThey offer a lot of meat dishes and only a handful of vegetarian items. But there is enough here to get a good experience of the range and taste of Kerala-food.\n\nEdit: In subsequent visits, the quality further dropped. The vegetarian meals were not served on the banana leaf, the rasam was the worst I've tasted, the puliseri looked pale and was just sweet, the ulli theeyal was too sugary, and everything else was average.\n",

I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve found anything better.\n\nService - 9 | Ambience - 7 | Food - 10\n\nThe price point is reasonable for the taste and service. The food is super tasty, it is homely and not too oily. The service is quick, doesn\u2019t take too long. The taste is super authentic which I really like! There are a lot of restaurants but the one\u2019s serving food where meat is tender and tasty are few. I would highly recommend this.\n\nLovely place for some nice South Indian food. I couldn\u2019t pick any single dish as they were all tasty. Loved the sweet and salty lime juice as well. Definitely worth a visit.\n\n1st visit on 4th week of Oct 2023.\nWe were recommended by Indian friend to try the this restaurant.\nActually craving for nasi briyani but when served,  the taste totally different from North India briyani. It was spicy taste only, no fried onions and tumeric fragrance.. we cannot get use to it.\nSorry to say only alacart rice cost $7.50, with only spicy taste, is not worth to eat.\nOther dishes, masala lady fingers and chicken tasted normal.\nFish with mango sauce tasted so so, served with a inner hidden shallow container with only few pcs of fish meat also not worth to eat..\n\nI think the only best dishes go to the 6 pcs grill prawns but pricy..\n\nThe crab rasam was awesome. Delish vegetarian meals especially the spicy sour curry(Vatthe kolumbe). Must try. The pepper mutton, onion eggs and lollipops chicken was alright.\n\nHad a craving for South Indian food so I came here. Hands down one of the best restaurants in the little India area. The ample use of curry leaves and coconut in the curries really show that Indian food is more than just being spicy. Of course, if you would like a spicy kick, order the karaikudi chicken masala. The parottas, although they look small are filling and flaky. Overall a really good experience, friendly servers, quick service and delicious food.\n",

Great lamb curry and butter chicken and super crispy prata! They also do catering so might think of engaging them in future.\n\nOverall food tasted average. Biryani was dry. Chicken Momo stuffing was dry and veg momo was salty. Rumali roti was good. Chilli prawn was better compared to all other items. Service was good and faster.\n\nThe food is great! Service was great, sadly the atmosphere wasn\u2019t good, it was pretty hot even during dinner, PS. their chicken 65 is basically chicken tenders\n\nI\u2019m speechless.

They are old school. No menus! So if u wanna treat ur taste buds to real humble authentic South Indian thali, head over here!\n\nCame here for a quick bite.

But today, it's Take Away for a home party and the ever reliable Mr Ravi ensured our orders are all good and his staff are attentive to our requests. Halal certified and so many to choose from.\n\nHad been a regular customer here. Overall food is good despite the food standard now and than has some issues. Price wise I think there's some increase. I think it's fine but the service has to improve too for it to reflect on the price increase. Hope the management will make sure the service gets better. Otherwise may not patronize anymore. Overall, price is competitive but like I said, service has to be competitive, otherwise risk of losing genuine customers. Food can be improved too, there is some drop in the food taste and standard as well.\n\nIncredibly fresh fish head curry and amazing side dishes which pleased me and my friends.\n\nVery grateful for Ravi\u2019s very friendly and superb service which made the visit a joyfilled and pleasant one.\n\nSakunthala never fails me! The Briyani Mutton is a flavor explosion - tender, fragrant, and perfectly spiced. The Butter chicken is a succulent masterpiece, charred to perfection.\n\nThe vibrant atmosphere and friendly staff enhance the experience (But sometimes it gets really busy). Whether you're a foodie or a spice enthusiast, Sakunthala is a must-visit for a mouthwatering journey through Indian cuisine. This place is a true gem that satisfies cravings and ignites a love for authentic Indian flavors. Don't miss out!\n\nMy visit to Sakunthalas Restaurant was a culinary delight. I ordered the chicken biriyani, and it exceeded my expectations in every way. The portion was generous, and the flavors were simply amazing. The biriyani was perfectly cooked and had an enticing aroma that made every bite a treat for the senses.\n\nTo complement the meal, I tried their lime soda, and it's an absolute must-try. The refreshing citrusy flavor provided a perfect balance to the rich and savory biriyani.\n\nThe service at Sakunthalas Restaurant was not only quick but also remarkably friendly. The staff's warm hospitality added to the overall positive dining experience.\n\nIf you're in search of a place that serves delectable biriyani, offers refreshing beverages like lime soda, and provides top-notch service, Sakunthalas Restaurant should be on your list. I'm already looking forward to my next visit.\n",

Today, decided to try again their chicken tikka briyani. They did not disappoint as the food taste as good as it looks!\nThe briyani bismatic rice is cooked lightly with spices without the heavy, oily fare that you get at the Tekka market stalls. The red fiery looking chicken tikka is nicely marinated and barbequed, yet remains tender. Kudos to the cooks, one of whom was seen observing me as I dug happily into the briyani! All these down with iced limau drink makes the meal complete\n\nThis restaurant in Dickson Rd opens 24 hrs. I tried Mutton Biryani, Thai Schezwan noodles and Aloo Paratha for the main course. The taste was really delicious and uplifted my mood. Then I had Milo Dinosaur drink which was extremely tasty and gave a final touch to this beautiful dinner. This place is vibing with people across the street and tourists. The waiter was a good guy and helped me try the best dishes. Must go here if you are living nearby. Highly recommend!\n\nI had a training course nearby so I had my lunch here for 4 days. The food is great! I tried briyani on 2 days and the teh halia was good! Always had seats and the staff served quite fast!\n\nOrder 1 is enough for 3 persons. Taste is good, big portion too. Near our hostel.\n\nLove my deep-fried crunchy poori ,and go so well with the savoury curry.\nBeriyani rice is aromatic & flavoursome. The set comes with tender mutton,mild spicy curry,hard-boiled egg, and papadom.\nQuite a generous portion for 1 person.\n\nFor drink, we get ourselves a cup of warm mild sweet tea limau! Super refreshing!\n\nWe spend less than $20 for 2 person ,quite a reasonable price \ud83d\udc4d\nWill definitely come again\n",

He was singing praises for the food he had, especially the butter chicken, so it was only fitting the family gave it a try. We went over for lunch here. Parking the car was horrendous, but the moment we sat down, ordered our food and ate, all the parking frustrations left us.\nThe staff were attentive and great at what they do. The food was the coup de grace for the meal. Everything they served was great, and trust me; we've had our fair share of Indian food! What I especially liked was the fact that we could taste the spice seasoning without being overwhelmed by it. The flavours were just right! It was a great meal for us!\n\nDelicious North Indian food served consistently over the last 20 years.\n\nI\u2019ve dined in and catered from this restaurant for my birthday party. Every guest I bring to the restaurant or taste the food at my home is amazed by how delicious North Indian cuisine can be.\n\nPrior to COVID 19, they used to be a popular food destination with the crew of a tier 1 European airline. The crew would pre-order a specific cashew based curry for their flight back home. Impressive.\n\nMust tries if it is your first time there: Chicken Malai Tikka, Cheese Kulcha, garlic naan, any briyani, palaak saag (chicken with creamed spinach), baingan bharta (mashed roasted eggplant), baingan bajardi (pardon the spelling. Fried eggplant with spices) and the Kashmiri naan, a sweet dessert naan stuffed with dried fruits used in fruit cake. Even fruit cake haters became fans of it.\n\nSure, by all means, order the butter chicken which is also good. But do try the rogan josht or look for that dish with the cashew gravy (forgot the name).\n\nService is good and the seating is comfortable. Do expect that the waiting time for food will be longer during peak hours or when you notice that there are several other tables that have not gotten their food. One pro-tip is to place your order upfront to avoid delays from the kitchen.\n\nCurries were greasy and not cooked like you would expect. Paneer tasted like mock meat. Navratna korma had chilies??\nActual order had less Naans than paid for so felt cheated. No one answers the phone.\n",

I didn't know what I was doing, but I was seated at a table and I agreed to eat what the other guy at the table was eating: the vegetarian lunch. It was absolutely delicious and surprisingly filling. They serve extra rice and curry if you're really hungry. Some of the guys there were doing that. I did also see a woman eating there.\n\nOne of the few Pure Vegetarian South Indian Thali restaurant in Little India. Very hygienic and friendly atmosphere. Taste just like the home. Must visit place. Serving thali only in the afternoon and rest of the items entire day.\n\nGo here for breakfast. Got here around 8am, ordered the paper dosa and my wife had the roast masala dosa, with chutneys. They also offered us what they described as a doughnut which was good but not sweet.\n\nTo order, go straight back to the counter, order, and wait for your food before sitting. It is self service once you\u2019ve picked up your food.\n\nMy wife wanted a mango lassi but they said they wouldn\u2019t have them until probably 10am.\n\nSouth Indian meal of good quality and reasonable price. They server yellow dal which is I like (served in Maharashtra at few residences).\nI had a meal twice there and quality is consistent.\nYou need to reach early to avoid the crowd on week ends.\n\nWorth Trying.\n\nI would definitely return for their food menu as it was packed at 11:30am Sunday. Cash. About 10 person deep line.\n\nMango Lassi was fresh, tangy and sweet. Very balanced mango vs yogurt flavour. $3.\n\nCash.\n",

Initially wondering why the place was so empty when I arrived but after a while it was totally packed.\nA little confusing on the menu because the physical one outside the shop had dinner menu and lunch menu and the electronic one only had lunch. Not sure if could only order from the lunch menu tab but upon asking could order from anywhere from the menu. There were duplicate dishes on ala carte and lunch menu because portion size was smaller and it comes with a set of soup and rice.\nOrdered quite a few items to try, the most important thing I wanted to try was the marinated raw crab and we also ordered the galbi along with some other dishes like seafood pancake and kimchi stew.\nEverything here was good, from the sides to the mains. The galbi was cooked by the staff and it was cooked to perfection. Raw crab was also nice and flavourful and well marinated.\nBill came and it was slightly expensive but definitely worth for the quantity and the quality. Would definitely come back again!\n\nThe newly revamp joint has a real modern touch. Service is absolutely amazing. Food quality is top notch. Many tables was having the raw crab. Looks good however didn\u2019t dare to try. Seafood pancake was delicious & they don\u2019t skimp on the ingredients. Btw the steam egg is FOC. Every table has it. We wanted to order however the waitress explained they will provide every table with one.\nHighly recommended.\n\nFirst time trying Guiga and I\u2019m so glad we did! Everything from service to food was perfect. I loved the beef tartare and marinated crabs\u2764\ufe0f We got the Black Pork set with a side of beef ribs and the samgyetang, which is by far the tastiest I\u2019ve had in Singapore. We didn\u2019t quite enjoy the steamed egg, maybe cos we let it sit there for too long because we were busy eating up the feast we ordered!  We will definitely be back!\n\nthe food here was great and the kimchi was a hit! the pasta salad side dish was also yummy. Ronnie\u2019s service was veryyy sweet and the top-ups on the side dishes were very very generous!\n\nReservations are recommended. When we visited on a Saturday for lunch, the place was packed.\n\nThe pork was good. The staff isn't very interactive or smiley, but they are quite helpful when it comes to grilling the meat.\n",

Came around 6:30pm and it was fairly quiet and managed to get a seat. But the place was getting crowded shortly.\n\nAttentive and very fast service. The banchans were replenished once we finished some of them.\nThe meats were of good quality!\nWill definitely be back again!\n\nTLDR: Will return\n\nType: Korean BBQ\n\nWaiting Time: None at 7pm on a Thursday. Food took 10 minutes to arrive from the time we got a table and ordered.\n\nMust Try (\u203c\ufe0f): The meat in BBQ Set C - Beef Brisket, Marinated Beef Rib, Marinated Chicken - delicious and good value at $79.80 before tax and service charges // The shredded cabbage salad with black sesame dressing banchan.\n\nService: Good - the service staff was polite but the chicken was left on the grill for too long.\n\nNote: The restaurant\u2019s ventilation system isn\u2019t great - the smoke will get absorbed into your clothes and hair.\n\nThe food is great, excellent customer service, banchan is delicious, so happy to try their Ganjang Gejang.We had a great dinner at Supulae Korean BBQ, thank you very much, definately will be back again.\n\nSupposed to go to another outlet across the road for korean bbq but the queue was too long. Ended up in this restaurant.\nNice refreshing sides.\nThe meat are delicious and the sauces are what you will experience in korea.\nStaff are prompt in getting the meat bbq for you.\nBest of all, nice ventilation system as the restaurant is not smokey compared to other outlets.\nOrdered their Supulae set\n\nOrdered Set B which comprised chicken and pork. Selected kimchi stew as the side which was disappointing : diluted soup with cabbage and eggs with a hint of kimchi taste and red colouring. Steamed egg was plain steamed egg with no garnishes. Half half pancake was too mushy  with flour inside. Standard had dropped significantly since my last visit a few years ago. The sides tasted like they came out of a packet. Liked the finely shredded cabbage with black sesame sauce though. I think the restaurant has room for improvement if it wants to stand out from the heaps of similar options along this street.  Supulae has been around longer than the rest of the Korean bbq restaurants here and it should do better on their dishes. There is certainly fierce competition but Supulae needs to only not stinge on the quality then Ioyal customers like me will come back.\n",

Our favorite food is the spicy chicken feet pot and the beef rib soup.\nThe panchan\ud310\ucc2cthere are also nice and the waiter and waitress are responsive. Just that sometime they get really busy.\nIt would be really lovely to go there for a sip of the hot soup on a rainy and cold morning.\nReally like this place a lot.\n\noverall a popular place with good options of home cooking style Korean food, better to have more than 3people sharing , portion is big for 2 person, you may only get a chance to try 1 or 2 type of food. The pork and chicken dishes are big portion. Chicken feet comes with steam egg and rice balls, it\u2019s a good combination and good to share.\nCame at around 630pm on a Friday evening, it started to get very busy from 7pm.\n\nCame here on a Wednesday night at 7 p.m., and no reservations were needed. I have walked past this restaurant a few times, but I was more familiar with their nostalgic cultural Korean decorations. They moved recently to a new area along the same stretch, and it's so minimalistic now... A lot more space is catered for diners, with rooms for big groups. Side dishes was pretty okay only. Toilet is huge too!\n\n\ud83d\udca7 Water is complimentary\n\nWe ordered:\n\n\ud83d\udc14 Jjimdak ($55)\nBraised chicken in dark sauce, this dish is one of my favourites in korea. And this standard is pretty okay! Huge portion that feeds at least 4 people. Chicken could have been braised longer to have more flavour. The japchae noodles at the bottom soak up a lot of sauce, so it's quite filling, along with potatoes and carrots.\n\nI rate: 3.5/5 \ud83c\udf1f\n\n\ud83c\udf43 Minari Jun ($28)\n1st time trying Minari, and we were surprised how fresh this vegetable pancake tasted. It didn't have a celery scent and tasted rather clean. Quite flat as well. Would like it if it's bigger.\nI rate: 4.5/5 \ud83c\udf1f\n\n\ud83c\udf76 Pine Nut Draught Wine ($28)\nThe way it's served is pretty interesting! In a small vat with a wooden scoop into a shallow bowl. It was a little gassy and had a faint, nutty sweet aftertaste.\n\nI rate: 4/5 \ud83c\udf1f\n\nThis place serves very authentic Korean food. Although traditional bbq was available, no one was having that as the standout are the Korean cooked dishes. It's quite close to the Korean food I had in Korea last year. The standout is the braised short ribs. It's so tender and meat falls off the bone easily. Pair the rice with the braised sauce and it's heavenly. The radishes and carrots were so yummy too. 2nd best was the assorted pancakes. It was like no other I had tried before. There were fish, mushroom, prawns and it's so all very special. It really fills you up too. The place was not very closely packed where you're sitting shoulder to shoulder and tables well spaced apart, unlike some other Korean restaurants here. The restroom are also very clean.\n\nWent for an early dinner and was given a spacious seat for our family of 4. Ordered the barbecued pork belly and beef. They will actually sliced the meat and barbecue the meat for you so that you don\u2019t have to actually do it yourself. Ordered the beef bulgogi for the kids and the kids loved it. Not too many of non spicy options for kids though. Kimchi pancake tasted great while the cold noodles were quite soggy. Overall prices are on the higher side, especially the barbecued meats. Service can be improved, cos we waited quite long for the rice to be ready and there wasn\u2019t anyone to inform us that we have to wait for the rice.\n",

Dun get me wrong, but my experience with the food is just, like I say just ......will I be back.... there's plenty other places to try. The set I ordered was JUST, the side dishes \ud83d\ude14 but the bean paste soup is really good. I have eaten Korean food before the craze. Maybe it's better to  get \u00e0 la carte. The service is tops.\n\nRestaurant That Are Actually Worth Waiting In Line For !!\n\nExcellent service, staff were all very friendly and helpful and the service was fast too. More than anything, the food was super delicious.\n\nA restaurant I really want to recommend to Local And Korean.\n\nMy preferred spot for satisfying my Korean food cravings!\n\nTheir kimchi soup is not only incredibly delicious but also delightfully thick. The steamed egg is a real treat too.\n\nThe best part? The attentive waiter who expertly handles the grilling of all the raw foods, from pork slices to chicken slices, allowing you to relish the meal without constant grill-checking.\n\nThe only challenge is their generous portions; the set meal is quite large for two people, even for a couple like us.\n\nOn busy weekends, expect a decent wait with a long queue, but it moves surprisingly fast. We arrived around 7 pm and waited approximately 30 minutes for dinner.\n\nDespite that, I'll undoubtedly return whenever the Korean BBQ cravings strike!\n\nThe food is good, there are varieties of meat including marinated and non marinated. Server will help to cook the food for you. They provide lots of sides (7 when I counted). Had Set C which was a combination of pork and beef and complimentary steamed egg with roe and choice of soup. Only thing is the waiting time cos it could be 2 hrs and above and dining time was 90mins.\n\nHad dinner at this restaurant and definitely the top 3 Korean BBQ restaurant in Singapore \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\n\nThis gem offers good quality meat which surely justify the money paid! Their pork was tender, fresh and no gamy smell at all. Their banchan were all very delicious except for the fish cake which was too tough and thick.\n\nSteam egg is good, well seasoned and below was charred on point! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb The naengmyeon was icy cold and the broth is flavourful but not too overpowering. And it goes so well with the meat.\n\nThey provide excellent service, staff were all very friendly and helpful and the service was fast too!one thing amazed me most is the staff will keep asking if your side dishes need to be refill which you don\u2019t see it anywhere.\n\nThe atmosphere is pleasant and with Korean staff and their warm welcome, it will bring you to Korea instantly. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\n",

The chicken was great - you can get almost anything deboned which is awesome. I think we liked the cheese the best, but the garlic soy was lovely as well.\n\nI went there on a quiet Monday night, and the place was pretty empty. A perfect spot for a relaxed catch-up.\n\nWe ordered two half chicken dishes - Yangnyeom & Soy Garlic flavour, along with a japchae. The chicken surprised us with its light, crispy batter and tasty sauces. The japchae, on the other hand, was okay and also had a rather small portion size.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend this place for a casual weekday dinner with friends \ud83d\udc4d\n\nTasty chicken and light cooling beer soju. Special ice cream beer. Good place for friends to hangout after work. Not so crowded during weekdays\n\nWe randomly chanced upon this when searching for good Korean food on Google so we decided to come here for dinner. Although we made reservations, it seems like the restaurant is relatively quiet during weekday nights (we came on a Tuesday night) - but nevertheless just make reservations in case things change!\n\nWe ordered a bowl of Jjamppong and got the original fried chicken to share (attached is the menu to see the different options). Portion is decent but the food was SUPER good! Honestly, the chicken batter was perfect and it was neither too oily or salty for our liking. The jjamppong wasn't too spicy or bland - just the right balance too. They even had a decent serving of seafood.\n\nThere was only one service staff member at that time and she was super professional and smiley when taking our orders and paying the bill. The overall vibes was really cool too, with Korean music playing in the background (not too loud so you can have proper conversations without shouting at the top of your voice). All in all, I would 10/10 recommend anyone looking for good authentic Korean food in Tanjong Pagar. It is a short walk from both Outram Park and Tanjong Pagar MRT stations.\n\nOriginal boneless chicken with onion sauce ($24++ = $28) - 2.5 stars\nEnough for one person though I'm probably not a bit eater. But this made me question whether KFC really is just overpriced Kentucky Fried Chicken. The chicken was kind of ordinary, although I imagine it had more meat than you'd find at Kentucky FC (and I haven't been there in years). But the issue was probably the onion sauce, which tasted like fairly artificial and processed mustard. I much preferred the fresh Pico de gallo-like onion sauce at Chir Chir. Would not pay $28 for this again.\n\n======\n\nBoneless chicken with sweet and spicy and rice cakes - 4.5 stars\nThe boneless chicken was juicer than the bone-in chicken surprisingly. My husband, who usually prefers the latter said he would just order the boneless chicken the next time. It was my second time having Korean fried chicken - given that the last time I had something similar was probably KFC popcorn chicken decades ago, I was pleasantly surprised that there was ample meat and not just a bunch of fried batter. I liked this sauce better than the soy garlic one but it was definitely sweet and towards the end I didn't quite enjoy the sweetness. We got the medium and it was larger than we expected.\n\nSoy garlic 6 piece - 4.25 stars\nSweet sauce and could barely taste the garlic.\n\nGood place for Korean fried chicken, but personally I think the sauces are too sweet for me.\n",

Too thick and still sticky inside.\n\nSoontofu taste normal.\nBulgogi is also normal.\nLA Galbi is taste good but too expensive for it.\n\nService also not good. Need so long to get staff\u2019s attention to order. Even when we ask them to top up their side, eventually they didn\u2019t do it.\nPlus they should instruct soontofu comes with rice.\n\nOverall, to be honest, I really don\u2019t understand why Google review is over 4.\nAll dishes are overpriced for the quality.\nThere is a lot of good Korean food with reasonable price.\n\nWith three branches scattered across the island, this restaurant is renowned for its stellar tofu soup. You can take your pick from various proteins like beef, pork, or seafood. While there are alternative dishes like bibimbap or bulgogi for non-tofu enthusiasts, honestly, why would you venture here if not for the soothing allure of tofu soup? It's a must-try, deeply satisfying, and my friends who joined me even confessed that they occasionally sneak in for a solo, heartwarming meal.\n\nFamous chain from Korea. I reviewed the Millenia Walk outlet which is for dinner which i love. I came to this outlet for Lunch. Super crazy weekday lunch crowd. I was disappointed with my order of beef offal soup. The whole soup is so thick and chunky. I barely finished it. The price point is too high for a weekday lunch. I rather do dinner. The restaurant has no lack of fans. Always long queue even for weekday lunch.\n\nI have been too all 3 outlets and I personally find that this outlet staff are more friendly. First tip, try to make advance booking. I did via Chope. Very long queue during dinner time. Chope has got good deals too. Their portion is very big. I suggest if you have 2 pax, just order 1 combo and 1 side. The corn tea is very refreshing. After a hearty meal, they give free yakult. Yummy\n\nVery expensive tofu.\n\nBut I\u2019ll have to say that the Dumpling\nSoontofu by SBCD Korean Tofu House is really good! Although the serving is very small for my tummy \ud83d\ude05, the soup is  packed with flavour, mildly spicy and most importantly, served piping hot. The soup goes very well with the short grain rice. I also like the Kimchi pancake  which is pan fried to slightly charred.\n\nOverall, dinner at SBCD is a pleasant experience.\n\n\ud83d\udccd SBCD Korean Tofu House\u2028\ud83d\udccd 7 Wallich St, B1 - 01 / 02 Guoco Tower, S078884\n\n#tiramisooojiaks #jiakjiakjiak #sgfoodie #sbcd #soontofu #kimchipancake #dumplingkimchisoup #guocotower\n",

While it might be a bit on the expensive side, the fact that the staff personally cooks for you makes it entirely worthwhile.\n\nThe staff members were not only friendly but also knowledgeable about which options would best suit your taste buds.\n\nWill definitely be coming back again.\n\nTLDR: May return for the beef only\n\nType: Korean BBQ\n\nWaiting Time: 30min at 7pm on a Friday. Food took 10 minutes to arrive from the time we got a table and ordered.\n\nMust Try (\u203c\ufe0f): The meat in BBQ Set D - Ribeye, Boneless Beef Ribs, Beef Short Ribs - very flavourful\n\nGood to Try (\u2757\ufe0f): Bean Paste Stew - decent // Steamed Egg - decent\n\nDon\u2019t Try (\u274c): Cold Noodles - noodles needed another rinse as they were too starchy and the broth was bland // Kimchi Pancake - bland, thin, chewy and greasy\n\nService: Excellent - staff was polite and grilled the meat properly. They also gave us hangover tonic (see last picture), which was a nice touch.\n\nNote: The restaurant can get smoky and the smoke will get absorbed into your clothes and hair.\n\nOrdered BBQ set A with bean paste soup and a bowl of cold noodles. The service staff is very hospitable and polite despite them being super busy during dinner time. Deducting 1 star because the meat has a very smokey flavour after grilling on top of charcoal for a long time. The smokey flavour is not really my thing but idk you might like it. The ban chan selection is also not a lot. On the other hand, I really liked the bean paste soup though, it\u2019s very umami and addictive. The cold noodles are very refreshing, I really liked it\n\nTowards the end and round the corner of the Korean restaurant stretch at Tanjong Pagar, not that easy to find tbh but it was fairly quiet on a weekday evening and meats were of pretty good quality! Seafood pancake and cold noodles were AMAZING. Would come back for sure.\n\nOrdered the pork belly and pork collar, both were tender but liked the texture of the pork collar more.\n\nThe kimchi cold noodle was surprisingly good, very refreshing. While for the seafood pancake, it tasted normal (can skip)\n\nAlso would like to thanks the service crew for their excellent service. They were attentive and helped to bbq the meat even during peak period.\n",

Food was awesome and we love how friendly and attentive our server Mr Shin Young Wook and another staff that grilled our meat for us.\n\nI definitely feel so welcome here and will only come back here for Korean BBQ in the future !\n\nCompliments to all the staff !\n\nEndured more than an hour-long wait but was worth it. Though what I didn't understand about the queue is that we were asked to wait for 15 minutes and then it became more than 30 minutes. I am not sure if the one who manages the queue was tired or what. But so many groups are coming in and and I kept checking the status of my queue and it always says 1 group ahead of us. But every time someone comes in, we are never called so we ended up waiting longer. Minus one for service because of this. I do understand that we were late for around 5 minutes as we didn't here the call for the waitlist but he shouldn't have told us to wait for a certain amount and not be able to deliver it for us.\n\nBut overall, experiencing the wait firsthand, I finally get why there's a line for this spot. Meat was succulent and the rice balls are absolutely explosive in flavour. The must order from their menu. We didn't get to try jjajang coz it was a bit too much for 2 pax already.\n\nThe variety and generous portions of side dishes were plenty to satisfy me, so no need to go overboard with the ordering just like we did. Lesson learned. \ud83d\ude05 I am actually already very contented with just their side dishes.\n\nThe service was also very fast and genuine. You can really feel that the staff are accommodating you depsite the busy schedule. They are very attentive and cooks the food for you very well.\n\nOut of all the Korean restaurants in Singapore I've been to, the staffs are most kindest!! The meat is so fresh and everything from the side dishes that I could refill at any time was perfect \ud83d\ude0b Other than the meat, the food is so delicious!! It's a restaurant that makes me want to go every day \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffb\n\nThe food was delicious.. specially the bbq (Prime beef), it was really darn nice and juicy!!\n\nThe tofu stew was spicy with the right kick for taste bud..\n\nThe flying fish roe with rice was delicious and yummy!!!\n\nTotal satisfaction!!! Every item is good, Jajangmyeon, Cheese Seafood Pancake, and BBQ Pork Collar is a must.\nFood is fresh and full of umami. Kudos to the staff for being friendly and helpful. They even grill our pork to perfection and always ask what we need next.\nThe atmosphere is cozy and surprisingly the temperature is cold and comfortable despite it being a Barbecue restaurant.\nLast but not least, the food portion is generous too at the price we're paying, I would say it's affordable.\n",

We also ordered a kimchi pancake.\n\nSide dishes include radish, kimchi, garlic, coleslaw, chilli, tofu etc. Kimchi was pretty good.\n\nAll items are fresh. Staff helped us in barbecuing the items well. We really liked the spicy chicken, the sauce added a great taste. Meat was soft.\n\nGood place for Korean barbecue cravings.\n\nThis is the place if you are a meat person. We went for the buffet which was value for money. Add $5 per pax for weekends and public holiday. Service was attentive and the lady bosses were friendly too. The buffet offers 7 types of meat. We don\u2019t enjoy the Bulgogi. Go for the beef short plate, pork belly and soya chicken galbi instead. We had 3 rounds and were full. After payment, do help yourselves to complimentary Yakult alike probiotic drinks.\n",

We order set B BBQ and seafood pancake. The portion is enough for me & 2 ladies friends. The staff keep coming to check out if we needed to refill side dishes. Very generous.\nWill come back to try the cold noodles.\n\nWent on a Friday late evening and thankfully it wasn't too crowded. Ordered the mixed meat set and Kimchi pancake that comes with fluffy steamed egg and seafood tofu stew. The meat was fresh and juicy but I think could do better with a bit more flavour. Love the \"spacious\" grill where the food could be cooked properly. Service and cooking skill of the staff was good! Variety of side dishes was great too\n\nThe food is good but the service quality is even better. Every time we visit, the restaurant is full and wait time for a big group is usually around 40-60 mins. However, once you get in, you are immediately served and the staff are very attentive. I love the cold noodle, steamed egg, and marinated premier beef here ...very tasty. Always come back whenever I crave for Korean BBQ\n\nThis is my second time visiting and it\u2019s still as good! I absolutely love the food and service here. The generousity when it came to the portions and the food that is cooked by the staff. All of them seem very well trained and very prompt with their service. I\u2019m very impressed and amazed to find such good service in a Korean bbq place. It definitely sets itself apart from the rest. I like the sides such as cheesy corn and the mash potato and bean sprouts. I will be back again!\n\nCharim is always my go-to for Kbbq in Tanjong Pagar area. The service and food has always been consistent from all of my visits. I decided to do a takeout today and was pleasantly surprised when the staff handed me my stew, with this generous serving of side dishes.\n\nThank you for the great customer service!\n",

Ideal to bring your friends, colleagues and loved ones. Each bite of the food was just melting in my mouth. Highly recommended.\n\nWas there with my friends to celebrate my birthday. We ordered a few dishes, and all was very good, especially the Black Bean Mascarpone, Bossam, Galbi Jjim, Dwaeji Ppyeo Deungsim, Abalone Gim Pasta and the Strawberry bingsu. These are the most try dishes.\n\nFood was really good! If you\u2019re a fan of beef tartare, you HAVE to try this. Enjoyed a burst of flavours for this one.\n\nThe octopus was really good too, could be charred a bit more but the meat was soo tender and yummy.\n\nSeabass rice was yummy and had a pretty generous serving, though I thought the price was a little steep.\n\nService was great! The guy who served us was very attentive and had very good mannerisms.\n\nAtmosphere was a little underwhelming, especially the choice of music but not a biggie. Maybe I was just expecting something a little more fancy but it turned out to be a pretty casual place with people wearing flip flops.\n\nWe went for a birthday celebration in a big group.  The food is good.  However, towards the end, we struggle to finish, thus affecting overall dining experience.\n\nLike a lot of restaurants,  the staff lacks training in taking orders. Recommendations and estimation how much to order is actually an important skill for a good dining experience which many owners overlook.\n\nThe place is a gem. The food was amazing. I don't remember the name of the dishes but you can refer to the pictures. The kimchi with tufo and sourdough was my favourite starter. The balance between sweet salt and creamy is divine. This crispy seafood pancake also hits the spot. The crunch was perfect. The fried oysters were amazing as well. For the mains I had the seabass with burnt rice. It's great for ppl who likes caypot rice or bimbimbap. The flavour is obviously different that those dishes but the elements are similar. The many ingredients mix with crunchy rice. We also had the Abalone pasta which is refreshing if you like a cold main dish. Will visit again to try other stuff. The service staff was good as well.\n",

Overall the chicken is quite fresh & crispy the biggest issue is that even the spicy sauce is sweet. Noodles were good too & had a nice balance of sweet & savoury. Overall ok, not our favourite chicken place but good for late night fix.\n\nNice ambience. Order Chicken with cheese. It has lots of spicy tteokbokki which tasted really good. Fried chicken tasted so so, the battered is too thick, seaweed rice ball has so much rice but too little ingredients to mix with. Side dishes and jar of green tea (diluted) were given free. Steamed egg is nice. Picked up free ice cream as you exit. The price here is on the high side. Menu has wide variety.\n\nWas missing korea, but too busy to travel. Glad that I found this place online and paid a visit. Their dishes were relatively similar to the taste I recalled while I was in Korea. And got free ice cream at the end of my meal.\nFood is good. Service is good. Atmosphere can be improved but in no way bad.\n\nKnown to be the OG of Korean Fried Chicken Restaurant in Singapore which first introduced Chi-Mek (Korean Fried Chicken and Beer), Kko Kko Na Ra has recently launched a series of Crab-tastic dishes featuring fresh premium Korean Crab caught from Yeonpyeong Island on the West Sea.\n\nWe savored the essence of the Korea West Sea with their new launch \ud835\ude4e\ud835\ude4b\ud835\ude44\ud835\ude3e\ud835\ude54 \ud835\ude46\ud835\ude46\ud835\ude4a\ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude42\ud835\ude40 \ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude3c\ud835\ude49\ud835\ude42 (\ud835\ude4e\ud835\ude65\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude6e \ud835\ude46\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude63 \ud835\ude3e\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude57 \ud835\ude4e\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude6c) $85 which is the perfect hearty dish that warms the soul. The spicy broth is packed with punch with assorted vegetables, tofu and mussels.\n\nWe also had their ever satisfying \ud835\ude4e\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude6e \ud835\ude42\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude61\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude58 \ud835\ude41\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude59 \ud835\ude3e\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude60\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude63 $23 and \ud835\ude46\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude62\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5e \ud835\ude4b\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude60\ud835\ude5a $25.\n\nRare find of viral \ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude5c \ud835\ude43\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude61\ud835\ude6a that has set Korea's social media ablaze right here . For those with sweet tooth, dont miss the chance to enjoy these here. Perfect ending to our meal with Shine Muscat Grapes $5, Orange $3.80 & Mixed Fruits $3.80. Completed our meal with Green Apple CHORONG CHORONG Soju $18!\n\nSatisfied tummies & great service.\n\nWould recommend the seafood pancake, soft and crispy. Their sides were well presented and I like the pickled radish but their kimchi was a little bland in my opinion. Ordered their fried chicken and it was nice, but the kitchen or staff seemed to have forgotten our order and we had to wait longer than expected to receive our food. Fried octopus was a little chewy so it was a little tough to eat. Tea and water was complimentary and you can get a free ice cream upon leaving too (common in many Korean restaurants).\n",

Not fishy tasting. It\u2019s what they are known for.\n\nBBQ is ok, some meat a bit tough even for a pork belly.\n\nTteokbokki was done well, doenjjang jigae (soybean paste soup) tasted great and flavourful.\n\nComplementary sides were well done too, 5 dishes.\n\nTook the 2-3pax beef set which came with bean paste stew and steam egg. The portion was just nice and it is reasonably priced. The stew was really good! Also loved the fresh kimchi and radish side dish. They also gave free melona on the way out which was a nice end to the meal.\n\n- Marinated raw crabs: must order\n- Yukhoe (raw beef with egg) : must order, big portion and delicious\n- BBQ pork: skip this, you can get better cuts at other places.\n- Watermelon soju (sweet) : can order, you can barely taste any soju but that's what we wanted\n- Kimchi pancake: can order\n- kimchi pork jiggae: can order, spicy and sour delicious soup that's good for sharing\n\nDelicious and fresh crabs - got the crab set that comes with both spicy and soy sauce. I like the soy sauce but most of my friends like the spicy one. My Korean friend said that the soy sauce crabs are not that salty in Korea. Also love their side dishes.\n\nRecommend to make reservation but I also walked in on a Friday around 6.20pm and manage to get a seat.\n\nThe meat here is very good, enjoyed the pork and beef intestines a lot. Kimchi pancake and rice balls were nice too. Tuna kimchi stew and cold noodles weren\u2019t to our liking.\n",

This place definitely is one of the best or should I say the best Korean restaurant i have tasted so far. Would definitely come back when i visit Singapore. Truly was an amazing experience. If you are in Singapore, dont forget to drop by this amazing place. You wont regret it.\n\nSuper Star K used to be taster with meat more seasoned. This time, it seemed that there was a change in management. The side dishes tasted different and seemed to have a change in preparation. The potato salad doesn\u2019t taste the same anymore. The price is still quite pricey but there is a staff preparing/barbecuing the meat for us. Service is good nevertheless. It is a small restaurant.\n\nWent there for a quick dinner with my colleagues. The waiter is welcoming and polite to serve us. Guess he assume we will be getting grilled meat and put the charcoal directly for us. Initially we were planning on cooked dishes but in the end we went for the grilled meal set that include the soup and pancake. The meat is well grilled with the marinated sauce. Soup is flavourful. Pancake was soft. I like steam egg but it is a bit burnt. Overall is alright but be prepared to smell like barbecue and grill if you plan to eat this.\n\nGreat Korean BBQ spot that offers a diverse selection of fresh, high-quality meats. We had the set menu which we found was good, the unlimited sides were a pleasant surprise with even the steamed egg being part of it. Staff helped to cook all the meats which were bursting with flavor. We enjoyed our visit and would be back.\n\nGood service by the staff here. They will help you to cook your meat. Free flow sides. But it\u2019s very very expensive for a little portion. Go for it if you are rich and a small eater. They use charcoal to cook the meat, feels like an authentic kbbq place.\n",

I rarely eat Korean cuisine so I am not sure whether it's authentic or not. Ordered beef brisket with level 2 spicy. Overall the taste is good for me. The portion can feed up to 3 pax, a bit too much for 2 persons. Quite full but a bit boring towards the end because all the ingredients are rice cake related and noodles. Great and friendly staff!

Note that restaurant has split shift; closes from 230-5pm.\n\nMy dining partner and I had a private room to ourselves.\n\nWe ordered the sashimi set (noted that requirement to order the same set within the same dining group). Came with various bancha (side dishes) which we loved the abalone porridge and grilled fish. The sashimi was fresh and generous. We also ordered the spicy fish roe cold noodles which was good. Additionally, we ordered a portion of marinated crab (the boss was nice enough to allow us to order ala carte as usually the marinated crab is only available part of the set). The marinated crab was tad salty for us even with rice - not sure if it\u2019s how it supposed to taste like as it\u2019s our first time trying.\n\nThe interior of the restaurant was nicely decorated with a fake Sakura tree. The staff who served us were friendly and helpful especially the lady wait staff who took photos for us and directed us to pose - added bonus for good service!\n\nWill be back for sure!\n\nA true Korean seafood experience. A very nice quiet place that have small private cubicles that serve the full sashimi set and ends with a nice army stew soup. It taste as good as those I ate in Jeju. I came with a Korean friend and he highly recommend to try the silkworm soup which is a Korean snack that is rich in protein. I was worried at 1st but but it tasted great. Will be back again.\n\nQuite an interesting Korean sashimi restaurant, definitely a first time for me. We had the \u201cAssorted Sashimi Set\u201d(Small - S$160) which includes halibut and salmon. Sashimi is really fresh and no weird fishy smell at all. The side dishes in the set were tasty too. As to service, I think they are shorthanded, so I didn\u2019t expect too much. We are here for the food mainly.\n\nAuthentic Korean sashimi, cuisine and experience.\n\nI have never tried Korean sashimi before, and was delighted to find this place.\n\nThe seafood set for 2 pax is really worth it and so much food. Also you know its authentic when everyone around is Korean and speaking the language!\n\nWe also ordered the soy marinated crab which I had in Seoul before. Had a lovely marinate and texture, and was quite sweet.\n\nLoved the seafood porridge starter and vegetable platter that complimented the sashimi.\n\nThe corn cheese mayo was very decadent :)\n\nFirst time having marinated crab in Singapore and at with so many other dishes for a set meal for 2. Though cannot compare to Korea but the food quality is there and great value at 30+/pax. One indication of the quality is the serving of the side dish. Will be back for other menu.\n",

                  "reviews": "\n\nHeard so many rave reviews on this restaurant. They don't serve Korean BBQ on the stove on each table. They have pot dishes where they put the portable stove to heat them. I personally don't like their food because they are too skewed towards being sweet. While i know korean dishes are tend to be sweet but i think they take it overboard as compared to other korean restuarants I tried. The signature marinated soy sauce raw crab is not fantastic. Tasted better ones around Duxton before. The beef tartare seasoning is too sweet again. What is really delicious is the marinated beef ribs. That particular one, i like. The ice cold beer is also very interesting with tiny shaved ice on top.\n\nOnly service staff X 1 is serving the entire restaurant due to lack of staff. She tried her best and have good memory to remember the orders. Just poor her need to man the whole floor. We ordered several dishes. The interval of the dishes coming is inconsistent. Almost towards end of the meal then the calamari came and we were almost full by then.\n\nReally friendly staff and the ambience of the place is pleasant.\n\nI think they may be a little understaffed and so waiting time was a little longer, but the staff are really friendly! We did find the tables pretty low, but once again, the place was still nice.\n\nOrdered the soy marinated crab, wagyu tartare, oysters, truffle beef tataki, marinated beef rib, kimchi pancake and the seaweed rice balls.\n\nUnfortunately, we ordered 3 soy marinated crabs and they were all extremely fishy, much more than should be expected, even when eating raw crab or any other type of raw seafood. Presentation was beautiful, though.\n\nOther than the crab, the other dishes were generally pretty enjoyable. In particular, the oysters were very fresh, and the truffle beef tataki was done medium rare and did have truffles. The wagyu tartare was not quite what we expected - it was not like most traditional yukhoe where the seasoning is really clean and simple (mostly sesame oil, salt, at most mustard, etc.). This one has a really strong flavour and is pretty salty, if I recall, it tasted like gochujang or ssamjang I think. Fresh and worth a try.\n\nOverall, we had a good time and enjoyed most of the food.\n\nWe visited because of the hype created on SM recently on the soy crab gejang gejang. We missed the all so famous pro soy crab in Korea and decided to visit to check if it was a hit or miss.\n\nGejang gejang - I would say it is both a hit and a miss. First and foremost, it it too salty on it's own, the saltiness level can make your throat feel sick. It mixes well with the rice ball at the side and also with the sauce given. However as a gejang dish, the saltiness could be further controlled.\n\nOysters - nice, tender and juicy\n\nScallops - too much truffle essence or oil, the scallop taste is lost and as an appetizer, it was warm and not cool enough\n\nRaw prawns - not cool enough but fresh and succulent\n\nRaw beef - 1 word, spicy, too spicy to enjoy anything else\n\nOverall - not a place to rave about but for some one craving for some soy crab can visit to try it out on their own\n\nWas searching for a Korean restaurant and came across this place.\n\nFor three pax, we shared the Spicy Seafood Crab Stew, BBQ Surume Ika and Marinated Pork set, Honey Garlic Fried Chicken Wings and Corn Cheese.\n\nWould recommend the BBQ pork set and Corn Cheese! We tried the Peach Tea Soju Cocktail as well but we pretty much can\u2019t taste the alcohol. Overall, the portion of the food were rather small except for the seafood stew.\n\nThe staff were rather helpful as they offered to change our plates every-time when the plates are full. A rather cosy resturant to chill with friends over korean food!\n\nWe had a fantastic experience dinning at So Seoul Korean Dining & Bar. From the moment we walked in, we were greeted by friendly and welcoming staffs. The food was outstanding, and I particularly enjoyed the soy marinated carb. The presentation was beautiful, and the flavours were spot on. The lady boss and servers were very friendly and attentive throughout the meal but I also want to give a shout out to the bartender, Wilson.  He was personable and made fantastic drinks, taking the time to chat with us about our preferences and making recommendations based on what we like. He also went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed. I highly recommend stopping by the Bar at So Seoul Korean Dinning & Bar and chatting with Mark for a while. Overall, it was a great experience, and I can\u2019t wait to go back.\n",

However the chicken was a bit bland and not worth it to be honest.\n\nWould definitely come back here again.\n\nStaff are also friendly and helps you to cook the meat.\n\nA little understaffed here! But generally the atmosphere is comfortable and the food are of high quality! The buffet is great and have awesome variety! I like that japchae is also part of their banchan, making the whole experience very memorable!\n\nLove the modern South Korean design and aesthetics. The meat was alright, wasn\u2019t the best I\u2019ve tasted but it was good. Our bill came to a total of SGD220, despite the buffet claiming to be SGD35/pax (there were 4 of us); we did order a stew and rice, but that shouldn\u2019t account for the vast difference. Service was good.\n\nOverall it was a good experience, will come again!\n\nThe quality of the food we had, particularly the pork, was absolutely exceptional. The succulent and flavorful taste of the grilled meat left us craving for more. It was evident that great care had been taken in sourcing high-quality ingredients and ensuring their preparation was done with expertise. The combination of flavors and the overall taste surpassed our expectations. Thank you!\n\nI\u2019ve ordered jokbal, spicy jokbal and samgyetang. Very good service, during order and after service as well.\nThe food delivery on time, food portion is huge, and they are really generous with the banchan as well.\nBoth jokbal and spicy jokbal are very delicious, manage to satisfy my cravings. My kids enjoy the samgyetang. Will definitely order again. Best of all, customer service is top notch, one of a kind. You have won yourself a loyal customer.\n",

The waiter and waitress helped to bbq. The pan Chan were all very nice. And the soy bean paste soup was super super delicious.\nAnd in addition my hubby like the environment it was very spacious.\n\nSep 2023\nThe first impression we walked in here was the place was very smoky & stuffy. The smoke filter hoods were too tiny. The meats were not marinated at all & tasted really bland.  Only the marinated short ribs was ok. The Korean fried chicken was completely tasteless. For the price tag, I will say it is not worth the value.\n\nNov 2023- We came back a second time because we had unused Chope vouchers . We ordered all marinated meat & they were better.  I\u2019d say they salvaged themselves from getting 1 or 2 stars.\n\n2nd visit to Daejim! First visit last month was to try the BBQ sets which were not bad - fresh meats but felt that the meats could be better marinated. Kimchi soup was great, very flavourful. The steamed egg was super good too! However the pancake was rather disappointing for a Korean food place :(\n\nToday\u2019s visit - tried the spicy stir fried squid+pork belly. Sauce was delicious! Bimbimbap was decent. Steamed egg today felt a little over cooked unfortunately. Spicy tofu soup came with generous servings of mussels and calms.\n\nService staff are nice (both visits, there are only 2 service staff but they were attentive). Remember to get your complimentary icecream after your meal too!\n\nSides dishes tasted good, will be more awesome if there are more choices \ud83d\ude06\nGejang size slightly small compared to the ones in Korea. However, is not as salty as other place in SG.\nHoney makgeoli, they did not open the bottle infront of us and cant really taste the honey unless, you smashed the honey, but you get slight honey taste. Their original fried chicken is quite tasteless with the meat itself and the deep fried flour.. and the flour is quite flour (this can give it a pass).\n\nNice Korean bbq. Very friendly service. Value for money with Chope deal. The raw crab pak really well with seaweed rice, a must try when you visited this restaurant. Tried the BBQ beef set and Pork/Beef BBQ set, both are good as well. Oh and they also give us free ice cream \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude0a\n",

In fact most of the dishes portion is relatively small for that price range.\n\nService experience is also under expectation. We sat at a place with a blind spot and the service staff are not attentive to our request. I have to walk to the counter for help. Suggest to provide some electronic buzzing system if the restaurant has under staff to serve the customer.\n\nCame across this place via Google search.\nSuppose to come here for DimSum. But only available in the afternoon.\nBut we still decided to stay for dinner.\n\nFood is not bad, very well presented. Taste is pretty ok especially the chicken and the laksa prawn.\n\nBut when comes to the service by the restaurant staff, I gotta give them a lower rating. It certainly under expectations.\n\nFirstly, they are not welcoming at all when we were at the counter waiting to be seated.\n\nSecondly, the waiter is not attentive. They have no smile at all (which is important in service line).\nWhen we request for tea or request him to add hot water, he just came and grab the teapot and go off with super monotonous attitude. When we say thank you, the staff don't even response at all (basically like a robot).\n\nTherefore, I don't think we will come back again. The food is ok but definitely not the best compare to the same level restaurant elsewhere. Also the service staff and their attitude didn't impress us despite the restaurant is not busy at all (only 3 tables including our table).\n\nCame for lunch, excellent staff service and quality food.

The \"cross bridge mi xian\" stands out, offering a delightful mix of ingredients. What sets it apart is the choice: you can either assemble the components in the hot soup yourself or have the kitchen take care of it. This interactive element enhances the overall dining experience, making it a notable option for those exploring the diverse culinary scene at Bugis Junction.\n\nCame here for a sat lunch and the shop was less than half full. Ordered the signature hong guo which can either come  all in one bowl or with the ingredients individually plated. Honestly, it doesnt really make any difference cos u will need to dump everything in. But if u are here for the social media post, go ahead to order it seperately.\n\nTaste wise, the soup was quite salty for me which is probably becos of the shrimp paste (?). I actually prefered the fried rice more which had the wok hey. The cutlet was ok too.\n\nIt will be a nice place for a casual lunch and i honestly may come back again.\n\n\"I have been dining here since 2008 and it has remained one of my favorite places to eat. The Vermicelli Noodles are consistently outstanding, boasting an amazingly soft texture. The ribs were also quite tasty. In the past, they used to accommodate extra noodle requests, but unfortunately, that service is no longer available. However, I'm delighted to see that they have expanded their menu with the addition of many other delectable dishes.\"\n\nI have the 9 dish cross bridge vermicelli set . It\u2019s a very big bowl of soup, the ingredients are in very small plates.\nThe soup is so much that can\u2019t finished.\nOverall a good experience and the staff are very friendly.\n\nLove their cross bridge vermicelli. The price is very reasonable. And I usually just order their vermicelli but not other dishes. So I can\u2019t say much about the taste. But if you like vermicelli, you should not miss Hongguo! I think the restaurant has been here for more than a decade! I remember I first visited it many many years ago\u2026\n",

                  "reviews": "\n\nFirst time trying. Definitely a good one. Not a spice-tolerant person but the fish and soup were really delicious before the rest of the spice mixed in. Then it was too spicy for me. But the food was really good. The drink portion was really big too for a single person. Atmosphere was good too, but my one complaint is that some of the staff members were behind our table talking loudly and laughing, I think while on their break. It felt a bit intruding for my family dinner but it's a small issue as it was only for a short while.\n\nThis place is a great option for enjoying fried fish in town. The initial taste is fantastic, but it can become a bit salty over time.\n\nThe prices are on the higher side too.\n\nIf you're planning to dine with a group of 8 people, be aware that this outlet doesn't have a dedicated large table. They usually merge two smaller tables, which might still feel quite cramped for a party of that size.\n\nLove the location. The fish we ordered is limbo fish with soy sauce based. The sauce however is too thin for our liking. The cucumber cold fish is good.\n\nService wise, is good. Friendly staffs. Their drinks are unique.\nMaybe will come back again to try out their signature flavoured fish. Nice renovation decor.\n\nFood is nice n not too spicy. Service is great, responsive n patient, drinks were served immediate at request for me n my thirsty peers! Nice touch to have tissue pack given at each table too. A good place to chat and dine! We had a great time!\n\nWe dropped by Tanyu@Bugis Junction to celebrate a birthday: our very first visit (even though we are not totally  fish fans).\nSeating and interior decor was comfy and functional. Some guests in the packed house were in highly celebratory mood, some rather loquacious and loud. Generally, the ambience was youthful and energetic.\nIn particular, the attending staff were exemplary in service and interfacing with us: offering helpful and tactful suggestions and ideas (patiently without being presumptuous or pushy) on menu items, side-dishes, satay-style grilled meats, fish options, types of sauces and flavours, accompanying ingredients, preferred spiciness levels etc\nWe ordered the Sauerkraut Grilled Limbo-fish (a specie of the catfish family), instead of the Seabass or Qingjiang fish (also a cat-fish); together with some side-dishes.\nThe grilled fish was thoroughly enjoyable: it was rather juicy, tender and delicious (and, of course, totally fresh), although some parts tasted \"fishy\" and had a few very fine fish bones as well. Caution recommended .\nThe Jumbo Lemon and Lime (Tower) was memorable for us, as it was truly a big jar, able to quench our thirst adequately!\nIf you like to eat fish, then obviously, you'd likely enjoy an outing to Tanyu!\n",

When we arrived, we have informed the staff about our reservation, the waitress didn't  brother to listen properly and showed us the way to the normal rectangular table for 4 adults, as the space is rather small, she told us to put the baby pram  outside the restaurant(we have no idea where to put because the entrance is rather small), at this point of time, we have only 3 adults + 1 child, and waiting for the last person to arrive.\n\nShortly after, when we are still deciding what to eat, the waitress came over to rush us to place order. One of the order, we selected 4x soups that served individually for 1pax, She comment that our 2year old child cannot finish the soup. I told her we have 4 adults, and like to order on behalf of him.\n\nAt the same time, we realised that she only gave us 3 sets of cutleries +1set for our kid. While waiting for our order, I was browsing the promotion offer from the acrylic stand on the table, the waitress wearing a blazer passed by told me that the promotion has expired, not sure why it was still displaying on the table though. The way she speak is as if we can't afford to pay for the food. Some of us are wearing work uniform, and the rest is t-shirt and shorts, I'm not sure if this part of discrimination against consumer or not. We've also requested for a baby chair, and she pointed that the chair is over there, we have to take ourselves.\n\nAt 7.40pm, she called my sister who is the one who make the booking earlier today, she pick up the call and found out that they reserved round table for us and we were at the wrong table.\n\nFurious of the poor attitude, my sister scolded the person over the phone(which turns out to be the same woman wearing the blazer) and we even made sacarstic remarks such as asking them if they think we cannot afford to dine in there?\n\nAfter all the commotion, we agreed to switch to the round table, and the baby chair was automatically placed at the round table. Eventhough they did apologize, my sister has repeatedly mentioned that we made a reservation, but not too sure why this kind of mistake are made. This is a well known and established restaurant, this kind of mistake shouldn't be happening.\n\nAfter all food is served, my niece doesn't like the fried rice, so we order a warm soya bean milk for her. The waiting time is long, we also request for a straw, and we have to ask several times.\n\nAlmost every week, I have the habit of visiting restaurant for a treat to myself or gathering during my off day.\n\nThis is my first time encountering this kind of rude attitude and it is happening in morden day in Singapore.\n\nTo be honest, all these action were uncalled and it ruined the atmosphere of the gathering with my niece.  It is really a horrible experience, this is our first but definitely our last time at the bugis branch.\n\nCame for the Xiao long bao buffet. The staff inside were ok, only the service manager was really really sweet. You have to finish the noodles before you can put in the order for the Xiao long bao. The best part of everything was the cucumber dish. I will go back just for that\ud83d\ude0d\n\nEver been to any Crystal Jade Branch in Singapore.\nBut this one is the one who has the poorest service.\nFood is definitely good and delicious.\nEven my 2 years old kids love their Lamian and Fried Rice \ud83e\udd70\n\nCrystal Jade is the place I love to go for their xiao long bao and noodles.\n\nI tried their pancake. It's nice for the crispy texture but a little on the salty side.\n\nThe rice in the hotpot is very tasty. I like the texture of the rice, which is like Claypot rice. The peanut is crispy and nice.\n\nThe appetiser is a cold dish that is crunchy and quite tasty. Initially, I wanted to do without, but after the promotion by the lady saying it's what Emperor eats in the past, I decided to give it a try, and it's not bad.\n\nI enjoyed their pomelo tea. It's sweet and just nice for me.\n\nThe seats are spacious and comfortable. It's also not very crowded in this outlet.\n\nStaff responds pretty fast to my request.\n\nLatest review:\nI come back 3 times and had the pork soup dumplings and they were good. For some reason the 1st was maybe an outlier that day? Also good was the green beans, vegetable dumplings and hot & sour soup. I\u2019ve changed my previous rating from a 3 to a 4 star. However, I would skip the crab dumpling which lacked flavor.\n\nOlder Review:\nI was disappointed with this place. I've had many soup dumplings before and was looking forward to this Michelin Star reputation. So when I bit into these dumplings only to taste mildly flavored soup, I thought \"what was the point\"? By itself, it doesn't stand out. With the black vinegar and ginger sauce provided it loses out its flavors. The same could be said for the Fish Maw soup. It is so mild that you wonder why such a long title was used? You can't taste the ham, dried scallop, winter melon or really anything else in this soup. The only thing that wasn't disappointing was the chili dumplings. Overall, an average meal with above average prices.\n",

Tried Signature Noodles and Barley Drink, both a good starting point\n\nThe store is located at Bugis Street facing Bugis Junction near Bugis+ side. Friendly staff greets warmly and suggests suitable seats. Order and pay seamlessly via the QR code on the table, with a quick waiting time until your food is served. The noodle is very nice flavors, especially their specialty noodles. Reasonably priced and highly recommended!\n\nQQ Noodle House is a decent spot for a quick and affordable meal in the area. The standout feature of this place is their springy and tasty noodles, which come with a range of sauce and noodle options to choose from. However, the portion size is quite small, which might not be enough for some customers.\n\nUnfortunately, the quality of the food has dropped compared to previous years. I tried the dry noodle recently, and it was disappointingly dry, with too little sauce to coat all the layers of noodles. The crispy wanton was still decent, though.\n\nAside from the noodles, they also have side dishes available. However, the dining experience is let down by the dirty and greasy tables, and the utensil tray that was not clean. The restaurant itself is a bit run down, with peeling table tops (as seen in the provided photo).\n\nDuring my visit, I was also given a corner table that was placed too closely together with another table, making it hard to exit. Luckily, I was skinny enough to squeeze through the gaps, but others may find it uncomfortable.\n\nOverall a good option for those looking for a quick and affordable comfort meal, but the drop in food quality and unclean dining environment can be a bit of a letdown.\n\nFood was easy to order via the clear QR code on the table or via the menu. The package sets made it fuss free especially for people who are spoilt with choices. I ordered the Kolo mee, the portion was not a lot for a guy but the chosen side crabmeat soup made up for it.\nSome of the service staff seem to have quite a strong accent that the mandarin might be difficult for some Singaporeans to understand.\nStore set up was neat, tidy, and clean. Gave a simple and minimalist feel of dropping by for a non-extended meal, consume it, and leave.\n\nwanton mee noodle texture is not as q as I've expected, glass noodle has wok smell and tasty but expensive($8), bkt has strong herb taste but the meat is very tough.\n",

However, their kitchen will not cut the items into smaller pieces. Some of them can be difficult to chew.\nThe soup booth is good, drinkable but gets thirsty afterwards.\nThe store is bright and air-conditioned.\n\nThe quality of ingredients is high. The beef broth mala soup is quite tasty and the medium spice is not overly spicy. Be sure to ask for extra soup. The dry mala is terrible and flavorless.\n\nLocated just infront of Bugis+. This is one of place for you who looking to eat spicy mala. Price by weight regardless meat or vegetable. Recommend not to take so many, as the price could be expensive. Option tomato soup available for those who dont eat spicy. Normal service by staff. Self service Sauce available at sauce corner. Paynow accepted. Disposable apron also available if you are required. Food was not bad. Sometimes could be long queue during peak hour.\n\nTried the bone mala broth. The food quality is good and the soup is very thick and full of flavor. It is not susprising that they are the biggest chain in the world. To me, it is on par with Zhang Liang, which is another famous chain.\n\nSpecial mention: the meat balls are very good and juicy!\n\n$15 for a 400g+ of food. Meat and veg are all the same price.\n\nNo service charge \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb.

The restaurant was full but fortunately we waited for only around 10 minutes.   Was quote sceptical because I saw many foreigners and thought this could be tourist trap.  I was wrong,  the claypot pig liver is super delicious and the braise fish head is so flavourful.  This is indeed a very good Cantonese restaurant.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for Chinese restaurant with amazing food and friendly service, look no further than this hidden gem. I recently had the pleasure of dining at this spot and was blown away by the quality of their dishes.\nThe beef meat teow with wok hey was outstanding. Beef was so tender and portion size was generous, even for the smallest option on the menu.\nNext up was the roasted duck, which was an absolute standout. The skin was perfectly crispy and meat was tender and flavorful.\nFinally, I have to mention the cereal prawn ball, no hassle at all in removing the shell and  flavorful prawns.\nRestaurant was the friendly and welcoming atmosphere.\nIf you\u2019re in the mood for some truly Chinese cuisine, look no further than this spot.\n\nCame here because of the online reviews and  partly we were nearby. The foods are hit and miss. Can order the fried beef kway teow, vegetable and home-made tofu. Will not recommend the Indonesia curry chicken and the roast duck, roast pork and char siew combo.\n\nFood is served quick and they are delicious! Place can be loud sometimes due to the occasional loud talking and laughing by other customers but I would definitely recommend coming here for the food.\n\nWhilst visiting Singapore, my friend took me to lunch at his favourite cantonese restaurant. I can understand why - friendly, warm service and absolutely delicious food served with a smile. The fried rice, sweet and sour pork and special tofu were particularly  notable - all of the plates went back to the kitchen absolutely clean\n",

I especially appreciated that the dishes were not too spicy.\n\nThe restaurant is very popular, especially on the weekends, it can be difficult to get a table without a reservation, and the wait can up to 30 mins.\n\nHowever, if you are willing to eat outside, you may be able to get a seat sooner.\n\nAlso, the restaurant is a lively place, with lots of noise.\n\nMy favorites\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\nDry-fried pork intestines\nDried tofu slices with preserved pork\n\nSuper eating this place. Similar to the Mosque Street outlet, the service is great, and the food is consistently amazing. Would be back to try the other dishes. Many tables ordered soups and we will do that in our next visit :) *Must try the lamb* featured in the photos below. DELICIOUS.\n\n3 of us went there during lunch time and we ordered 3 dishes to share. The fried tofu is crispy on the outside, soft on the inside = taste score 3.8/5. The eggplants are soft and the sauce is flavorful, makes an excellent dish to just eat with rice = taste score 4.2/5. The abalone mushroom chicken soup is not oily, there are 4 pcs of abalone that is thumb size big but it was very tough to chew, taste like a simple mushroom + chix soup = taste score 3.5/5. Overall experience 4/5.\n\nI recently had the pleasure of dining at a remarkable Hunan cuisine restaurant (Xiang's Signature Hunan Cuisine), and the experience left me thoroughly impressed. From the moment I stepped in, I could tell it was going to be a memorable meal.\n\nFirst and foremost, the food was exceptional. Hunan cuisine is known for its bold, spicy flavors, and this restaurant certainly delivered. Each dish was a burst of exquisite tastes and perfectly balanced spices. From the fiery Mapo Tofu to the succulent Orange Chicken, every bite was a delightful adventure for the taste buds.\n\nThe service was equally commendable. The staff was attentive, courteous, and well-versed in the menu, offering helpful recommendations and ensuring a smooth dining experience. They made us feel genuinely welcome.\n\nThe restaurant's ambiance added to the overall appeal. It had an elegant yet cozy atmosphere, making it ideal for both intimate dinners and larger gatherings. The tasteful decor and comfortable seating contributed to a pleasant dining environment.\n\nWhile the prices were slightly on the higher side, the quality of the food and the overall dining experience justified the cost. In fact, I was so impressed that I visited this establishment twice during my stay, and I'm already looking forward to my next visit. If you appreciate exquisite Hunan cuisine, impeccable service, and a pleasant dining environment, this restaurant is an absolute must-try.\n",

Thankfully, it lived up to our expectations. We visited on a weekday around 2 pm, and the short queue quick service. The soup was excellent, featuring fresh sliced fish with quality close to perfection.\n\nBeen visiting for 15 years. Used to be one of my fav fish steamboat , however yest visit I felt that they have cut down portion quite a fair bit. Even taste have changed and soup was more diluted.  I can understand raising raw ingredients cost but if trying to scrimp on ingredients and affect the taste I think it is not worth it anymore.\n\nThere were 3 of us and we were seated at the end of the middle row. It was very cold and ac was blowing right above us. Requested for change of seat to one of the corner table after I saw 3 pax leaving but was rejected saying the tables are meant for 5-6 pax. Requested staff to change us to other empty table's were also faced with similar replies.\n\nOrdering also took quite a while as shop seems to be shorthanded . One staff looking after the front door while another one in and out of kitchen and disappeared again. Tried to wave for staff to order but they saw us and ignored us. Quite disappointing.\n\nAfter we finished our food, the two empty tables that were supposed to be waiting for the 5-6 people were still empty throughout our entire meals. Not sure why you prefer to wait for \"unknown potential customer than ensure your current paying customer is comfortable in your store.\n\nConsidering the service and the drop in standard, unlikely to visit again.\n\nThis is a repeat visit for us, we have come before and enjoyed the food. But today we concluded that it won\u2019t be a place we will deliberately want to come back. Food is not bad, fish slices are thick and plump. Soup is good but not great like before. Food is fairly priced, considering the shop, Aircon. We would give 4 stars except that the staff are all so gloomy. Not sure if this is the outcome of an old establishment left solely in the hands of employees without affiliation.\n\nIf you love to eat fish soup, this you must try. Always long Q, unless u go off peak hours like before 6pm or go Q at before they open.\n\nToday i order their fishhead bee hoon soup, if u think like me that fish head mainly all bones then u are wrong. It got alot of meat & it taste yummy.\n\nYou can try their slice fish and fried fish been hoon soup if you prefer to have just meat, they have fish head/fish slice steamboat too\n\nVery nice fried rice and tomato egg. Fish soup noodle was not bad for the price. Hearty meal overall\n",

Came around 11pm.\nBut food varies greatly. We used to order the papaya soup. But today is just really bland. It is terrible. Nissan dry noodles taste great but the beef is really dry. Carrot cake is just soft. No crisp. Good flavors though. Nice milk tea ^^ Recommend the fried bean curd skin under dim sum. It is delicious. Give one more star due to service level. The food really came out fast.\n\nFood was delivered on a reasonable waiting time.\nthe Filipino lady server was quick and efficient at her work, constantly doing follow up on drinks and food order.\n\nthey missed out our 2nd round order of spare ribs. we ended up just doing a refund for it coz we've been waiting for awhile.\n\nFirst time order \"Pork olive fried rice\", the pork is tender and juicy,  hard to find other place with this standard.\n\nPlease avoid Wanton Char siew noodle,: the char siew and wanton is below standard.\n\nGive the service full mark: the cafe short of man power and only the guy (maybe the manager) run the whole show, he still remain friendly and patience.\n\nI recently tried the Xin Wang Hong Kong Cafe, and I have to say, it left much to be desired. There's virtually no service beyond them bringing your food because it's an IQ code order system. Unfortunately, the food doesn't come close to what you'd expect from a good Hong Kong cafe. It was so bland that I didn't even bother taking pictures for my review. I took one photo while we eating only. I wouldn't recommend it to fellow foodies or anyone who loves Hong Kong cafe.\n\nThe food was good, but not exceptional. The siu mei, sweet and sour pork, spare ribs, and baked chicken curry rice were tasty, similar to what I had when we lived in Hong Kong. Unfortunately, our experience was marred by the young lady who handled seating arrangements. She lacked courtesy and insisted on not giving tables even if they weren't reserved and there was no queue. It's a pity, as better service could have made the experience much more enjoyable.\n",

Do not order this on the menu ever. Walk 20 more steps to the coffee shop in front of mookata. \u725b\u5c0f\u4e8cbeef noodle is only $6.50 with generous portions of beef. Go there instead.\n\nWas introduced to this place by a friend. We tried their mala (medium spicy level) and their skewers.\n\nThe mala was not too spicy for medium level and the skewers were lightly seasoned (not too salty).\n\nLove the wallet - friendly price as total bill costs about $32 for 2 pax, which is considered cheap for the items we ordered including beer.\n\nGot there at 6pm, just randomly look for a dinner place. 2 storeys, ground and basement, with lift.\nThe \u70e4\u4e32mostly $1 (lamb, pork, beef and chicken), quite affordable. Taste wise can be better, still edible.\nDishes wise abit limited compare the other main China restaurants. The chicken cold noodle not bad, more vinegar taste.\nBeer have buy 3 free 1, $6 per bottles.\nFood wise can see they mainly sell mala, by weight according to choices. I would try it next time as alot order for their mala.\n\nAbsolutely one of the best Mala places in Singapore! Definitely a must-try place!\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0b\n\nIt\u2019s always so yummy!

Sure, this is not an authentic Taiwanese beef noodle - but I loved it.\n\nI alternate in between Lenu and a local food court beef noodle. Both has its own attraction and I would give high points to this. Ask the server for chilies - goes well with the soft tofu.\n\nSurprisingly excellent for what (and where) it is. Very efficient service, ideal for quick solo diners and groups alike.\n\nLiked:\n- The beef combination bowl is excellent. Generous servings, snappy lamian, tender meat. Nothing to complain about.\n- Tofu with century egg as a side.\n- Chili crisp. They don\u2019t provide this by default but they should. Not sure if it\u2019s out of a bottle but it\u2019s an essential condiment.\n\nLast visited in Mar 2023\n\nBeen to place a couple of times for lunch. The food is quite good and the service is very fast. On both occasions, I did not have to wait for for a long time for the food to arrive. I\u2019d recommend people to try out any of the pork noodle dishes. The scallop noodle dish is also good. You\u2019ll have the option to choose a less or more spicy option for your serving. On average, you\u2019ll spend around $15-16 per person if you don\u2019t go for a combo meal.\n\nAll in all a very decent lunch or dinner option if you\u2019re in Bugis Junction. Would definitely recommend this place to people.\n\nfresh and tender beef slices with perfectly cooked ramen noodles, broth is light but very fragrant and flavourful. checks off all boxes of a proper bowl of noodles.\n\nI\u2019ve been to this noodle chain many times before in multiple locations, and I\u2019ve always been satisfied with my meals!\n\nI love that they have a range of prices, so even if you\u2019re on a tighter budget, you can still have a great meal. My favourite is by far the vegetable pork wonton noodles, with the la mian. The noodles are chewy and the broth is rich and silky, topped off with juicy wontons. As a plus, there\u2019s a tea time set inclusive of a drink and a side for only $13. I ordered a garlic fungus side, which was pretty mid since I don\u2019t quite enjoy an overwhelming taste of raw garlic. The braised tofu was pretty good though. On another note,  I also love the dry noodles and century egg tofu side when available.\n\n- a broke college kid\n",

                  "reviews": "\n\nExploring the mazy Bugis Junction in search of dinner options, discovered an authentic Chinese restaurant with a stupendous anniversary deal! We were attracted by the attractive promotional prices as we walked past.. who can resist $9.90 grilled fish \ud83d\udc1f , $9.90 baby lobsters \ud83e\udd9e?!? \ud83e\udd24 What swept us off our feet was that the food was actually generous in portion, and really delicious! The grilled fish was meaty, the meat was succulent and perfectly matched the savoury green chilli gravy. Top notch grilled fish that can easily rival Tanyu. The baby lobsters was immensely flavoured by the Mala gravy, and eating it while shucking the gravy was a delightful experience. The portion was decent, and absolutely no complain at this promo price. We also ordered tomato omelette which was fluffy and tasty. Of course, nothing completes grilled fish like ice cold beer \ud83c\udf7a. The food serves here are authentic and sumptuous, and made us crave for the other dishes on their menu. All in one, we would like to return frequently.. but honestly without the promotional discounts their usual prices are on the steep side. Highly recommend :)\n\nI encountered this restaurant while passing by and decided to give it a try.\n\nThis place isn't friendly for diners who don't eat pork, so I tried a few dishes that don't contain pork.\n\nThe lamb rack were decent, but there was too much chili, which affected the natural flavor of the lamb. Of course, this heavy seasoning might be an attempt to mask the lack of freshness in the ingredients. The best fresh lamb rack are typically found in Mongolian-style cuisine, and some Sichuan restaurants also do a good job such as chuanyangji. Not all Sichuan restaurants struggle with lamb rack.\n\nEel is quite unique and not commonly seen in other Chinese restaurants. However, stir-frying the eel without chilli is a good way to bring out the eel's natural flavor.\n\nThis restaurant might be suitable for diners with less sensitive taste buds or those who prefer milder flavors. The service is good.\n\nTried this place for the first time, their grilled fish is very tasty and fresh. The host wasn't lying when she recommended to get the \u9c7c\u9999\u8089\u4e1d to go with rice, it was one of the best I've ever eaten. Strongly recommend to come and try.\n\nSauerkraut fish and frog are nice and not too oily like most Chinese eateries. But all food items are very steep thus not value for money. Avoid the beef pot with carrot and potato, I wasn\u2019t able to eat a whole single piece of the beef brisket. Either tough tendon or coarse meat. (Refer to pic) Whole pot of beef was wasted. We only ate the carrot n some potato. Nice gesture they gave us 10% discount for whole meal.\n\nBest Sichuan restaurant I've had in Singapore! EVERYTHING is delicious.\n\nThe grilled frog tasted super fresh. It was spicy but not overpowering. The cold noodles are springy and chewy. All their signature dishes are outstanding.

Fish was grilled quite nicely, texture was smooth and easy to eat without much bones. \u4e2d\u8fa3 was quite spicy, so please be warned if you can\u2019t take \ud83c\udf36\ufe0f. If you\u2019re feeling famished, go for the buffet option as you get free flow of side dishes such as fried mantou, pork belly, chicken, chilli oil wantons and much more.\n\nThey actually grill the fish here, not those kind that fry the fish.\n\nChoose the barramundi and it was a nice size and seemed fresh.\n\nOrdered \u4e2d\u8fa3/medium spiciness and is tolerable.\n\nCan select the other ingredients to accompany your fish.\n\nAlso ordered the \u53e3\u6c34\u9e21/mouth watering chicken which was good.\nGood valance of vinegar and spice.\n\nGood service from staff and there's enough space between tables so it didn't feel cramped.\n\nFelt like it was a bit pricey, but my Chinese friends tell me it's worth the price.\n\nDefinitely one of my favourite restaurant go for dinner/ supper with my friends, the staff there are amazing, friendly and flexible for any adhoc request from us. We always order the patin grilled fish as the portion and taste is super yummy \ud83d\ude0b !\nRecommended to anyone who no idea where to go for supper, here is the place!\n\nVery nice grilled fish but was super disappointed and disgusted by the lotus root that we paid 4.80 for. Enquired the waiter and he said it was oxidised. The look of it make our appetite die down. We also ordered their paradise iced fruit tea and it tasted very bland, 0% sweetness so we requested for sugar syrup. To our disappointment, they said they do not have sugar syrup. Also disappointed by the service, it was hard to ask for the waiter to refill the soup / serve us the food as there was only 2 staffs serving the upper floor.\n\nTrying out the grilled fish that I heard so much and see publicity. Ordered a steamed fish,  mala chicken.  Not bad.  Find the fish base soup a bit salty.\n",

The ambiance is pristine, complemented by refreshing air conditioning throughout the indoor seating area. Our party indulged in both Mala Tang (soup) and the dry mala dishes, and while both were enjoyable, the dry variant stood out as particularly delectable.\n\nWe had an awesome Mala (dry one), super delicious.

Shirley, Maggie and Chin Chin were amazing hosts, recommending dishes and ensuring that we were well taken care of.\n\nGreat place for your family dinners. I will definitely come again soon! :)\n\nShirley, Maggie and ChinChin service were impressive. Very attentive in service and clearing plates. Chef also put on a goof fire show for the pork dish. Every item served was explained well. They also provided a cake from my mum\u2019s birthday.\nMany thanks to the team!\n\nThe menu at Man Fu Yuan is a celebration of exquisite Chinese cuisine, and it showcases the artistry and passion of the talented chefs. The array of dishes offered caters to various palates, ensuring there's something to delight everyone. Whether you're a fan of traditional favorites or seeking innovative culinary creations, this restaurant has it all.\n\nThe service at Man Fu Yuan deserves special mention. The staff members were attentive, knowledgeable, and passionate about their craft. They took the time to explain each dish, offering valuable insights into the flavors and ingredients. Their attention to detail and genuine enthusiasm contributed to the overall exceptional dining experience.\n\nThe ambiance of the restaurant is sophisticated and elegant, with tasteful decor and comfortable seating. The soothing background music added to the overall relaxing atmosphere, creating the perfect setting for a special evening with loved ones or an important business gathering.\n\nMan Fu Yuan Restaurant is a gem that should not be missed. From the exquisite cuisine to the impeccable service and delightful ambiance, every aspect of this dining establishment exceeded my expectations. Whether you're a connoisseur of Chinese cuisine or simply seeking an exceptional dining experience, I highly recommend visiting Man Fu Yuan Restaurant. It is an indulgence for the senses and a culinary journey that will leave a lasting impression.\n\nService is good there, the 6 courses meal will get 5 stars if not because of the lobster with crispy rice noodle dish. While the lobster is fresh and the texture good, the noodle spoilt the dish with the fried noodle taste like rancid oil, disappointed. Other than this dish, all other dishes are up to standard. Recommended the Man fu yuan appetizer.\n\nCelebrating my daughter birthday Food was awesome. Was serve by a very friendly and attentive staff named Maggie Yong. She was so attentive in her details and ensuring the celebration of my daughter birthday a success one\n",

The man tou was grilled quite well, crispy outside, but the inside was too dry. If inside is softer then would be better\u2026 And also the place was too noisy and crowded so can\u2019t hear each other well. But overall the food was nice\n\nFirst time there during lunch time, not that crowded. Like their food and they do have the BBQ plate on each table therefore the bbq skewers will place on top and food still be hot even if u eat later. Although varieties not as much but overall i will still go as it is a nice place to eat \u70e4\u4e32. I love their potatoes, toasted bread, \u51c9\u62cc\u9762, will go try more next time. Best to make reservation as dinner time and weekends normally fully book.\n\nPreviously was at the East Coast outlet, tried the Bugis outlet this time. Did not choose any premium options (the difference was the kind of topping on the meat) but food was still good! Each stick was $1.60 on average. The waiters don\u2019t \u2018introduce\u2019 the meats so we had to deduce ourselves if we were eating beef/pork/mutton.\n\nThe mutton was very tender and we enjoyed it the most! Shishamo (fish) was also enjoyable, very nicely grilled. The bun was v generous and lightly salted, which I enjoyed. Nice vibes, got crowded after 7pm.\n\nWent there for late dinner on Tuesday night was not crowded. Food service was fast. Food was rather good will be great if there are more selection other den bbq food.\n\nI finally have a change to try China-style grilled skewers. They serve a smorgasbord of choices - 50 type of skewers (note: I order more than 20 types of them) that served with grill-box-on-the-table. They also include other dishes, e.g. Shredded cucumbers, cold noddles, cold bean curd, etc.; and wide variety of beers (note: I took green tea instead\u2026 too many oily foods \ud83d\ude43). Well, my favourite food: grilled beef tendon, baked sweet corn, grilled enoki mustard, grilled potato chips,grilled premium lab ribs and many more\u2026The place environment is decent. But, the service is good as the staff are friendly and they are able to converse mostly Mandarin and understandable English. The orders usually take about 10 minutes waiting time which deserved a 4-star from me.\n",

The food was amazing and service was impeccable. I asked if I could order only one glass of barley because it came in a jug but they told me that they charge per jug, hence I didn\u2019t order the drink at all. However, several minutes later, the server comes with a glass of iced barley FOC, I was super grateful!! \u263a\ufe0f My partner and I might have found our new spot for china food, price is similar to that of Chinatown\u2019s Oriental Chinese Restaurant \ud83e\udee2 (also banana bread as toast??? Amazing!!)\n\nWas abit skeptical b4 stepping in as not much customers and saw some negative reviews here.\n\nHowever the \u4e32\u4e32 meats turns out to be delicious! Personally felt its better than some other famous places. We ordered less salt versions and its just nice.\n\nThe \u70e4\u97ed\u83dc and  \u70e4\u9945\u982d wasn't that nice though.\n\nThe \u9178\u83dc\u9b5a is good as well.\n\nWill revisit to try other dishes to see if it's good.\n\nFood is good- especially worthy using Eatigo deals.\n\nWe ordered all dishes less salty and oily. The clams and frog leg was still somewhat salty. Crispy chicken was crunchy and skewers were tender and flavorful. The other signature dish (\u9505\u5305\u8089\uff09was a little tough to chew cos it uses lean meat. A lot of dishes to choose from.\n\nThe BBQ sticks were perfectly seasoned with a great balance of sweet and savouriness. The grilld mushroom was the star of the show today, damn sweet and fresh, while the grilled chicken and pork were tender and succulent. I did not have much expectations before coming here because of the great number of chinese BBQ restaurants in the vicinity, but it was a pleasant surprise to us \ud83d\ude0b\n\nthe food here is nice. The price is a bit expansive. Will recommend the suan cai fish soup which currently only serve at 1 size. It's good for 3 pax. Ask for some discount when make payment.\n",

We went for the 3-course set lunch and were satisfied with the quality of ingredients used, great cooking, and exceptional service provided by Rimo, Charlene, and team. Recommended dishes: Escargots in garlic butter, Lamb chops, Pear Melba.\n\nWe celebrated a birthday here and were delighted with the extra mile taken with the presentation of the desserts. Thanks to this meal, we\u2019ve found another authentic French steakhouse!\n\nI recently dined at \"Les Bouchons Rive Gauche,\" and it was an exquisite culinary experience. The highlight of the evening was their selection of red wine, which beautifully complemented the succulent steak.\n\nTo start, we savored the pan-seared duck liver, a dish that showcased exceptional freshness and a rich, melt-in-your-mouth texture. It was truly unforgettable.\n\nWe also indulged in a delightful off-menu item, the heated Camembert cheese, which emanated a delightful flavor due to its oven preparation. The combination of the gooey cheese and its subtle yet profound taste was a gastronomic delight.\n\nThe main course featured the Black Angus prime rib, which impressed with its perfectly balanced seasoning that enhanced the natural flavor of the beef. It was a prime example of culinary expertise.\n\nTo conclude this magnificent meal, we had the cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e, a dessert that was both light and zesty, providing the perfect sweet note to end our dining experience.\n\nThe ambiance and service at \"Les Bouchons Rive Gauche\" further added to the overall charm of the restaurant. If you're looking for an exceptional dining experience with an emphasis on quality, this is the place to be. I highly recommend it for anyone seeking an unforgettable culinary journey.\n\nwe did encounter a situation at our table. However, it\u2019s important to note that this issue was not related to how the restaurant was run; it was more of an outside factor. Despite this unexpected situation, the restaurant\u2019s staff handled it promptly and professionally, ensuring that it did not affect the overall dining experience. Their commitment to customer satisfaction and their adeptness in addressing unforeseen challenges further demonstrated the restaurant\u2019s dedication to providing a top-notch dining experience.\n\nBest steak we had as a family! Super value for money. So tender and juicy. Super good appetisers. Fantastic service!\n\nGood food, good service and good vibe. The lamb chop was nicely cooked and reminded us of what we had in France. Waitress was of good service. She made sure we were well taken care of.\n\nI had my birthday lunch here and the food was tres d\u00e9licieux! Special mention for the pan seared foie gras and the ribeye steak. Such depth of flavour at a great value, do check out their lunch set promo if you're coming by in the day.\n\nBig thank you to Rimo, Charlene and Jan for the impeccable service and attention to detail :)\n",

The place focuses more on a wide range of quality vegetables across the world. Very unique presentation of the dishes! My partner was having the vegetarian option and it was as good as the non vegetarian options. The chef even packed us his hometown cake to bring home for tasting.\nA little high on the cost, but worth the experience!\n\nOne of the most breathtaking food experience I had the chance to enjoy.\n\nAmazing culinary journey. The contemporary symphony of aromas and textures through a vegetarian focus was fresh, exciting and new. Every dish is meticulously crafted to bring a delightful balance of flavors. The wine pairing was on point. Compliments job to the chef.\n\nExcellent service. Attentiveness and professionalism exceeded our expectations.\n\nThe atmosphere was warm, friendly and cosy. We felt welcomed and in optimal conditions to savor our dinner.\n\nWe recommend this restaurant to anyone passionate about food.\n\nBeautiful vegetarian cuisine, beautiful ambience, beautiful service and staff. Just take that leap for tastebud and exquisite ingredients discovery. Presentation of the food, attention to your dining experience made it such a pleasant experience. Do come by each season for different culinary exposure.\n\nChef Jeremy and the team did a fantastic job championing seasonal vegetables. The wine paring was beautifully done for each course to highlight the taste of the food with a great balance.\n\nThe ambience of the restaurant was intimate and lovely but the light was slightly dark. It was a birthday celebration and we had a great time throughout the night.\n\nThe menu was exceptional, a great variation of vegetables and herbs tastefully balanced and beautifully presented. The choice of courses was perfectly matched. The staff was very attentive and friendly. The chef introduced himself to all the guests and was very accommodating. We really enjoyed our dinner at JAG, a highlight in Singapore.\n",

                  "reviews": "\n\nI came to Singapore few weeks ago and was looking for Mediterranean restaurants. I stumbled upon this gorgeous place 5 minutes away from my hotel. I tried Kebabs on day one and man it was delicious. Atmosphere is great and all servers are friendly, specially three girls Urmi, Wendy and Fina are super nice, they make sure to get you a table quickly, take the order in timely manner and also make valuable suggestions on the menu. They always keep checking if everything is fine and customers are enjoying food. I loved the desert suggestion after eating my dinner. After first day I have been to this place 7-6 times and was always greeted with same service. I highly recommend this restaurant and will go again before I leave Singapore for USA.\n\nWe had the sultan's delight and mussels with garlic cream and cheese toast. The sultan's delight is really enjoyable. We could taste the smokiness from the eggplant puree and the lamb stew is really tender with tomato based sauce. It's tangy and smoky with some crunchiness from the pine nuts. Really enjoyable. But the mussel is pretty standard. It didn't taste really fresh but they're quite generous with the amount. The garlic cheese sauce is ok only.\nService was good and attentive.\n\nVisited for my birthday meal with my family as I was craving some Mediterranean food and this place had great reviews. However, the whole experience ended up kinda disappointing - as I had high expectations too on my first visit.\n\nService:\n- It\u2019s a restaurant but I felt like there was not much service per say.\n- It\u2019s a pretty high price point but they don\u2019t serve complimentary water (charged at $3 a pot of hot water, or $11 for Evian water only)\n- Ordering isn\u2019t as fuss free as they try to make it. Online ordering only from mobile app, with just one physical menu at the door. Asked for any extra copies for easier viewing but none available. You also have to pay upfront in mobile order.\n- Feels like I visited a restaurant but received fast food style service.\n\nAtmosphere:\n- Overall atmosphere is okay. Like a typical restaurant\n\nFood:\n- Average, I\u2019ve had much better at other places for a similar price point.\n- Pita bread, spreads and kebab grills were okay.\n- Saffron rice & Briyani rice were disappointing. They use basmati rice which gave a nice texture. However, flavour is so subtle that I could barely taste the difference between the 2.\n\nSummary:\nWould I return? Definitely not! For the price point, the food and service didn\u2019t live up to expectations for a highly rated restaurant. Will continue on my hunt for yummy Mediterranean food!\n\nVisited on a Thu night, it's superb crowded and busy in the restaurant. 3 dishes for 2 people, very filling. Overall the food is pretty decent and the price point is on the higher side.\n\nExcellent experience with vibrant dining experience. Food has great range of taste to excite the palate. Service is welcoming and top notch, they also gave a complimentary cake.\n",

The staff was incredibly friendly, making it a delightful meal from start to finish. Can't wait to go back and savor more of their delicious dishes!\n\nThe meat platters and lamb rack at this Greek gem are culinary masterpieces! Each bite is a flavor explosion, and the tenderness of the meats is truly impressive. The dips, a perfect accompaniment, add an extra layer of deliciousness to every dish. A must-try for anyone who appreciates top-notch Greek cuisine!\n\nVisited for the first time after hearing good reviews from friends. Awesome ambience and child-friendly. Helpful staff who helped us with food orders and wine recommendation. Dips were great, octopus tender and flavourful. Desserts were also delightful. The standout dish was the lamb chops!\n\nHad dinner some time last week and the food was pretty good but it was quite pricey. The waiter asked if we would like sparkling or still water and we thought still meant free tap water, but it turned out to be $10 bottled water. Don\u2019t make the same mistake as we did if you don\u2019t want to splurge on water!\n\nUnfortunately, we found a piece of stainless steel dish sponge in our food which is quite unhygienic and dangerous. The staff were kind enough to take it off our bill but this was a very eventful first experience dining here.\n\nWe had an excellent dinner here at Blu Kouzina. The food was delicious, staff very friendly and helpful, and the restaurant designed beautifully.\n\nWe shared the meat platter, kebab platter, 4 dip platter (tzatziki, hummus, red pepper, harissa), and kanafe. Everything we ordered was cooked to perfection and tasted amazing. Stand outs include the lamb chop and the red pepper dip.\n\nThe restaurant even served us a few drinks on the house!\n\nOverall a great dining experience and easy recommendation.\n\nWent to celebrate birthday with a few friends. The food and service were good. Only disappointment is that when we were leaving the place, the wine was actually not finished.  The staff could do better to confirm if we still want it before throwing the bottle away.\n",

Chicken was well cooked and flavourful.\nPricing above average.\n\nThe food was great. Meat was fresh and tasty. The spicy sauce is fantastic :)\n\nGreat taste and good try for our 1st time on Mediterranean grills foods! This are today special dishes!\n\nSeats are shared with a few other stalls within this eatery. You order from the shop you want to eat from.\nFalafel were large, crispy, fluffy and delicious. The hummus texture was just right - not an amorphous baby food mush, not too chunky, and very tasty. Lamb kofta was on the salty side for me, but tasty nonetheless and of a good meaty texture. Thoroughly enjoyed both versions of chili blend - the green one and the red one. Warning for regular people: the red one is very spicy. Pita bread was on the flat side, a bit taco-like.\nThe owner is friendly and approachable.\nWill definitely be back!\n",

Authentic Turkish cuisine and we especially love the creamy hummus, chickpea stew and delightful kunefe. Great service as well. Will recommend to visit in a group to try a variety of sides and mains!\n\nEverything is delicious here! Staffs are friendly, the Kunefe is one of the best, and the Karavan kebabs, both beef and lamb, are amazing! \ud83d\ude05 The hot pita bread is also great. In the last 4-5 months, we've visited this place many times, and our friends love it too. Whenever we want to enjoy a meal without worrying about quality and taste, we head straight to this restaurant. \ud83d\ude0b You won't regret giving it a try!\n\nHummus! Good! The lunch set is value for money - comes with a main + drink + soup + bread + dessert all for $20!\nThe pita bread is baked to perfection and the submarine bread looks so amazing! However the price for the submarine bread is a little high. Will probably not order this again the next time.\nThe soup of the day was lentil soup (vegetable soup) its really rich and herby. Very different from what i usually have.\nThe chicken dish is the highlight of the meal. The chicken meat is sooooo soft and tender. The seasoning is on point. Goes really well with the breads. The rice that comes with the dish is really fragrant as well.\nLots of vegetarian options.\nOverall a positive experience and will recommend \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\n\nTotal bill is about $85++\n\nOrdered quite abit for 2 person.  Love the cauliflower salad. Hummus, eggplant dips. As we were celebrating our birthday, the restaurant gave us complimentary tea and a kind of Turkish delight. The staff were attentive and friendly. Will definitely go back for the cauliflower salad and hummus.\n\nThis was my second visit today and my colleagues and I absolutely loved the food! I am usually not a fan of Turkish or Mediterranean food but this place is an exception. After trying the food a few months ago for the first time, I have been wanting to visit them again.\n\nEvery dish was delicious and tasted fresh and   wholesome. The Mezeplate is a good option if you are not sure what to order as it has a bit of everything and you can to try the different dips and appetisers. I enjoyed the hummus, cauliflower salad and eggplant dip very much. Their lentil soup was very good too - comforting and tasty.\n\nFor the mains, we tried two of their lunch set meals -  two rice dishes with the different chicken kebabs which were served with tea, soup and a rice pudding dessert. We also ordered their salmon which was so tender and flavourful. Several colleagues commented that it was the best salmon they had ever tasted!\n\nThe highlight of the meal was their dessert - Kunefe which was absolutely delicious! The taste and texture was so complex and had so much depth! The crispy stringy pastry with the creamy sauce, nuts and ice cream was indeed like what the menu described it to be - \u201ca slice of heaven\u201d!\n\nThis is seriously an underrated restaurant which serves amazing food and I would highly recommend it :)\n",

                  "reviews": "\n\nI had the pleasure of trying Turkish cuisine for the first time, and it was truly a delightful experience! The standout dish for me was the lamb; it had absolutely no odor and tasted fantastic. The grilled items were a highlight as well, bursting with delicious flavors. The restaurant\u2019s ambiance was beautifully decorated, and the staff was both charming and incredibly helpful, taking the time to explain the dishes to us. While it\u2019s not the cheapest option, the prices are fair for the quality you receive.\n\nOne thing to note, though, is that the platter we ordered was described as \u201cfor two,\u201d but for Asians, it\u2019s considered a generous portion. So, if there are four of you and you\u2019ve already ordered other dishes, I recommend going for the platter for two only; it\u2019s quite substantial. Would recommend to anyone looking for a great dining experience!\n\nFirst time having Turkish food and was really\npleasantly surprised. Their dips and bread was really exceptional. The bread was steaming when it came out it was both crispy and fluffy at the same time. The platter for 2 was also great all the grilled meats was tender and flavourful. Portion was also huge.\n\nEverything from the service to food were impeccable. Staff were polite and always made sure we were well taken care of. I ordered before my friend came and they asked when the food should be prepared and how it should be served. Food was perfectly done too. It is the little things that make a difference and win them a return customer.\n\nVery impressive food & service displayed by the dedicated front staffs and chefs. It\u2019s nice walking in the street after a wine & dine session in the area. The staffs were very attentive, price is reasonable.\n\nWent here for a birthday celebration and the attention to detail from their service staff is amazing, didn\u2019t mention to the staff that it was for a birthday celebration, only had a note in the reservation. But they went above and beyond, having candles in the dessert and even giving us props to take pictures with and proceeded to then print out the photo of us to keep!\n\nThe food also matches the service, authentic Turkish cuisine done perfectly, the Hummus was so good we had to order a second portion! I\u2019m not usually a fan of chicken but the chicken that came with the platter blew my mind, so juicy and tender. Then comes dessert, my first time having Kunefe and the only thing I have to say is that I wish I didn\u2019t share it, wanted it all to myself \ud83e\udd23\n\nDefinitely coming back here again!\n",

They serve the best salad, octopus, sea bream, lamb chop and even chicken. Their dips and pita bread are also to die for. Service isn't as good as it used to be anymore but oh well.\n\nCelebrated a friend birthday here and the staff was quite helpful. We were introduced to a good spread. Wasn\u2019t expecting the food to be good in this type of cafe but was pleasantly surprised of the meat quality and portion. Slightly on the salty side but acceptable. Overall, would come back again.\n\nLoved having dinner here. Food, service, atmosphere all fantastic. Wayne was a great server who recommended some signature dishes - codfish roe was my fav. Octopus was well cooked and kebab was also unique but perfectly cooked.\n\nCame here multiple times including the one at the old location. Also recommended and brought my friends, colleagues here many times! Loved the food, ambience and service! Just so good! This time my friends and I came here to celebrate birthday and the bar manager treated us to complimentary alcohol and gave a small bottle of olive oil (we also purchased a big one!). Their olive oil tastes so gooooooood! The dessert was complimentary as well. I love the fish, octopus and vegetables the best!\n\nFood is fantastic. Price is reasonable as well, total damage is about $50/pax. (We ordered like 7-8 dishes).\nService is pretty prompt. The ambience is good & cozy for gathering & chit-chatting.\n",

The food worth 2 stars. The meat was pretty hard, the starter was too sour. The dessert was really not able to match our taste. The house wines was tasteless, but the red wine taste better when it pair with the meat. I will strongly recommend you only order the red if you want to have their one for one house wine promo.\nOur bill was $128, you can get a much more better grilled meat platter and better food at other restaurants. :)\n\nLe Rida has a rustic ambience somewhat akin to an old time eating house in a small town. Quaint and homely\nFreshly baked pita bread with lemon chick pea hummus was delicious and filling\nMains of Lebanese lamb kafta kebab had the right balance of flavour and crunchiness.\nWash it all down with 1 for 1 Heineken draft at $17.90\n\nManager Sanjiv was both friendly and helpful in his recommendations and unlike in some establishments, he did not push you to over order.\nDefinitely worth a return visit!\n\nA quaint no frills dining place with excellent food and good service. The staff are simple people but are very hospitable, often checking in on the food quality and our experience. If you are looking for a good meal away from hustle and bustle, this is the place to go. Oh.. U can definitely have a conversation with your company and hear them loud and clear\n\nDidn't think the food was thaaaat amazing. Nor was the service. But at least they let us drink outside drinks.\nHOWEVER, i requested for no garnishing on my hummus. When the guy brought it over, there WAS parsley on it. And all he said was \"just pluck it out\". --.--\nSo if i was allergic to that, i should just pluck it out.... nice. The hummus wasn't good either. I've tasted better. Like a friend who went with me commented... it isn't creamy enough. Also, comments about the baklava was that it was too hard... and wasn't good.\n\nAbsolutely loved the food, I am heavily into Mediterranean food. I have tried most of the places around Bugis as well. The food here was so fresh, with perfect taste and presentation. It was completely worth it travelling from East.\nThe service was quick, the portion size was generous . We ordered mezze plateer and tabalu salad. They were scrumptious loved the customised heart shaped Pita bread. Hummus, was so creamy and so were all other dips.\n\nWould strongly recommend.. It has become one of my favourite place..\n",

Only comment is the sauce..only tasted most of it towards the end, not evenly distributed but the chicken had a generous chunky serving. Overall, it was delicious and fresh plus it was nicely sealed that there's no veggie peeping on the paper or any sign of a soggy end of the wrap once I got home. Well done and hope more will get to try it too :)\n\nI love the crispy fluffy falafel and chicken shish wrap here. Selvam was awesome at customizing the wraps and making good chat. Super nice and quick dinner!\n\nGood muslim food available. The person who serve Mr. Hanif\n\nFood taste is secondary, the senior guy at shop is super frustrated and mean with possibly new colleague. Almost as if he will start throwing away things, shouting and all infront of customers.\n\nAnd obv in this environment the new guy served us wrong order, and seems bit untrained and unaware of what he\u2019s making.\n\nOverall, never visiting again because of atmosphere and food both.\n\nI recently enjoyed a hummus pita and falafel wrap at Pita Tree, and it was a taste sensation! The hummus was rich and velvety, spreading its creamy goodness over warm pita bread that was the perfect blend of soft and slightly crispy. The falafel in the wrap was a crispy, flavorful delight  a delightful contrast to the smooth hummus. The combination of these two in a single bite was heavenly. Pita Tree truly excels at crafting Mediterranean classics with fresh, quality ingredients. This dish left me craving for more, and I can't wait to return for another flavorful experience. A must-visit for hummus and falafel lovers! Somemore Thank you so much Mr Hanif for your suggestion\u2026\n",

Place tends to get crowded and there\u2019s sometimes a queue, so it\u2019s wise to make a reservation before heading down. Had the dips and bread, octopus, sea bass, spinach pastries, and finally, baklava for dessert! Everything was great! Octopus was nice and tasty + tender, sea bass was fresh, all the pastries were warm and the Greek coffee we had to end the meal was pretty good too! Will be back here again to try more food! Hopefully sooner than later! Highly recommended for authentic Greek Mediterranean food! Fantastic experience every visit!\n\nA lovely place for those looking for non pork meals. They don\u2019t qualify as a halal place  as they serve alcohol. But good for Muslim friends. It was my first time here and it\u2019s been a while since I had Greek food. I love the dips option from spicy to mild tasting dips. The fried calamari was great too followed by the medium rare lamb which was tender. Ensure you make a reservation to avoid disappointment. Good place to bring friends.\n\nAlways crowded on weekends such that even booking a table on same day is sometimes not possible.\nI really enjoyed the medium meat platter. grilling was on point  meat was juicy and not dry.\nmoussaka went down way too easily. Greek dip platter was on point flavour wise and the taramasalata was flavourful without tasting too fishy.\nsadly the pita bread is pretty small portioned, I'm not sure how you're expected to finish the dip given with the portions served\nGrilled octopus was also delicious.\n\nService was friendly and efficient.\nDecor isn't very Greek but honestly ambience is great (albeit a bit noisy)\n\nIt's harder to get a table here than the at its closest competitor, and for  good reason.\n\nGood food. Although the beef can be on the dry side, everything else was delicious.\n\nHighly recommend the grilled octopus. It is not chewy at all. For those who don\u2019t like squid or octopus, try to have a bite.\n\nRestaurant is packed on a Friday night and the food arrives pretty quick. Staff are quite alright. Some could use a little refining in politeness.\n\nThere\u2019s complimentary licorice candy. Absolutely love it.\n\nWill visit this place again. But recommend to come here in a bigger group to order a larger variety of dishes.\n\nFirst visit. Reservation was smooth via seven rooms. We chose an outdoor table as the weather was pleasant. The food was delicious. We had the whole oven chicken and chicken yiro wrap with fries. Pesto pasta was good as well. Desserts were amazing too. Overall highly satisfied.\n",

All the restaurant staff were exceptionally warm, friendly, and kind, and it felt like we were having a sit down dinner at a family home. For the birthday celebration, everyone sang happy birthday as well and we were so well taken care of. The ambience was amazing. Definitely must try and we will definitely come back.\n\nWe went to Mykonos by the bay on 1st July to celebrate my daughter\u2019s birthday. I must say that the service staff was quite friendly but the  quantity of the food actually disappointed us. The food was nice but portions were extremely small so we have to order more food. Specially the platter, which was priced at $29 was totally not worth as the dips portions were too small.\n\nVery nice view of the marina of docked boats, al fresco dining.\nWell trained staff, skillful and knowledgeable.\nFood is equally fantastic.\n\nFood is excellent, especially the fish, perfect with the creamy garlic source. Not too crowded on a Monday night, it was windy and comfortable with the outdoor seats. Staffs are attentive. Overall very pleasant experience.\n\nGreat Greek Food\n\nHad dinner with a bunch of friends. We ordered to share. The meat sharing platter was of high quality and cooked to perfection despite it being a dish with many different types of meat. The breads and dips were also great.\n\nService was excellent. We had them arrange tables and then changed tables. They accommodated us each step of the way without any fuss. Service came promptly with a smile.\n\nThe place certainly lived up to its Mykonos name - blue and white furniture graced the place. Outdoor sitting was comfortable with ceiling ELV fans constantly cooling the place next to the water.\n",

Please give them a chance, it\u2019s a really quite amazing.\n\nThe lamb shank is highly recommended. Really just drop off the bone type. The butter rice is also amazing.\n\nFirst visit to this Turkish food joint thru a friend's recommendation. The Mix Grill Platter offers a nice variety for sampling. Found the meat a bit tougher than my preference. The marination for lamb was good, not gamy. The Pistachio Baklava a bit too sweet - normal, most Turkish desserts are too sweet for me. Would return to try their other Turkish delights.\n\nThe place is very pretty so we were expecting a pretty decent food. However, as much as I wanted to love the place, the food was a big let down. We were the first to arrive for their dinner service but we waited for 20mins for our dips to be served. The dips are very poor, it\u2019s like store-bought and tasted old, and the bread, i think they only gave one. Moussaka tasted like something I would make without knowing what moussaka tastes like (eggplant with watery tomato sauce). We also had a mixed grill, which at $70+, is quit disappointing.\n\nMaybe it is worth having their lunch set of wrap, but our dinner experience was quite poor.\n\nLove the food. Price is fair and service is fast! Although it's scanning QR code for the menu, apparently it's still ordering through a wait staff.\n\nVery good Turkish food. Much better than the other Turkish or Mediterranean restaurants I had so far in Dempsey and other locations. Lamb shank is meat drop off bone and kunefe dessert was excellent and highly recommended.\n",

We are satisfied with the ambience, food, drinks, service and the atmosphere.\n\nThe staff are polite and helpful. We ordered the Mixed Jumbo Kebab Platter for us to share and followed by Kunefe with ice cream for dessert. They even sang birthday song to me when they presented the dessert with a candle on it. It is very nice and I appreciate their thoughtfulness.\n\nWe are impressed with the jumbo platter as all the meat and veggies are well prepared, well marinated and well cooked. We finished everything off the plate. It is simply delicious. We also enjoyed the Turkish Tea and dessert.\n\nWe will definitely return to try out other food from here again.\n\nIf you follow my Google reviews, you'll know I'm very critical. Yet, this is a restaurant that I'm giving a full five-star rating. That is because it's really perfection!\n\nThis was my third visit, and this time was with a group of friends. I was not kidding when I shared that I liked the food here more than what I had when I was in Istanbul! Was it because they catered well to the local Singaporeans? I'm unsure, but I really liked the Turkish food here! Most importantly, the service quality here had been great thus far! Please maintain!\n\nSuch a gem! The food was so I\u2019m very impressed!! Some meats are dry but overall the food is so good! I love the hummus dips! Our table was nxt to the glass so the view was amazing!!! The food does get cold fast because the place is cold!\n\nI love love love the desserts they are super sweet as expected of Turkish desserts but with their tea or coffee it is perfection! Will come back for the desserts!!\n\nMy partner and I had a wonderful anniversary lunch at Sofra Turkish restaurant. We were impressed by the authentic and delicious Turkish food, the friendly and attentive service, and the cozy and relaxing ambience. We ordered the mix platter salad, the chicken Adana kebab, the baklava, and the Turkish coffee, and we enjoyed every bite and sip. The salad was fresh and flavorful, the kebab was tender and juicy, the baklava was sweet and crunchy, and the coffee was strong and aromatic. The portions were generous and satisfying. The staff were very kind and helpful, and they even gave us an extra dessert to celebrate our special occasion. We felt very welcomed and appreciated. The restaurant has a nice view of the CBD and esplanade, which added to the romantic atmosphere. We had a great time at Sofra Turkish restaurant, and we highly recommend it to anyone who loves Turkish cuisine. It is one of the best Turkish restaurants we have ever been to.\n\nAmazing food. Would recommend! Good options but most of it are variation of similar items. Service is friendly and prompt. Prices are slightly above average but portions are good for sharing, so its good for groups. Great outdoor views (minus the heat). Would be good if there are those  mist-fans or coolers outdoor.\n",

Everything is always delicious, fresh, you can only enjoy food and views with such pleasure here! I would never have thought that there were such wonderful places in this city!\n\nI ordered the baked cheese rice with chicken and it was pretty good, adequate cream sauce with the rice, the chicken was tasty & the melted cheese made it all better overall. Although I would say that the portion is slightly small, but perfect for one person. The other dish was kebab chicken rice - the shredded chicken was really good and the rice had a delicious buttery taste too. It came with some salad on the side, although without salad sauce, when paired with the chicken and rice it was a good meal :) The drinks prices were too high though, does not seem worth it.\n\nAwesome food - awesome people - great location!\nTrue Turkish hospitality!\nOur favourites are\n-the Turkish tea\n- Adana kebab\n- Lahmacun (bread with Lamb meat )\n- Ekmek (Bread)\n- Lavash (Turkish Bread)\n\nPricing is a bargain compared to other Turkish Restaurants in Arab Street.\nFor us it\u2019s our everyday go to!\n\nFood is a little towards dry but fragrant and taste is acceptable. Service is not so fantastic, 2 people sharing but no side plates and only given 2 thin pcs of serviette which we used to  hold the pizza. Venue is still considered good and outdoot sitting is pet friendly.\n\nOverall, it's something can consider to try. Still grateful for making their outdoor sitting pet friendly.\n\nUnassuming on the outside with minimal decor on the inside, I thought that there\u2019s no way this place could be selling authentic middle eastern food!\n\nBut of course I was wrong. Meat dishes are decently priced and delicious, baked goods are fresh, and the Kunafe is deeelightful.\n",

It tasted good but whether it was made fresh that morning I can\u2019t be sure cause it looked like they were taking precooked pitta out that had been in the fridge although there were fresh dough balls on the counter.\n\nThe best Hummus and Falafel I have tasted thus far!\nThe Hummus is creamy and smooth with generous amount of Tahini and nice Olive oil while the Falafel is filled with Herbs at the right point.\nEven though I had it take-away for supper, the food was still delicious.\nI had Pita and Olive since 100AM days (more than 10years ago) and the Hummus never fails!\nAlthough there was once when I did a take-away during lock-down, the Shawarma was a little over-cooked which the hit and miss is common with the manpower shortage seen at f&b.\nBut happy to have the nicely done Shawarma back again this time!\nThe price is reasonable with the quality provided compared to restaurant prices, not forgetting that the current rental must be way more exp than 100AM days although it is only a kiosk space.\nA satisfied and happy customer\ud83d\ude0b\n\nThe Falafel with Hummus and Pita set was $16, although I agree with many users here suggesting that the portion is small, I do think that with the quality of the food, it might not be sustainable to up the portion without a significant price increase.\n\nThe falafel were nicely warmed, soft and flaky, great if you're having a scratchy throat and avoiding the deep fried variety. It was nicely seasoned and the warming spices hit just the right spot. I love the olive-tomato-salad thing and wish the portion was bigger but I guess with rising food costs, I find the portion reasonable.\n\nThe hummus was really smooth and lemon notes really help to cut through the spices from the falafel. Pita bread had a nice yeasty aroma and was soft and easy to stuff.\n\nMy only complaint was that it was really hard to cut and portion the pita bread with plastic cutleries and plates. It kept running about. The place is also quite squeezy and warm.\n\nI'm a big fan of the Pita Pockets as the ingredients are always tasty and plentiful. I'll often take a tub of fresh Hommous home as well. If you are in the Great World area call in and try this great family business.\n\nWe were greeted by a Shalom!!!\n\nThe recommendations were awesome.\nThe beef was flavourful and delish. The bread was warm and safe and went well with the hummus.\n\nI would definitely come again.\n\nP.S forgot to take pictures at the beginning.\n",

Long Phung offers a spread of delicious Vietnamese dishes at prices that won't break the bank.\n\nEvery dish is packed full of flavour. You'll be left craving for more. And as you're dining, let your cup of Vietnamese coffee slowly drip, and you can enjoy the robust beverage as a perfect finisher to your meal.\n\nSeating space is adequate, but do arrive early if you're looking to dine as the spaces fill up quite fast, especially on weekends.\n\nWe were out in the east and decided to try this place because there were a lot of good reviews. Seems like a pretty traditional Vietnamese menu. Food was good and you can tell it wasn\u2019t seasoned for foreigners\u2026it had very sublet but well balanced flavors. We loved all the sauces and the balance of crunch & soft textures. Our favorite was the fried spring rolls the flaky crust was so good it was addictive. The smoothies left a lot to be desired, they seem to be very skimpy on the fruit. Otherwise I love it that the food is also very light so you don\u2019t feel so stuffed at the end. We didn\u2019t get any noodle soup, maybe next time, but most people seem to have some sort of soup. We would definitely go back. The downside is the location (if you aren\u2019t close) but the price, value and quality are all top notch.\n\nMost of their dishes come with sweet sauce which  I like. Beef was okie, not very tender but their spring roll was good. Their crepe was special, inside got prawn and pork belly. I think they add coconut to the crepe\n\nPaid 23.22 for the meal. Food was decent, served very quickly.\n\nAll seems fresh. My spring rolls may have been sitting a while as all 4 pieces were stocked together. Tough texture for the skin. Ingredients were fine.\n\nOverall more of a good vibe. Maybe skip the ones I have ordered and get a pho or fish. Didn't satisfy my cravings.\n\nAuthentic Vietnamese food. Speedy service. Love the jellyfish salad, grilled squid, and beef stew. Banh Mi bread is exactly the same as those found in Vietnam. Returned twice in less than a week. Highly recommended!\n",

Service is also quite pleasing.\n\nA fellow foodie introduced me to this Vietnamese restaurant. We tried two type of beef noodle. The classic  beef noodle soup was good in that the broth was tasty. The other special beef noodle was more interesting in that the broth resembled that of Singapore prawn noodle.\nOur favorite dish was the pancake where the meat and crepe is wrapped with lettuce and dipped in a sauce. Somehow the combination turned out to be nice.\nWe also ordered fried chicken wings, spring roll (fresh and fried skin) and chendol.\nOn the whole, the food is authentic and good. Service was also very good.\n\nAnother family favourite joint as we live nearby. Food is always consistently good \ud83d\udc4d.\n\nThe banh mi is actually a \"new\" edition to the menu and the one to try is the Traditional. Plain baguette goes v well with chicken curry which is super yummy!\n\nThe Banh Cuon (Vietnamese version of chee chiong fun) although pricey (in SG) is worth ordering bcoz you won't be able to find it anywhere else. Freshly done, it is chockfulof crunchy bean sprouts, Thai basil and complemented with slices of Vietnamese ham.\n\nThe beef and chicken soup noodles are also to-die-for...try and you won't regret it.

As for the service, it was good \ud83d\udc4d. Very friendly staff. Environment was also cozy. Will come back again.\n\nReally really good banh mi! Our fav is the the chicken - though the others were good too! Affordable and quick to prepare. They have good coffee too!\n\nGrilled pork banh mi was delicious, i enjoyed the pickled vegetables and kick from the chili padi too. Their bread is really light with a thin/crispy crust. Affordable and good place to get your banh mi fix! But i would prefer if the bread was more fragrant.\n\nGreat Banh Mi for a reasonable price! crispy bread. Best vietnam drip coffee I've ever had. they also have great service, the ladies were very nice. the uncle is also very kind.\n\nThe Best Banh Mi in Singapore, period. (I was born in Saigon) \u2014 go for Banh Mi, Siew Mai in a bowl, Goi Cuon (Summer Roll), Bun Thit Nuong.\n",

Portion size is decent too.\n\nWe ordered the beef banh mi , crab-pork brain soup and Vietnamese spring roll. We particularly liked the spring roll and the coffee. The soup was a little too thick for our liking but the brain had a clean taste. Overall a nice place a quick Vietnamese meal and coffee.\n\nCosy and clean. Very friendly service crew. Ordered spicy hue noodle soup, dried grilled pork noodle & beef wrapped in betel leaves. The food tasted pretty good ! Portions are generous as well.\n\nNice shop with good food. Tried fresh srimp rolls and beef combination pho.\n\nSoup is sweet and herbs aplenty.\nShrimp roll is a little warm from the pork but really nice too!\n\nWe came on a Saturday afternoon. Love the atmosphere and ambience. A good place to chit chat. Ordered the beef sticks, chicken pho soup, dried pork vemicelli and prawn spring rolls. Can say their vietnamese food is good.

Even my meat loving husband enjoyed his vegan meat burger here.\n\nOrdered their standard chicken bahnmi which was great! The bread was nicely toasted, crunchy yet still soft and nicely balanced with the vegetables.\n\nTheir spring rolls are also really good!!\n\nDefinitely recommend this place.\n\natmosphere was rather quiet when we were there which is nice weekends tend to be slightly busier.\n\nFood is really good though, both the beef and pork options are well marinated. we got the bun cha (well sorta bun cha) which came with spring rolls. the rolls appear to be yam based they were crispy and well done.\n\nserving portions were of good size and would certainly come back again to try other options.\n\nBeen loving their food since before they changed to become a vegetarian restaurant, the quality has stayed the same since their switch. Bread is still so fresh and has a great crunch while being chewy, perfect banh mi bread.\n\nRating the food purely based on the mushroom and tofu vegetarian pho. It's really average and not the most bang for buck at $12 (+$2 for egg) but I went for it as I was craving something soupy. Nevertheless, I'd still be back to have my fill of vegetables and to try other stuff!\n\nAmbience wise, this place is on its way to becoming thich nhat hanh's monastery food hall. The Buddhist mantra playing in the background creates an air of reverence; evoking a sense of decorum. I'd imagine that any noise made in this eatery feels disrespectful.\n\nIt'd be nice if the space was kept secular and casual so people can just have a hearty meal with friends. Cheers!\n\nSandwich Saigon converted to a pure vegetarian restaurant a week ago for religious reasons. We saw many customers coming in and leaving a bit confused. But we are not complaining \ud83e\udd23 We love Vietnamese food and really happy there's vegetarian one at Katong now. The pho and bahn mi tastes great, the downside is that it's abit pricey.\n",

One of the few places that have got me enjoy every dish!\n\n1st time here.. Nice environment.. No need fly to Vietnam.. BUT Many dishes not available.. The highly recommended egg coffee is not available.... Staff is helpful BUT, poor command of English, can't give recommendation.. So if not well verse in Vietnamese cuisine, this may not be the place\n\nLoved the food....came 3 days in a row.\n",

Lastly the roast pork baguette is crispy, and the pork is juicy.\nHighly recommend!!!\n\nI had a pleasure to dine in in this amazing restaurant. They serve incredibly delicious Vietnamese dishes with affordable prices. The ambience was quite good. I had a sense that I was back home at that moment. Definitely I\u2019ll be come back with my friends next time\n\nVisited for the first time today and tried their Bun Cha. It was good. Not as good as in Hanoi of course, but still delicious. We tried the fresh oysters at $1.90 a piece currently on promo and it was delicious and tasted fresh. The atmosphere is really like in the streets of Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh with the low tables and chairs. I recommend this place if you haven\u2019t tried Vietnamese food.\n\nGeylang is a food haven.\n\nBut if only you know where to find them\n\n. If you like to time travel a bit to HCM.\n\nThis place can help you.\n\nTry the viet beer to kick start\n\nThen the salad, meat, follow by the rest is history.\n\nDo remember my word of advise. Sit outside.\n\nOne of the best Vietnamese food in SG. The chilli dipping sauce is very appetising. The deep fried spring roll, bun cha, bbq etc are delicious. There is promotion on oysters as well, it\u2019s fresh and plump. Price is affordable. Staff are attentive and friend. Nice ambience for friend gathering.\n",

We had the promo meal and added more veggie rolls and Imperial rolls (?) and more drinks.\nI really liked the spicy beef Pho, very flavorful and the spiciness was just right. We enjoyed the food and the service was good too.\nThe only thing that can be improved here is the printing of QR codes given to tables as it's not friendly to the environment. A feedback that I shared with the cashier when paying.\n\nThe food was quite bland unfortunately, but the decor is nice and the service very friendly.\n\nThe chef recommended noodles in gravy in particular lacked all the flavour you'd expect from Vietnamese cuisine. The banh mi was better but the sauce was a bit odd, almost ketchup-y. Egg coffee was decent.\n\nThere are many better Vietnamese options around Katong, so I can't really recommend this one. It's nice, though, that they cater well to vegetarians.\n\nLanded up at this Vietnamese place for a quick lunch with my daughter. Just the two of us\n\nBeen to other So Pho others but first time at Parkway Parade. Decent ambience, and was quiet around 2pm on a Sunday afternoon. Just 2-3 tables occupied.\n\nThe service was very good. Staff were helpful and efficient. All the food we ordered was delicious...\n\nDefinitely coming back again...for an un-pho-gettable experience \ud83d\ude1c\n\nFood was served very quickly. But it seems like they are short-staffed. The payment counter staff has to jump in for food service and ushering. Noodles this time now are slightly undercooked and have to be soaked in the broth slightly longer, but the plus side was that the broth was piping hot. Mixed platter appetiser would be slightly better if it came out earlier than the mains but cannot fault them as the spring rolls were freshly fried.\n\nSo Pho So Good.\n\nFirst let\u2019s start with the user experience of ordering.\n\nThe food is classified in a very unnatural way from so satisfying and so thirsty or something like that. Then you have to guess what\u2019s in each category. It make choosing of food really hard with ref to the hard copy menu and the app for ordering.\n\nNext, let\u2019s dig into the food.\nThe beef was thin but chewy. We took only 10% of it.\n\nThe batter for the fried squid was thick and flat. There is hardly any crisp to it. The squid was stretch and fibrous.\n\nThe spicy soup felt like Chili flavour over water - there was no depth to the soup base though.\n\nAll in all, in think we came here because it wasn\u2019t crowded. I guess we could have guessed why.\n",

Starting from the hummus, absolutely generous and delicious portions. Perfect appetizer.\n\nThe butter rice with kebab was crazy delicious, we literally scraped the plate clean from the rice and the greek yogurt like substance in the centre.\n\nPizza was crispy and fragrant at the same time, the tomato sauce parts was absolutely amazing.\n\nStrawberry drink was okay!!! Not super special but nice!\n\nIn the middle of Arab street you find this restaurant. We were welcomed\u00a0by a real Turkish guy. Very friendly and he could advise us what was the best to order. We sat outside, along\u00a0the street. Within 15 min the table was full with all kinds of grilled meat. Real Turkish flavors and a nice apple tea were enough to make my day complete. Eating here, and watching the people pass by is a big joy.\n\nParking in this area is very hard, as you can understand.\n\nHad a great dinner here today. My friend saw this online with high rating stars so we just stopped by after work.  And yes, the food is delicious, the atmosphere is awesome, love the music too.\nSo if your family or friends are outgoing and friendly, this is the right place for you to gather together and laugh together and dance together !\n\nCuisine is new to me as a traveller. Trying the dish with my arab friends and the chef being a wonderful host in telling us about the different food added to the stellar experience of dining here. Service was awesome. Food was a good blend of flavors.\n\nJust returning home from an amazing service and hospitality from Cappadocia.\nChef Ahmed Hagras went out of his way to arrange a very sweet surprise for my husband's birthday at my request.\nThe whole staff sang happy birthday for him with a special kunafe.\n\nThe food itself is finger licking good, no doubt. But the experience was way better.\n\nThank you everyone at Cappadocia for helping make this day special for him.\n",

Staff are friendly and helpful. Lovely place to be to watch people walk by while enjoying dinner. Parking is limited in the area though.\n\nFood is really great. Had a very nice dinner with family. The street sets the mood for good food.  Food felt authentic and very tasty. We had chicken Mandi, mixed grill and \"pizza\".\n\nPlace also has some good baklava.\n\nParking lot picture below.\n\nOne of the nicest place to eat on a cool night is at Arab Street, dining alfresco. We didn't even need them to turn on the fan.\n\nMy favourite dish here is the tabouleh itself. Sometimes you may find lemon seeds in it but that speaks to how authentic the salad is.\n\nWhile initially heading for a different restaurant, at which we were repelled by the pushy staff / promoters, we headed down Arab Street to look for an alternative. Most of the other restaurants also had promoters out which tried to lure us in. The guys at Tabbouleh just let us check the menu first and then we asked for a table. Service generally was ok, we waited a bit to actually order, food did not take a very long time though. The atmosphere actually was quite nice, views on the mosque, night time street impressions with a table outside. The food was delicious, I normally don't like Hummus a lot, but here I liked it. It was well presented as well. In the end I got the feeling that despite the 10% service charge it was expected that we give additional tip, which was a bit strange hence the 3/5 for the service. We did like the tea at the very end which rounded up an otherwise nice dinner experience. Thank you very much.\n\nWe choose the restaurant because of its good reviews and as the staff was not at all intrusive as most of the other places in the area.\nWe shared a mixed appetizers plate, which was alright. Overall good, but also no particular highlights.\nThe iced lemon tea was perfect after an exhausting day.\nA plus was the free mint tea at the end, which we really appreciated.\nThe service could be more attentive, while the food was out quite fast. All in all a rather average experience.\n",

The standout dish for me was the lamb; it had absolutely no odor and tasted fantastic. The grilled items were a highlight as well, bursting with delicious flavors. The restaurant\u2019s ambiance was beautifully decorated, and the staff was both charming and incredibly helpful, taking the time to explain the dishes to us. While it\u2019s not the cheapest option, the prices are fair for the quality you receive.\n\nOne thing to note, though, is that the platter we ordered was described as \u201cfor two,\u201d but for Asians, it\u2019s considered a generous portion. So, if there are four of you and you\u2019ve already ordered other dishes, I recommend going for the platter for two only; it\u2019s quite substantial. Would recommend to anyone looking for a great dining experience!\n\nFirst time having Turkish food and was really\npleasantly surprised. Their dips and bread was really exceptional. The bread was steaming when it came out it was both crispy and fluffy at the same time. The platter for 2 was also great all the grilled meats was tender and flavourful. Portion was also huge.\n\nEverything from the service to food were impeccable. Staff were polite and always made sure we were well taken care of. I ordered before my friend came and they asked when the food should be prepared and how it should be served. Food was perfectly done too. It is the little things that make a difference and win them a return customer.\n\nVery impressive food & service displayed by the dedicated front staffs and chefs. It\u2019s nice walking in the street after a wine & dine session in the area. The staffs were very attentive, price is reasonable.\n\nWent here for a birthday celebration and the attention to detail from their service staff is amazing, didn\u2019t mention to the staff that it was for a birthday celebration, only had a note in the reservation. But they went above and beyond, having candles in the dessert and even giving us props to take pictures with and proceeded to then print out the photo of us to keep!\n\nThe food also matches the service, authentic Turkish cuisine done perfectly, the Hummus was so good we had to order a second portion! I\u2019m not usually a fan of chicken but the chicken that came with the platter blew my mind, so juicy and tender. Then comes dessert, my first time having Kunefe and the only thing I have to say is that I wish I didn\u2019t share it, wanted it all to myself \ud83e\udd23\n\nDefinitely coming back here again!\n",

The lamb chops were on the drier side. Overall interesting meal. Recommended for group dinners.\n\nFirst time trying Lebanese food and it was really nice with a very good vibe. the ambiance was all set and whole arab street experince was lit. Hummus with bread and apple teas is a myst try dish over here. The price is on the higher side and I would say going in a group pf 5-6 people will be good as we get to try lot of new dishes.\n\nSanobar Lebanese Restaurant in Singapore is a hidden culinary gem that whisks diners away to the flavors of Lebanon. The restaurant offers a delectable and authentic Lebanese dining experience, from succulent shawarmas to flavorful falafels and tantalizing baklava desserts.\n\nThe ambiance is warm and inviting, and the friendly staff ensures a delightful dining experience. The menu caters to various dietary preferences and offers a true taste of Middle Eastern cuisine. Staff is so welcoming and friendly! Whether you're a fan of Lebanese food or new to it, Sanobar is a must-visit, I enjoyed the place so much when I visited Singapore in January!\n\nVisited 13 July 2023 humid summer evening. The following sharing are based on our unbiased personal opinion and experience.\n\nMultiple visit to this restaurant serving Turkish delicacy. Located at Kampong glam, Bussorah street. We had a great and delicious dinner for the night.\n\nThe food was filling and delicious dessert \ud83c\udf82 and Turkish coffee was fantastic. And the dining atmosphere vibes was good with outdoor sitting.\n\nFood 4 \u2b50\nServices 4 \u2b50\nAtmosphere 4 \u2b50\nReturn to try again definitely \ud83d\ude01\n\nDrop by the next time when you visit Kampong Glam I'm pretty sure you will like it here. Cheers\n\nNice food. Requested for some cherry tomatoes on the side and was spot on. Chicken was cook perfectly and tender. Good service staff. Was given a mint tea after meal. 5 star for the chefs and service crew.\n\nA must go to restaurant. ;)\n",

For 12$ this was an all round bad experience.\n\nAwful falafel wrap, honestly one of the worst I\u2019ve ever eaten. Covered in horrible sauce, presumably to disguise the dry, packet falafels.

But I think the price is quite expensive considering the portion. Mine was 10 SGD but was not very generous portion. If I consider the location, which is a tourism spot, then maybe the price is reasonable but, still, for locals, I think a bit expensive.\n\nThe food tasted very bad, the bread was incredibly stale, I'm pretty sure it was just microwaved. It looked very different from the photos we saw online so I'm not sure what happened. Wouldn't recommend at all, we spent a total of 60SGD and I wouldn't say any bit of that was worth it. Would not recommend at all.\n\nHad their signature lamb chop but was served with Briyani rice. Food taste good here but food portion was a little disappointed. Wasn't very transparent about the cost as the receipt reflected different price from the menu. Wouldn't return to dine here again as it's tad expensive and they charge 10% service charge for a roadside store. \ud83d\ude05\n\nHad a great lunch here. Cheaper than most places nearby and very delicious food.\n\nWe had a delicious lunch at  House of Kebab. The highlight was the hummus- lots of garlic & ideal texture.  The  mixed grill meat and chicken was a little dry but tasty and good flavour.\n",

The quality of the ingredients was evident in every bite, and the presentation was a feast for the eyes.\n\nThe staff at Derwish are not only knowledgeable about the menu but also passionate about ensuring a memorable dining experience. Their attentiveness and friendly demeanor added to the overall positive atmosphere.\n\nHad a delightful dining experience at Derwish Turkish! The mixed kebab platter was outstanding; I was trying to control my carbs but I couldn't get enough of the fragrant rice. The hummus was good, although the bread was a bit tough for my liking. However, what truly stood out was the exceptional service. The staff was incredibly friendly and always had a smile on their faces, which added to the overall splendid experience. Looking forward to visiting again!\n\nEverytime I have a loved one visiting Singapore, I always take them here. I always come back here for the food and service. The food is great - big serving and authentic and I love their Bunefe!! \u2665\ufe0f The service is top notch, leaving us satisfied every single time. Will surely be back with other loved ones who are about to visit. \ud83e\udd70\n\nGreat food and service. Food is definitely wayyy more expensive than the usual, but the taste makes it not such a bad deal. Apple tea is really nice before eating the food, very refreshing and fragrant but after eating any food it doesn't taste as nice.\n\nPeter, the staff here, was exceptionally polite and gave us a warm welcome. When I needed to store my dessert in the fridge, he was incredibly helpful. Peter also recommended their signature dishes, and we decided to try them.\n\nThe Tajin lamb shank was a delightful surprise, with tender, succulent meat that practically fell off the bone. The flavors were rich and aromatic, making it a standout dish.\n\nThe Meze tabagi was a delightful assortment of Mediterranean appetizers, a true explosion of flavors and textures. It included a variety of dips, fresh vegetables, and savory bites, providing a wonderful contrast of tastes.\n\nFor a refreshing beverage, we ordered the Mango Ayran. It was a perfect balance of sweet and tangy, making it a great complement to our meal.\n\nUnfortunately, as there were only two of us, we couldn't order the traditional dessert Peter recommended. Nevertheless, we thoroughly enjoyed the atmospheric environment, delicious food, and excellent service provided by the staff.\n",

Go here!\n\nAmazing food, ate there twice\n\nSultan Mosque Nakamise Street has a lot of restaurants with a nice atmosphere, so I was a little confused, but a local friend brought me to this restaurant. The appetizer platter is full of Mediterranean cuisine (Lebanese?). For mains, we each ordered lamb chops and skewered beef (I don't know the name). I was so absorbed in chatting that I couldn't eat all the appetizers, but they all tasted authentic. The main meat dishes are simply prepared but delicious. I appreciated the thoughtfulness of pointing two large fans at us. None of the restaurants in Nakamise serve alcohol (for religious reasons), so if you need one, you should either drink before coming to this area, or go to a pub a little further out of this area as there are many pubs. Let's go for a drink.\n",

The salads were fresh and the dessert was delicious. I highly recommend their kunfa as it's authentic, made fresh and absolutely scrumptious.\n\nMy only drawback was the warmth. There could have been better distribution of air-conditioning, other than that we had a swell time. I know there are many other restaurants in the area offering a similar experience but Byblos stands apart with class and authenticity.\n\nLOVE the food!!! Hot, freshly baked lavash bread, delectable and well seasoned kebabs, even the salads appealed to my picky 11 year old. Ambience was lovely, only downside was the music is a wee bit loud (I was sitting indoors), but the staff brought down the volume. Our plates were all cleaned out, clearly we enjoyed dinner at Byblos. Highly recommended!\n\nThere are many Turkish food restaurants along Arab Street but this is the best one I've had here. In fact, I daresay it's the best Turkish food I've ever had. The Chef and waiters were all very welcoming!\n",

The tea was good, lasted us the whole meal, decent amount. They also gave us a complimentary baklava. Nice touch. 200+ for 3 person.\n\nWe have visited this restaurant many times before. The staff are always very warm and friendly, and service is great. Food is consistently very tasty. Dishes are best for sharing. Our favourites were the pottery lamb kebab and the chicken musakka. A lovely, unique place for Turkish cuisine that we highly recommend.\n\nIncredible Turkish food - despite being at a touristy location, the quality was excellent and of good value.\n\nThis was a popular spot on a Saturday night, given our last minute reservation, they only had slots 8pm and later.\n\nNeedless to say the slight wait was worthwhile - the various breads were so fresh and done in house. Meats were succulent and well seasoned, all around excellent, there wasn\u2019t a dish we didn\u2019t like.\n\nPortions are generous, given the choice of would be nice to go with a group of 3+ but we won\u2019t complain about leftovers!\n\nhad an amazing dinner here! brought my family to try turkish food for the first time and they enjoyed themselves :) the owner was extremely hospitable and gave us a complimentary kunefe as well as some tea. the food was amazing! solved my middle eastern cravings ~\n\nMy first authentic Turkish food experience highly recommended by my friend. And it totally blew my mind - how hearty and flavourful the food was and how warm the staffs were. The biggest take away was the hummus & bread and baklava!!\n",

Highly recommended, Lahmacun, Beyti Kebab, Tavuk kanat ( Grilled chicken wings) Grilled meatball with cheese, \u00c7oban salad and of course Kunefe with ice cream.\n\nI read good reviews about this restaurant and decided to dine in last night with cousins from Malaysia and an aunt. Firstly, I'm disappointed with their service, food came not as we requested, instead of Pita bread, we were served rice. Secondly, had to ask from 3 servers before our drinks were served. Food are not as delicious as we expected it to be, compared to other neighbouring Turkish restaurants there. Not attentive service. Tables are dirty, chairs not cleaned before sitting customers. Will not come again.\n2. After replying this review, I don't think the Owner is genuine with his reply. I'm not expecting for a refund neither a free meal but i am sharing my experience in the restaurant. I guess you should be sincere with your offer of apology or service recovery and not offer and giving an invalid number. Such a dishonesty!\n\nSivan was very approachable and friendly! Top tier service from the guys here and the manager as well. Food was good too! Highly recommend the meat platter and kunafe with goat\u2019s milk ice cream!\n\nGreat Turkish fare, with the best kunefe. Order the mixed grill if you're here, and the kunefe with goat milk ice cream.\n\nJust gets a little warm for outdoors seats.\n",

The price depends on what flavour chicken/spice chicken/extra spicy chicken/beef. Easy order via whatsapp, cashless pay via paynow (scan to pay). Friendly and approchable staff. Highly recommended!\n\nBy chance ran into this little shop selling Indonesian snacks and kueh.  Very nice presentation and packaging.  They sell a variety of dry snacks as well as fresh made kueh including lemper, rice balls with coconut and gula melaka, tapioca and coconut, etc.  You have several choices of fillings for the lemper.  They also sell kueh lapis with a variety of flavors.\n\nExpected to be good lemper but not impressed. Ayam lemper on soggy side. Kuih kuih was overly pandan rich and starchy to my liking. Had better ones elsewhere.\nWon\u2019t be patronising here again.\n\nCame across this shop in Arab Street. Never tried a Lemper before decided to pop in to see.\nLemper was the main item they were selling, but there were also quite a few other kuehs displayed on the shelves. Took a while before deciding to try the ayam one. I took the non spicy one but the shop assistant told me she would recommend the spicy one if I could take chilli. Took her advice but I didn't get the very spicy one only took the mild one. Also got a box of ondeh and Salat. Was out around having meal then took out the items and realised the Lemper I got was rendang! I went back to the shop after the meal and asked for an exchange she agreed without hesitation and gave me a dollar refund. I didn't even know the chicken one was cheaper. They do have the problem of people walking into the shop picking the items up and putting it elsewhere.\nQuite an interesting experience trying the Lemper. Was spicy but pretty acceptable for me. Loved the ondeh such a small piece but with loads of gula melaka inside. Salat was not bad but the green portion was a little too tough for my liking.\nNice interesting shop with some Indonesian delicacies to try.\n\nIt's so difficult to find Lemper Ayam in Singapore and finally I found a shop selling Lemper Ayam while walking around Arab Street. The taste is authentic and delicious. Love it! Must try the Pulut Kuning and the kueh kueh too. The staff was friendly, helpful and courteous. Highly recommended!\n",

Overall meat was dry.. so different from what we had a month ago. And the aircond is not working and ventilation was horrendous! Only one good comment - the bread served for dip were warm and fluffy\n\nThe tabbouleh was horrible. Very sour. The other dishes were average to good. Staff wasted a lot of my time trying to figure out food panda.\n\nReally enjoyed the food here, delicious tabouli (the best in Singapore (in my humble opinion) & hummus, very delicious kebab, the lamb Mandi fell off the bones & a yummy knefe!

Unfortunately most of the beef items were unavailable. Had to choose the lamb ones. It's really tasty nonetheless. They also have good chicken and vegetarian options.\n\nWe used the Eatigo discount and its definitely worth it.. the foods are great, taste just fantastic to our liking! The waiter is friendly to recommend us their signature foods too..\n\nService by the Chinese guy was good, but the food was really so so and would have been very expensive (avg $25/main) if not for the entertainer app we used. We tried their most popular mains and switched the rice to pita bread. But the bread was very stale and tough, the meat was so so and we ordered hummus which tasted rather diluted. The only good dish was the kunefe, although somehow it's really oily. I'm not sure if that's normal cos this is only the second time I'd eaten kunefe and the last time I had it elsewhere, it wasn't swimming in oil. We literally poured the oil out on a separate dish and it was a lott of oil...\n\nSetting was pretty although it was mostly empty on a Sunday lunch time, not surprised \ud83d\ude05\n\nLove the food from this place.

The food was really sad and the presentation was bad. We ordered a egg plant dish called 'Moutabel dish' and was served with some other dish which didn't even have a slight ingredients of eggplant (yes, they served with a hummus instead). We notified the person at billing counter, but instead of accepting the mistake - they declined to remove the wrong dish from the bill. The pita bread served at Amirah's Grill is pathetic and doesn't even match 50% of what really a pita bread tastes as we had tried several other times in other Middle Eastern Restaurants in Singapore as well as UAE.\n\n- Fools people with a different dish\n- Doesn't accept the mistake and charges customer for the wrong dish\n- No presentation skills\n- Rude staff/Management (Didn't even care to correct the bill when a wrong dish was served)\n- Costly. They charge S$9.9 for really small portion of hummus\n- Servers with unordered dish (so, you have to eat what they want to server or left at their kitchen)\n\nI rate this Amirah's grill: -1/10\n\nReally stay away from Amirah\u2019s Grill !!!\n\nMixed grill was smaller than expected, but very flavourful meats and potatoes. The yogurt drink had dubious bits in it and was not very tasty. Very chill atmosphere.\n\nNice and authentic turkish food. Maybe a touch overcooked, but taste was great.

Place is a little congested but overall I was very impressed with the Turkish kebab BBQ, hummus, and bread. It was a delicious and satisfying meal that I would definitely recommend to others.\n\nFood was pretty good and authentic. Beyti Lamb Kebab was the star of the night. Usually lamb dishes have strong taste and restaurants tend to use very strong sauces to mask it, but the lamb didn't have such a strong taste and the sauce was mild. A perfect balance. Hummus was good as well, although the pita was on the harder to chew side.\n\nHowever, service was a little off, hence 4 stars. Would, however, come back. Got 30% off dine in via foodpanda and ended up to about 30 per pax, so pretty good deal.\n\nThe food was served so fast. Everything was delicious and the priced were good too. Servings were more than adequate! JB still was sweet to serve us even though we came half an hour before they closed. Try the meat grill  platter! Love it!!!!!!!!\n\nFood are fantastic. The butter rice is very tasty.\nWith the herbs on Lamb and chicken. It really tastes good. Price abit pricy but it will not deter people from going back.\n\nVery good !!! We ordered the eggplant kebab, hummus and dolmads and it was so tasty!!!! Very good meal, perfect service. They were so nice to us and made us feel at home. Thank you! We will come back for sure \u2764\ufe0f\n",

Probably won't visit again as the a\u00e7ai bowl is disappointing.\n\nAlmost addicted to their A\u00e7ai bowls. Not gonna lie. \u2014 Their interiors, ambience, environment, vibes are top notch and really good for self and group visits to chill, rest and relax. And reflect.\n\nA\u00e7ai is on the sweetest note of my tastebuds. Sweeter and happier side of life. \ud83d\ude0b\ud83d\ude0d\ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffc Gotta love it here.\n\nAcai Flower Bowl\nNuts\nBYOB\nAmong all, i highly recommend BYOB for a bigger portion for a little ($1) more than the regular price for menu bowls. \u2014 Opt out of bananas as it\u2019s just better and less jelak and gummy with the sticky texture. Nonetheless, still delicious.\n\n8.1/10 \ud83c\udf1f Not the BEST a\u00e7ai place in Singapore town BUT one of the best one I have found. Can\u2019t wait to try other items and places.\n\nGreat place to satisfying ur acai craving while in Holland V. Quality of ingredients is top-notch and acai is on the sweeter side as well. Ambience is quite cozy too.\n\nthe acai tasted more like sugar than acai berries, feels like the percentage of acai is much lower than to the other additives. nice space to chill, well decorated, dragonfruit is nice but i found the goji berries a bit hard\n\nThe menu are great. The taste are ok. Wish place is bigger\n",

The pizza base was soggy and the pizza disintegrated completely as we tried to lift up slices. The ravioli was drenched in this awful, overly salty and peppery sauce and I couldn't taste anything in the filling. The risotto was not particularly good either. Other Italian places I've been to have been much better.\n\nYou cannot imagine the service standards of this place.\n\nFaizal, Jess and Gabriel - our servers for the night were exceptional. EXCEPTIONAL.\n\nSurprised this place has NOT even obtained a Michelin \u2b50.\n\nFood 10/10\nService 10/10\nQuality 11/10\n\nI don't get it. How is this place charging mad affordable prices while serving food only perceivable at the Hyatt? \ud83e\udd2f\n\nWe were sitting outdoor enjoying our dinner!\nFirst time visit the restaurant. Loved the texture of pasta, the sauce was creamy, portion was generous! Mozzarella with ham was delicious, too! The pizza was the down side that the seafood was tasteless and the pizza dough could be better. Tiramisu was good, too!\n\nThe pizza here is tasty. The crust is thin and baked nicely. We had the margherita with seafood add on. The squid was a little too chewy but otherwise it\u2019s fine.\n\nService was prompt. Only downside was that the aircon was a really weak. We were in the restaurant and still felt really hot (on level 1). When we went to the bathroom at level 2, the air con there felt much better.\n\nDelicious and filling pizzas and pastas. Couldn\u2019t finish for 2 people! Worth it if dining with 1 for 1 / 50% offer! The store manager was very friendly and kind \u2014 offered to keep my many bags of groceries at the back while we dined and brought them back to me after we finished our meal. Thank you!\n",

We decided on a mexican fiesta and as such, popped in for a quick fix and to our delightful surprise, we were not at all disappointed.\n\nMy dish was about $19 before GST. It was fried chicken with loads of tomato sauce on it, with cilantro rice and nachos on the side. My friends had nachos and enchiladas. The flavours were good and the cilantro rice was so yummy. They didn\u2019t skimp on the cilantro and the rice was cooked to perfection, every rice with that intense cilantro flavour. My chicken was fried to perfection, and it was juicy and moist. The serving size is generous for what you\u2019re paying.\n\nThe restaurant service was attentive, and I loved that they provided free iced water to patrons. Such should be the standard of more restaurants in Singapore.\n\nThe decor was quaint and cute.\n\nAbsolutely love the Mexican food here especially the Soup with the fresh seafood in it had the nachos with pulled pork which was amazing the enchiladas filled with beef and the set with taco and enchilada with beans on the side I added guacamole as well which was great! Definitely would recommend this! Though service is sometimes quite slow it\u2019s still quite worth while\n\nI don't eat much mexican, but I really enjoyed my dinner here. Was difficult to choose from the menu but thankfully the staff were very helpful with their recommendations.\n\nThe spring roll thingy was amazing, way better than it looks.\nI didn't know nachos can be served like that, the pulled pork one was good but wish there was more meat.\nBeef quesadilla was really good too, altho it looked really flat and sad, but it was actually very flavourful and filling.\nFish tacos tasted quite interesting, I actually couldn't taste the fish at all which is a good thing.\n\nOh and I love the guacamole and tomatoes and salsa ~\n\nThe downside is all the quesadilla/taco/XXX all looked and tasted very similar.\n\nBut yea would come visit again! It tastes quite wholesome!\n\nI am a frequent customer and have been ordering from them for a couple of years. No longer in the future as there was a cockroach wrapped in my burrito. I have reported them to the food agency.\n\nIt\u2019s been many years since I\u2019ve last been here. It\u2019s a long standing establishment and the food did not fail me.\nOrdered the pi\u00f1atas, chimichanga and calamari. Food was served fast and the server was very friendly.\nAll the food ordered were tasty, filling and authentic. I\u2019ll be back to explore the menu more.\n",

This place do not serve beer tower.\nThe food is great, would love to come again with the big group.\nWe asked one staff to help us to take a photo and after he take 1 photo for us, he took out his phone to take another photo and told us that it is going to post on their Instagram. One of my friend felt not respected, firstly he didn\u2019t ask for our permission, secondly, we don\u2019t know who he is and don\u2019t know what he is going to do with it, and express that he is not comfortable with it, especially he doesn\u2019t like a random person having his photo in other people\u2019s phone. Perhaps, asking for permission might be a good choice.\nBtw, the food and drinks are so good!\nBy the way, I\u2019ve gotten quite a few mosquitoes bite from there.\n\nNice location at the end of a busy street, this bar is open and airy with plenty of seating and a decent range of beers. The cocktails were also impressive and reasonably priced during happy hour. Food was only ok (fairly run-of-the-mill pub-grab and a little too many fried options) but that's ok. The staff were friendly and attentive. Solid choice for a street packed with options.\n\nA great atmosphere and the food is really delicious. Staff super friendly and readily available for next drinks and orders.\n\nA great selection of Western foods.\n\nNice ambience. The food is good and the staff attentive. The corner tables have some mosquitos issues but the staff will provide incense when asked. Highly recommend their lamb stew and lala soup.\n\nAlways one of my favourite places to go to in Holland Village (among the many watering holes there!). Prices are reasonable, food is quite tasty and the vibe all round is great. Generally not that crowded but if you're in a bigger group do remember to get reservations.\n",

Definitely a must-go place for meat lovers. The salad and food bar had a great variety to choose from and the meat get served direct to the table every few minutes (^^\"). And remember to ask for the pineapple!!!\n\nAll the meat is quite salty, makes you keep drinking water and fill up your stomach fast. Most of the beef like tenderloin and lamb were overcooked and were lacking in flavour.\n\nBooked our reservation for 7pm but had no issues despite us coming earlier at 6.30. Our waiter, even though he was a trainee (some chinese/asian person) was super on the ball when it came to refilling our water and changing our plates.\n\nWhen I accidentally dropped some meat on my white shirt, he immediately dropped whatever he was doing and got me a wet and dry tissue for me to clean off the stain. Highly impressed with the service and food. Had a lovely evening together with my wife.\n\nFood is great. Service is excellent. The salad bar was also really good. It's a meat lovers paradise\n",

Every bite was tender and we enjoyed the service very much. At one point, we even requested the chef for a particular cut, which he very graciously prepared just for our table. The salad bar is very fresh and well prepared. We recommend the ham, pineapples and beef brisket. If you dare to try, get the chicken heart too!\n\nCarnivore started 2 decades ago at Vivo City, relocated to CHIJMES, and just relocated to Robertson Quay.\n\nThe meat or skewers were not what we accustomed to. All the variants of beef on skewers had a very strong gaming beefy taste and either dry or hard. Definitely not tender just hard. The short beef ribs not so hard or tough but strong beefy taste. The chicken heart was okay at 7/10. The home made sausage was dried out, was not tasty at all, a dismal 2/10. The bacon wrapped chicken at 5/10. The chicken thigh better at best a 7/10.\n\nThe best from carver is the skewered barbecued pineapple at 9/10 and butterfish at 8/10.\n\nStrangely the buffet sides were better overall compared to the skewered meats. Minestrone soup 7/10, black beans with sliced sausages 7/10, potato salad 8/10, asparagus salad 7/10, beef stew 6.5/10.\n\nThe assorted chocolate desert was 8/10. The fruit was decent at 7.5/10.\n\nDunno what to say. We are so used to the higher meat qualities when they were at Vivos City. Just wish they were as good as before. They just started operating less than a month since relocating from CHIJMES so maybe they just getting into the groove.\n\nService was good, friendly & attentive. Hardly anyone there during Monday lunch as it was a public holiday, in lieu of Deepavali.\n\nThis is a meat lovers paradise! Every meat they serve is awesome! My faves are the rump cap, chicken thigh and the butterfish! But on the whole food is awesome, and service is great! I especially loved the service from an elderly gentleman. He was attentive to my needs and made sure I got what I wanted. He deserves 100 stars and he makes my day!\n\nMeats were a bit dried but taste still not that bad, salad bar and dessert okay, overall okay\n\nFelt like meat variety for rotation was alot lesser than what was shown on their website. Pineapples only came twice, of which once did not even made it to our table.\n",

The cheese bread and fried banana were awesome toooooo!\n\nDo try them out!\n\nWe brought a toddler with us and it was child friendly. Overall the food were great and fresh. The marination taste really good and was grilled to perfection; the beef was medium rare, good job to the chef! I'm not a fish person but it got me eating second piece, it was delicious and fresh. Our daughter just loves the chips and tomato. Service was attentive and well explained. Good job to Chris and team! Looking forward to visit again!\n\nIt was my anniversary celebration. We had\nlunch, and it was a carnivore's dream come true. The buffet-style service, with servers continuously offering a variety of meats until you signal them to stop, was a delightful experience.\n\nThe meat selection was impressive, and I must say the Picanha, Prime Part of Top beef stole my heart.\nDespite that Picanha that stole my heart, there were some others that I think otherwise. Maybe this is personal preference.\n\nOverall, I found their concept of unlimited, high-quality meat servings are truly enjoyable.\n\nNotes: the bottle provided on the table are chargeable. One is sparkling water, the other is mineral water.\n\nNo complaints whatsoever. It's worth the steap price, from the sides (pictured) to the array of various meats, all cooked to perfection, to the attentive and courteous wait staff.\n\nMy only reccomendarion is to come hungry.\n\nThe only positive thing I can say about this place is the decent interior. The food is otherwise pretty terrible. Their picanha is tough, dry and sinewy while their supposed wagyu sirloin is almost certainly not wagyu given that it lacks the signature tenderness you expect from high quality beef and also carried a weird, almost gamey taste. Service was also lacklustre, with the waitress having an attitude that suggested she would rather be anywhere else than at the restaurant.\n",

It taste really good with the chicken nicely grille.\n\nI have ordered the sweet crepe of banana and Nutella. love it when it is gluten free. it is hard for the crepe but after the first bite it kinda of melt in your mouth. it is not too sweet. the spinach drink is very refreshing and is well blended. the portion of the. crepe is alright for me as it is quite filling. but maybe little for people with bigger appetite. packaging is well protected delivered by grab. looking forward to try their other crepe.\n\nBefore visiting, I read the reviews and was wondering how good can acai be. After trying it I must say it's really very appetizing with the chocolate sauce and peanut butter. One thing that can be improved would be the packaging for the acai, the bottom of it was already wet within 10mins.\n\nThe grilled tapioca wrap was also good with generous amount of fillings. Although the skin looked crispy it was quite chewy but in a good way.\n\nLove their acai bowl! Portion was generous and they purely used acai - no fillers like chia seeds taking up half the bowl unlike at certain other places. My favourite is their keto goddess bowl - it has everything that I like: blueberries, strawberries, cacao nibs and coconut flakes! The owner is really friendly too. And price was very good at $12.90 for a large bowl which was enough for two of us to share.\n\nFavourite acai place by far.\n\nBeiju Express have the best a\u00e7ai bowl in town and I\u2018ve tried many. Fresh, delicious range of ingrediants, served at the perfect temperature and amazingly arranged.\nAnd must try the Brazilian Tapioca Crepes. I had the Watcha Chicken.

Although the squid ink pasta took 40mins to prepare, you can be sure it is cooked the authentic way cause the flavour is thoroughly infused into all the rice. The tapas were so flavourful, went very well with the bread drizzled with olive oil. Only thing was this menacing crow that was eyeing our food from the tree outside.\n\nWent for dinner on a Saturday - wasn\u2019t too crowded.\nService was great! Really appreciate the staff checking in with us - and when we wanted to look at the menu for desserts, the lady recited the whole list and recommended the lava cake (which we thoroughly enjoyed). When I asked for additional ice for my drink, they gave me a cup with a pair of small tongs!\nFood was okay - nothing to shout about, in my opinion. I enjoyed the White Anchovies Salad but my partner didn\u2019t really like it much. He enjoyed the squid ink paella and the Pan Con Tomate. The Huevos Con Todos was pretty good too. Dessert was amazing - I don\u2019t have a sweet tooth so it was cloying towards the end but my boyfriend who loves sweets had a field day. Very flavourful!\nBut I guess you pay for the ambience.\nNot sure I\u2019d make a trip down specifically for it again, but a nice place to try for a date night.\n\nCame to celebrate a dear friend\u2019s birthday and we caught the tapas promotion - 9 tapas for $109.90++. Just nice for 4 of us to share. Each of the dishes carry their own richness - yummy! We polished them off clean! \ud83d\ude01 the staff were also helpful and great in servicing us! Love the high ceilings and spaciousness of the premise that overlooks to the yachts dock. Will definitely recommend this place!\n\nA good place to dine by the sea.\n\nService requires more attentive staff.\nSpoon was not provided when the dish requires such.\n\nThe grilled octopus leg was good. Recommended to order.\n\nPaella Pescado seafood rice is average. Depends on whether u like the spice taste, some of us feels the dish tasted sweet.\n\nGambas Al Pil Pil was also nice. If they can provide bread to go it would be excellent.\n\nPan Con Tomate was a normal bread with tomatoes topping. Nothing to shout about.\n\nOverall price is not cheap.\n\nThis place is pet friendly dog cats etc, hangover brunch was awesome. Been here several times already so food is legit and consistent they\u2019ve change furnitures recently looks more Mediterranean. All you can eat menu within 2 hours also for drinks if you fancy to add 39 unlimited sangria and pava\n",

Every dish wowed us.\n\nFor 2, we ordered chili lime wings, Italian pork sausage pizza, pan seared barramundi, linguine meatball pasta, and tiramisu gone wild. My favorite was the meatball pasta, something in the meatball was so addictive, felt like there were exploding flavors of several herbs and nuts in this dish but weren\u2019t overpowering. Everything was tied together perfectly with the sauce and most importantly, pasta was Al Dante. On a side note, the dessert, tiramisu was actually huge and made perfectly. Good to share!\n\nAnd with such good food quality, it was worth every dollar spent. We managed to try a few dishes in one sitting and was a little over being just full. The service was prompt and pleasant so as the environment. Will be returning here for sure!!\n\nFood really nice +, environment is great+, staffs are friendly. Foods are so good to taste. Love the tiramisu.\n\nFood here was AMAZING! Every dish that was recommended to us was so delightful to taste. Highly recommend the mushroom ravioli for starters, the crab pasta, and the pizza (crust was so nicely done) \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\n\nService was great too, they provided 4 wraps for our fajitas instead of the usual 3 as we came as a family of 4. He also shared these amazing recommendations, thank you very much! \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc\u263a\ufe0f will be back!\n\nNice ambience for Mexican & Italian food. Love the beef fajitas and Burrata. Sadly line many establishments these days, they do not serve tap water and only served still water at $7 a bottle.\n\nExcellent thin crust pizza! One Of the better ones I had tasted.

The food and service does not disappoint. Staff tried to accommodate every request we had, which does really make the whole night more enjoyable.\n\nThis place serves up one of the best Paellas in Singapore! My go to place for squid ink paella! The black paella came with perfectly grilled tender prawns and scallops!\n\nOrdered the grilled prawns which was served on small sizzling skillet filled with soft tender prawns swimming in a pool of fragrant garlic oil. Hmmmm.. I could cut the all the seafood here with my spoon!\n\nOur favourite appetiser was still the saut\u00e9ed cauliflower! It looked like a simple dish until we bite into it! There were so many layers of flavours in this dish! One bite into the crunchy cauliflower, paired with the smoked aubergine pur\u00e9e, spiced mayo, pickled onions and a speck of herbs was just divine.\n\nIf i can give 10 starz i will gladly give them. Their seafood paella was honestly one of the best we ever tasted in SG. The flavour is bursting with every bite and the texture is legit aldente. Their fish n chips and char grilled portobello was also great tasting.\n\nI would like to commend on their service because they had went the extra mile to provide my partner with a complimentary birthday dessert when i casually mentioned to the staff. Really appreciated that gesture which made our day. Thank you\n\nWe celebrated my daughter's birthday yesterday and we had a great time! The staff was accommodating and we felt really well taken care of. The kids enjoyed having a pool to splash in before and after dinner.\nFood was good, we had the mushroom croquetas - this tastes like breaded mushroom soup; crystal bread - which was a hit with the kids, its basically toasted bread with tomato paste; potato churros - another hit with the kids; octopus tentacle - super yummy; beef steak - tender and juicy; red snapper; highlight was the squid ink paella! We also had the iberico paella - that was OK only.\nThe white sangria was a little too watered down. Tasty, but abit like fruit juice.\n\nNice beach atmosphere. Great pool. Good food. Pate and ham Croquettes were great! Fried Peppers too! Bread was so so. Had their cocktails. Not fantastic though.\n\nA beach club which does dinner service in an air conditioned restaurant section. Spanish styled tapas and mains dominate the menu. Extensive range of drinks including cocktails and wine. Food quality really good as well as service.\n",

The churros came freshly fried and was good too, but would have preferred actual choc sauce vs the hershey choc syrup.\n\nOnly gripes; the overly sugary lemongrass drink that was served premade with no ice. Had to ask for ice twice but given few pieces\u2026..  also very weird that we dined in but were served with plastic cutlery when we clearly saw metal cutlery, it was a little strange. It was practically only 2 tables and the lady served my food to the other table\u2026. Could tell she wanted to take it back to serve me but they already started eating it.\n\nI think its a quaint little place but some things need to be improved. At $30 for 2 expected just a little more.\n\nExcellent service. The beef Mexican rice bowl was not bad. With the homemade drink, I spent less than $10. I was there alone at 5 ish and I had the entire place to myself. I don't remember music playing but it sure would be nice to listen to some tunes.\n\nSmall quaint shop located near Tai Seng Mrt, they had a $10 set meal that had a wrap, small hash brown and a lemongrass tea. There was a small side of nacho chips with salsa.\n\nNothing amazing but I guess it was better than nothing coz there wasn\u2019t anything there open before 11am\n\nDropped-off my 10-months old laptop at LENOVO Service Centre at 3 Irving Rd, #01-17 Tai Seng Centre. BITC, Singapore 369522 on Tuesday 18 April 2023,\n\nThus decide to settle my late lunch within the area too.\n\nOne will be spoiled with choices as there are so many small eateries and cafes. I was drawn to  Olive Mediterranean & Middle East which was located across the street at 11 Irving Place #01-14/15, Tai Seng Point, Singapore 369551.\n\nOrdered for myself a Mexican Rice (Celantro & Spinach With Beef) Bowl at S$7.50.\n\nIf you are a small eater, the serving portion is just right. However, definitely a \"No. No.\" for someone who has a heavy duty digestive system, I would recommend that you order some nachos or Quesadillas too.\n\nIn my opinion, the rice is mildy aromatic (I was expecting a more pungent aroma of Celantro and spinach).\n\nI will rate the minced beef topping as \"healthy choice\".  It is relatively quite nice BUT will not leave one any special impression.  It will definitely taste alot better if there is a little more fat (this will enhance the juiciness) and more spices are added.\n\nHowever, if you working in this area, it is a great place to meet up with your colleagues and friends after work.  You can sufficient outdoor sittings surrounded with plants.\n\nStumbled on this place as i happened to be browsing around. Been awhile since i had my tacos and wraps, decided to try this as i noticed they had very high reviews.\n\nHad the beef Quesadilla - loved it as it was simply nice\nChicken Saffron Stew - Soooo tender and nice but soup wasnt as thick as i wanted but thats purely due to my own taste\nHashbrowns - Thumbsup as we all loved it. Hearsay its even better than M's hashbrown but i leave it for u to judge.\n\nService wise was top, very homely feel given by the lady boss and staff. She took her time to guide me through the menu and shared with me what we should order.\nI must say the food takes a pretty long time to come for a quiet Monday Afternoon but i guess Good Food - Time to prepare so no complaints from me on this.\n\nOverall i recommend this place based on the food served + prices. Very nice and they deserves better businesses. should be pretty quiet when its after office hours.\n\nWill be back again :)\n",

                  "reviews": "\n\nOpening in March 2022, Zuzu Kebab is a Muslim-owned hawker stall specialising in Turkish kebabs. The chef at the helm of Zuzu Kebab formerly hailed from the Turkish Kebab House, a pop-up stall often seen in Pasar Malams / Night Bazaars around Singapore. Zuzu Kebab tends to attract long hungry queues of diners, thanks to their delicious dishes served in large hearty portions, at wallet-friendly prices.\n.\nAmbience at Zuzu Kebab is shared with the rest of the Serangoon Garden Market & Food Centre hawker stalls. There's ample common seating, with bright lights, and an open, airy, bustling atmosphere. The large and attractive signage of Zuzu Kebab is easy to spot, with people patiently waiting their turn to order.\n.\nService at Zuzu Kebab is friendly but structured. Chef takes a few orders at a time, then makes each order one at a time. This results in fresh, made-to-order, piping hot meals each time, though it also leads to a short queue of up to 15 minutes in waiting time. It's usually a 1 or 2 man show here, and while they demonstrate great product knowledge on the menu, they can be rather brusque during peak periods.\n.\nFood at Zuzu Kebab is Turkish cuisine, with a focus on kebabs. There's a good range of options here, though most folks order the staples. I like that their dishes and meals are healthy and wholesome, not too greasy, and served with plenty of fresh vegetables. Quality is consistently above average, and portions are large for individuals.\n.\nPrices are wallet-friendly but higher than other hawkers, budget about SGD $9 per person.\n\nEnjoyed the burrito & butter rice with chicken. The pita bread with hummus was yummy. Be prepared to queue/wait for your food during peak meal time.\n\nZuzu Kebab serves food fresh and you can\u2019t go wrong with any orders. Just try whichever you feel like to eat today. My all day comfort food and also healthier choice :)\n\nGood quality and value !!! Just need to prepare for long queue and waiting time.\nKunefe is the best I had so far!! Freshly made, rich but not sweet! Must try!!\nThe pita bread are freshly made, for garlic and cheese option, they will bake it upon ordering, it is so good just out from the oven , but be prepared for some waiting time, if you are in a rush, take the salad ,kebabs , original pita.\n\nZUZU IS BACK!! Absolutely tasty and worth the wait. Just look at the char on the chicken. Definitely value for money w the huge portion size. I always come prepared to pack some back for my lunch at work tmr \ud83d\ude0d\n",

Still keeping up the standards. Fish & chips are served in a good proportion. Pizza (thin n nicely done as well) n pork ribs (big portion hor) Crispy wings with a special dipping sauce - not too bad but I thought the wings can be further marinated for people who don't go for the dipping sauce. Fries costs only $5 on Fridays n you get ALOOOT of fries too. Ordered Bolognese n Carbonara (finished before I remember to take photo). The kids absolutely loved it. We loved how much clams we had in the vongole - power la. The staff were also very friendly n kind to hand us spoon n plates for our cake.\n\nBeen awhile since I had a beer at Serangoon Gardens! Plonk serves Little Creatures Pale Ale on tap. It was an enjoyable pint and the St Kinda fish and chips was a great pairing. Great attentive service crew and will be back!\n\nBeen to Plonk many times, usually for their express brunch. The fish and chips was fantastic, crispy and freshly fried fish with a nice thin batter coating. A whole heap of fries absolutely fried to perfection. Paired very nicely with the Little Creatures IPA they have on tap. Very pleasant ambience as well, open air but cool inside. The tart was more on the chocolate side, fudgy and delicious and paired with vanilla ice cream. On other visits i\u2019ve also had their truffle mushroom risotto which is cheesy goodness.\n\nI was around the serangoon area and looking for something new to try. Stumbled upon Plonk with loads of people having a beer in the front and decided to try this place out. The food was great, the place wasn't too crowded, music volume was just nice, but inside was just too dark.\n\nThe food was great and you should not skip on the pizza. Ordered the mushroom truffle, mushrooms are big and chunky, dough was nice and crispy.\n\nKitchen whipped meals are \ud83d\udcaa strong. Very flavourful pizzas. Eggs and burgers are juicy and crisp to lock in the flavours \ud83c\udf54\n\nUnfortunately they\u2019re so popular the kitchen is short handed. You\u2019re gonna have to wait 40mins plus for service. You can tell the waiter and managers are harried from the load too. Kudos on their efforts to still be friendly and nice \ud83d\ude03\n\nCheck the waiting times if you\u2019re in a hurry to avoid being hangry\n",

They serve the best salad, octopus, sea bream, lamb chop and even chicken. Their dips and pita bread are also to die for. Service isn't as good as it used to be anymore but oh well.\n\nCelebrated a friend birthday here and the staff was quite helpful. We were introduced to a good spread. Wasn\u2019t expecting the food to be good in this type of cafe but was pleasantly surprised of the meat quality and portion. Slightly on the salty side but acceptable. Overall, would come back again.\n\nLoved having dinner here. Food, service, atmosphere all fantastic. Wayne was a great server who recommended some signature dishes - codfish roe was my fav. Octopus was well cooked and kebab was also unique but perfectly cooked.\n\nCame here multiple times including the one at the old location. Also recommended and brought my friends, colleagues here many times! Loved the food, ambience and service! Just so good! This time my friends and I came here to celebrate birthday and the bar manager treated us to complimentary alcohol and gave a small bottle of olive oil (we also purchased a big one!). Their olive oil tastes so gooooooood! The dessert was complimentary as well. I love the fish, octopus and vegetables the best!\n\nFood is fantastic. Price is reasonable as well, total damage is about $50/pax. (We ordered like 7-8 dishes).\nService is pretty prompt. The ambience is good & cozy for gathering & chit-chatting.\n",

The food did not disappoint and everything was really delicious ans savoury. The chef and waiters service was friendly and attentive. And there was also a free flow of cabbage for us as well.\nOverall a five star recommendation for this place so do come and try!\n\nService is great.\nPlace remains same for a Monday before 6pm .\n\nMiso ramen is still well flavoured and appetising. Helps chase away Monday blues.\nPrices have increased for adding noodles so I opt for a add on of rice instead.\n\nCheers.\n\nWe were very happy with the taste of our food and the service level provided! Big eaters like me rejoice with free flow rice and cabbage!\n\nFamily\u2019s go to dinner place for tonkatsu sets. Love that the rice and cabbage is free flow!\n\nThe tonkatsu is well breaded and fried. Not greasy and still juicy.\n\nRice is properly cooked, always nicely done. Loving the soup that comes as a side with the meal itself. Cabbage is shredded nice and thin, and the dressing is tart and delicious!\n\nOverall a really good experience!\n\nIf you are keen on noodles, the ramen is pretty good as well. Extra serves of noodle and soup can be purchased to top up the meal itself.\n\nOverall, really yummy! Get there early for a table!\n\nOne of my favourite Oyakodons(and store, too!) in Singapore, while I often visit for their Katsus, if I ever crave Oyakodons I often find myself back here. Affordable Authentic Japanese Comfort Food.\n\nThe Oyakodon has half-cooked eggs which lends an extremely smooth texture to the dish. The Mirin is rich but not overbearing. Chicken chunks are tender, eaten with rice, it\u2019s truly something I come back to again and again.\n\nThat said, most dishes here are tasty, so if it\u2019s not your bowl of rice, you can\u2019t really go wrong with the Miso Katsu either(not pictured).\n",

We came here several times and this time was a special day for us and our precious Stitch who turned 5 years old this year. You could pre order a dog friendly cake few days before your appointment. Our cake is made of pumpkin and fruits so humans could eat it too\n\nFood is not bad for the affordable pricing and we enjoyed it! Service was great and speed of serving the food is considered fast. We enjoyed ourselves a lot and recommend you bring your dog there :)\n\nBetter than average human food for a pet cafe! Prices are very reasonable. The floor is a bit gross though because it's vinyl and some owners don't clean up after their dogs immediately. Not wheelchair-friendly as there are steps at the entrance.\n\nA Paradise for Pet Lovers!\n\nThis is another hidden gem for all pet lovers and foodies alike. From the moment we walked in, we were welcomed with open arms and so was our furball.\n\nThe highlight of our visit was the pet menu, a thoughtful touch that truly sets this place apart. Our pup had a ball choosing from a variety of delicious options and the complimentary water served in bowls was a fantastic gesture to keep him hydrated and happy.\n\nFor the humans, the Chilli Crab Shakshuka and Salmon Hae Bee Hiam Spaghetti were nothing short of amazing. Bursting with flavors, these dishes were a treat for the taste buds. The Chilli Crab Shakshuka had the perfect balance of spiciness and richness, while the Salmon Hae Bee Hiam Spaghetti offered as much punch, if not more.\n\nThe presence of pee pads made our visit stress-free and convenient, ensuring our pets' comfort. The entire atmosphere exuded warmth and welcome for animals, making our experience very lovely.\n\nWe will be back!\n\nWent there twice.\nFirst, the food was really affordable and really good, ordered beef burger, their fish and chip and salmon rice bowl. Quality food!\nSecond, it\u2019s really dog friendly, the mop water etc is readily available, even leash as well. We\nCan leash our dog to the hooks on the wall which allowed us to eat peacefully\nThird, the dog food portions were really great and affordable as well\u263a\ufe0f our baby girl really enjoyed it without us spending a bomb on it (picture Was attached can be seen, how big the portion was)\nLast, the staff were really friendly, service were good \u263a\ufe0f\n\nLike the Pet Friendly inside the restaurant. Wanted to pay with cash or credit card but was told only paynow or paylah.\nOrder:\nUsing QR code need my credit card details\nDuck comfit - salty & very dry meet.\nBig breakfast -  Good\nCarrot cake-  hard & dry. Suspect frozen & reheated.\nHot beverages - Good\nReasonable prices\n\nReview quality of food from feedback & I  am confident business will grow.\n",

The floor staff attend to you immediately and ensure the food served are hot. Unfortunately, there were some mishaps with the food served. When informed, it was immediately rectified and a new dish was served. I am very impressed with the service and the quality of food. Kudos.\n\nYummy food but I think they need more staff for the weekends. Hard to get their attention especially for water refill. Can\u2019t blame them as there\u2019s only two of them managing everything. Might want to consider self-service for the water though.\n\nUPDATE:\nWent back again and now they don\u2019t even serve tap water but charge for bottled water at $6? Not sure if I will revisit.\n\nWe were there on a weekend for a late lunch. The place was very empty. We were ushered in quite quickly, but when we wanted to place an order, we waited quite a while to be able to get someone's attention.\n3 out 4 items we wanted to order were not available, but we were not informed when we sat down, hence very disappointed. They also have a pasta menu that is not available for weekends too..\nFood came quite fast, but the plates have very disgusting dirty and wet cotton string wrapped handles. I cannot imagine anyone's hand touching that and then touching the fries or wrap. Mocktail was a glass of diabetes, 15% to 20% syrup, coloring and milk. The orange cake was a miss too. It tasted like tapioca kueh.\n\nWe had a comfortable good time on a rainy Sunday evening, eve of PH, at Ela (Bukit Batok)! Our favourite dish was actually 'Keto' with Pulled Beef - the cauliflower rice was very well done with a generous portion of pulled beef! #mustry\nWe would like to do a special shout out to the one and only floor staff that night, Yani! She was like a wonderwoman, running the floor service alone, serving at least 5-6 tables of guests professionally - from bringing guests to tables, to taking orders, clearing tables, making drinks, serving the dishes etc.! Mad respect! Thank you for being so attentive and patient with your warm services! Will be back at the new outlet to try other items soon too! \ud83e\udd73\n\nIt was so cozy and absolutely loved the vibes. The food was exceptional and the service was great.\n\nThe smell of the pita was sooo good and the pita on my lamb was soaked with flavor. Tho you may want to note that lamb generally has a strong smell/taste. My suggestion is to maybe elevate their dessert as the cake tasted like any ordinary lemon pound cake with an ice cream scoop on top. Wish there were smtg more special.\nhonestly would come here again.\n",

I was personally expecting the meat to be grilled on the table but it was done in the kitchen instead. Pork collar was overcooked and tough to chew. The beef on the hand was done alright. The other main dishes that we ordered were slightly better than the BBQ option than we had.\n\nI reached 630pm and had to queue outside for a while for 25mins. The server was passionate and shared with us what\u2019s the highly recommended dish to go for. Order an oxtail soup and a recommended BBQ. Oxtail soup was okay and lags of umami. The pork belly is overcooked and served on a hot plate that\u2019s not hot. Then I would recommend serving on the plate instead if there isn\u2019t any sizzling effect, why bother? Food for thought. I think probably we picked the wrong dishes? I don\u2019t know\u2026 but I\u2019m sure paying for that price I can get better BBQ meat for sure. Head down and try for yourself, review is base on my personal preference. You might have a different experience than I have.\n\nFood:\npork bokkeum $30\nserving size was generous and it was filled with lots of veg, onions and mushrooms. slight spice gave it a nice kick but doesn\u2019t come with rice. quite a challenge to finish it even if we weren\u2019t full because it got quite jelak\ndolsot bibimbap $20\ncan\u2019t go wrong, really nice and we polished it off\nhaemul pajeon $17\nthere was seafood with every bite of the pancake, they certainly don\u2019t scrimp on the ingredients. personally not a fan of how soft the pancake was though ):\nadditional items:\nsikhye $4\nreally nice and smooth drink, but serving size was a tad small, moreover no complimentary water which is usually a norm in korean joints\nhite beer $17, rice $2\n\n10 side dishes came complimentary but nothing really stood out. some were quite salty as well \ud83d\ude05\noverall not too bad, but nothing that stood out as being really delicious\n\nSuperb Korean food. Great, authentic taste.\n\nLove the japchae - nice texture, flavourful. Oxtail stew is good too. The BBQ platter is fantastic.\n\nThis place reminds me of a joint in Seoul that I used to frequent, esp their bokkeum octopus, which has such a generous amount of octopus compared to other places where there's more veg in the dish.. their side dishes are also good and a hit for my toddlers.\n",

We reserved well in advance as this place requires reservation during the peak hours.\nOrdered Grilled Tilapia in spicy fragrant sauce and few veggies like potato, lettuce, tofu. The flavours were amazing and fish tasted really fresh and there was no fishy smell as you usually feel while eating any seafood. We got a plate of home made buns and rice to go along with it. Cooled ourselves with cucumber salad. For drink we got sour plum four seasons tea and local craft beer. Everything we ate or drank were worth it.\nStaff was friendly and accomodated our request of getting rice later and also getting some of those buns take away. Definitely will visit again, Cheers :)\n\nGot the mushroom seabass, medium spicy and added Chinese cabbage. Portioning is quite little, can only find a few pieces of veg and that's about it.\n\nService was also slow. Our noodles was not served as we were almost finishing our food. We checked twice with one stuff who told us that he will check for us. Then we checked a third time with another staff and staff told us they forgot our noodles. She asked if we would like to cancel this item since we are almost finishing our food. We said ok. Our noodles came shortly.\n\nSeasoning and food is quite nice and flavourful.\n\nWe brought our friends to experience mala cusine and were told that the Classic set meal for 4 pax offers whole seabass so we accepted their recommendation. The medium seabass was slightly small in our perspective because we were expecting a larger fish since fish is the main item in this set. Each one of us got a little portion and it tasted fishy and unfresh, we didnt enjoy the fish at all. Nonetheless, we thought the presentation of this dish was beautiful and the side dishes in the fish tasted yummy. We were wowed by all other side dishes like Spinach, Lala, Sweet&Sour Pork, Watering Chicken, etc.  We feedbacked to the Server on our experience and glad that they will inform their kitchen. In general, their service level is friendly and helpful.  It is the fish dish that ruined the overall eating experience.\n\nSaturday lunch at 12pm, only customer in the restaurant for a while. We ordered the set with the grilled fish and several side dishes. Fish was fragrant and flavorful, but the portion was a little small for 4 pax. Generally on the saltier side as expected of Chinese cuisine. We had a good lunch together.\n\nExcellent food and customer service. My food was in a mess when the grab driver delivered to me and was irresponsible to reply or answer my call. When I call in the restaurant to ask for a solution, immediately after seeing the photos that I send them. Without second they arrange to send me those damage food to be replace and resolved my issue. Would like to thanks chong Qing grilled fish serangoon for your fast reply and your efficiency. Especially to Jia Zhe for your help.\n",

From the grilled Octopus tentacle, to the seafood platter to the meat platter and the best of all, the pork skewers.. we almost didn't order the pork skewers but am glad we did because it was out of this world and not like anything we (or I) have tasted before.\n\nBe prepared for a budget of 80 to 100 per pax without drinks or alcohol.\n\nEasy parking at Craig Place (walking distance). May need to maneuver a bit if you have guests on wheelchairs.\n\nHad an extremely enjoyable dining experience here with my work colleagues. Although I've not been a huge fan of Greek food all along, our lunch was actually quite yummy. Got ourselves a mixed platter combo to share, some moussaka, spanakopita (make sure you get this), and some pita bread with dips. Make sure to call and reserve ahead of time, as they do get quite crowded during meal times.\n\nThis place is just outstanding: exceptional raw material used to create fresh, delicious, authentic dishes. Great wines offered, relaxed atmosphere, cozy decoration. All pieces are put together nicely for a fantastic experience! The cooks and managers are really putting their heart into Fotia and it shows!\n\nWe will be back for sure!\n\nGreek food in a nice setting. Been here a few times and the food always stands out, definitely one of the best Greek restaurants in town. Salads are delicious, uses good fresh ingredients and seasoning was good. Meat platter was big enough for 4 of us with a good selection of grilled meat, flavourful and had good taste.\n\nBeautiful venue that really makes you feel like you\u2019re in Greece. Wide variety of seafood, meat and vegetarian dishes - the platters are definitely plentiful and good for big groups. Service is friendly and prompt which is appreciated.\n",

The chicken feet & pancake with brown sugar is good too! #authentickorean food \ud83d\udc4d\n\nFood was awesome! Loved the soup broth. We took out 2/3 of the garlic from the soup, as we were scared it was too spicy. The taste was perfect to me. We ordered small, but couldn't finish it between 2 people. I think it's highly possible to have 3 people share a Small pot. Service was great, waiter refilled our soup automatically when he saw it was finishing, and allowed us to take away the remaining dishes which we couldn't finish. Location is extremely convenient as well. We came during lunch without reservation, so we got seats immediately. Not sure how it's like for dinner. Would definitely come here again, with a bigger group to try again \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\n\nFirst experience with Dakdoritang and it was wonderful! Love the spicy soup and big bunch of garlic! The steam egg is also wonderful!\n\nThe interior design also makes you feel like you are transported to Korean. Really like the vibe and the staff were super friendly and helpful with suggestions.\n\nThe taste of eating in Korea! People who like garlic will like it! There's a lot of garlic, but after taste is very clean!\n\nThere are a lot of side dishes, so you can enjoy the drink!\nThere's only one restaurant specializing in chicken stew in Singapore !!\nWeekend waiting is long. Join us on weekdays\nI recommend it :)\n\nFirst time trying Dakdoritang and Kelim\u2019s version was great as they added in a good amount of garlic for an enhanced taste of the stew and the chicken meat was very tender. The knife cut noodles and fried rice made with the stew were very tasty too!\n",

All the restaurant staff were exceptionally warm, friendly, and kind, and it felt like we were having a sit down dinner at a family home. For the birthday celebration, everyone sang happy birthday as well and we were so well taken care of. The ambience was amazing. Definitely must try and we will definitely come back.\n\nWe went to Mykonos by the bay on 1st July to celebrate my daughter\u2019s birthday. I must say that the service staff was quite friendly but the  quantity of the food actually disappointed us. The food was nice but portions were extremely small so we have to order more food. Specially the platter, which was priced at $29 was totally not worth as the dips portions were too small.\n\nVery nice view of the marina of docked boats, al fresco dining.\nWell trained staff, skillful and knowledgeable.\nFood is equally fantastic.\n\nFood is excellent, especially the fish, perfect with the creamy garlic source. Not too crowded on a Monday night, it was windy and comfortable with the outdoor seats. Staffs are attentive. Overall very pleasant experience.\n\nGreat Greek Food\n\nHad dinner with a bunch of friends. We ordered to share. The meat sharing platter was of high quality and cooked to perfection despite it being a dish with many different types of meat. The breads and dips were also great.\n\nService was excellent. We had them arrange tables and then changed tables. They accommodated us each step of the way without any fuss. Service came promptly with a smile.\n\nThe place certainly lived up to its Mykonos name - blue and white furniture graced the place. Outdoor sitting was comfortable with ceiling ELV fans constantly cooling the place next to the water.\n",

The food worth 2 stars. The meat was pretty hard, the starter was too sour. The dessert was really not able to match our taste. The house wines was tasteless, but the red wine taste better when it pair with the meat. I will strongly recommend you only order the red if you want to have their one for one house wine promo.\nOur bill was $128, you can get a much more better grilled meat platter and better food at other restaurants. :)\n\nLe Rida has a rustic ambience somewhat akin to an old time eating house in a small town. Quaint and homely\nFreshly baked pita bread with lemon chick pea hummus was delicious and filling\nMains of Lebanese lamb kafta kebab had the right balance of flavour and crunchiness.\nWash it all down with 1 for 1 Heineken draft at $17.90\n\nManager Sanjiv was both friendly and helpful in his recommendations and unlike in some establishments, he did not push you to over order.\nDefinitely worth a return visit!\n\nA quaint no frills dining place with excellent food and good service. The staff are simple people but are very hospitable, often checking in on the food quality and our experience. If you are looking for a good meal away from hustle and bustle, this is the place to go. Oh.. U can definitely have a conversation with your company and hear them loud and clear\n\nDidn't think the food was thaaaat amazing. Nor was the service. But at least they let us drink outside drinks.\nHOWEVER, i requested for no garnishing on my hummus. When the guy brought it over, there WAS parsley on it. And all he said was \"just pluck it out\". --.--\nSo if i was allergic to that, i should just pluck it out.... nice. The hummus wasn't good either. I've tasted better. Like a friend who went with me commented... it isn't creamy enough. Also, comments about the baklava was that it was too hard... and wasn't good.\n\nAbsolutely loved the food, I am heavily into Mediterranean food. I have tried most of the places around Bugis as well. The food here was so fresh, with perfect taste and presentation. It was completely worth it travelling from East.\nThe service was quick, the portion size was generous . We ordered mezze plateer and tabalu salad. They were scrumptious loved the customised heart shaped Pita bread. Hummus, was so creamy and so were all other dips.\n\nWould strongly recommend.. It has become one of my favourite place..\n",

Had the Fig Time pizza, rock melon with parma ham and angel hair pasta w/ king crab meat. Will come back and try other dishes on the menu (:\n\nAnother find in Serangoon gardens and Another Italian favourite of mine. Quite hidden. We had to park car and walk a while to get here. The ambience was cosy and the service was prompt. I loved their pizza! All dishes we ordered were lovely. The pastas were fresh. Truffle pasta was decadent.\n\nBaci Baci, nestled in a cozy corner of Serangoon, proved to be the ideal spot for our early celebrations of my son's birthday. When asked what he wanted for his special day, he excitedly exclaimed \"pasta,\" so we ventured to this charming restaurant.\n\nThe moment we stepped inside, the neat and inviting decor set the tone for a pleasant dining experience. The service staff were friendly, exhibiting warmth and genuine hospitality.\n\nWe embarked on a culinary journey, starting with the Crema di Porcini. Unlike other commercially-made versions, this soup had a distinct homemade taste that was truly delightful.\n\nThe Cacciucco, with its perfectly balanced acidity, whetted our appetites and prepared us for the feast ahead. The Soute do Cozze was heartwarming, and the choice of white wine in the soup was spot-on.\n\nThe Tagliatelle impressed us with its impeccable texture and rich truffle aroma, while the Capellini al Grancho, although tasty, could benefit from a touch of cream to enhance its flavors.\n\nA surprising hit among the children was the Frutti de Mare, their first encounter with squid ink. Initially skeptical due to its color, they couldn't resist requesting seconds after tasting its unique and delicious flavor.\n\nIn conclusion, Baci Baci surpassed our expectations for a memorable early birthday celebration. With its cozy ambiance, friendly service, and delectable pasta offerings, it proved to be a delightful culinary haven.\n\nHad expectations but after some cold plain bread then bland ordinary 'homely' pasta, things got incredibly boring and disappointing. One thing good was the pizza dough. Might be worth giving the pizza another shot... Maybe.\n\nBest service ever, waitress and owner went above and beyond to take care of us. authentic pizza was so good I ate it before taking the picture!\n",

When I open it up at home, fish egg is hard like rock and not fresh. Fried fish is missing too.\n\nSoup & thick beehoon taste ok.

I had made an online reservation a week ahead, and even physically went down to confirm my reservation with the manager. She gave us assurance that we would be accommodated for our Sunday lunch. Somehow the staff forgot to reserve seats for my family on the actual day, and we were told to wait outside the restaurant for 20 minutes past the agreed time. No sincere apology or even any seats or water provided for our kids and elderly while we were waiting! We definitely won't be patronizing this outlet again!\n\nA seamless dining experience here especially with friendly & effective crew. Food are fresh & tasty. Peter helps to cook & pack our food as we couldn\u2019t finish it. I didn\u2019t manage to name all the crew but they are all fantastic!! I highly recommend this place!!\n\nHad a great experience with the food and service.  Exceptional positive service with Peter who waited on our table.  All of us had a many good laughs with his stories and the evening is so enjoyable.\n\nWe had excellent service from Joey and Peter. They came to help us cook our meats. The food is excellent. Only concern was a 90 minute time frame to enjoy our dinner.\n\nWent to check out this Korean BBQ restaurant at Nex, they marinated all the meats with the yummy and tasty sauce! They offered free flow of vegetables, garlic, onions, kimchi and cucumbers. The environment is cozy and you no need to worry about the smell of the barbecue. This place is really a great spot for family and friends gatherings.\n",

Compared to overpriced places, this is reasonably priced and was really delicious. I had the Birria taco and I loved it. Definitely will be back.\n\nAwesome food.. a tad bit over priced in my opinion.. but not a deterrent.\nWe ordered a couple of stuff and everything was fresh, hot and yummmy !!! Their lemongrass drink was pretty refreshing!\n\nVery welcoming staff recommended us food and was very friendly. Ordered the Mexican rice bowl and Burrito, which was really tasty and flavourful. Will come back again.\n\nStumbled onto this eatery and we decided to give it a try.\nAceituna Mexicana serves some Mexican inspired dishes, as well as some Middle Eastern inspired dishes. The reason I say it's inspired is because I feel that it's more like it's been tweaked to cater to the local taste buds.\nThe menu isn't extensive, but what they do serve is pretty decent. My enchilada is more like a lasagna, with less fillings.\nIt's probably a place that caters to the people living and working nearby, as I don't really see myself making a trip specially for the food. But if you're around the area, it makes a nice change from the usual fare.\n\nHad the set lunch - chicken rice bowl set. Taste like Briyani for me. Food taste not so bad, with salad on top, it is a plus! The set come with crunchy hash browns make it even better! Still worth to try if you are nearby.\n",

Wanted to order a chendol and a chin chow drink. The server told us we have to order main food. I asked exactly this \u201cwe cant just order a dessert and a drink?\u201d The person replied yes and that he cant take our order if we not ordering food. We got up and left.\nCant believe they turned down customers just because we only wanted dessert and a drink? Horrible service.\n\nI brought 5 Australian friends there and we were late because the flight arrived 1.5 hours late. The restaurant was very accommodating. Everything was delicious. Everybody was very happy and had only nice things to say. The favourite was the curry fishhead. The staff really followed my request to introduce the dishes to my friends. I really appreciate the attention to detail, speedy service and accommodations. I highly recommend this place and have only gratitude to them. Sorry I didn't take any photos because we wee busy eating! :)\n\nThe place is small and tight. Portions are small - even the medium is enough maybe for 2 to 3 people at most, and cost a pretty penny. For 8 persons, total cost came up to S$241.50.\nTaste wise it was ok overall, nothing to shout about.\nHae cho was ok, but tiny.\nAyam buah keluak, at medium size, had only one nut cut into two. The taste was ok. Chicken was tender.\nChap chae was good, but portion was really small and alot of cabbage more than anything else.\nItek was really sour, bit strange but ok. Tender.\nBabi pongteh was really soupy. I'm more used to those that are less watery. But the meat was good.\nFish was not fresh. At 38 bucks, not quite worth it, I felt.\nOtah was small for the ten bucks it cost. Thought it was way overpriced.\nDessert portions were small for the price tag of 7 bucks. So-so only.\n\nOverall, I felt not worth the price tag. Unlikely to go back again.\n\nwow. House of Peranakan has been the highlight of my week! Great food and service, not many Peranakan food in Singapore, and as a Peranakan myself, it brings me back to my childhood days when grandma would cook. Highly recommended!!!! The staff is really helpful esp. this waiter named Duane\n\nUnique, one-of-a-kind environment.  Food depends on taste, but for me was unique, top class, and tastes home made.  I'm honestly a bit puzzled as to why the restaurant isn't rated higher.  Peranakan cuisine is under-rated.\n",

I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a genuine Peranakan dining experience.\n\nDinner @ Old Bibik Peranakan Kitchen.\n\nLove the Barramundi Assam Pedas! Just right on point!\n\nHere are the dishes i ordered:\n1. Crispy Chinchalok Omelette 7/10 (portion is huge! Suited for 4-5pax)\n2. Barramundi Assam Pedas (9/10)\n3. Kepiting Soup (8/10)\n4. Ayam Buah Keluak (8/10)\n5. Nyonya Chap Chye (7/10)\n\nP/S: Old Bibik\u2019s cooking suits local palate, hence if you\u2019re looking for authentic peranakan food, move on \ud83e\udd2d\n\nFabulous food. Super tasty with chilli on the side to adjust to your own taste. Good sized serves, well priced with good old fashioned service (efficient and attentive). Keen to go back as there was much on the menu we'd like to try but couldn't fit it in.  Loved the open setting with fans to keep you cool.\n\nSome of the best Peranakan food we've had in Singapore! Everything tasted great and had a lovely home cooked feel. The sayur lodeh especially was spectacular -best I've had in Singapore. The Nyonya Ikan Assam Padas was something new to us and was very good too. Portions were generous and quality of ingredients felt high -well worth the price. A cosy ambience and warm and friendly service completed the excellent dining experience here. We will be back again with our friends!\n\nChance by this place when the original venue we wanted to go was close on a sunday. Tasty perankan dishes with wide offering of dishes with friendly service\n",

General all the dishes were delicious , flavours were towards the mild side. Fresh ingredients and we enjoyed the service and ambience !\n\nCame here after watching Ghib Ojisan eating here on his YouTube channel. Ordered ayam buah keluak, beef rendang, assam sotong, otak otak, nyonya chap chye, blue pea rice, chendol and bo bo cha cha. Rendang was very tender, probably my favourite in this list.\n\nOverall, food was decent but so-so. Can find better peranakan food elsewhere for this price range. Restaurant has a nice ambience though, and wasn\u2019t crowded on a Sunday night for dinner around 6.30pm.\n\nI decided to explore the Joo Chiat area and took a bus there and walked around. It's a Monday so it's quiet and relaxing. Just felt a bit hungry and wondered what I could find and this restaurant just popped up!  Very quiet on a Monday and i had the whole place to myself for lunch. I must say prices are high for the food, but I decided to treat myself. Service was good and the food was good. I really like the very special Ayam buah keluak and ngoh hiang. I love the decor and traditional objects all around the restaurant. It's a great authentic dining experience.\n\nWe came here while scouring for Nonya food in this area.  There were several restaurants in the area,  and I decided this based on Google reviews.\n\nReservations needed and recommended too.\n\nThe food is well balanced in both taste and scent,  unlike other places whereby the spices can be very overwhelming. The Sambal KangKong has that homely style cooking,  similar to mom's. Another item worth a mention is the curry chicken,  with that hint of sour in it,  bringing out the life.\n\nFinally,  never leave this place without trying the Chendol,  always leave room for dessert. It's not too sweet,  though heavy on the coconut.\n\nOverall,  service is fast,  speedy in fact.  I guess this is also due to the crowd that never seems to stop coming in,  we came on a Sat evening.\n\nWorth a return visit or as when one craves for Nonya food.\n\nstaff were v friendly and the food was gd \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd\n\nthe best dish we ordered was SAMBAL KANGKONG ! the chilli paste used was very fresh and tastes different from sambal kangkong from other places.\n\nwe also ordered: nogh hiang, ayam buah keluak and hainanese pork chop.\n\nthey also gave a complementary acha dish.\n\nwanted to try their fish but was a bit expensive (about $48).\n\ntotal was abt $25 per person !\n",

Get to choose your favorite ingredients. My Yong Tau Foo paired perfectly with their rich and flavorful laksa soup.\n\nDon't miss the creamy, custard-like Durian Pengat! A divine treat with that bold durian kick.\n\nI recently had the pleasure of dining at \u201cNyonyas\u201dand I must say, it was an exceptional experience. The standout feature of this establishment is undoubtedly the impeccable staff and their genuine hospitality. From the moment I stepped in, their attentiveness and spontaneous understanding of my needs was evident.\n\nThe menu at \u201cNyonyas\u201dis a testament to their commitment to catering to a diverse clientele. It flawlessly balances an array of international flavors, ensuring there's something to satisfy every palate. Whether you're craving traditional fare or seeking a culinary adventure, this restaurant delivers.\n\nKudos to the team for their dedication to creating an inclusive dining environment that transcends borders. I'm thoroughly impressed and can't wait to return. Keep up the fantastic work, Nyunyas Team! \ud83d\udc4d\n\nwhat a pleasant find in the east (Katong)! Good buffet spread of Nyonya Peranakan food at only S$38.90++, and is daily lunch. I recommend to try their laksa, kueh pie tee , achar & durian pengat - really good. Kuddos to their Chef David, who runs the kitchen & live station (fried carrot cake is good too!) Service staff is good.\n\nPeranakan buffet spread at Katong Village Hotel. Spread is rather huge for the price, but the food taste is so-so. Curry chicken and ponteh chicken rather bland. Salt duck soup very saltish. Nyonya laksa is is still manageable. The only 2 outstanding are the appetiser, which consists of kimchi, achar etc and durian penget.\n\nThere\u2019s a wide variety of food to choose from with a mix of Peranakan food and other cuisines too! There are live stations and diy stations along with their buffet spread which made the experience more fun. I particularly liked the laksa which was very flavourful and the appetising achar too! The staff provided prompt and good service which made the dining experience very enjoyable :)\n\nDisclaimer: Was here for a tasting but I saw how the staff treated other guests similarly as well \u263a\ufe0f\n",

Quick too.\n\nWe came as a family of four and ordered 7 dishes + 2 desserts.

Not too spicy as my girl who cannot eat spicy food also enjoyed the dish. Ayam bulak is good. The salted veg duck soup is normal. The duck meat is very soft. As usual, the chap chumye is very nice.\n\nPrawn egg omelette is a bit too oily, but still delicious. We tried the honey pork for thr first time. It's sweet, and nice. Only thing is there's corn, carrots and peas, not sure if everyone would like it.\n",

If you're in the area, don't miss the opportunity to savor their delicious offerings.\n\nDo take note they are off on Tue to Thurs.Also blue pea nasi lemak only avail on Fri to Sun.\n\nI\u2019ve always wanted to try the Nonya Nasi Lemak at Emmanuel Peranakan, which is one of the more popular stalls at 84 Marine Parade Central Hawker Centre.\n\nNo luck this time either, so I went with their regular Nasi lemak. Took fish fillet, chicken, begedel, tofu and fried egg.\n\nRice is very ok, not flavourful. I liked the begedel and the chicken. Fish is well cooked. The egg and tofu weren\u2019t good - quite bland and didn\u2019t seem fresh.\n\nFor $8.5, it\u2019s on the more expensive side too.\n\nLOVE their sayur lodeh!! This dish of theirs hasn\u2019t been getting the attention it deserves - it\u2019s creamy and strong on the coconut milk - probably one of the best I\u2019ve eaten!\n\nTheir blue pea coconut rice is pretty interesting too: it kinda has the texture/flavour of the glutinous rice you find at the bottom of kueh salat haha and so it\u2019s stickier then usual and has a mild sweet fragrance to it.\n\nWould definitely dabao my lunches from here if I stay around the area. It\u2019s somewhat pricey but well, it does taste better than the other mixed veg rice options out there!\n\nMy perennial favorite hawker stall. The menu is wide. My favorites will be fried chicken wings, cod fish batter, bombs, fish otah. The curry gravy is heavenly. This is a place whereby you can have a decent meal at a decent price. My only grouse is that they should open more during the week.\n\nFriendly shop owner and reasonably priced. The Nyonya nasi lemak is a nice twist of the usual one with excellent chicken rendang. However, the sambal chilli isn\u2019t super spicy.\n",

Food is generally appealing to taste buds, staff comes across as friendly, what I really love is the interior aesthetics and vibes.\n\nCertainly interesting for an experience, but perhaps not a return visit, and the prices tend to be a little high.\n\nService excellence goes to Marivel and Aeron. We had a great dining experience because of them.\n\nFood was great too! Kudos to the Chef!!!\n\nI couldn't say anything bad for the ambience of the restaurant as it bring more effect to the experience.\n\nHere for the four-hands collaboration and got to try dishes of very different cuisines. Very friendly staff and delicious food! Weekend lunch seems slightly crowded do make a booking if you can! There's a beautiful outdoor area that is pet-friendly!\n\nNice cosy Asian fusion restaurant in the heart of Katong with stunning casual interiors. We came on a weekday evening, and only 3-4 tables were occupied.\n\nWe had red wine and decided to have it along with the following :\n\n1) Chilli Crab Cake - Nice crispy croquettes that pairs well with the chilli crab sauce.\n\n2) Rendang Lasagna - Nice rendang sauce, that is not too fiery. Mix it well with the cheesy lasagna and you have a winner.\n\n3) Salmon main served on a bed of mash potato, some noodles and veggies.\n\nAs a guest of Hotel Indigo, we enjoyed their breakfast buffet and room service. The breakfast was included with our room rate so we took advantage and the staff was helpful to point out the vegan options and made us a veggie currie and roti to go with the buffet, we were full and taken care of. The fruit was a bit bland and the cappuccino was a bit bitter, but overall good variety for breakfast and we were full for hours.\n\nThe room service came in clutch after being exhausted after a long day of walking and shopping. We ordered the Assam Curry Seabass, the Chap Chae, Sauteed veggies, and jasmine rice - we didn\u2019t venture into the fusion dishes and kept it simple. Everything was flavorful, especially the Sea Bass, and it arrived quickly and piping hot, totally satisfying!\n",

They sell a wide variety of traditional Nyonya Kuehs, Nyonya bak zhang(Dumplings), cookies and biscuits. They have mini Nyonya bak zhang too. I love the Nyonya and Salty ones!! Mini ones at $1.50, regular ones at $4.50. Fillings gao gao. Support local, you can even use Kris+, by Singapore airlines to make payment \ud83d\ude02\n\nCraving for Nonya Kueh, this is one of stalls is recommended online. But the taste was not up to my expectations.\n\nDuring Covid, I ordered the Bak Zhang via delivery. The glutinous rice was undercooked, so the dumpling were unpalatable. I do not have this issue when I buy the Bak Zhang from the shop. I like to eat Kim Choo Bak Zhang.\n\nWas gifted this by a friend and when I know it\u2019s from Kim Choo, you enjoy every moment because you know there\u2019s a bit of heritage, history, heirloom you are experiencing.\n\nThe glutinous rice layer breaks apart softly to reveal the filling with anticipation. One mouthful and you experience an alternating taste of sweet and savoury of the chinese five spice powder and lean pork.\n\nThere will be newer flavours; more exotic proteins; colours - and yes that should be the way.\n\nBut I take comfort that there is a homely version we can all return to.\n\n\u2018Kim\u2019 me the zhang cos I \u2018Choo\u2019 the original anytime.\n\nHaving bought from KCKC for years, it\u2019s generally has been ok to good but never quite hitting the 5 stars mark. Perhaps it\u2019s because they spread their products to include obvious 3rd party suppliers. So today we decide to try 1 items. fish cracker  has more flour than fish having eaten this snacks from across Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. it\u2019s also over fried.   Lastly they only accept purchases over $15 if you wish to pay cashless or card or swipe.\n",

My wife went for ban mian as mee hoon kway also sold out..Shouldn't such places cater for enough items if they want to do business... A go to place if you want a quick and fuss free meal.\n\nMy personal review, Malaysia Chiak stall at Singpost generally offers Penang fried kuey teow, a popular Malaysian dish. The overall experience at the stall may vary, but based on customer feedback, the taste and quality of their Penang fried kuey teow is usually average. It's always best to try it for yourself and form your own opinion based on your personal taste preferences.\n\nOverall I feel it\u2019s extremely value for money at $5.50. You get claypot chicken rice with a decent amount of chicken. The rice has a good char and there are tiny bits of salted fish. I think many people give flak about the minimal service but the price reflects the service. It\u2019s one of the cheapest full meals you get in the mall anyways. Not the best claypot rice in SG but definitely above average.\n\nChilli is definitely very good tho. It\u2019s like chicken rice chili but spicier.\n\nUsed to be good when it first started. Food quality and service have deteriorated over time. Recently did take away and the queue system was horrible, its disorganised and staffs are angsty with the need to order and cook... Ended up they did not separate the noodle and it was all soggy...there goes my lunch\n\nWe\u2019ve always liked this place - primarily the Penang fried kway Teow; carrot cake (which I think they have stopped); and the prawn noodles.\nThe fried kway Teow is about just nice - dry fried, not overly oily;\nNext to try is the claypot- looks good and reasonable price.\n",

Reasonably priced.\n\nIconic market in the East... has 2 levels comprising the market and sundry stalls on the Ground level  offering a myriad  of grocery and  market items,  and Hawker dining and retail stalls offering apparel and household items on the Second level. Very crowded especially on weekends. Time for a major renovation to the market area and hawker dining area as it's very congested. A few hawker stalls on the 2nd level are \"Legacy Hawkers\" having existed in the old Geylang Serai Market 50 years ago or more.\n\nYesterday at Geylang Serai, saw charming  44 to 60 Changi Road, mixed commercial and residential shophouse enclave with a post-World War charm. Time seems to stand still here, offering a serene escape from the bustling cityscape. The slow pace of life allows visitors to immerse themselves in the traditional Malay culture and food that permeates the area. From the tantalizing aromas of Malay cuisine to the enchanting sounds of traditional music, Geylang Serai offers a nostalgic retreat, capturing the essence of a bygone era.\n\nAt Geylang Market, you can get almost everything down here. Now under this one stop roof, you can get food, marketing groceries, apparel, fruits & authentic traditional jamu also. Do spent time to wonder around this market be it at level 1 & 2.\n\nClean, spacious and airy (thanks to the high ceiling) hawker centre with many food stalls. Good for locals and tourists alike.\n",

She said $1.50 and she can\u2019t sell it at $1.50 anymore. Okay fine. We asked to add soup, she gave us extra soup in a small bowl and literally just slammed it on our table! Goodness. And there were SO MANY cockroaches around it was super disgusting! Small ones big ones EVERYWHERE! NEVER AGAIN will I ever come back here. First and last time. Food is so-so, just edible. Soup taste has super strong star anise taste and that\u2019s about it. Nothing else. Not tasty.\n\nThis malaysia styled bkt is the kind that I prefer, rather than Singapore's peppery kind. Ordered the mix soup which was not overpowering with herbs. Mixed intestines and parts were generous enough, and I like that the ribs are of smaller sizes that just falls off the bone and easy to eat. Despite eating at peak lunch hours, I hardly perspired. Price is reasonable and they accept visa which is a plus. Will try the dry version in the next visit\n\nOne of the best bkt!!! Love the soup and the chilli with garlic, so malaysia style. They allow refill of soup only once! The green vegetables so sweet and crunchy.\nThey have other food like frog porridge, small side dishes if you don\u2019t like the ribs.\n\nnice Bak Kut teh with herbal flavour.\nThe mutton soup is also good, mutton meet is very tender.\ncrispy intestine is very unique with the spring onion inside. good texture.\nFriendly staff.\n\nHerbal style Bah Ku Teh (pork ribs and organ soup). Youtiao are soggy. We tried signature bah ku teh soup and dry versions and they are nice. We didn\u2019t enjoy the organs. You can also have frog dishes with porridge. A bit pricier in my view.

Delicious and big portion.\n\nOne of the best Nasi Padang restaurants in Singapore. A plethora of dishes on offer, so best to come in a bigger group so that you can share more.

However,\nIt\u2019s kind of obvious that the crabs are not really that fresh, hence the pricing. Other dishes were quite tasty and value of money. The Kai lan vegetables were very tasty, a must order dish in my opinion. Barley tasted too sweet.\n\nIt is ideally situated close to the Aljunied MRT. You can choose between outdoor and air-conditioned sitting.\n\nOn various days, there are special promotions. They had $15 soon hock fish and $45 volcano chicken on Monday and Tuesday, respectively. For specials, give the restaurant a call before you visit.\n\nIt's a manual reservation, and you should ask the restaurant to text you a confirmation in case they accidentally forget your booking\n\nA good location for gatherings of friends and family.\n\nFood was generally good. The salted egg squid was excellent -- squid cooked to perfection and we actually tasted the salted egg! The pork belly was also very good -- flavorful and crispy-tender. Wasn't a fan of the crispy noodles, though. If you order that, ask if you can have the sauce separate so the noodles stay crispy. Also, one of the waiters threw a tantrum while we were there.\n\nI brought my wife for a good meal in Singapore and notice this simple restaurant along the street when I drive . Penang Seafood ...and we drop by for the seafood ..to our suprise that there had been a promotion to the crab . Price so worth for it. At $68 for 2 crabs.  Simply look at the size of the crab.....and it just so delicious \ud83e\udd24\n\nAll the dishes we picked were really good. Especially the spicy bee Hoon and baby squid garlic. They only take reservations for 6 pax and above. For small group walk-ins, come earlier at 6pm. Wait staff are friendly. Open-air Carpark opposite MRT and walk over. Spent sg$107 for 2 carbs, 3 dishes and 4 drinks, great pricing!\n",

Do note Chinese satay doesn't have beef skewers. All skewers were grilled to perfect tenderness. Marinade was a good balance or sweet & savory complimented by the peanut dipping sauce. \ud83d\udc4d\n\nMaybe it\u2019s just my luck that my order of delivered satay tasted like overnight food because I certainly won\u2019t recommend it. I know my photos made them look pretty good but both the mutton and pork texture were dry and absolutely does not represent what good satay is suppose to be. And the Banana Leaf Otah is unusually small for a \u201cBanana Leaf\u201d type otah. It\u2019s not the usual size you and I are familiar with. It\u2019s so small it\u2019s the size of a normal otah or perhaps even smaller. Moreover it did not taste good at all. It tasted flat and like overnight food as well. The chicken wings, although damn skinny, was their saving grace. At least the wings and chilli sauce tasted quite nice. Satay sauce also not bad. But this will be my first and my last time. This place is not for me.\n\nOrder the Pork Belly satay and don\u2019t bother about the rest.\nSimply because the pork belly was so good that the usually pork and chicken pale in comparison \ud83d\ude0a\n\nI will let the photo speak for itself.\n\nWe ordered 10 sticks of chicken satay and all 10 were puny pieces of skewered meat. Behold, each stick actually costs 70 cents!\n\nSatay was well marinated and cuts of meat good sized. The pork belly satay was good! every thou the price is double of the normal pork satay, you do get double the portion as well, so it works out to be the same price. Their prices are really reasonable considering the most satay sellers are asking $0.70 to $0.80 per stick now they are still at $0.60.\n",

Open half shutter and i ask other hawker they also say not sure open or not. I arrive at 11:30am and google say open at 12pm-7pm.  Waited almost 2 hour. Decided to eat briyani at other hawker and wow! its amazing\n\nLove it! A different twist to Malaysian\u2019s halal wantan mee. The beef kut teh is delish! Just be careful of the mala pepper in the soup or you\u2019ll numb your tongue biting it.\n\nThe halal bakuteh was quite different from the usual. This was more on the peppery side. Lots of Big black pepper was inside so be careful when eating.\n\nThe beef was tender and flavourful but also loaded with fats on many of the chunks. If that is a concern to you.. flavour wise it\u2019s wholesome almost identical to mutton soup.\n\nOverall can eat again if you have the feels. Customer service very good. I was carrying a baby and the staff brought the dish to my table.\n\nIt\u2019s my first time trying Bak Kut Teh (don\u2019t worry it\u2019s Halal version). To be honest as a muslim I don\u2019t have the comparison with the real Bak Kut Teh but this one taste good and can smell the spice so nice. Worth to try\ud83d\ude04\n\nCame down on Monday at 5pm plus to try their halal Bak Kut Teh but no longer serving food. Google map state that its open from 10am to 7pm. Should\u2019ve change the timing. Disappointed and waste of time.\n",

I do have friends recommend the tomato noodles.\n\n#2nd review# (a year later)\nThe Sarawak laksa is still very good. The broth, the sliced omelette, and even the prawn paste on the side - I highly recommend it.\n\nI also had stir-fried money cai with egg, which is off-menu. It's decent too.\n\nRare find of Sarawak food place that is selling other than kolo mee and the laksa. Decided to try tomato crispy noodle and it was really good! The tomato gravy is quite tangy and it came with 2 decently sized prawns and some fishcake. The good thing is that they serve free flow pork lard. Friendly staff too.\nOn other occasion, tried the mei cai longevity noodle and kolo mee. The mei cai noodle came with crispy bits of fried prawn, stir fried egg and veggie. Taste is quite mild and comfortable with good portion. Kolo mee noodle is quite QQ and came with quite generous portion too but unfortunately the char siew was finished. Enjoyed the food here!\n\nThe mee suah wz vege is too dry and no taste at all. The noodles also not near to\noriginal taste n served wz green chilli instead of red .\n\nVery interesting East Malaysian food and I enjoyed every meal.

Portion is big and delicious\n\nJoined one of the longest queue at the geylang serai. Tried the malay staple, mee rubus and mee soto. Good but nothing spectacular.\n\nOrdered the laksa Johor. Gravy was authentic, delicious & thick. Though there were no fishcake slices, julienned laksa leaves & slithers of cucumber served on top of the laksa. Basically, it's SGD3.50 for a plate of laksa gravy poured over white, fat & cylindrical rice noodles (which stuck together & made eating them quite unpleasant & inconvenient), with no added protein or vegetable values. For that price, I think it's quite expensive for a serving plate of \"just carbohydrates\".\n\nOne of the best breakfast to go stall here.\n\nThis place serves amazing bowls of laksa. Thick rice noodles swimming in savoury and mildly spicy coconut gravy. There are so many layers of flavours in this dish that to describe it in words is not justified. It is heaven in a bowl. Highly highly recommended!\n",

Not too thick and not too watery.\n\nThis stall is operated by a husband and wife team (William and Mei Ling)\n\nIt serves a very good lontong, full of vegetables (cabbage and long bean), come with one hard boiled egg and a fried tau kwa (half slice). The soup is rich with coconut milk and lots of dried shrimps, really delicious. The Chilli Paste is spicy and very flavorful. Price is reasonable at $4.00 per serving.\n\nAs I was sitting right in front of the stall today, I overheard that the lontong was sold out - that was 9:35am!\n\nThe stall serves very nice mee rebus as well. Stall lady (Mei Ling - Indonesian Chinese from Medan) told me she would recommend me to add her special Perkedel if I was ordering the Mee Rebus or Mee Siam.\n\nDelicious Indo style mee rebus, lotong & mee siam run by an Indonesian family.\n\nLove the broth and the fried potato. Pardon my photo and do not be fooled by the plain looking bowl of noodles as i asked for no tau ghey and no spring onion.\nChilli is spicy though.\n\nTheir curry/ sardines puffs is worth waking up early in the morning to get. Mee Soto and Mee rebus is also one of the best I have eaten in SG!\n",

Too soft that the moment I sit, I can feel the legs start to spread. Sometimes I have to put an extra chair to make it sturdy. Can the management change the chairs, please?\n\nOne of the best Malay snacks around. Their epok epok are damn shiok. Jack fruit fritters also shiok. Same quality but cheaper than their T3 branch.\n\nWhenever I am within the Geylang Serai area, Mr. Teh Tarik is one of my favorite places to go.\n\nWe went there to get our Hokkien mee and fried Kway Teow for lunch. It is near the entrance just beside the pisang goreng stall.\n\nAs always, the 2 dishes we ordered are Hokkien mee and fried kway teow. Ironically, although the menu is Chinese but the cook is of Indian heritage and he cooks it perfectly and fast too. You don't have to wait long to get your food.\n\nThe Hokkien mee was flavourful and not too soggy. Fresh prawns and ingredients. The Fried Kway Teow with clams is spot on too. The \"char\" taste is present with the right amount of sweet dark sauce.\n\nThen coupled with teh tarik to end your meal is so blissfully satisfying. Give it a try if you are nearby.\n\nWarung Syuhadah nasi lemak and nasi rawon taste wasn't nice. All 4 of my family agreed. Chicken was so dry and hard. Begedil was very very oily too.\n",

And the people working were so kind to explain everything to us. Can\u2019t wait to go back!\n\nFirst time here, not sure is it good\nHad craving for indian rojak...\nAnd this is the only store selling that.\nPicked my food, they chop it up then done...\nI was shocked... never re-fry?\nThen how to be crispy...\nBut it was soooooo goood.\nIts flavourful and crispy for some items..\nSauce is very old school taste...\nI love it!\nWill be back...\n\nSaw a long queue during lunch and decided to join. The rojak is ok, many choices to pick, I like that they have tempeh and fried tau kwa, which are my favourites. The deep fried stuff does not taste oily. The dipping sauce was light, on the sweet side and complements the rojak well. Overall it was a nice first try for me and I may patronise the stall again if I dream of eating indian rojak.\n\nAn interesting experience. Lots of locals come for authentic rojak. Love some of the stuff (fried fish cakes etc) while some might be just too salty for my taste (animal liver)The secret sauce is flavorful- makes all the difference.\n",

Most of them are doing well, good flavor and charging was high too.\n\nFor this stall, the quality of Malay dishes was good, full of flavor with variety of choices.\n\nI brought a take away Nasi Padang which consists of 2 vegetables and 1 chicken thighs meat. Cost me $7. Which is usually $5.50 to $6 before covid.\n\nVery understand that the food cost nowadays is increasing tremendously. But I still feel the increase is way too high, perhaps $6.50 is more reasonable.\n\nBeside that, I must say that their service attitude was good, polite and patient when selecting your dishes from many they had offered.\n\nOverall, I  pleased by their great taste of food they offered, definitely I will come back again but probably not so often due to the high cost of food.\n\nHad Nasi Rawon for takeaway and I must say that the rawon is lacking of the real gravy of buah keluak. Tasted more on turmeric. Begedil & paru are coated with batter which frankly there's no need to. Sambal belacan is \ud83d\udcaf\n\nI've had better rawon elsewhere just that this stall have to give a miss.\n\nBest. Sedap. But like most place all food price went up.\n\nGreat food! The nangka vege and kupang is outstanding. Better value than Sinar Pagi. Thoroughly enjoyed both the rendang and ayam lemak as well.\n\nI usually not like this,but it is too much.Bought nasi padang at this shop this morning (21 October 2022). Rending is abit chewy. Telur Burung tasted sweet. Sambal is bland.no taste .it's like having a covid symptoms. Best part is,the WHOLE FOOD BASI(STALE). my mum is the type of person whom doesn't like to waste food even though it is going to be fatal. Price was charged $7.80. I hope my mum won't have stomach problem. Wanna do business,do it professionally.  Don't start later on by saying, \"melayu gini,suka dengki sama melayu..please do the right way..  1/100.\n",

Their focus is on delivering quality creative and flavourful Indonesian dishes.  Portion is quite good.  Nice simple cosy cafe in the heartland with limited seating capacity.  Good to make reservations during peak time.  Hope to try more dishes next time!\n\nVery authentic Indonesian food.\n\nI ordered the oxtail soup and the grilled chicken.\n\nThe oxtail was so fall off the bone tender and bustling with amazing flavours.\n\nThe grilled chicken was very well grilled with a nice caramelized finish.\n\nLoved the chilli paste that came with the dishes. Rustic that comes with a punch.\n\nWill definitely be back for my Indonesian food fix!\n\nKeep up the good work!\n\nThis is my first time trying fried oxtail, I liked the juiciness of meat with a hint of salt. The traditional oxtail soup feels healthy without the overwhelming strong flavour compared to the others that I tried.\nA must-try is their signature ginger drink! Not spicy and smells so fragrant!!!\n\nI enjoyed the quiet ambience and the pleasant service. Gonna bring my whole family here the next time!\n\nGreat location with a multi storey carpark just beside the restaurant. Staff are very friendly and great with recommendations. Food comes freshly prepared and the sauce on the chicken was very flavorful and the soups they gave with each dish are also worthy as dishes themselves. They have quite a few oxtail options and those are definitely worth a try also.\n\nWent here on a Monday afternoon. Restaurant was very quiet. We ordered fried oxtail with rice, fried chicken with rice, corn fritters, ginger drink and rose drink (bandung). Oxtail was well-cooked but tasted a bit salty. Fried chicken was nicely cooked. I liked their new item, the corn fritters. Ginger drink was nice but could have been more flavourful. We liked the ambience but would have liked items to be more affordable. Place was also very stylish and posh looking but our cutlery kept making loud noises as we ate. Nice place to go once in a while.\n",

Sambal was good.\n\nJay and Chris,\n\nI wanted to express our sincere gratitude for the delightful meal we enjoyed as a family from Tambuah Mas. The flavors were exceptional, and every dish surpassed our expectations, making it a truly memorable dining experience.\n\nYour dedication to providing outstanding service shines through, even in a takeaway setting. It's evident that Tambuah Mas takes pride in ensuring that each customer, whether dining in or enjoying a meal at home, receives a culinary delight.\n\nOur family thoroughly enjoyed every bite, and I can assure you that we'll be singing Tambuah Mas's praises to family and friends\n\nThank you both  and team  for consistently delivering excellence and for making our family meal so enjoyable.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nMohd Hanafiah\n\nFood was moderate. The food wasn\u2019t serve hot and the taste was okay. Felt really bloated after eating, immediately I knew food was prepared way earlier and not freshly cooked and serve. I have very sensitive gastric. To go back or not? Nah.\n\nThis is not the first time we dine at Tambuah Mas.  The food is good, quite authentic.  Service is not the best, probably due to shortage of staff and poor training.\n\nThe experience from making reservation to dining was excellent. They were accommodating to our big group and the service during the dining pleasant. Food was good as usual. Highlight is the deep fried fish which was fresh and crispy. The beef rendang was a bit dry compared to what I had at the Tanglin Shopping Centre branch. But overall the food and service did not disappoint and we all enjoyed our dinner.\n",

Food turned out DELICIOUS and surprisingly even the teh bing is yummy. Highly recommend this place to everyone! I only have two points for improvement to raise. The tahu telor was super salty. Skip this dish please. Also, unsure why the lighting was crazy dim. I could barely see what I was eating. Please turn up the lights! It didnt help the ambience, trust me. But overall, a wonderful meal.\n\nTasted wee bit on the sweet side otherwise ok.  Quality if rice bit too broken.  Lopez not bad teh tarik too dilute.  Pricing ok.\n\nLove the chicken rendang and sambal brinjal. The chicken rendang is rich in flavour and will give you the mmmmm factor!!  Beef rendang is also a favourite here though, I didn't order it.  For drinks, just order the teh botol.\n\nThe perks of eating here are no queues to wait in, and a fairly comfortable seating atmosphere, however, the food isn\u2019t as good as the ones on north bridge rd. The gravies and dishes fall short of a real oomph and flavor. Ok for a quick meal if in the area but I\u2019d rather opt for the real deal elsewhere.\n",

                  "reviews": "\n\nA gem that located at 2nd floor of Lucky Plaza. It's Indonesian kind of stall (depot makan). Couple times we tried their food and we found that their ayam geprek with sambal bali / matah is the must have item when you're here. The price was justify the taste and amount of the food.\n\nTheir fried boneless chicken was nice, the fragant rice and everything was in generous portion. We tried their other sambal but nothing can beat their sambal bali, the rice vermicelli toward hot & strong white pepper-y smell and taste.\n\nOne of the same staffs couple times looked so unfriendly, maybe too tired after working long hour but wore a mask still couldn't hide the look. Since the person's working in service industry he needs to spread the joy, welcoming spirit and friendliness.\n\nSince their sweet martabak is really sought after, it's better for you to order the sweet martabak in advance as they have a limited slot in a day.\n\nThey have launched a new menu in their new outlet and boy it was so good!\n\nI tried the Soto Betawi, which is a hearty beef soup simmered in a coconut milk based broth. Its light on the palate, not thick and the umami, they nailed it!\n\nOne of my new favorite Indonesian food eatery! I was so glad when I found out that I could order via whatsapp and arranged my own courier because I stay in the east and rarely got the chance to go Orchard. Tried almost everything in their menu and none was ever disappointing.\n\nMy favorites are soto betawi, ayam geprek, batagor and tempe bacem. My hubby and I are tempeh (soybean cake) lovers, so we love to try tempeh dishes every chance we got, and we never find tempeh bacem (seasoned tempeh) anymore in Singapore after the last eatery that had it closed down long ago. We were elated that Gading have it, and it was very very delicious! Sadly it was unavailable this time around, but it definitely become our must order dish. The ayam geprek is tender, generous portion and great with any kind of sambal, have tried the sambal mercon, kemangi and bali - all were amazingly good with different levels of spiciness. The soto betawi soup is so rich I always finish it till the last drop. And the batagor taste authentic and very nice, just that the portion is a bit small for its price.\n\nTried the martabak in two separate occasions, black charcoal (chocolate and cheese with charcoal dough) and classic (chocolate, cheese, peanuts). Had the classic one with add-on wijsman dutch butter at additional $4 and no peanuts. Both were amazing! Adding wijsman butter just made it even more delicious, the extra cost was a tad pricey though, maybe I\u2019d say it\u2019s worth it if it were $3 price point.\n\nOverall, Gading offers great Indonesian food that I will definitely love to order again and again.\n\nI was walking around 313@somerset when I saw this little shop at the basement. I was quite excited to see they are selling martabak (basically Indonesian version of pancake/min Jiang kueh that is more decadent and unhealthy). My normal go-to for martabak is pancake boss at Bugis so decided to give this one a try.\n\nI ordered the original and top up $4 for wijsman butter. Total damage is $19.90. A bit on the pricy side when compared to pancake boss. The martabak can easily feed 2-3 people (better to share due to high calories).\n\nThe martabak is delicious, sweet and a little salty from the cheese. They use good quality chocolate rice (much better than the one used by pancake boss).\n\nNice to see more martabak shops in SG (there is another martabak shop in ION Orchard but I have not tried it).\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this shop for your martabak fix.\n\nGive it 5 stars as the main course were so delicious. The ikan Bakar is nicely done with the kicap manis sauce. Ayam penyet is soft and tasty. Thank for serving us diff sambal as requested. We also ordered original martabak in advanced but the filling still abit bland.\n",

I would recommend chili prawns, the gravy is flavourful. I will definitely come back to try other dishes! This place is suitable for company, family and friends gathering, why not?? There have set up the beautiful partition so it gives us privacy when dining.\n\nI recently had the pleasure of dining at Bumbu Restaurant in the Arab/Muslim neighborhood of Singapore, and it was a unique experience. The restaurant\u2019s decor is a refreshing blend of Thai and Indonesian antiques, which added a distinctive touch to the ambiance.\n\nThe food at Bumbu is a fusion of Thai and Indonesian flavors, which made for an interesting culinary journey. I ordered the Tom Kha soup, which was incredibly flavorful and packed with chicken. I also tried the Thai-style chili basil, although it was a bit on the salty side. The olive fried rice was a delightful addition to the meal.\n\nOne of the standout aspects of Bumbu was their excellent service. The staff was friendly and attentive, which enhanced the overall dining experience.\n\nIn conclusion, Bumbu Restaurant is definitely worth a visit if you\u2019re looking for a unique blend of Thai and Indonesian flavors in a beautifully decorated setting. I had a great time, and I believe you will too!\n\nLove the ambience and the decoration.\n\nBeef rendang is good, very tender and flavourful. Fried kangkong is interesting, paired well with the sauce that is slightly spicy and tangy. Telur tahu is nice. Must try the sambal (caution, \ud83d\udd25).\n\nI found the durian chendol too thick (coconut cream) for my liking.\n\nHad a great experience here this evening! First time here and was impressed with the service and food quality. While the portions seemed a bit small, it allowed for us to order more variety! We tried the chicken buah keluak (love the spoons that came with the dish to help with the nut!), signature rendang, chap Chye, prawn egg, fish maw soup, and ended off with chendol! Everything tasted very authentic! We really enjoyed the sambal belachan too, which was complimentary! Will be back again to try more dishes in future! Service was excellent, and the interior was beautiful!\n\nNot much food pictures because too tasty and hungry to eat immediately. \ud83d\ude02\nJokes aside I appreciate their innovation and effort to making their dishes as they planned to taste as possible. I would say their dishes has many influences from Chinese, Malaysia, Indonesia, even Thailand. Very innovative. Their interior aesthetics were so picture worthy.\n",

Sambal fish is so-so,abit sweet ,not to my liking . Nasi Padang also not bad, consist of what I think is vegetarian chicken rendang,soy tofu,vege lemak lodeh and sambal egg belado.Orh luak with oyster mushroom is also good, not oily at all , taste on point , actually better than the real thing.Bak mie is tasty,noodle springy,mock shredded chicken is unnecessary,the fried wonton is good though,I settle with level 1 spiciness which to me is pretty hot. Satay is so-so,don't really taste like the real thing, tasted like regular deep fried mock meat, satay sauce can't mask save it either.\nService is super fast, 5 different person served us, all are very warm, friendly and are always smiling. Even though we came just 30 mins before their break time which is at 3pm.We feel welcomed!\n\nMy first on an Indonesian take of vegetarian fare, as strongly insisted by the friend as a counter-proposal to my initial spot for vegetarian food. Small and cozy restaurant along the ground floor close to the entrance. Great spread of Indonesian food in vegetarian version if you are game for it.\n\nPlace is cooling, sheltered, and very accessible from the MRT.\n\nI had a wonderful experience at Warong Ijo!\n\nThis new outlet is located conveniently near the MRT making it more accessible.\n\nThe vegetarian dishes they offer are simply amazing \u2013 full of flavor and beautifully presented. The friendly staff made my visit even more enjoyable. It's not often you find a place that caters so well to vegetarians while providing top-notch service. I highly recommend trying their delicious dishes and soaking in the welcoming atmosphere.\n\nWe have never tasted Indonesian vegetarian, find the dishes not bad but nothing special. We ordered the Rendang fried rice, sanbal sweet potato leaves, otahs and gardo gardo. Find it pricey n felt the portion were not justified, especially the gardo gardo.\n\nVery happy to come across this vegetarian restaurant!\n\nAll the dishes we had were full of flavors yet not too salty. I particularly like Orh Luak (oyster mushroom omelette), Lumpiah Goreng (spring rolls), and stir fried spinach.\n\nRendang lion mane mushroom was quite spicy and oily.\n\nSaturday dinner was very busy. A very lively place.\n",

Pig liver kailan was tasty too, cook to perfection and the sauce is just so savoury that it\u2019s perfect with the rice. Lastly we had the chicken feet with a Thai spicy sauce. Apparently this is a new appetiser and not every time has this dish. Very \u5f00\u80c3, sweet and sour. The chicken feet is deboned so very chewy and easy to eat. Staffs was nice too, very friendly and attentive to our needs. We ordered all this with 4 rice, 4 drinks and even takeaway 2 more packs of chicken rice, total with gst about $120. Quite worth it for the quality of food. Their specialty always never disappoints me. Highly recommended if u wanna try Chinese cuisine\n\nFrequented this place for the past 10 years. Taste deteriorate compare to years ago. The fried hor fun no longer have the wok hey. Steam chicken still good as per usual apart from more oily. The pork belly have more fats than meat. One thing good is the service have improved compare to the past. Avoid lunch hour as place is crowded. But too little people then the aircon is not on for all. Need to request for them to on.\n\nVery nice chicken rice, better than the opposite Loy Kee. The price is more to a high price but they use kampong chicken.\n\nA must visit for tourist\n\nGreat Chicken Rice with the \"olden day taste\" and the other dishes such as the Lotus Root Soup, Fried Beancurd, Stuffed Meat Beancurd and the Eggs Fried Prawns.\n\nOh ya Boon Tong Kee i left my powerbank yesterday! Please help me keep leh. Thank you \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\n\nVery good white chicken, we ordered chicken for 2 pax portion with a sambal kangkong.\n\nIt is quite crowded during peak hours but we didn't have to wait too long before our seats.\n\nChicken is perfect with their soy sauce, and goes well with their fragrant rice. Honestly 1 bowl isn't enough due to how tasty it is but the price point is abit of the higher end.\n\nSambal kangkong was delicious which I suspect was cooked with abit of the chicken broth or essence on top of the usual sambal - an unique taste if you want something new but tasty!\n\nOverall a decent 5 star for the price.\nP.s. please ask the staff to debone your chicken otherwise you get more bones than meat..\n",

Turns out, it's surprisingly good!\n\nThe Tahu Telor is a must-try for all! It's so difficult to get this dish nowadays at your neighbourhood hawker as it's quite labour intensive to make. Soft tofu cubes are deliciously coated in a big mound of egg, the tastiest parts being the flossy burnt ends. Add in a generous heaping of beansprouts, julienned cucumbers and carrots in tangy kicap Manis sauce. The peanut gravy was served separately, so that you can control the amount of sauce/ sweetness you want in your dish. We usually cannot finish a Tauhu Telor but as this didn't feel as oily and heavy, finishing it was a breeze. There wasn't a lot of oil leftover on the plate either.\n\nThe Sour Vegetable Soup is good as an appetizer or palate cleanser between heavy dishes. Cabbages, long beans, turnips and peanuts were simmered in a sweet-sour broth with flavours of tamarind, galangal, turmeric and shallots. It was refreshing but I found the peanuts undercooked and rather crunchy. Not sure whether I love or hate nuts done as such.\n\nThe Fried Pomfret was quite basic, it was lightly battered in some turmeric cornstarch and served with Spice Level 5 Fiery Chili. This dark coloured Chili gives quite a good punch unblocking my blocked nose but it was not strong enough to mask the fishiness of the fish. I felt that the pomfret was not super fresh as I could taste some staleness near its belly portion.\n\nLastly, we had the Mozzarella Smashed Chicken cutlet. The chicken meat was really tender and not dry at all, the bits of flour coating hanging on it was flavourfully soaked with mozzarella cheese, which was thrown atop the chicken and lightly torched before serving. We chose a Level 1 Sweet Chili to be served with it. This Chili is great for beginning spice eaters as it's super smooth and sweet with an oniony taste.\n\nThe smashed fried duck really came off easily when poked with a fork, we tried the Level 3 Shrimp Paste chili with it and the pairing turned out heavenly. I found the Level 3 chili a little sweeter than expected but it was well received by the others.\n\nThe Honey Marinated Beef Ribs were also thoroughly pre-simmered to achieve tenderness, although meat grain was slightly stringy and tough, the sweet kicap manis marinade made the dish whets up a good appetite and made it easier to swallow. The Level 2 Green Chili was one of the least sweet chili, with aromatic notes of coriander and green pepper.\n\nThe Teh Tarik Kosong Ice is really rich and good. It was full bodied with vanilla notes with a rich, milky mouthfeel.\nIt's a nice place to overindulge and grab a deep fried dinner. Cleanliness of the place could be improved. There were strands of hair and bits of batter on the benches we chose.\n\nWill revisit to try more dishes!\n\nTotal damage: $37-42 for 3 pax\n\nYummy Indonesian food.  Surprisingly good.  The chilli has up to 7 levels to be selected.\n\nWe ordered Ayam Bakar Taliwang Kampung (S$14.50), Iga Bakar (beef) (S$14.50), and Tahu Telor (S$8.50).  We opted for level 3 chilli which was spicy and good enough for our liking.\n\nWill definitely return for other food.\n\nUpdate as of 28 Oct 2022:\nTried the fried chicken, gado gado and my favourite tahu telor.  The chicken was nice.  As for the gado gado, it was just ok as it had the same gravy/sauce as tahu telor.\n\nPortion abit small but the taste is cook. Chicken are nicely fried and tender. Chilli Aso shiok but quite spicy\n\nRecommend to try!\n\nThere's a good spread of Indonesian dishes. The food was good. The asam rebus soup tasted good but could be better if they also use belinjau nuts and leaves (but I know it's not easy to find in Singapore). The tahu telor was also good but could be improved by having more tahu to attain a good balance between the tahu & telor. The grilled chicken was okay although the meat was a little dry; could be a bit more juicy and moist and tasted better if fresh chicken was used instead of frozen chicken. The fish (tilapia and pomfret) dishes were my favourite. The fish meat was juicy and tender whilst the exterior was crispy and well prepared. I will visit again and will want to try their equivalent of beef bakso and other dishes also. Well done guys!\n\nA little too pricey. $10.30 for 1 ayam penyet (takeaway). Rice was also charged. Taste of the food was not great. I will stick to the good old ayam penyet ria or president in the future.\n",

                  "reviews": "\n\nCame all the way from KL for a work trip and stopped by this resto for a good lunch.\n\nThe food is tasty, we took a few lauk lauk with rice. The tauhu goreng was good, and it deserves another repetition the next time I stop by Singapore.\n\nFood portion is good. Could be a lot if you\u2019re not a big eater. But still worth it and your tummy will thank you \ud83e\udd23\n\nThey have outdoor seatings as well as air conditioned area upstairs. You have to order at the counter first. It could be quite busy during lunch hour, but worth the wait for the food !\n\nSpoiled by choices, vast selection of mains and side dishes on display. Tried a handful of dishes and most of them are fragrant and tasty. Their vegetable side dishes were also well executed. Kind of slightly salty for me.\n\nHowever, prices here are at a premium, especially with the limiting portion served. Good authentic nasi padang with their main customers observed as tourist during my visit. Not a meal to be enjoyed daily at this price point. And especially during lunch time, the hot weather is a push away factor for me to revisit.\n\nRumah Makan Minang Pte Ltd is one of the best Malay food restaurants I have ever been to. This hidden gem located on Kandahar Street serves authentic nasi Padang that is so tasty, you will be dreaming about it for days after. The menu offers a lot of selection, but be prepared to wait in line as the dishes can run out quickly.\n\nThe restaurant's atmosphere is cozy and welcoming, and the staff members are friendly and accommodating. I highly recommend trying their Rendang and Soto Ayam, which are so flavorful and cooked to perfection. The dishes are served fresh and hot, and the portions are generous.\n\nThe only downside is that the restaurant is quite popular and sometimes can be crowded, so I suggest getting there early or being prepared to wait in line. Overall, if you're looking for authentic Malay food that is both delicious and affordable, Rumah Makan Minang Pte Ltd is the place for you.\n\nI came here a few times and the queue really speaks for how popular this place is. The fun starts with queuing and ordering the food. It\u2019s also good to come here in a bigger group, so you get to savour the various dishes. My favourite is the tender beef rendang and the tauhu telur. Their best part is that there is an air-conditioned seating area on level 2 that is accessible by a staircase at the side.\n\nI've eaten malay cooking for aeons; the taste and flavours of each kind of dish are ingrained in my DNA. Sadly, for such a popular name as Minang, the food is poor in taste and very pricy. For the lunch I had, it cost me $45 sgd.\nThere are many small stalls in foodcourt that can rival this restaurant.\nThe taste is just not up to standard, lack of salt, flavour and richness of Malay cooking. If its about healthy living, there are alternatives that they can add to maintain the standard. Like KFC, McD, they remain consistent throughout the eras... if these big names can do it, so can they.\n",

                  "reviews": "\n\nl I must say, this place is one of the best spots to savor a delicious plate of Ayam Penyet. I tend to opt for their BBQ chicken over the fried version, simply due to personal preference. While their service might come across as blunt, it's undeniably efficient. And let me tell you, their fried tofu is a must-try; it's a personal favorite of mine. The self-serving free flow of soup is a major plus. Price-wise, it's a bit on the higher side, typically exceeding $15. All in all, if you're in the area, it's definitely a great choice to relish some Ayam Penyet!\n\ncame by for dinner before catching the Singapore vs Thailand match. impressed with how fast their food was served to speed up turnover. loved the crisp of their fried chicken, as well as the spiciness of their sambal chilli. remember to help yourselves to the complimentary chicken soup too near the drinks counter, it's really tasty! \ud83c\udf72\n\nSurprise, surprise, we didn't expect much at all, thinking it was just another average restaurants, we were so delighted we had one of our most memorable dining experiences.\nThe grilled chicken, satays, beef rendang, were cooked to perfection! This was the closest thing to eating in Jakarta. The price is reasonable too, this will be our favorite to eat when we crave Indonesian food.\n\nGood food. Self serve soup. Good variety of options to choose from. Fairly good portion side. The grill beef feels quite dry for me but the rest was good. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f good serve fairly quickly.\nHave good seatings for group. Maybe just me but it\u2019s was a bit warm inside the restaurant. Not a bad feed but I expected better? Reasonable price for the location.\n\nYummy Ayam Penyet and other Is Indonesian dishes at affordable prices.\n\nThe chicken was succulent and crispy without being greasy. The accompanying tofu and tempeh were very good too. Tofu was soft on the inside and tempeh was crispy. The catfish was very generously sized. Overall, I would say the portions were generous.\n\nOnly dish that was a a bit of a letdown was the kangkong which was a little soggy. Still, we will return for other dishes.\n",

Sambal wasn't spicy enough but chicken portion was good. Iced lime drink was refreshing. Fried rice was on point.\n\nThe food was okie. Pricing wise it is slightly cheaper than a few other popular brands.  Overall service is ok too. Attentive service and friendly boss. The only unpleasant experience was the smelly menu. Guess the material was made in PU leather. Spoilt my mood.  They should change their menu\u2026.  Very unpleasant.\n\nThe nasi kuning was above average - quite fragrant.   The soup ayam noodles was really good. The satay sauce was good but the chicken lacks of marination.  Overall I give 4 stars for food but the smelly menu worths only 1 star.\n\n[updated: i visited agn for lunch and was happi. ordered P2 dis time rd]\n\ntheir rendang beef was really good. i ordered the rendang jawa timur which came in 3 big cubes. for a small eater like me, i could only finished 2.5 cubes with white rice. the lady at the counter was really nice to offer me a glass of warm water when i told her im not ordering any drinks. would return agn next time to try other dishes.\n\nTake away gado gado $9.90 and so small portion with 2 cubes rice cake 4 cubes potato abit of tofu and no tempeh. The portion take out vs dine in is huge difference. This is not\nHow you do business\n\nPost lunch time was easier to get a table for 2 on weekend. Staff took our orders within minutes of deciding. Food came in acceptable time and was piping hot. Delightful service and overall had a wonderful lunch.\n",

Taste was just right \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d service was prompt and attentive but they kept on offering to clear when we were not done and the place was not crowded. Will definitely come again\n\nBad service especially the man with white hair. Can\u2019t remember his name. Worst attitude ever. Don\u2019t allow my gf and myself in even when my mum was in the toilet. But not sure why some was allowed to go in when their friends took more than 20-30 min to reach. Food standard drop. Tauhu telur felt like I was eating telur only. Gado gado peanut sauce over cooked. Smelled of burnt peanuts. Seems like there is only half egg and vege with little potato. Horrible standard. Enping also not crispy anymore. Definately not coming back again. I am giving only 2 stars instead of one because one of the Chinese guy was friendly.\n\nDate of Visit: 6 July 2023\n\nDelicious authentic Indonesian cuisine.\nBoth professional and family setting.\nExpect crowds during peak hours.\nHighly recommended.\n\nWe ordered quite a lot of dishes today (more than the pics I could share) for Mom's birthday but the table was filled up so quickly we had to start eating and we had no time to continue with photo taking \ud83d\ude05 Overall the food was nice. Tahu telor is very nice. A pity the beef rendang had a mixture of meat that was quite tough. The restaurant gave us a complimentary chendol for my mom's birthday. They also allowed us to bring our own cake for cutting and provided paper plates! Overall, it was a good experience.\n\nWent there for dinner, as it was on Friday night it was packed with people.\nWe do have to queue for a while to get a table. So if anyone had a plan to go on weekends you might need to be patient as the waiting time could be longer. Food wise was ok.Dining experience, maybe the waitress could jot down or pay more attention when customers order as I have to regularly check on them for the item that I order which end up was not be key in. Understandable that the staff are tired for the long working hours. But something could do better in serving wise. Price wise seem ok for me as it in town area. Overall 5/10\n",

Portion pathetic . $13 for this food !!\n\nNice nasi padang. The beef rendang is good and traditional. Rempah of the rendang is great and fresh. Ask for extra gravy for rendang as it is more traditional dry style. Other dishes is good too. They are generous with the gravies so that added complexity to the dish. I think firstly the dishes are traditional and what dish we choose to balance with each other is important. It is almost the same for all nasi padang too. Overall it is a great gem for authentic nasi padang. Well done!\n\nOne of the best nasi Padang in Toa Payoh. The beef rendang is stew till very soft n tender.\n\nAuthentic Indonesian style nasi Padang done very well at good prices. Very popular with a queue during lunch time. Can tell many are regulars.\n\nThe gravy is flavourful and not overpowering spicy which is great for me. Also lotsa variety to choose from. The beef looks really tender even though I chose the Sotong, which is fresh and tender.\n\nIt is a true local treasure that brings the authentic flavors of Malay cuisine to our neighborhood. If you're in search of a memorable dining experience that celebrates the heart and soul of Malay culture, look no further.

Very happy with our experience, will definitely recommend to others :)\n\nI recently dined at IndoChili restaurant in Singapore, and it was a truly positive experience. From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with warm hospitality that set the tone for the entire meal. The highlight of my visit was undoubtedly the authentic taste of Indonesian cuisine that I savored. Each dish was a delightful journey through the rich and diverse flavors of Indonesia.\n\nThe menu offered a wide range of options, allowing me to explore various regional specialties. The rendang was particularly outstanding, with its tender, slow-cooked beef infused with a symphony of spices. The satay skewers were a flavorful delight, and the sambal had just the right level of heat to awaken my taste buds.\n\nThe ambiance of IndoChili restaurant was also a significant factor in my enjoyment. The cozy interior design, adorned with Indonesian decor, created an immersive atmosphere. The staff were attentive and knowledgeable, making recommendations that enhanced my culinary adventure.\n\nOverall, IndoChili restaurant in Singapore is a must-visit for anyone seeking an authentic taste of Indonesian cuisine. The combination of delicious food, warm service, and a charming atmosphere left me with a memorable and highly positive dining experience. I can't wait to return and explore more of their tantalizing offerings.\n\nComing there in almost evening for dinner. I ordered nasi goreng sate (fried rice with chicken satay), nasi goreng seafood (fried rice with seafood), and lemontea.\nNasi gorengs's taste is actually good, authentic, it taste same like i ate when I still in Indonesia, approved. Satay's also quiet good and tender, but the gravy is 4/5 because its too smooth and dont have cutted peanut texture but okay lah, still acceptable. Lemontea also okay.\nTip: if you like nasi goreng spicier you need to tell the waitress/cashier to give you more chili because mine is not too spicy.\nGreat services comes from the manager and waitress aunty who treat us equally with another visitors. They also helpful.\nAnother plus point: atmksphere was very cozy and they played Indonesian traditional sonha so it will take you too your old day and makes you relax&nostalgic.\nProbably will come back again to explore another foods.\n\nGreat experience, had a variety of dishes with some groupmates. Service at the restaurant was very attentive and made us feel at ease. When our food went cold while waiting for one member, server Doreen even placed our soto ayam over a heater so that it would remain warm. Dishes are all traditional fare and delicious, nasi goreng sate especially is quite a decent portion for the price. The drinks were a good surprise, the strawberry tea genuinely shocked me at how fast i finished it \ud83d\ude02 if you're willing to take the price this restaurant is definitely worth the time\n",

The chicken is incredibly tender and generously flavored, especially with the extra spicy chili if you're a spice enthusiast. For those leaning towards sweetness, the ayam bakar or griller chicken is an excellent choice, accompanied by delectable tempe and tahu.\n\nThe service is commendable, and there are no hassles with payment via PayWave. Highly recommended for a satisfying and flavorful Indonesian food dining experience.\n\nGood quality, tasty Ayam Penyet served in a fast food manner.\n\nChicken is moist on the inside and crispy on the outside without being oily. Tempeh is crispy. Tofu is nice and soft on the inside. The portions are fairly generous too.\n\nGreat place for a quick meal.\n\nI must say that I\u2019m very surprised by the portion of the food. Just take the fish for example - it cost me SGD13++ via GrabFood and the portion is huge (and it arrived crispy and hot too!).\n\nThe taste is good too - I like the sweet black sauce with a touch of onions and the chilli sauce that isn\u2019t too spicy.\n\nFlavorful fall off the bone tender crispy fried chicken leg and awesome sambal chilli. Perfect combi. The chicken satay is very chunky, tender and moist. Gado gado was nice too. Lots of crispy belinjau crackers topping. Very generous portions for low prices. Friendly staff. Shiok.\n\nBack again for penyet, tahu telur and mangoes. Shiok.\n\nI previously ordered delivery from this restaurant and enjoyed the food, so I decided to dine in today. However, I found that the quality of the food for dine-in and delivery was about the same. I ordered the oxtail soup and fried chicken, and while they tasted okay, they were only warm.\n\nWhen I entered the restaurant, the waitress did not serve me and I had to find a table myself. I figured I need to order via a QR code and had the option to pay on our phone or at the counter before our food arrived.\n\nUnfortunately, the staff's attitude left something to be desired. This restaurant is popular for its food delivery service, and there were several delivery drivers coming in to collect food. One of the orders was not checked and ended up being picked up by the wrong driver. When the correct driver arrived, the staff refused to take responsibility for the mistake and make up for it, despite having plenty of food in the kitchen and not being busy with other orders.\n\nAfter witnessing the incident, I've decided that I will no longer order delivery from this restaurant. My decision is not only based on the impact it has on the delivery person, but also on the hungry customer who's waiting for their food.\n",

Have gone to the place few times and the place delivers nice consistent flavour.\nIt\u2019s nice they allow walk in also and give the timing , not put all into reservation only\n\nSweat worthy dishes, it's been a while since i didn't get to enjoy nasi padang at this level. The dishes are packed with umanis and flavours. Worth to orders are beef rendang, fried egg, sambal (on its own) and ikan asam pedas. I had 2 and a half packs of rice. Oh, forget to mention that the rice is the unsung hero of the meal, steam to perfection and the chef is care enough to add in some butterfly pea juices to make it slightly blueish.\n\nBravo! Definitely will bring friends and family here again\n\nI think my favourite of all will be Ikan Goreng Balado because it was fried till crispy on the outside and not too dry on the inside, along with their Chilli Sauce, it was match make from heaven. Next will be their Emping Belinjo which dipping with belachan lime mixture was a whole new experience at least for me. Tahu Telor was okay with the sweet, nutty sauce drizzled over. Kangkong Belachan wasn't spicy enough in my expectation for this dish. The portion of their steamed rice wrapped in banana leaves was just right for me. Chendol was okay. Will come again.\n\nSpeedy service. Seated, Ordered, Served at break neck speed and efficiency.\n\nFood was great, an absolute joy. Would prefer a thicker rojak sauce for my tahu telor. The ikan Assam pedas was a little spicy. But otherwise, everything else was marvelous!\n\nThis was one of my favourite Indonesian restaurants. I have been a customer for more than 20 years, since when they were operating from a shop house on the other side of Upper Cross Street.\nI seldom go there nowadays as my favourite dish, the otak fish was always not available due to one reason or another. Now I heard that that they stop wrapping their rice in banana leaves. This is something special for this restaurant, the leaves gives the rice a great fragrance.\nAlthough cost have increased, restaurants should not cut corners especially with items that makes a difference. Old photos attached.\n",

Chilli has spicy kick to eat. Nothing to complain, nothing to rave. A decent Singaporean meal.\n\nVery nice nasi lemak place with yummy side dishes. Tried the ayam lemak which is spiced chicken cooked in coconut milk, very warm to savour on a cold day. Not to miss, the coconut rice felt rich and aromatic. All these for below $10 while dining in an air conditioned place.\n\nLoved the otah. Bought set E to get a variety of ingredients but not sure if it\u2019s worth that price. You can choose the type of chicken you want. Food was good nonetheless! Seating can get a bit cramped as tables are seats are close to one another.\n\nThis place has a home cooked feel about it. The staff are friendly and understanding but not overly stiff.\n\nI ordered classic basic nasi lemak and chose my own sides.  I feel that it may have been more economical to just purchase one of their sets. The beef rendang was soft and the sauce was nice. What I do appreciate is that it had less salt in all of their food.  They make their own Chile which was not too spicy.\n\nI take one star off because 1 plate of food plus 1 drink set me back $10. I won't be able to afford to eat here that regularly.\n\nInteresting Nasi Lemak! Good choices available. I like the flavour of the rice and it's chicken. The combinations is interesting. I do find it a bit pricey but they make up with taste. Will try again when possible.\n",

The grilled chicken drumstick was tender and moist\u2026 but it\u2019s not much bigger than the drumstick from a spring chicken. The veggies were fresh. The soup was flavorful and had lots of beef in it. The crisps were nice and crunchy but not enough of it. Hahaha.\n\nOverall a nice experience but the cramped sitting area and the fact that it\u2019s right by an undivided walkway kinda spoils the experience a little.\n\nA Halal Muslim shop, managed by experienced muslim ladies.\nShop serves Indonesian Muslim fare ... which were delicious and average-priced.\nMy friend from Indonesia enjoyed the soup best.\nHe mentioned that the rest of the dishes taste different from those in Java ... but still delicious.\nI guess the shop owner adapted some local flavourings to our local tastes.\nNo alcohol is served here ... just soft beverages.\nService can be improved ... but I understand they may be short-handed.\nAmbience ... no choice ... as the shop is already small, with only a few tables and space.\nOverall ... a nice experience in a cosy shop ..\n\nThird time eating from this restaurant. We ordered the Bumbu Kemangi (chicken) and Soto Ayam Kuning, and both are very nice and flavourful. The rice in Bumbu Kemangi came wrapped in pandan leaves and was very fragrant. The stir fried chicken was well marinated with aromatic spices. The chicken soup was hearty and homely. The only con was the glass noodles in the soup was quite little. But overall a very satisfying indonesian meal!\n\nTotally impressed with the food here! Love everything on the plate. The rice is very fragrant and tasted like chicken rice. Chili was great! Highly recommended for a flavourful meal! Only downside is it can be quite hectic to find a seat during lunch time, but the food is worth the wait.\n\nThe food was great! Tried the ayam bakar bara, gado gado and bakwan jagung (corn fritters). The flavoured rice was very tasty and the chicken was delicious. The chilli is quite spicy for me. A bit pricey for the portion served. It is always very crowded during lunchtime on weekdays so it is best to go before 12pm.\n",

Food available suits even my picky nephews \ud83d\ude05\n\nWe always order the curries and toufu, and pastas for kids. \ud83d\ude0b\n\nShiok!!!! Impressive food place. As an Indian vegetarian, I enjoyed every bit of it. The food order can be altered even to suit vegans. Don\u2019t miss this place must try place for everyone locals as well as tourist, don\u2019t forget to try Singapore delight food Laksa.\n\nThe restaurant is located just opposite the Beauty World MRT station. We had lunch (3pax) on a Saturday and it wasn't too crowded. Service was prompt and polite, prices were reasonable. We loved all the dishes (bitter gourd in black bean sauce, fried egg & tomatoes, steamed tofu) except for the deep-fried sweet and sour mushroom, which wasn't exceptional (more chewy than crispy). They have a good selection of infused rice and serve different hot and cold beverages (including BBT). Recommended!\n\nwas there at 9.15pm, we know your last order 9.30pm and the cafe has no crowd.\n\nHmmm perhaps your boss earn enough for today and you suggested us to take away instead?\n\nQuite disappointed and decided to travel else where to fill our hungry tummy instead.\n\nI will reconsider whether will want to visit your place again if given the choice.\n\nNice vegetarian food! The Nasi Lemak has a nice flavour on the rice, though not overly done, chilli goes with this dish in my opinion. The ngoh hiang is a bit hard but the taste make up for it. If you don't like too hard stuff, maybe you want to skip this dish. Toufu has a great mixed of sauces. Claypot rice looks better than the taste though, so I'll skip this next time, as I'm one with heavy taste. Cereal \"prawn\" is very well done, such that I can just go with cereal and rice if need to. Overall, this place has enough dishes and set meal to cater to most, so I'll not take any stars off, especially the ambience and service is well above average.\n",

It tasted okay but maybe \u201ccoconut chocolate\u201d would be a more realistic name? The burger tasted great but the sweet potato portion was very very little:( and was a tad bit dry wish it came with sauce or something. I probably would come back again even though it\u2019s a bit expensive but normal cafe price haha. Probably will wanna try other raw cakes but the tiramisu just didn\u2019t cut it..\n\nGreat place if you need to do some work.  Wifi is available, and it's not very noisy.  Only 2 tables have a power point nearby that I can see though.\n\nWe went on a Sunday morning, foodwise there's many vegan options. Not very familiar with vegan and gluten free but I felt the food were very gentle to the palate unlike ur usual hawker fare.\n\nAtmosphere were great, staff services is great an not too crowded. I would think its a great experience and food combination is well thought out.\n\nLacks generosity!! I\u2019ve been 4 times to the living cafe & each time I came back feeling dissatisfied & hungry. Not because I can\u2019t order another main dish but it doesn\u2019t make sense - what\u2019s the point? The menu is great but the portions are restricted. We ordered for 2 people, vegan wrap, veggie delight pizza (barely any vegetables) & some deserts. Ask for the sauce & you are asked to pay $3 on top. I prefer to be charged on the dish & I\u2019m happy to pay $25 instead of $20 but serve me a well thought wholesome plate please.\nI think there\u2019s a misconception that Vegan people don\u2019t need much food despite paying more for their dishes.\nMost of the deserts contain honey, so they are out of bounds for vegans.\nHopefully some heart is put in to this great place to make it feel more warm \ud83c\udf40\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\n\nFood was pretty good but the cappuccino with soy milk and beer root latte with oat milk were terrible. Prices were OK for the high quality ingredients but service was almost nonexistent other than putting food on my table (ordering and payment was done online and no drinking water was provided). Cafe was rather cosy but not good for gathering as customers have to leave after just 1h 15 min (despite it being half full on a Sunday during brunch time). Also, you HAVE TO provide both mobile number and email address for ordering, which is an involuntary release of private data just for a meal. \ud83d\ude05\n",

Vegetarian but meat eaters will enjoy this place too.\n\nMezze platter was quite big even for 2 pax.\n\nReally enjoyed the moussaka and the Spanakopita.\n\nIf you pay by cash there is some free ice cream.\n\nFirst time visiting due to friend\u2019s recommendation. Did not disappoint. Lots of options that don\u2019t make you feel you\u2019re eating vegetarian. Drink menu is extensive but on pricey side. Service was good.\n\nAmbience - The restaurant has this very European, relaxed vibe. Good for families but I don\u2018t see why you can\u2019t go for a date either \ud83d\ude01\n\nFood - my friend and I ordered the halloumi salad and lasagna. We really enjoyed the meal, the ingredients were good quality and food was prepared with care. However, did feel the halloumi was a bit too salty. They have a variety of Mediterranean and Italian options and can make it vegan too. Didn\u2019t really enjoy the rose though.\n\nService - prompt service and the staff were polite and friendly\n\nWould definitely return again.\n\nYou won't believe how rare it is to have a Mediterranean vegetarian place that has so many allium free options, including the Pizzas. Glad to see original sin survive the pandemic when many didn't.\n\nThe Moussaka and Mediterranean pizza were good, though a little too salty but that's probably just me. Nice ambience for a date with friends or the significant other, especially over a good conversation. You pay for the quality. Enjoy!\n\nWonderful and classy vegetarian restaurant. Had dinner here with the wife on a weekday evening. Food was wholesome, good service and atmosphere. Recommended!\n",

                  "reviews": "\n\nLocated at Bukit Timah Market & Food Centre, stall number #02-188.\n\nPrice: $7.00 (Lei Cha Brown Rice)\n\nThe ingredients of the Lei Cha (Thunder Tea Rice) includes fried bean curd, sweet chye poh (preserved radish bits), long beans, stir fried cabbage, mani cai (sweet leaf), black eyed pea, toasted peanuts and sesame. Tea soup is basil based and kind of resembles Thai green curry in taste minus the coconut milk.\n\nAll the ingredients they used are very fresh and tasted delicious as a whole. The tea soup might seem little at first but the amount given is just right.\n\nLooking forward to trying the Bee Hoon set next time!\n\nDo come support the lesser known dishes in Singapore!\n\nFirst time trying leicha, was curious about how the tea would taste. Opted for kosong set and was amazed how FULL i was 60% into my bowl. I enjoyed all the crunch factors from celery (i think), beans, peanuts (the best imo). The tofu was soft and yummy.  The portion is really generous.\n\nThe tea...is not what i was expecting. It's like an acquired taste for me, i cant say i like it when i first tried. It's more of getting used to that taste. Would continue trying leicha elsewhere to compare how different/similar it can be.\n\nOverall the whole bowl has a light taste, not too heavy nor salty. Enjoyed my meal!\n\nUsually takeaway, but the thunder tea will be better if thicker and more cencentrated. Can't even ask for me to go with the rice, the amount is not enough to complement the rice and veg.\n\nVery good taste amongst the rest I have tried. Good find if you want something healthy from this hawker centre. Something nutty yet Asian in flavour.\n\nSo yummy and wholesome. A bit pricey but worth it. Balanced flavours with generous portions of veggie and taukwa, complete with beans (more protein!) and crunchy peanuts~ requested for thunder tea paste since this was a takeaway, and I added my own water to it. On the saltier side, though I guess this is common, so I added more water to balance out the taste a bit. Still very tasty though. Will be back to try the beehoon :-D\n",

Service staff were friendly which made the experience feel a little better. Not a place I will visit again.\n\nThe waffles here are fantastic and their dessert here they do not use normal sugar. It's hard to find nice crispy waffles nowadays. Hidden gem in bukit Timah area.\n\nOutstanding service and food. We enjoyed every sip of our coffee with the music. I love the place and surely will come back more often. Staffs are very accommodating.\n\nOrdered their pizza. Said it will take 10mins. No problem. After 15mins, needed another 6mins. Fine.\nPizza was sparse. Too crusty, over baked, pizza base was soo salty. With only 3 ingredients:- cheese, 3 capcisum and a few mushrooms. Don't waste yr money. 30april@5ish pm.\n\nGiven your \u2018earthly pretence\u2019, disappointing that you choose to serve dine in food in plastic bowls with plastic cutlery.\nYour reason \u2018we use plastic because we are very busy\u2019 didn\u2019t quite wash I\u2019m afraid.\nSo come on - please get your act together.

The food worth 2 stars. The meat was pretty hard, the starter was too sour. The dessert was really not able to match our taste. The house wines was tasteless, but the red wine taste better when it pair with the meat. I will strongly recommend you only order the red if you want to have their one for one house wine promo.\nOur bill was $128, you can get a much more better grilled meat platter and better food at other restaurants. :)\n\nLe Rida has a rustic ambience somewhat akin to an old time eating house in a small town. Quaint and homely\nFreshly baked pita bread with lemon chick pea hummus was delicious and filling\nMains of Lebanese lamb kafta kebab had the right balance of flavour and crunchiness.\nWash it all down with 1 for 1 Heineken draft at $17.90\n\nManager Sanjiv was both friendly and helpful in his recommendations and unlike in some establishments, he did not push you to over order.\nDefinitely worth a return visit!\n\nA quaint no frills dining place with excellent food and good service. The staff are simple people but are very hospitable, often checking in on the food quality and our experience. If you are looking for a good meal away from hustle and bustle, this is the place to go. Oh.. U can definitely have a conversation with your company and hear them loud and clear\n\nDidn't think the food was thaaaat amazing. Nor was the service. But at least they let us drink outside drinks.\nHOWEVER, i requested for no garnishing on my hummus. When the guy brought it over, there WAS parsley on it. And all he said was \"just pluck it out\". --.--\nSo if i was allergic to that, i should just pluck it out.... nice. The hummus wasn't good either. I've tasted better. Like a friend who went with me commented... it isn't creamy enough. Also, comments about the baklava was that it was too hard... and wasn't good.\n\nAbsolutely loved the food, I am heavily into Mediterranean food. I have tried most of the places around Bugis as well. The food here was so fresh, with perfect taste and presentation. It was completely worth it travelling from East.\nThe service was quick, the portion size was generous . We ordered mezze plateer and tabalu salad. They were scrumptious loved the customised heart shaped Pita bread. Hummus, was so creamy and so were all other dips.\n\nWould strongly recommend.. It has become one of my favourite place..\n",

We ordered the chicken butter curry, fish curry, prawn curry etc, all items are good and go very well with the garlic and butter naans. Price is good as well.

I love spicy food and their vindaloo fit the bill.\n\nThe vindaloo, chicken samosa, garlic onion kulcha, naans and tandoori chicken were ok.\n\nThe above has been edited post my recent order: They gave a reduced amount of potatoes in the vindaloo, the taste was not as good as previous orders and they did not give any pappadums with my order for the first time. This inconsistency is a negative experience for me.\n\nHighly recommend with the reasonable price. Their fried cauliflower, Tandoori chicken and cheese with spinach are very nice. Nann is normal but very good with prawn masala. Im not Indian and sometimes I can\u2019t really imagine their dishes but staff is very kind, explained me one by one.\n\nNice food with friendly staff and they care for their delivery riders. Five stars! Will be back for more briyani!\n\nAuthentic Indian food, nice ambience and seating.\nI have tried Aloo Paratha and Egg burning - both of them were absolutely delicious.\nI understand that all the breads will be wrapped in a nice cloth, served in a small basket. I could feel the smell of ghee while I unwrap the bread.\nStaffs were friendly and they do have a nice clean toilet facility.\nI\u2019m sure I will visit again to explore other food options.\n\nAbsolutely delicious Mango Lassi, Garlic Naan, Palak Paneer and Chicken Tikka Masala. Before our dishes arrived, we were served with delicious papadom and Mint Chutney. That itself was high quality so we knew the food would be good.\n\nThe Garlic Naan was wrapped in a maroon cloth, served in a basket. When we unveiled the Naan, the fragrance of the butter and garlic felt like a warm hug. It was crispy and tender, the perfect combination for the Chicken Tikka Masala and Palak Paneer.\n\nThe Chicken Tikka Masala was served with fresh tomatoes and they were delicious with the Tandoori chicken. After eating the spicy food, we washed it all down with the perfect Mango Lassi.\n\nThe staff was friendly and accommodating to our requests for ice water. Definitely returning to try the other dishes!\n",

We got Plain Prata x1, Egg Prata x1, Butter Chicken x1, Garlic Naan x1, Dum Briyani x1 and Iced Teh Tarik x2 which added up to $38.80 for 2.\n\nPrata is average but their fish curry is really diluted. Butter chicken is not bad. Garlic naan is what you would expect it to taste. The only thing worth the price is probably the Dum Briyani. Although it looked like a small portion, there was a lot of mutton buried in the rice and was really filling. The mutton was also tender with really nice gravy. Personally will not be back again.\n\nGood place to have your Indian breakfast. Service is good during the morning.\n\nLast I had supper here at night on weekend, they clean your table as soon as you finish your food to make way for the next diner which is understandable. So, decide if you want a place for good food or a place to hang out.\n\nI've been using this restaurant as a JC peeps meeting base for years. Glad to see that it, together with its competition down the road, has survived the building of the MRT line. When I last went, they didn't have date milkshake. Not sure if its temporary or for good. Date milkshake is good \ud83d\udc4d\n\nIncredibly extensive menu with plenty of seating. Service is really quick and you order through a QR code so it\u2019s convenient. There\u2019s parallel parking along the road and parking at the malls opposite. The food was good, there\u2019s choice between dum briyani and just briyani and this was the plain briyani, rice was flavourful and the chicken was good. Can even choose what piece of chicken you want. Overall quite nice, i would return and would want to try the other stuff on the menu.\n\nThis is one of those few eateries I often wonder how they managed to attract the crowds. The place isn't cozy, the food are generally pricey, there are mostly misses than hits in their extensive menu, even the tasty ones are achieve by being too greasy & over saucy like the Maggi Goreng Pattaya I had today.\n\nAlso their QR code ordering system is a pain to use, there's no embedded payment system to any of the many existing digital payment we have here, you simply have to enter ur credit card manually. If you choose to pay at the counter, your cart orders would be gone and you have to re-order everything at the counter.\n",

No stall name seen but only 1 duck yam rice and wonton mee stall inside the food court. Super friendly owner too! Give it a try when you nearby. \ud83d\ude09\n\nAmazingly good!!! Just ordered the combo as I need to have a quick meal before my shopping trip, but the quality of food surprised me!!! Service is good as well and I guess, I'm gonna go back to try other food in the menu as well. Had a beef sumiyaki & salmon & chicken sumiyaki and impressed with the combination of ingredients used! Keep up the good work, and I guess I'll be back soon!\n\nTea was too diluted, even after pouring half away and mixing with the stronger cup of coffee couldn't save it.\n\nThe Chee chong fun was too oily (refer to picture attached) and surprisingly tasteless even with the black sauce.\n\nThe toast were soaking in melted butter aka soggy.\n\nThe redeeming factor were the half boiled eggs that were perfect.\n\nPerhaps the breakfast menu isn't your forte, or more training could be done for the front end staff if you intend to continue targeting the morning demographics.\n\nDefinitely not a good way to start the weekend morning with an underwhelming breakfast with the family.\n\nI think this place is a hidden gem. It deserves far far more than the 3 stars it has which is why I\u2019m posting this review.\n\nThe beer garlic fried rice is one of the best I\u2019ve had and the taste is like from an upmarket Japanese restaurant.\n\nThe sushi was also really tasty, and yet different from other restaurants.\n\nHighly recommend!!\n\nFinally the place reopened at B1, replacing the coffeeshop at the corner (the chicken rice is still there). Prices are just slightly above average and the food quality is good for the price point. Their chicken curry seems to be using the roti prata curry instead of Japanese curry.\n",

Dishes are good and acceptable, with a big range of dishes available. Average price per person for ala carte and drink is about $10 per person. Fuss free meal! Parking available at the road or outdoor carpark nearby Beauty World Mrt station.\n\nThe food was delicious. Served quite fast. You don't need to wait long.\n\nTried the nasi campur. You need to try the curry chicken, which was fantastic. Tried the butter chicken with plain naan, which was great, too. We also had bryani prawn and Chinese style fried rice.\n\nStaff are very attentive, friendly, and helpful.\n\nEasy to travel here via bus 67 from CCK Bus Interchange or Downtown Line Beauty World.\n\nWill come down to try other food next time.\n\nBeen coming here for years. You get what you pay for, never had complaints about their food.\n\nLooks like they upgraded their curry bowls \ud83d\ude02\n\nLots of comfort food at its best here. They've range from Western food to indian dishes.\n\nThe dishes we ordered are served warm and taste acceptable.\n\nWith all the price rising, we are surprised that their price is still reasonable.\nYou'll find fried rice with a side dish from $5+ only.\nPortion is generous too\n\nIt was a weekday when we visited the restaurant, and it was busy with customers, but their staff were incredibly fast.\n\nReasonable rate + Great service.\nIt's definitely a great supper place to lepakz with friends\n\nAnd the cheese naan & butter chicken is a must try! Highly recommend!\n\nThe butter chicken was the best I've tasted all over singapore.  As I've tried alot of it elsewhere... nothing is compared to Ameen's butter chicken. And damn the cheese naan is solid I tell you. Crispy on the outside and soft and gooey from the cheese on the inside. Totally recommending this place to anyone who loves a good solid butter chicken and pair it with their naan. Will be coming back very soon and many more times over the years!!!!\n",

Cheap and good old traditional food is always good. Food Quality A+ Quantity A+\n\nCame here for a late lunch with my colleagues as a new stall from \u77f3\u5e74 pork trotter just recently open.\n\nWe also order many of the local favourites like satay, chendol, chicken wings oyster omelette and carrot cake.\n\nThis place is not only popular with their food with many stalls and also have a huge crowd during peak hours.\n\nThe passage of time has brought about many changes to this hawker centre but one thing for sure, you will always have a memorable meal at the end of the day.\n\nI attribute my visits to trips to the nearby supper places, hiring a domestic worker or eating at Beauty World Food Centre. The Korean food along the slope or the cafes along Lor Kilat are part of that too.\n\nThe carrot cake is nice, I remembered there was a stall that allows you to add meat like pork. Peter's Pan was a good western.\n\nThe vibe is different during lunch and in the evenings when the BBQ stalls open. A sunny day will make you want to grab chendol while a rainy day will entice you for fish soup.\n\nThere is no bad food here, only good memories.\n\nthe food compared to other hawkers centres is one step above, having a really savoury and delicious wanton mee, crispy and hot fried carrot cake and good chicken.\n\nTried kopi C kosong from Hup Cheong (3 stars) and Hainan coffee (3.25 stars)- both were so-so. The Hainan coffee was slightly milkier so we preferred that.\n\nNonya Zhang was good (4 stars). Wanton mee close to the entrance (3.5 stars) - char siu was too sweet, wanton pretty good.\n",

There's reason why this restaurant survived during the pandemic. Leonardo, the boss of Caruso, always treat his guests with his best.\n\nThe perfect Italian restaurant at Western Central. With every pride and passion possible, each dish is carefully prepared with excellent taste. The service is exceptionally pleasant with an original Italian taking you through their signature dishes.\n\n2 recommendations here. Reserve your table way in advance. Parking is ample at Guthrie House behind.\n\nThe Italian food here is very authentic. They use fresh ingredients. The ingredients look simple but the aroma and taste of the dishes are very flavourful.\nIt was super busy and packed during mother's day, but the Italian owner was very approachable and friendly, and tried his best to get us our reserved table as soon as possible as the previous seating was late.\nLove their pistachio gelato with bailey shot. It's really \ud83d\udc4d.\nWill definitely visit again!\n\nVery pleasant Italian cuisine! The food is the attraction here, wouldn't rate the ambience and the service as 5 because it's just not there. However the food served was really scrumptious. Highly recommend the lamb steak. Would come back for the food again.\n\nIt was a pleasant visit, although I expected more as this is an authentic Italian restaurant. It was for a girlfriend\u2019s birthday treat and we were served 2 slices of plain bread after ordering. It came with olive oil and balsamic vinegar but no side nor small plates were provided. So we ended up pouring the dips onto our main dining plate. No butter was served either.\nThe $58 mixed grilled meat platter was delectable. The lamb and pork belly were enjoyable. The salad was served was limp and there was no crunch nor freshness\n\nWe asked for mint sauce and the server wasn\u2019t sure and said would check if available. Few minutes later, she served us brown sauce instead. We didn\u2019t want to trouble the crew and decided to stick with the brown sauce. The meat was already tasty and we wanted the mint sauce to balance the taste. Nonetheless, I wonder if mint sauce was available as this is an Italian restaurant. I totally respect the original taste of the meats and used the brown sauce only sparingly. Service was friendly. Paid $123 for 2 mains (a pasta and mixed grill) and a bottle of sparkling water.\n",

The restaurant provided impeccable service, and the buffet itself offered a delightful selection of Italian dishes.\n\nFrom the moment I walked in, the staff at Rubato made me feel welcome and ensured that I had everything I needed throughout the meal. Their attention to detail and dedication to guest satisfaction were evident.\n\nThe lunch buffet at Rubato featured a wide variety of Italian classics, from fresh salads and antipasti to hearty pasta dishes and delectable desserts. The flavors were outstanding, and the buffet's diverse offerings catered to a range of tastes. It's a fantastic option for those looking to explore a variety of Italian flavors in one sitting.\n\nThe only area where Rubato could improve was in the presentation of the main courses on the buffet. The plating of the meats and sauces at the start could be refined to make it easier for diners to identify and enjoy each dish.\n\nIn summary, Rubato's lunch buffet offers an exceptional culinary journey through Italian cuisine, with outstanding service to match. It's a fantastic option for those seeking a wide array of flavors in a warm and welcoming atmosphere. With a little attention to plating, Rubato's lunch buffet could become an undisputed five-star gem in the world of Italian dining.\n\nWe had a blast celebrating at Rubato with their fancy Vegetarian Italian Omakase! We told them we don't eat meat or seafood, and they whipped up a 6-course masterpiece just for us. All we had to do was sit back, relax, and enjoy the delicious Italian dishes they served up!\n\nScallop, Uni angel hair pasta was 10/10, worth the price. Octopus was 10/10 too, charred taste and sauce goes well together. Crab leg pasta was alright 7/10. Big and juicy oyster 8/10.\n\nWe just had the best dinner date at @rubatosg \u2764\ufe0f!\n\nThey are one of the oldest & most prestigious Italian restaurants in Singapore founded in 2009. Do you know they are available till 2am daily for deliveries via @grabfoodsg & for dine-in during weekends, eve of PH & PH?\n\nAmong the dishes that we've tried in our 6 course Japanese-Italian Omakase, here's our top 3 picks! See till the end to salivate over what we enjoyed \ud83d\ude1d.\n\n\ud83c\udf1f \"A Gift from the Angels\"\nYou literally \ud83e\udd2f when you take a mouth, it consist of Chilled Angel Hair Pasta, Hokkaido Scallops Sashimi, Exotic Japanese Seaweed, Premium White Truffle Oil And Freshly-caught Hokkaido Bafun Uni, the combination matches so well and they are really fresh!\n\n\ud83c\udf1f Lobster Cappuccino & Mushroom Soup with Truffle\nThe soups are so flavourful & rich but not cloying, we just slurp down the soup till the last drop, it's definitely one of the best we've ever tried.\n\n\ud83c\udf1f Cod Fish\nThe cod fish literally melts in the mouth, there wasn't much seasoning or sauce but you can taste the freshness of the fish in every bite!\n\nYou can enjoy a Japanese-Italian Omakase between 6 - 9 courses starting from $128++. The chef will decide on the menu, you can inform them of your dietary preferences & they will customize the menu accordingly for you! They also have regular menu if you prefer to choose your own dishes.\n\nThis restaurant is a perfect place for dates, gathering or celebrations. Recommended to make a reservation and enjoy the amazing dining experiences!\n\nCelebrated my birthday with my girls at Greenwood! Mr Daniel was attentive and provided a great experience for us! The Tomahawk Steak & Seafood Platter is a MUST TRY! Ended the lovely night with amazing desserts, one of every kind! Thank you Daniel for the arrangement! Will be back!\n",

Waiting staff friendly and helpful. Lady staff was cheerful and welcoming.\n\nFood was good, really enjoyed the mushroom soup. The pizza will really thin and light ( I'll let you decide whether its a good thing or bad thing ) and my favourite was the truffle fries. The menu was a little confusing as we were given 2 menus, but one of the labels for the kids menu was different than the others. The atmosphere is good if you want to eat peacefully. Ambience is nice and calm with a sort of vintage-y theme to it. The music is nice too. I will recommend this place and all the other places around it.\n\nOrdered via Deliveroo but couldn\u2019t add photos to the review. 12\u201d Paper thin pizza as thin as a tortilla wrap that cost $30 each for the margherita and the pepperoni pizza. And this was the Large size already.\n\nThe box weighed more than the pizza itself. I don\u2019t know how they actually allowed this to be sent out. Will definitely not be ordering from them again.\n\nlovely place with great options. love the truffle pizza! atmosphere was relaxing and nice, we sat next to the kitchen so we could see the chefs make the pizzas :) the staff was nice enough to give us a free DIY pizza kit because of children's day too!\n\nAttentive, friendly service staff, nice food, and good atmosphere. Easy parking space when we got there.\n",

Overall the food is awesome but somehow we don\u2019t seem to enjoy the Canada crab.. the service is also top class as they are friendly and serve us well. Keep it up!\n\nCame here because there\u2019s a queue for Jumbo beside this restaurant. Decided to give it a try as this place\u2019s quite busy too. We were ushered to a table but then it\u2019s hard to get the servers\u2019 attention when we were about to make orders.\n\nWe ordered the Canadian chili crab as recommended by the server and it didn\u2019t disappoint. The crab was huge and fleshy where I craved for more of it as the chili sauce was so good. We even ordered mantou buns to dip in the sauce and it\u2019s delicious.\n\nThe steamed fish was delicious as the flesh was soft and flavorsome. The razor clams with minced meats and vermicelli were fresh and flavorful. I liked the noodles with oysters too especially the crispy bits of the topping.\n\nI had a fantastic experience at this restaurant! The food was absolutely superb, and the service was top-notch. During my visit for lunch, I had the pleasure of trying both the chili and pepper crab dishes. The crab meat was incredibly fresh, and the dark pepper sauce was a standout\u2014it paired perfectly with the crab. To end on a sweet note, I indulged in the mango coconut dessert, which was not only beautifully presented but also impressively layered. I highly recommend this place for an unforgettable dining experience!\n\nI've been here twice, and both times are good. Food is tasty, especially love the Irish duck and white pepper crab. The staff are friendly but not attentive as it seems like they are very short-handed. Overall, the experience is enjoyable, and I will be back.\n\nNo matter how tight is your schedule in your Singapore visit, you have to try the crab plate in Long Beach UDMC. UDMC is rightfully famous for its delicious black pepper crab, the plate that I ordered there. The crab is cooked tender, and the sauce is incredible. This was my first time eating a crab and I am definitely not disappointed.\n\nI should warn my European friends that the price rates are quite high in this restaurant, the prices are excluding tax (US style) and no service in the restaurant is free (even tissues).\n\nI recommend Long Beach UDMC for visiting once but only once\n",

Tonight, at 8pm, we arrived, relieved to know that this coffeeshop can host  a party of 5pax  (some coffeeshops turn us away because they only have the capacity to monitor 2pax in this pandemic).\n\nAlas, the Fried Hokkien Mee was sold out. We stumbled upon Lagoon BBQ Seafood. We ordered:\n\n1. Yangzhou Fried Rice (Excellent. The best YZ fried rice i ever tasted in SG. Got wok hei and each grain of rice is gorgeously evident)\n2. Salted Egg Yolk Sotong (Excellent, Tasty and Crispy)\n3. Sambal Kang Kong (Good, could be spicier with more sambal)\n4. Sour Plum Pork Chop (Excellent. Umami)\n\nI have lived in the east forever and I never knew of this Tze Char place. Well, I'd be back. This will be my go-to place in future.

Vast variety of seafood and other meats and veggies dishes to choose from. Thoroughly enjoyed the dinner here. Staff were friendly and efficient and the atmosphere of the East Coast branch is very nice, comfortable with plenty of seats for all. Can get packed during peak hours, if not, I highly recommend the outdoor seats that\u2019s closest to the beach / foot paths. Highly recommended!\n\nService was fine but not outstanding, with the staff forgetting my request for ice water until i finished my meal. Nice ambience next to the beach with comfortable sea breeze. As for the food, black pepper crab was fine. Fried yam with scallop didn't taste freshly fried which was disappointing compared to what i tasted previously at the Ion outlet. Hor fun was decent. Mocha pork rib was the highlight here with the pork rib crisp on the outside and the meat tender plus a strong coffee flavour. May return for the ambience.\n\nWe were treated to an exemplary dining experience thanks to Julia. Her attention to detail and thoughtful arrangements for our lunch gathering went above and beyond! She anticipated our needs with professionalism and added special touch to our meal.\n\nLobsters, chili crab and black pepper crabs were amazing.\n\nThank you for the great seafood and hospitality \ud83d\ude0a\n\nJumbo East Coast never failed to impress me for the past 20+ years.

Kudos to you and your amazing team! \u2764\ufe0f\n\nWonderful food, helpful staff and great location by the beach. The place was crowded for a drizzly weeknight but the energy was awesome. The chilli crab could be a tad spicier. I hope they didn\u2019t tone down the spice level for the many tourists who dine there. Their mocha pork ribs was super delish and tender.

Hor fun has good wok hei too.\n\nHad lunch - boss mee sua, coffee ribs, prawn rolls, fish maw soup, crispy sotong, cai Po tofu. Pretty standard zhi char food. Good quality and tasty. Best dish would be the crispy sotong. Boss mee sua below average.\n\n$50 for grouper hotpot with 8 slices of fish filet and lots of fish parts in the soup. Really nice. When I was there, I think every table ordered this so a must have. $12 for the prawn paste chicken. Nice with the soup if you like meat. Best thing is no corkage charge for wine lovers with dinner. Bad thing is 10% service charge on bill. You need to tell the helpers 2-3 times to do something. Like..can i have a soup-base refill. Can I order now? So the service charge is really not for service but to pay the staff, which is fine but when it is added automatically onto your bill for ok service, you feel somewhat disappointed. Nevertheless, the food is good and people/staff is quite nice. Overall, I will be a repeat customer.\n\nWe were taken to this restaurant by our Singaporean friend on a weekend trip. The food and atmosphere were great, and the price was reasonable. The signature chilli fish tasted amazing. The service was outstanding - friendly waiters. The restaurant is about 20 minutes drive from the city centre.\n\nLoved the red grouper fish steamboat. Tasty broth with deep fried yam, spinach and cabbage with fresh slices of grouper fish.  Sambal kangkong was good, balanced flavour of spiciness, and saltiness from the haebee.\n",

Tried both kind of chili crab with and without eggs, it was different and nice not so ketchup taste n less starchy. We had the fried fish with Thai mango sauce, good! Crispy US duck was good, tender n skin was crispy.\n\nSuperb dinner and seafood experience with the work team. Everything was done excellently. Deep fried baby squid, duck, Cereal prawns, fish and crabs. Amazing. Will want to come back again with family.\n\n16 Jul 2023: back here to celebrate mum BD. Nice food, firm meaty crabs and excellent service. Tried the curry fish head as it was birthday girl's favourite.\n\nI love the old school vibes here! Traditional Chinese restaurant set in the 80s! This place has been around since 1956, and the food is great! Service is also good! Love the chilli crab here and they are apparently the creators of this iconic dish! We had Buddha jump over the wall soup, baby kailan, chilli crab with mantou, and a fried mee sua. What a memorable and amazing experience! Will definitely be back again soon! We also got to say hi and bye to the friendly founder and owner on our way out!\n\nNice food n great service. The boss is always friendly n welcoming. My gal loves the Chili Crab n it\u2019s always a must have dish on the table for her when she goes to Roland Restaurant.\n\nOne of the old school Chinese restaurants that the entire extended family goes to over the years during special occasions. Has nice Tim sum and Chinese cuisine. 5 stars for sentimental value and nostalgia. Good to know that the restaurant is still around after all these years.\n\nFamily had a 10 course meal to celebrate a few birthdays.\n\nCold dish was so so. Would prefer sliced lobster with mayonnaise to lobster balls among other things.\nLotus paste bun was ok, but it is always fun to have it styled as longevity peaches which are linked to Chinese mythical stories.\nBuddha jumps over the wall was nice, but every individual soup pot ingredients are non-uniform. You never know what your going to get till you open the lid. \ud83d\ude02\nSuckling pig was awesome! Crispy! \ud83d\ude0b\nRazor/Bamboo clams were delicious.\nAsparagus was decent.\nDrunken prawns were ok.\nChilli crab is the signature dish with fried Mantou buns which are a childhood favourite. \ud83e\udd29\nSteamed pomfret was good.\nUS duck was yummy.\n",

The prawns are super fresh and super sweet. The bamboo clams are very big and flavourful. The food also came very fast even when all tables are full. The price is very reasonable. There's an outdoor seating area - good for kids to run around. Parking lots right in front of the restaurant. The only downside is the noise when the restaurant is full due to the relatively small space. Overall very highly recommended place.\n\nGreat Food at reasonable price, lobster porridge and white pepper crab definitely a must have, the white pepper is quite different from the usual ones I had, it\u2019s flavorful and spicy. Highly recommend \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\n\nThe restaurant serves fresh and live seafood which tasted delicious. I would recommend you to visit this place with your family and friends!\n\nIt\u2019s been our 3rd visit here since their opening. The food is amazing! Fresh seafoods and portions are good! Love their white pepper crab! It\u2019s our favourite place to go for crab! Their current promotion is 50% off Alaska crab.\nFriendly boss and staff! Thank you for the great food and great service!\n\nAll the food was very fresh and delicious, very affordable pricing! Went to eat on their opening week, although restaurant was very packed but the staff are still very friendly & efficient! Must try their Chili Crab!

The 2nd floor dining area can fit about 50pax. The food is ok2 only...\nWe had Hong Kong Steam Fish which was ok, sambal kang kong is good, Seafood Tom Yum Soup was veey good, Hotplate Beancurd was ok, Sweet & Sour chicken was nice so is the omelette prawn was good too.

We ordered our foods already and almost 1 hour later then they came and informed us that some of the foods will take very long to cook and request us to change our orders.\n\nFor some of our pax , food took a total of 2 hours before they arrive on our table.\n\n2.5 hours later, some food still did not arrive.\n\nIt would be understandable if the restaurant was packed with dinner crowd. Unfortunately there were only us in the restaurant during lunch time with no crowd.\n\nA little hard to swallow the fact that you sit in an empty restaurant and not having your food served after 2 and a half hours.\n",

Sambal was spicy enough too. Definitely worth a try!\n\nWe used to love the BBQ stingray from this stall. This time round, we ordered the stingray $20 and blood cockles $8. The cockles didn\u2019t taste fresh. The stingray also didn\u2019t taste as good and fresh as before. My friend and I who ate the cockles had  diarrhea the next day. I don\u2019t recommend this stall anymore.\n\nFirst time trying the food from this stall, usually we have a specific stall that we always go to but decided to give other stall a try this time round.  Quite surprised that they are Halal certified, so its Muslim friendly. Menu is pretty extensive, can cater to different tastebud. Like most stalls over here, they have bbq seafood as well.\n\nOrdered 3 dishes, sambal stingray, Kailan in oyster sauce and an onion Omelette. Food took about 15mins to 20mins to be ready. Taste wise, not bad but there is room for improvement. One thing I didn't really like was that the food was already cold when served. My guess, was due to waiting for all the dishes to ready and served together and as a result the food turn cold.\n\nOverall, food was acceptable. Not really sure if i would return though.\n\nCockles stank of mud. Inedible. Will not recommend. Hoping we will not fall sick tonight!!\n\nSuper yummy mee goreng and loaded with flavour!

Im surprise to find this standard in hawker rather then in Famous crab restaurant.. Seeing is beliving!! Come down try yourself.. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb oh yah. The aunty wearing Rolex is very friendly too. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\n\nLoved the sambal stingray and the BBQ prawn. Had the order as take away so the family can dine at the sea side area. The lady is so thoughtful and ensure that all the utensils and the needful are properly assorted for us. We had a fabulous sunset meal at the seaside.\n\nOutstanding!  The stingray was tender, and the sambal had just enough heat.  The satay was delicious. The calamari was crisp and tender.  Combined with the outdoor setting on a beautiful evening, it was amazing!\n\nA beautiful and thick slab of stingray, nicely grilled with a smooth texture. Sambal packs a punch too and surely not for the faint of heart!\n\nLoved the BBQ crab that I ordered for a mini celebration today. The meat was thick, solid and chunky, crab weighed 900g. Everything they cook here tastes great. Usual favourite items I order are Tua Tao, BBQ Spicy Stingray, Salted Egg Prawn and Deep Fried Baby Sotong!  Loved it!\n",

Crab was very small, was told 500-600g but we felt like it was a lot lesser as the crabs do not contain much meat in them. Sauce was alright, towards the spicier spectrum.\nMantou buns were $1 each which was quite pricey.\nWe also ordered the champagne pork ribs ($16) that was good, lean pork with slight champagne taste. Rice ($1.50) was a small portion.\nWet wipes are $0.50 each.\nOverall wouldn\u2019t come back again even with the promo as we felt the price wasn\u2019t justified, service was also alright. Parking is in the condominium, quite a walk from the restaurant as you can only park at the visitors lot. The security doesn\u2019t really care about where you\u2019re going so you don\u2019t have to deal with them.\n\nFound in a condo. Cosy and  homely place for dinner. Food is nice canto style.\n\n2 pax meal was bit pricy but to be fair we had steam clams.\n\nWorth a try. Good for family meals.\n\nHad to pay for parking at the condo though. Hdb rates.\n\nWent for dinner on a Friday night after reading the good reviews on google map. Ordered their signature dishes, BeeHoon, pork, veg, prawn and crab.\n\nThe pork is average, done-ness is just nice, not too sweet but a bit of starchy after taste.\n\nThe BeeHoon is below average for me. they put too much ginger and cover the taste of the clam and BeeHoon. The sauce is too starchy which is not what I expected. Good thing is it is not salty.\n\nthe veg is average, the taste is good and the veg is young. but there are too little century egg and salted egg. the sauce is also too starchy.\n\nthe prawn is good, full of wine taste. the doneness is ok. but it is suppose to be in a wooden pot with stone but they say they run out of that so only normal steam for us.\n\nthe crab is above average, the sauce is good, one of the better one that I have tasted. but the crab is a little over cook, the meat is a bit tough. they do not have big crab, only those 500g +- kind. the crab meat is not sweet and do not have any crab taste.\n\nVery cozy place with good food that is reasonably priced.\n\nStandard of food and service was maintained reasonably well even after the CB period, there were fewer people patronising this outlet on a Saturday night but it deserved better attendance. Chilli crab sauce was a bit disappointing- dropped quite a bit from our first patronage. I liked the dessert - being lemon grass jelly. Overall, not bad, a satisfying dinner.\n",

Salted egg chicken is always a hit, portions are a little small. So do note when ordering for a bigger group.\n2. Salted egg prawns were well fried such that we were able to bite through the shells\n3. Beef with veges was really average and don't think you should be ordering this\n4. Chili crab was honestly pretty decent but sure packs a punch!\n\nOverall, the quality of the food was decent however felt that the food could have came a little hotter as it was freshly prepared.\n\nEasy to find @ near Changi Road roadside. Seat no problem. But, the food cook not (  sorry ) nice. Especially the fried chicken lemon.\n\nWent for my birthday - food was good and staff were helpful and friendly. I love the crispy baby squid and theirs did not disappoint. Highly recommended!\n\nHad a company dinner here. Food was good but not great. The fried noodles were unexpectedly delicious. Chili crab was normal tasting but the there was a lot of gravy. The sweet sour spicy fish was mostly spicy, didn\u2019t have the sour savoury taste. But the fish wasn\u2019t fresh out of the water. There were many tables. Enough to fit 10 people each. Toilet was relatively clean. Parking was quite easy to find nearby.\n\nThe food quality at this place has gone from bad to worse. The eggs in the hot blade ate burnt. The chicken used are frozen and not well cooked.  Only the drinks seemed normal. Would definitely fire the chef at this place!\n",

Happen to be in Marine Terrace area and decided to give this place a try. We were there around 7pm and there were many people having takeaway.\n\nOrdered three dishes and the food didn\u2019t take long to arrive although the staff did inform us that there is at least 30mins waiting time. We order the 3 cups chicken, stir fry Hongkong Kailan with garlic and fuyong omelette.\n\nFood was not bad, got nothing much to complain about. 3 cups chicken was quite good, unlike most place where they chicken piece with bone, they use chicken thigh here, much convenient to eat.\n\nOverall, worth coming back again to try other dishes.\n\nVery bad experience at this stall. Ordered 2 portions of Sing Chow Beehoon, but got kids size, containers were not even half full for $9.40!! Also beehoon wasn't fully cooked!! Very disappointing! Seems like cook only made one portion by mistake and then split it into 2 portions, didn't border to make a 2nd one! Not serious to run a business like that!\n\nAvoid this place at all costs, if you can. Food quality and quantity is not good. Think about paying 30 bucks for a dish that is made up of ingredients costing $3 or $4, either they are extremely super stingy or just plainly outrageously trying to rob you in daylight (without even blinking an eyelid),\n\nService is very bad. Very unfriendly people. They say open but then say to me come back at 4pm when it was 2.50pm. What is this huh? I can literally see your stall open and if there's staff there, why don't just make the food? Price is ok and food taste good but only wished that the service was better than this.\n\nFood is average, portion is small but pricey. Only advantage is I can call in advance to order and collect later.\n",

Dumplings were fresh and chewy. Generous fillings of prawns. Service was quick, efficient, no nonsense.\n\nDim sum is good and very fresh. Seems like older people tend to visit and may not leave reviews which could be the reason why the not-so-high rating is as such. Personally don't think the rating is reflective of the food! Maybe it's a bit pricey but would definitely recommend this place. Har Gao has really fresh and big prawns, Fan Choy is also delicious. Liu Sha Pao has sweet, watery custard. Carrot Cake is very flavourful and has additional ingredients inside too. Didn't try the porridge but will do so next time. Zi Char also seems quite popular here, a lot of people ordered fried rice. Very sad thing is the parking here is horrendous :'( But really worth a visit!\n\nEnjoyed the har Gao and xiao long Bao here, delicious and well-made! Recommend the pan-fried carrot cake (not in picture) as well, super fragrant, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.\n\nTried out this newer location of Mongkok Dimsum in East Coast and the food was consistently good like other branches. This place is smacked in the great Joo Chiat area so you can also have a pleasant walk around the neighborhood after your meal to digest the food \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udc4c\n\npleasant experience dining at mongkok dimsum, with a large variety of meat & carb dishes as well as dim sum. beef hor fun was good, veg dishes were fresh and well cooked. dimsum was pretty okay - not the best but good and satisfying enough.\n",

Genuinely impressed at how smooth everything was. Food (chicken wings and steak) were spot on too. It's got a bar vibe overall with a combo of tables and chairs + tables and bar stools.\n\nI liked it very much. Very good ribs and chowder. Excellent service. Nice ambiance. Happy Hour 4pm-6pm. Large food menu for dinner (starting at 4pm). Large drink menu too with many options for tap and bottle beer, wine, cocktails.\n\nFood was delicious, well priced with decent size portions. Scallops and Beef Wellington were my top picks however If I'd gone again a steak was next on the hit list. Looking for a warm and cosy venue on a cold night? Look no further than Brazz, no booking no worries. Visited twice on our 11 day Queenstown holiday and thoroughly enjoyed both visits.\n\nAwesome food. Staff kept leving door open with horrible wind blowing on me\n\nUpdated, two years on. The food was really good. However they got my order wrong twice. Forgot a condiment and j had To ask a third time before they brought it over. The staff were really nice though.\n",

However, the service left much to be desired; they weren't particularly friendly or attentive. Don't miss out on their amazing bread!\n\nThis was really disappointing! First, the owner asked if we want sparkling water. We asked for tap water. We were given bottled water and charged $5. We thought it was law that drinkable water is free, or at least cheap. Second, we were given a small table next to the door which had freezing air flowing in. I politely checked if we could change a table as there were three free ones. The owner almost yelled \u201cno\u201d and walked away. The other tables would have been good. Third, the seafood pasta I ordered was awful! It tasted no flavor, the white sauce was just cream, no garlic or wine or oil, and I found heaps of celery in it. It\u2019s just weird. The pizza had lots of fresh toppings but needed seasoning. We paid $105 for a beer, a juice, a water, a pasta and a small pizza and we opted not to tip.\n\nYeah that famous garlic bread is famous for a reason, so delicious! They have half portion options for their food which is so great! Also fun to add to the chalk walls in the bathrooms\n\nGood hearty food in a rustic old style farmhouse. We had the portofino pizza (highly recommended), spaghetti bolognese (a classic done well) and the spaghetti with chicken livers (delicious). Portions were decent sized and good enough to share. Prices are on the high end but that's pretty much what to expect when in Queenstown.\n\nThey don't take reservations, so just show up early and put your name down for a table. Service is efficient and food is out pretty quickly.\n\nThey \u201csurprised\u201d us by adding celery to our Her Majesty\u2019s Pleasure pizza?? It was disgusting and not anywhere on the menu or list of ingredients. They need to tell customers before adding random ingredients to their order \u2014 especially with pizza that has specific listed toppings so you can customize.\n\nThe bolognese sauce on our second pizza still had whole bay leaves still in it, which are inedible.\n\nAlso, this is the only restaurant we\u2019ve visited in Queenstown that makes you to pay $12 for water instead of offering free boiled tap water.\n",

Sherie (hope I got your name right) was the friendliest/warmest host and actually explained to us the menu and followed up with thoughtful wine suggestions.\n\nI highly highly recommend eating here. Everything from their steaks to seafood were top drawer. Will be back for sure.\n\nCouldn't be happier after dining here at Botswana Butchery. My partner & I are visiting celebrating our engagement and we were not disappointed! The food was delightful. The waitress we had was friendly and so attentive! We even got a complimentary dessert which made our day! Was seeking a quality steak all week long and I finally found it! This is the place to go to for sure!!!\n\nBeautiful atmosphere, amazing food and really great service, it\u2019s an experience coming to Botswana Butchery.\nThe menu has an abundant selection of delicious food to choose from, there is something for everyone and especially so if you are a meat eater.\nFor starters we had the bone marrow and the tuna tataki\u2026.my husband was very impressed with the bone marrow and the quality of the tuna in the tataki was very high.\nFor mains we had the half duck and the wagyu eye fillet. The half duck was so delicious and cooked to perfection. The eye fillet also was cooked beautifully.\nThe only small thing which I didn\u2019t like are the prices of the wine. They have an amazing selection yes, but prices were insane. I know how much I can buy these for and a 300% mark up is crazy.\nOther than that, we had a great experience- just be prepared that it will be pricey.\n\nHighly recommend Botswana. Service was great and the food was amazing. We had the crispy squid, lamb loin, t-bone steak and eye fillet with sides and they were superb and the pudding for dessert was delish.\n\nGreat dining experience on a cold, snowy day. Beautifully cooked whole NZ lamb shoulder served with absolutely perfect duck fat potatoes - crispy on the outside, soft in the middle and hot. We ordered the seasonal vegetables which was asparagus with hollandaise sauce; again, very tasty. The slow cooked lamb was served on a warmed plate accompanied by a nice jus and mint jelly on the side. Able to carve it with a spoon - cooked to perfection. Staff were great, the experience exceeded our expectations.\n",

We savored the mouthwatering medium rare beef, the succulent confit duck, and the flavorful salt and pepper calamari. The catch of the day was unfortunately not up to par, but the attentive staff promptly resolved the issue when we had to send it back.\n\nTo accompany our main courses, we indulged in the delectable polenta fries, which, while a bit lackluster in taste for our liking, were still enjoyable. The Caesar salad provided a refreshing and tangy addition to our meal.\n\nFor dessert, we were treated to the heavenly trio sorbet and the classic cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e. Both desserts were prepared with finesse and left us longing for more. What made our dining experience truly memorable was the personalized dessert arranged for my dad by the kind and attentive staff. It truly showed their commitment to providing exceptional service.\n\nOver the years, Lombardi has received numerous awards for its outstanding culinary offerings and impeccable service. The restaurant has consistently been recognized for its commitment to quality, earning accolades that showcase their dedication to excellence.\n\nIn conclusion, Lombardi in Queenstown is a must-visit for anyone seeking a memorable dining experience. From the mouthwatering beef and amazing duck to the flavorful calamari, the restaurant's menu boasts a range of delightful options. Though a couple of dishes fell short of expectations, the exceptional service and attention to detail more than made up for it. Lombardi's well-deserved accolades reflect their commitment to providing a remarkable dining experience.\n\nCelebrate my birthday here last march. Nice food and service plus great view from restaurant.\n\nGreat service, amazing fresh food and very quality. Very nice view as well.\n\nFood  large  portions delicious.\nCould do with some extra staff training.\n\nWas fortunate enough to try out this restaurant after a day on the slopes as it was part of the hotel & was too tired to venture out to the city.\n\nThis place definitely did not disappoint! The breakfast options are nice but dinner was even better! It also had a nice cosy & fancy restaurant feel to it during the dinner service.\n\nThe service by Kyle was fantastic, friendly & attentive.\n\nWe ordered:\n- the soup of the day (pumpkin) \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc\n- seared scallops with octopus \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc\n- fish of the day \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc\n- bakes lasagne \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc\n\nStandout dish was the baked lasagne for me & would fly back here just for that (& the views)!

A huge shout out to Eva, what a great host ... very personable and she adds so much to the way things are done at what is honestly our favourite restaurant anywhere.   Congrats Eva, we'll see you again Friday night at Table 14, we can't stay away!!\nJohn & Lynda, Australia \ud83c\udf0f\n\nNice experience\u2026.after 11 years!\n\nOur last visit to Lone Star, Queenstown was in 2011. The most recent visit was in December 2022 - during Christmas/ New Year holidays.\n\nWe were a group of 8, including 5 vegetarians. All the dishes we had were well prepared, and the wait time was reasonable. The service was friendly and efficient.\n\nIf my memory serves me right, the number of vegetarian options in 2022 is more than in 2011, which is great.\n\nIt was quite a nice experience dining at Lone Star, after the long drive from Christchurch. My only small complaint would be that there was no guacamole/ avocado in the nachos dish. The dish was tasty nevertheless, hence we didn\u2019t mention it to the staff there.\n\nI will be happy to dine here again.\n\nVery disappointing experience.\nThe wait staff were friendly but quite slow and inconsistent with their level of service.\nThey had to change our drinks selection multiple times due to them not having ingredients or drinks available.\nThe food was not great my wife ordered salt and pepper squid and it was not edible, it was so salty it was like eating salt directly from a salt shaker.\nThe fish and chips tasted like crusty fat vat. None  of us finished our meals.\nWhen we told the staff about the food quality they weren\u2019t surprised and didn\u2019t seem to care.\nLet\u2019s just say I will never go back to lone star Queenstown again.\n\nOur server Basil was amazing, he was friendly and entertaining, thank you Basil. The food was worth the price you paid and absolutely delicious. Went there for my nieces 18th birthday, Basil sang her happy birthday and she was given a free desert.\n\nMost enjoyable dinner we have had during our weeks stay in Queenstown.\nQuesadillas to start were awesome. The ribs were great and I loved the coleslaw no the usual stuff. Then not having any more room we shared a white chocolate pudding that was super yummy and a great size to share. My daughter loved the frozen margarita and espresso martini.\nThe safe to drink still water was way better than other restaurants keg water\n",

The steak and ribs were nice (ribs especially were good value). The lamb was nice but slightly over cooked. I recommend this place and would try it again.\n\nWe love this place so much we went twice! Lovely views here too. Order the steak. Medium rare.  Lamb skewer. The yummy flavoured chips! And the tiramisu brownie! I\u2019d love to return here one day\u2026\n\nWent for dinner on a Monday night. Service was excellent although we always are early eaters.\n\nGreat selection of meats and meals (vegetarians need not attend). We had a meat share platter. The ribs were delicious,  the chicken was moist and cooked so well, the sausage had a nice kick and steak was tasty.\n\nI was also impressed at the drinks options, I do enjoy a bourbon and there was a great selection.  Also similar section for Whiskys.\n\nCouldn't fit in dessert (even with the nice selection they had) but thought finish it off with an Espresso Martini.\n\nHighly recommend Flame if you are in Queenstown.\n\nHad a late lunch here after getting off the old steam boat. Loved the atmosphere, staff were super friendly, good local beer, restrooms were clean. Food was alright, maybe 3.5 stars. Our ribs were decent, maybe needs a little spicier smokier bbq sauce for more oomph (we asked for hot sauce and at least they had that), the coleslaw was lacking sauce and flavor, very bland, chips were good. The rump steak was good, but the burger was not, dry and kinda sad. Generous portions though. We would probably go back to try some different dishes next time at dinner time as they have more options, and for the friendly staff and atmosphere.\n\nDidn't have reservation but was seated within 10 mins. This was on a Monday, around 9:30PM. Place was still packed. Somebody took my order right away. Had my starter and waited for almost 20mins for my main. They were busy so I guess it was understandable. Food was great in general.I would say they have one of the best ribs I have ever tasted here in NZ. Chicken was moist and flavourful but the Mozambique Prawn was a bit mediocre and underwhelming. And their chips! I am not a fan of chips but theirs were delicious. I actually finished a serving of chips for once. Serving was huge. Don't worry if you can't finish your meal. You can ask for a takeaway container so you can just bring home your leftover. Lunch sorted! I would still recommend this place to people wanting a decent meal while in Queenstown. They also open til late so if you are arriving late in Queenstown and you want to have a good meal before heading to your accommodation, head to this place.\n",

Ordered the market fish alongside a scotch fillet and both was excellent. Not to mention their scotched carrot which was so amazing. Overall highly recommended to try their steaks!\n\nWe had fabolous night dine in here, atmosphere is decent. They have good table service and acknowledge us so well for the menu, it's worth to have a wonderful night here. The food is unique and well-served.\nThe first floor you can have bar drinking with friends. Second floor are the restaurant part. Also they have nice dessert menu after having steak feasting.\n\nNo doubt about it, this place is seriously amazing! Just let the chef work their magic and enjoy the deliciousness. The staff here are super friendly. It's hands down the best spot for steak in Queenstown, my favorite restaurant in town.\n\nThanks so much for our wonderful experience and divine food.\nBoth our maitre D, and fabulous French waiter Charles were so professional and they ensured we had all we needed constantly, to make the night be a smooth seamless banquet of courses,\nalong with the other staff.  Sincere thanks to the chefs we didn't meet.  Food we wont forget!\nBeautiful surroundings, best wines and lovely comfortable d\u00e9cor.\n\nAbsolutely the best steak I\u2019ve ever had. Just trust the chef to cook the meat how it\u2019s best done and enjoy. The staff are super friendly and knowledgeable of all the different cuts of steak. This is definitely the best steak place in Queenstown and probably my favorite restaurant in the town. For a side, get the truffle Mac n cheese too \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb\n",

Mussels in cr\u00e8me sauce were good but nothing to write home about.\n\nSame for the eggs Benedict\n\nThe tabbouleh salad was really unexpectedly delicious.\n\nWe stopped here for breakfast before a big day of hiking. The service was very quick and the staff were very nice. The rosti was fantastic, a very generous serving. I\u2019d definitely return as everything was delicious.\n\nWe made a booking for lunch but had to cancel as our day trip plans to Milford sound took longer than expected. But we decided to try our luck without reservation at dinner and boy are we glad for that decision! The food and service is impeccable and I truly enjoyed the crispy duck bun, along with the pork duo and polenta fries. Highly recommended visit !!\n\nAbsolutely amazing food. This was our first restaurant after arriving in Queenstown, and it had set such high benchmark standards for the rest of the trip.\n\nThe chowder is a must order as it was creamy and buttery. Perfect with the bread that came along. The beef rib sandwich was good as well. The fried pickle offered a tangy contrast to the sandwich.\n\nLoved our dinner here - mussels were fabulous and staff were really attentive and friendly. We ordered the 2 hour slow cooked rib eye steak, fries, peaking duck and mussels with garlic toast. We sat outside and enjoyed the view of the lake.\n",

Daniel was fantastic! A must visit when in Queenstown.\n\nWow, what an amazing restaurant! The food was of exceptionally high quality, and the service was outstandingly friendly and helpful. Our waiter went above and beyond to assist us in choosing dishes and even took a beautiful sunset photo of us outside the restaurant. The meal itself was simply superb; we had the steak and ordered a dessert of cake and cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e.\n\nThis restaurant is amazing! The food is top-notch, and the service is super friendly. Our waiter helped us choose dishes and even took a great photo of us. The fish was absolutely delish!!!!\n\nFrench onion soup - This was a good onion soup. The soup base was intense like the French ones but the French were too salty. This one was just right. One thing it can improve, more cheese.\n\nLegendary seafood chowder - The name itself was a gimmick. I've had way better chowder from many many places. This was probably one of the more average one. Not saying it's not tasty, but the amount of cream, the thickness, and from all the seafood ingredients, you want to have a balanced but also strong enough to taste the presence of them.  Not impressed.\n\nBeef bourguignon - Average.  The beef were fine but the sauce overwhelmed by red wine, you want to have red wine to compliment the flavor of the beef not the other way around. This one I couldn't taste the flavor of the beef but just wine.  The pasta was Al dente\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc.\n\nSirloin steak - Great quality. The beef is tender, tasty. The thickness of the steak actually became an issue.  The grill steak I had in America is not big by volume but thick as texture.  I also preferred stronger grill taste.  Normally, you need a very strong grill to char it, locked in the juice and then it'll crisp up on the outside then lower it to grill it to medium rare. Or you can sous vide it to perfect temperature and charred it with strong flame grill.  This steak was not grill to crisp, in fact, it was warm when it was served.  The peppercorn sauce also underwhelmed.  I had to add fresh ground pepper to spike up the flavor.\n\nThis is a fine dine restaurant, I expected more from it. Otherwise, it's still quality cooking and it's not fair to compare to Michelin stars restaurants.\n\nMy partner and I celebrated our engagement here last night and the service was absolutely amazing! The food was delicious and the atmosphere was amazing too, a big Thank-you for making our night so special \ud83d\udc97\n\nWe will most definitely be returning the next time we\u2019re in Queenstown!\n",

Understandable although New Zealand has excellent wines in its own right. BUT wines - be red or white - are served at room temperature. Sorry, I couldn't drink my white wine. My wife ordered ice cubes... to improve the situation somewhat. I will never ever order wine in a restaurant in New Zealand - this restaurant killed it completely by serving white wine at this temperature...\nFood was okay.\n\nExemplary authentic italian food with delicious handmade pasta, love the angus beef ravioli! Staff very attentive too, prices reasonable too around $24 for a pasta. Garlic bread will be better if there is more garlic, but bread is handmade and still good\n\nGreat service and atmosphere, awesome pizza. The only issue is the carbonara, the egg was added when the dish was too hot, so in turn i ended up with scrambled egg through the dish. Easy mistake for a novice. But overall a good experience.\n\nWas super excited to try this place!\nAfter a long day out adventuring Queenstown, we decided to order in. I was hyped for some authentic Italian as advertised but what we ordered was not that.\n\nThe gnocchi sauce tasted like it had been poured out of a tin from the supermarket and was topped with tasty cheese. The margarita pizza tasted like domino\u2019s. Both meals were cold when they arrived and the delivery took 45 minutes longer than it said on the app.\n\nFor the price I paid ($62) I was expecting authentic Italian. Would not recommend if that is what you\u2019re expecting.\n\nOH EMM GEE.......HANDS DOWN - BEST ITALIAN FOOD IVE TASTED in a long time!!  The flavours were absolutely delicious as was my Aperol Spritz!  Amazing service just made this whole experience FANTASTIC!!

Management should look into having more training with him.\n\nMy visit to Nest Kitchen and Bar in Queenstown left me with a delightful culinary memory. I had the pleasure of savoring their smoked salmon bagel, and it was a true culinary gem.\n\nThe bagel was perfectly toasted, providing just the right amount of crunch to complement the luscious ingredients within. The generous serving of smoked salmon was of the highest quality, offering a delicate balance of smokiness and freshness. The capers, red onions, and cream cheese added layers of flavor that harmonized beautifully with the star of the dish.\n\nWhat truly stood out was the attention to detail in the presentation. The bagel was a work of art, as visually appealing as it was delicious. The service was friendly and efficient, adding to the overall enjoyable experience.\n\nNest Kitchen and Bar's inviting atmosphere and picturesque views of Queenstown's surroundings provided the perfect backdrop for this culinary experience.\n\nIn conclusion, the smoked salmon bagel at Nest Kitchen and Bar is a must-try for those seeking a memorable breakfast or brunch in Queenstown. It's a testament to the art of flavor and presentation, leaving a lasting impression on your taste buds and culinary senses.\n\nOne of the best dining experiences of our lives!\n\nWe went for the degustation menu and the food was simply excellent.\n\nWe would like to compliment the staff - every one of them were attentive, helpful, friendly and engaging.\n\nThe view was simply gorgeous!\n\nOverall 10/10 experience. We would highly recommend this place for special occasions!\n\nThe view was amazing! I'd recommend coming during the day time instead of night time as you get the whole lake view. Food wise was good, but not amazing in terms of international fine dining standards. It just feels like something is missing. My cod was slightly salty, but the lamb rump was done beautifully. The service could be a bit more attentive but it was friendly. Probably come back for breakfast next time!\n\nOur anniversary dinner at The Nest was one of the single best culinary and custom service experiences that we\u2019ve ever had. From the moment we walked in the wait staff interacted at a professionalism that we\u2019ve only experienced in 5 star resorts in Italy, and the food was a culinary experience that was second to none.\n\nWhile I don\u2019t enjoy dramatic or hyperbolic reviews, it\u2019s safe to say this was easily within our top 3 dining experiences and we will come back any time we are in Queenstown.\n\nIt was a memorable experience, the location and the restaurant itself were outstanding.\n\nVanessa and the staff looked after us, introducing the chef's dishes with great savoir faire.\n\nWe opted for the tasting menu and all the dishes were meticulously prepared, with international flavours blended with local ingredients.\n\nThere was a prevalence of seafood options Although also pork, wagyu and lamb were available.\n\nIn terms of fine dining experience I was satisfied, and the price for me was perfectly in line with their offerings.\n\nSurely this is a place you want to keep it in mind when you visit Queenstown.\n",

Food is really fresh. We were parked next to the kitchen, and could see everything being made.\n\nHad a pizza which was made by the head chef. Was fluffy and delicious.  Would definitely come back next time I visit Queenstown.\n\nI really enjoyed the cuisine at Bella cucina! We had a pizza and two pasta dishes.\nThe ingredient tasted fresh (including the parsley in the pasta) and the staff were friendly. Especially we were all impressed by your freshly made pasta which well cooked and went well with a sauce. Definitely would like to go back when we go to QT. Thanks!\n\nTop notch food! Fresh, natural, and just so nicely cooked. The clam spaghetti was just natural and right on the spot. Will definitely go there next time we visit Queenstown. Have recommended to a few friends already.\n\nThis is one of best eateries in Queenstown. Small and intimate it does not move away from its authenticity. The food was amazing and delicious. Try the dough balls ( small bread buns) with their infused olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Vongoli pasta and chicken roulade. Don't be surprised however if you don't find these on the menu. Their dishes change according to the season and availability of produce.\n\nWe had an amazing dinner here. The pasta, seafood & risotto are super delicious. The restaurant atmosphere is chill and relax but a bit crowded cuz the seating area is quite small. Overall, highly recommended and early reservation is needed.\n",

We appreciated the offers to change but were happy to eat it. (Appreciated the complimentary soft drinks) The next time we had a wee cheeky Chappy serving us he was funny and cool and read the room of his customers. Well done sir. A real cool groovy place. Will recommend and return.\n\nWe visited on Easter Monday, when the weather was gorgeous and every single outdoor table was occupied. We took a high table inside with a nice view of the bar. The beer selection was great, and we ordered pints of Panhead Sandman Hazy IPA (yum!!) and the Loaded Nachos with Chili and Guacamole. The nachos, served in a hot cast iron pan, were among the best I have ever tasted!\n\nThe service was as friendly, the beers came quickly, and the food came very shortly thereafter.\n\nWe loved our meal and would be here often if we lived in QT!\n\nFood was delicious, as had fish and chips, bbq cheeseburger and fish tacos. Cocktail dangerous daiquiri was really good as well.\nThe ladies served us so well and made us feel welcome. Thank you \ud83d\ude0a\n\nGreat location with happy hour 3pm-5pm $8 house pints\n\nOptions available for all dietary requirements\n\nVisited from the US and immediately felt like a local. The beer selection was fantastic, service was quick, and food was top notch. We had the cauliflower starter, and chicken burger, and \u201cworld burger\u201d for our main. Overall the vibes were immaculate in this place, and we\u2019ll definitely be coming again during our short time in New Zealand\n",

Everything was perfect from the atmosphere to the food & paired wines, and Grant's service was impeccable and incredibly knowledgeable (along with the others).\n\nIt's definitely the place to be if you want an unforgettable culinary experience in Queenstown.\n\nWe happened to stumble across this little cocktail bar after dinner somewhere else. Awesome cocktail menu, there is definitely something for everyone tastes and the barmen/ women are more than happy to make the classics too. They are beautiful presented with garish. It seemed to be quite a trendy spot for the tourists who were entertaining.\n\nWhat an experience! We had an awesome night enjoying the 8 course tasting menu. Everything was perfect from the vibe to the food and wines I\u2019d rate the experience 20/10. If you are looking for a nice meal perfectly paired with wines this is the place to go. The last dessert was the best with the late harvest Pinot gris wine.\n\nReally wonderful food and service. Our party had the eight course tasting menu. Staff explained each course and wine pairing wonderfully. The wines were paired really well. Portions were large for tastings.\nWe were worried about dress codes, but the restaurant was lenient and we saw many parties with pretty casual clothes even though the atmosphere would indicate more formal attire.\nThere was no issue accommodating the nut allergy my friend had.\nThe only point of improvement would be the quality of cherries used in my aviation and other cocktails. It would have been preferable to get a luxardo or equivalent rather than a red maraschino.\n\nI have had the pleasure of coming to The Bunker over the last ten years - it was exciting to come back after the renovations and see they\u2019ve made more space to ensure more people can get bookings! Still feels like a wonderful almost speak east style atmosphere with great appointments a now larger restaurant bar but still kept the low heat fireplaces, leather, black table clothes and green \u201cbookie\u201d lights with the historical Queenstown photos to dine amongst.\n\nThe food is always spectacularly prepared and is of portion sizes which mean you can do three courses or a tasting menu without feeling like you have to roll yourself back to your accomodation.\n\nThe staff are incredibly inviting and knowledgeable about the local area, produce, flavours and dishes. Love a good chat with staff that are engaging and attentive.\n\nCocktails are great to enjoy - the Casino Royale Vesper is still a favourite - smooth and delicious with all courses but the wine list is wonderful without being confusingly large featuring many of those that make this province shine for their wine making talents.\n\nFor me it\u2019s one not to be missed every visit on the near annual trips. Book early to get a preferred time with perhaps only 30-34 people able to fit in each half of the new renovations.\n",

It\u2019s super busy though so definitely get there early.\nWe had the pancakes and the French toast. Both were delicious but our favourite has to be the French toast.\n\nThis place is hella popular and it's easy to see why. The main draw for me was plenty of options for dietary issues, and I had the eggplant dish which was a huge serving size and absolutely delicious. The staff had such a good vibe about them, and the almond mocha I ordered was probably the best I've ever had. If you can get a table, this place is definitely worth the hype!\n\nEdit to add: I went back twice after my initial review and every single time the food and drinks were top notch. Can't recommend it enough!!\n\nFood was tasty, and sharable. We got the beef brisket and an appetizer. We were able to share this between 3 girls. If you are hungry though, getting two apps and the brisket would probably suffice!\n\nA standout health food place in my opinion, and my favorite meal in Queenstown. Ordered the Turkish eggs and the raspberry and pistachio French toast, which were both incredibly tasty and had creative flavoring\u2014definitely not as basic as they sound. Combined with outdoor seating, it was a great brunch experience!\n\nYum! And very accomodating for our little one with food allergies. French toast was absolutely delicious, pancakes were yummy but did get a tad trifle-like-soggy under all the berries, might be better on the side? All around though a delicious breakfast and buzzing little place.\n",

Couldn\u2019t fault anything & as a Qtwn local we are intending this to be our regular dining experience! Was utterly superb!\n\nHad steak somewhere in Queenstown, that meal make me think \"Queenstown never compare to my CHCH\" until I had Angus Steak here. That is what steak should taste like!!!\nEveryone! MUST! COME!\n\nThe restaurant\u2019s view is the only high thing I can talk about as it overlooks the mountains from the window. However the service attitude of staff is missing. We ordered dinner with soup,  entr\u00e9e and main course and they served us main course first. When I asked about the soup, the rude reply came that I have only two hands to serve. Basic etiquette of serving a dinner are missing , looks like no training given to staff and how to speak to guests. Next day I order a simple Omlette and what I got was the most hopeless Omlette I ever had in my lifetime. The cook didn\u2019t even know how to stuff the Omlette with simple fillings and the dish was just thrown on my table as if a great favour was done to me. Menu of breakfast was same for all the three days we stayed. The rooms are average and the bathing tub is risky as no anti skid mat. I felt so unsafe while taking bath. Overall I didn\u2019t find it worth the price I paid for three nights\n\nHad the most delicious dinner. The Ribye was amazing and Apparently the Salmon too. Dessert pavlova a good size and delicious. Highly recommend. \ud83e\udd29\ud83d\ude0a\n\nVery few vegetarian options, entr\u00e9es were good but the mains were rather plain and unenjoyable. It is quite expensive for what you get even though the portion sizes were decent. The view and restaurant were beautiful and well kept, also the staff were friendly and polite. However, the food is the main reason to go to a restaurant and our meals simply weren't very good.\n\nI would have a hard time recommending this restaurant for the price and quality.\n",

We noticed that it\u2019s been a while since a review so here is an update.\n\nThe menu is simple and provides enough of a range to suit anyone\u2019s pallet. There\u2019s a dedicated vegetarian and vegan menu and, they can cater to dietary requirements although best to speak with the Ma\u00eetre De / Restaurant Manager about what can be accommodated.\n\nWe had the Baked Feta and Crispy Chicken options from the Entr\u00e9e menu, alongside sides of mash potatoes and roast vegetables. This was a great amount of food for 2 people. We also had room for desert and the lava cake is recommended. I was able to obtain a cream-free option as I am lactose-intolerant.\n\nI can\u2019t rate the staff service enough. A special appreciation goes to Yuka whose service and standards are fantastic. The chef was also great - which goes to show that it\u2019s not always about it going perfect but the people who can help out when something doesn\u2019t go quite right. All in all, would recommend dining here for dinner!\n\nEvery dish we ordered was absolutely exceptional and our waiter was so friendly and hospitable. We ordered the seafood chowder, Mackenzie's salad for entre, porkbelly and zucchini risotto for mains followed by the most magnificent peanut butter ice cream cake.\n\nGreat atmosphere, great service, delicious food - would 10/10 recommend dining in if staying at the gorgeous Hertiage Hotel in Queenstown. Well worth it!\n\nVery tasty (especially salmon and steak), friendly staff, I strongly reccomend :)\n\nService was good but portions were way over priced. For $19 I got what would be a starter in most places. The buffet looked decent but don't order the avocado smash its so not worth it.\n\nBeautiful diner tonight, pork belly and the pasta of the day and the lovely choc lava was the best\n",

Ordered another round, \ud83d\ude0b\n\nNot sure I would return for the veggie versions but maybe the meat dishes are better!\n\nbest latin american food i\u2019ve ever had. just beautiful.\nall the flavours are spot on. very tender pork on that cubano. burrito is not mushy unlike some other mexican restaurants. pictures don\u2019t do justice how amazing they are.\n\nthe coxinhas are so good, definitely a must try.\nhorchata is very refreshing, perfect balance to the spiciness of the food. their sauces are equally great.\n\nhighly recommended.\n\nA cosy, little Latin American eatery with a wide range of meals. We loved its ambienece and the friendliess of staff members was also praiseworthy! We went for the vegetarian nachos and  we requested it extra spicy. It turned out to be a great choice. We also had a horchata. I found it a bit too sweet, but the cinnamon flavour in it was very enjoyable.\n\ngood value for money; has a cool vibe.\nwe've ordered beef burrito (good), chicken arepas (good, but needs sauce to be yum) and beef nachos (very good).\n\nAwesome little eatery with (what seems like) authentic arepas and other Latin American food.\n\nWe had the arepas and tacos, plus a horchata to drink. The arepas were the highlight - a Colombian dish of delicious warm corn flatbread cut in half and with rich fillings like pulled pork or chicken and avocado. This seems like their signature dish. I haven't been to Colombia but it tasted right, like it was they way it is meant to be.\n\nThe tacos were not as good and didn't seem as authentic - maybe the chef is Colombian? They came on blue corn tortillas but they had too many beans in them. Horchata was sweet but very yum.\n\nThe downside was the service. The person at the till was super distracted, and I had to remind her twice to make my horchata.\n\nThere is very little room to sit inside, so you'll be outside in the cold if you're more than a 2-3 person party. However the vibe is pretty good with contemporary Spanish-language pop and rock music blasting and colourful decorations.\n",

It was absolute value-for-money!\n\nThe main dishes were generally okay, with quite small portions. However, they were nothing much to write home about. The drinks and sides were the stars of the show, and I would definitely be back especially for the fried chicken.\n\nHowever\u2026 the desserts here were really expensive, costing as much as a main dish. If you are craving Taiwanese desserts, you\u2019re better off going to another place like Nine Fresh.\n\nVery nice Taiwanese food bistro if you miss Taiwan food! The braised pork belly rice is very flavorful, oyster egg omelette is differently made compare to sg style, and the egg crepe roll is also very crispy.\n\nVery satisfying meal indeed. I had a very joyous dining experience! My family and I enjoyed the food very much \ud83d\ude04\n\nThis time I ordered something new like Fried Chicken with Cheese, and all my family members love it so much!\nLove their meesua too, but I ran out of it yesterday. So I ordered their pork belly rice and udon, scallion oil chicken rice and as usual, the food at 8 Degree always satisfies my craving for Taiwanese food!\n\nTheir Bubble tea also spoil me with their choices.. all yummyy!\n\nTry them out! Super recommended!\n\nFood was pretty good! Reasonably priced too. Shop is simple but service was good and Aircon always nice in Singapore. Recommend you try their eggroll with floss. Somewhat like a crepe/fresh popiah roll.\n\nAlso recommend trying the sesame cold noodles paired with a fried chicken with cheese.\n\nPork rice was also nice, not too sweet, hardboiled egg was also very good quality and with their spicy chili dip. Very good!\n\nOh I also really liked their bubble tea. Even at zero percent sugar it was good. The pearls here are really chewy soft and can tell it's made fresh.\n\nWill be back to try other dishes when I'm in the area again.\n\nCame here for Taiwanese food and really enjoyed our meal!\n\nTo drink, we tried the milk tea with pearl, jasmine green tea with pearl and the grass jelly milk tea (all large size)! The portion was really generous, they gave loads of Pearls, and the tea taste was rich and strong\n\nWe tried the chitterling and oyster meesua, the pork belly rice and the cold sesame noodles (pictured below) which we all enjoyed.\n\nA yummy meal, would like to come back one day and try more dishes!\n",

My partner and I ordered scallion chicken rice, veg, pork floss egg roll with cheese, milk tea, honey butter toast.\n\nI don\u2019t usually eat rice bowls but I thoroughly enjoyed the scallion chicken rice which was flavourful and fragrant! Would definitely recommend this dish.\n\nLoved the hot milk tea at 50% sweetness too. I don\u2019t really eat pearls but this one was nice!\n\nWould have preferred the egg roll to be more cheesy with the usual crispy kind as it turned out to be more of a soft chewy dough - still rather interesting and some may like that.\n\nHoney butter toast was a nice dessert to end our meal!\n\nHad a nice dinner at this Taiwanese restaurant. The staff is really friendly and the cafe itself is cosy. Loved their scallion oil chicken rice. It was very flavourful. We ordered 2 mains, 2 side dishes along with their signature pearl milk tea. The price is reasonable and definitely worth the visit.\n\nOur favorite to go when we craving for Taiwanese food. The Pork Belly Rice is a mix of fatty and lean braised pork, pickled veggies, all on fluffy white pearl rice. \ud83e\udd24 The Scallion Oil Chicken Rice has this killer fragrant sauce and perfectly shredded chicken. Worth the try\n\nService was impeccable and food was served promptly. Their chilli is really good. Mixed it with the \u5364\u8089\u996d&\u5927\u80a0\u9762\u7ebfand it gave both dishes more flavour.\n\nMilk tea is really fragrant, I had ordered 0% sugar.\n\nAiyu Bing was nice, but could have been colder and it would be even better. Portion is huge. Worth it.\n\nHad a great dinner at 8degrees with my family, we really enjoyed the signature pork belly rice as well as the other dishes! The prices are affordable and it\u2019s a hidden gem in Kovan. Definitely worth a visit if you enjoy authentic Taiwanese cuisine. Highly recommend the milk tea with pearl \ud83d\udc4d and scallion pancakes!\n",

Especially their egg fried rice, it's really authentic and you can tell how it was skillfully wok-fried. The restaurant though is more suited for families and groups of people, so it's a bit noisy and not suitable for couple dine-ins. The dish per order is quite pricey but it could be shared for two. Overall, we enjoyed the food here!\n\nThe location is great, though other branches like the one in Nex are brighter and nicer. The food is good as always, we loved the hot and sour soup, soup dumplings, egg fried rice etc. Dessert-wise it would have been great if they serve the taro sago in coconut milk like the branches in Shanghai.\n\nDate of visit : Tue 15 Aug 2023\nTime : 11.30 am\n\nThis time we arrived early. No queue.\nWe basically ordered the same dishes. Thru the QR code and self-ordering.\nFood is alright quality remains the same.\n\nDate of visit : 17 Jan 2023\nTime : 12.15 pm\n\nNot much queue. Food came quickly. Service and tea is good.\n\nEverything was ok, except maybe the noodles.\n\nClassic taiwanese cuisine. The dumplings are out of this world!!! Prices might be a bit high for traditional Chinese cuisine, but worth it considering the Michelin star, AND they make it for you on the spot, fully transparent for anyone to see. Seasonal additions are good too.\n\nDing Tai Fung always delivers a delightful experience! I ordered their fantastic egg fried rice, which was as delicious as ever. The xiao long bao were freshly made and bursting with flavor. The mi sua with chicken soup was a winner, packed with rich taste. Dining here is a surefire way to enjoy a flawless meal.\n",

Please try the both the steam and pan fried versions! Order with hot sour soup and scallion pancakes to share and it\u2019s settled!\n\nTry their steamed dumplings \ud83e\udd5f\u2764\ufe0f. The skin has a lovely bite to it and the filling is seasoned perfectly. When you take a bite, the flavourful juice from the filling flows out making it a more enjoyable experience!\n\nReally love this simple and comforting food.. if you love \u8471\u6cb9\u997c (Spring onion pancake)\uff0c\u997a\u5b50 (boiled dumplings)\uff0c\u9505\u8d34(pan-fried dumplings)\uff0c\u8c46\u6c99\u997c(red bean pancake)\u3002\u3002 Go and try it. Very affordable and accessible.. nearest train station - Lavender\n\nAfter over a year in Singapore this is still the best taste for value fried rice I've had, and that's not even the store's specialty. Pass over the long queue at Tai Hwa Pork Noodle and give the scallion & egg pancake, dumplings, and fried noodle here a try\n\nThis is my go to place if I want to eat China dumplings and hot and sour soup. As many have highlighted, the scallion pancake is to die for. They are all so good, much better than what many restaurants can produce. It's in a coffee shop so the ambiance is not high class but the food is really authentic and very high quality. Don't miss this.\n\nApproved by a fellow Shenyang-native. Highly recommend the chive and egg stuffed pancake \u97ed\u83dc\u76d2\u5b50 - better than my mum\u2019s.\nAlso worth trying the fried noodle: addictively garlicky and slightly spicy. Very different from fried noodles commonly seen in Singapore.\n",

Serving size is just about right for an adult male. It seems to be managed by Taiwanese so the food should be authentic. The place is small but cozy and decorated with old school nostalgic household items. It's a good place for a quiet lunch. Overall a thumbs up and would visit again.\n\nHas the lu rou fan set which taste good on it's only, the mushroom tempura is well seasoned too. Egg is old school hard boil though, so nothing too exciting there. Oh ya chili is really good and goes well.\n\nThe salt crispy chicken is very underwhelming, feels like very poor chicken quality. Milk tea is ok, the pearl feels a bit dry.\n\nHonestly price point is steep for comfort food.\n\nWe ordered the braised pork belly rice set, intestine mee sua, and egg pancake with cheese and pork floss. The taste was very homely and generally good, though I wished that the flavours were stronger. Perhaps it's just my personal preference, but I would have loved a bit more of the oiliness that those at a street stall in the night market would have, which makes it a little more authentic.\n\nWe still enjoyed our time there, and the decor was also very nostalgic, with typewriters and cassette tapes!\n\nA good place to have some Taiwanese food! We ordered braised pork rice, mee sua with braised intestines & oysters, fried chicken and fried king mushroom! All rice and mee sua were good. The fried chicken was succulent and the fried mushroom was really moist and juicy inside! Overall a really pleasant dining experience!\n\nSalty crispy chicken rice and Crispy Cheese & Pork Floss Egg Pancake is nice \ud83d\udc4d . Lu ru fan(mince meat bowl has more fats then meat though.\nBlack tea kosong with pearl bubble tea ($4) was good \n",

Really enjoyed the flavourful beef noodles and dumplings which were handmade and actually Fiona\u2019s family recipe. Boss is also a fellow rider and made us feel at home. His dogs are so cute!\n\nAuthentic Taiwanese food.\nRecommended:\n1. Kala chicken leg rice\n2. Braised Beef Shanks\n3. Century egg tofu\n\nOverall:\nGood food with a neighbourhood cafe vibes. Really value for money!\n\nFood (GST and service charge applicable. Prices before):\n1) braise pork rice set - comes with preserved vege , half a braised egg, and braised pork with sufficient braised sauce. Tastes very balanced! Not too oily but really flavourful with the sour notes from the preserved vege accompanying.\n2) beef noodle soup - strong flavoured beef soup, with thick cut noodles and thinly sliced beef pieces. Favourite of the day\n3) gyoza - comes in 10 large pieces. It's lightly panfried and comes in either cabbage/\u9152\u83dc + pork. We opted for the \u9152\u83dcone and it was decent. Worth the price\n4) crispy pork big intestine - this is pretty tasty and nicely seasoned after deep-fried, however it's a little smaller than what we expected for the price.\n\nService:\nOrders are placed via web-app thru QR code, and pay at counter after you're done eating. as at 01-Sep-23, paywave is acceptable.\n\nThere was only one lady in charge of serving everyone for the full dinner service, so don't expect servers to come to you greeting you and asking for your orders and recommending you things to eat. It's pretty no-frills in this regard. Nevertheless, food are served to you and not self-collect with beeper.\n\nDog owners do take note! Place states it's dog-friendly yet the seating that's truly dog-friendly is only a small strip of area outside of the \"outdoor\" seating. Seating that only accommodates 2pax per seat. We had to tie our dogs by the railing as our group's 5-pax.\n\nDecent food tho. Try the railway bento and salt-pepper chicken \u270c\ufe0f\n\nA rustic place offering Taiwanese signatures like braised pork rice, beef noodles and dumplings, etc.\n\nA place to patronise when you have cravings for food from Formosa.  Serving portion is just about right for 1 person. That gives you the chance to order more dishes to share with dining companions.\n",

The culinary expertise is evident in every detail, from the impeccable presentation to the rich, complex flavors that left me craving more.\n\nThe menu at Abundance reflects a true passion for Taiwanese food, offering a diverse array of options that cater to every palate. The friendly and attentive staff added to the overall enjoyable dining experience, making me feel welcomed and ensuring that each dish was a memorable journey.\n\nIf you're a fan of Taiwanese cuisine or just eager to embark on a flavorful adventure, Abundance is a must-visit. My taste buds thank me, and yours will too!\n\nFood:\nFood was really great with creative choice from the restaurant. Taste was really good. Dessert (ice cream roll) is a must-try for me. Interesting cocktails, craft beers, and drinks.\n\nService:\nThe reservation was at 7pm but the seat was not ready within 15 mins (understandable as it was a large group but could be improved).\nBrought a cake for celebration. When I asked for the cake, I was expecting the cake to be served by the staff but I was given the cake and served it myself instead. (Service charge was in the bill, so customer would expect better service)\n\nAtmosphere:\nAmbience was great but could get noisy in peak hours. I could not hear clearly what my friend was saying who sit two seat away from me (maybe could improve on sound absorption?)\n\nLovely place for some novelty Taiwanese cuisine! We had the chicken and the prawn buns. O thought the dressing that came with the chicken bun was too wet for my liking, but the chicken was well fried and crispy. The prawn patty was quite nice too! Truffle fries is a pass. The sauce for the dumplings was a touch too heavy for my liking, though the addition of lard is a nice plus. Finally, the dessert is really good in my opinion, because I'm a bit of a weirdo and I like coriander ad peanut with ice cream. It makes sense to me, but I get it's not everyone's thing. Shout out to the staff who checked how many pieces I wanted the ice cream cut into. She had considered that I was there in a family of three, and that I might not have wanted the default sliced in two. Will definitely recommend, and also come back!\n\nA well-hidden gem in the Redhill HDB estate. The Taiwanese cuisine at Abundance was a pleasure experience for us. The authenticity in each dish transported me to the lively streets of Taiwan, with a good combination of savoury, acidity, spices and texture evident from the first bite to the last. Their culinary expertise left us wanting for more.\n\nThe friendly and attentive staff enhanced the overall dining experience, making us feel welcomed and ensuring each dish was prepared with effort.\n\nIf you're a foodie person, Abundance is a must-visit dining location.\n\nThe atmosphere was rather cramped and basic, but the food made up for it. Nestled at the block near the MSCP, this place is a treat. The balsamic fries were an interesting find. The gua bao was a hit. Kids also loved the beef noodles. The salted egg prawn gua bao was nicely done. One dish I didn't like the fish paste chicken... a bit overpowered by the fish paste. Lack of kids' utensils and plates make this place slightly kid unfriendly, although high chairs are available. It's a simple fix that the management should look into. The meal was rounded off with their black sesame ice cream popiah and the peanut with coriander ice cream popiah. The latter is a definite must try!! It was so good we forgot to take a photo of it. Price wise, the food is not cheap, but the innovative menu is a treat! Was crowded on a Sunday evening, and I recommend booking ahead.\n",

Surprisingly, there was no lunch crowd, but that didn't necessarily translate into a great dining experience.\n\nThe food was just average, lacking the depth of flavor we expected, and it leaned towards the pricier side, making it hard to justify the cost.\n\nWe attempted to use deals via Burpple, but unfortunately, the staff's unfriendly response left us quite disappointed with their attitude and service.\n\nOn a positive note, the restaurant had an alright atmosphere with a nice design, but it didn't make up for the underwhelming food and staff interaction.\n\nMy friend and I ordered the Hokkien mee, crispy hor fun and prawn cakes. The Hokkien mee was flavourful and satisfying, and the crispy hor fun was surprisingly good but might be a bit jelak. The prawns were a bit powdery and tough though. I didnt enjoy the prawn cakes as it tasted a bit weird.\n\nWhen we were checking out, they offered a 10% discount in exchange for a Google Review. They didn\u2019t specify if it had to be a 5 star review tho, so take it as you will.\n\nHokkien prawn noodles tastes really good in my opinion but really too oily from the roasted pork & lard added I believe. I\u2019m certain that the amount of oil can be halved at least. Other than that, prawns are fresh & huge. Place is IG friendly. Service is ok.\n\nMai hiam buay pai.  I love their man tou, Hokkien mee slightly above average for me but lots of ingredients which justify their price. Pork cheek also not bad. Second time patronised this restaurant because we wanna try their Hokkien mee. I will not return again for their Hokkien mee but other dishes, why not?\n\nPretty average food. Nothing much to wow about. Need to reserve early for seats, walk in will be taking a risk. Maybe is the hype from influencer that\u2019s causes everyone to come. Prawn noodle above average but for selling price not much worth it because of the big prawn that\u2019s all. Stingray was kind of disappointed due to was deep fried first, kind of wasted to execute this way. Overall not worth the price paying for.\n",

Honey Chicken (as with our sides) was so well marinated & crispy even though it was packed up. The fragrant pork belly rice has a good ratio of meat-sauce-rice that makes it delectable! At least 5 plump oysters swimming in my mianxian, & I'm so gleeful downing it! I highly recommend the sesame chicken bites too - a must-order side to accompany your meal, or just pair it with a bbt for a quick snack! Bbt here are the large 700ml cups & $5 a cup with toppings already included is such a steal! Ours are their bestsellers, the first a refresher, & the latter oh-so-smooth we need another cuppa! \ud83d\ude0b\n\nOrdered salt and pepper mee sua. Super good and flavourful. But need to wait 15 mins for the food  to be ready. The staff will inform you the waiting time before ordering.\n\nNot bad la. But the rice was too mushy. And when they said bento, I sort of expected a bento. This is more like a bowl. Price a bit high for the size.\n\nMango tea was ok. But the agar ball was weird. It was more of a popping ball.\n\nNice mixed of chicken with sides, flavourful and satisfying. Nice taiwanese flavoured.\nOnly shortcoming might be the preparation time.\n",

It\u2019s hard to explain but it just wasn\u2019t good. Lacking in flavour and basically just salty. The chicken wings that came with the set although well fried, the meat wasn\u2019t moist and you could tell that it\u2019s a cheap frozen wing.\n\nThe indoor portion of the restaurant also had a rather bad smell, but at least we could choose to sit outside.\n\nWill definitely not be back here or to even try other branches.\n\nBlanco Court Beef Noodle is a beloved establishment in Singapore, renowned for its delectable bowls of beef noodles. As you step inside the unassuming eatery, you are immediately greeted by the rich aroma of simmering spices and savory broth, setting the stage for a culinary experience that is nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nThe star of the show at Blanco Court Beef Noodle is, of course, the beef noodle soup. The broth is the heart and soul of this dish, and Blanco Court does not disappoint.\n\nReally a delicious bowl of beef noodles, with tender beef slice, smooth noodles that mixed very well with the gravy, spicy tangy chilli sauce to mix with the noodles, beef, gravy. Soup is delicious too. Only thing is that the portion slightly small at $9.90...but as we know..inflation...inflation.\n\nGreedy me bought the Large Superior Bowl cause I wanted it all!\n\nThe portion was huge and the ingredients were all clean & fresh.\n\nSlightly Salty for the dry sauce, I used the like and chilli paste to reduce it.\n\nThe soup was flavorful. I asked for a refill & they gave me a bowl.\n\nComfort food especially on a rainy day. Dinner Queue was reasonable as Thai Food was crowded.\n\nThe best beef noodle I've tasted. Ordered the superior beef noodles and the beef slices, tendon, and balls are all superb. The sauce was initially starchy but turned more fluid as I ate.\n",

Apart from the bento, they also have other stuff like noodles and soup. The food looks not bad and have always wanted to dine here. I happen to run some errands nearby and decided to drop by for lunch one day.\n\nWith much anticipation, ordered their fried chicken bento which was SGD$7.50 for the big portion. When the food came, I was quite disappointed because the fried chicken was very small piece. The rice bowl came with 2 different kind of veg and half a braised egg. First thing, my food was served cold. Fried Chicken felt like it have been prepared for quite sometime back. Chicken was not crispy and it lack seasoning.\n\nUtterly disappointed with the food. Would not recommend. With that being said, Owner was Friendly, contrast to what other review have said.\n\nIn a corner of Queensway, this tiny eatery serves reliably yummy lu rou fan (braised pork rice)! Used to eat here fairly often when I was working nearby, and it most defnitely qualifies as good comfort food. \u2661\n\n\ud835\udc03\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc32 \ud835\udc12\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc29 & \ud835\udc01\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1d \ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc24 \ud835\udc11\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc12\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2d ($\ud835\udfd4)\nA smaller bowl of braised pork rice with their homemade soup.

Really lovely home cooked taste. Apparently the large (+$1) will have more rice and more meat, but even the small was hearty enough. I want to try the soup and other dishes next! Will definitely be back again :)\n\nUpdate: I\u2019ve been back multiple times since my first review and each time it\u2019s SO GOOD. Seems like they change up the soup every so often. It\u2019s definitely of my favorite places to eat in this area.\n\nIt\u2019s been awhile since I visited. Happy to know that the homely taste I love has not changed! Definitely worth a visit. \u2764\ufe0f this is located inside Queensway Shopping Centre, nothing fancy about the ambience, but a simple but definitely good budget-friendly meal with lots of options\n",

We felt like we were taken back to Taiwan as soon as we walked in. Super popular amongst the Taiwanese expats in town and always full at night even on weekdays - better to make reservations in advance!\n\nReally loved the \u5364\u8089\u996d, felt that it was really authentic and affordable. As for the other dishes they weren't particularly spectacular except the deep fried oysters but it was not bad to say the least. I enjoyed the varying types of tea they offered.\n\nThe food was generally served quickly, and the place itself was quite vibey. Felt a little like stepping into Taiwan.\n\nWide variety of food to choose from that we ordered too much. All tasted quite authentic Taiwanese. Place a bit so small so can get full house real quick\n\nA Taiwanese friend recommended this restaurant and it was the best Taiwanese food I have had in Singapore. The \u76d0\u9165\u9e21 (golden fried chicken), fried rice, yam balls, bitter gourd with salted egg were exceptionally good. The meatball soup was mediocre. Stir fried sweet potato leaves with Sakura ebi was simple yet flavourful.

                  "reviews": "\n\nSweet potato porridge was really nice, traditional taste. Oysters omelette, braised pork belly are two dishes that go very well with the porridge. The restaurant is next to Toa Payoh Town park so some tables has great view of the park. The dining environment is a bit rundown but they will shift to a new location soon.\n\nStewed pork - Fine but could have been a little more tender.\nBraised pig\u2019s large intestines - Too soft.\n3 types of eggs with Chinese spinach - Fine.\nFresh cockles - Fresh and plump. Better with chilli sauce.\nFrog with spring onion - Not bad.\n\nCame here specifically to eat before they move to macpherson. This place is bustling and full house when we reached around 6pm. Recommend you reserve in advance.\n\nPorridge is pretty plan and simple but thats the charm and they give you a full bucket of it which u will be sure to finish. There is sweet potato inside.\n\nFood is awesome and right up the alley of my chinese taste buds. My favourite dish was the shredded pork and the prawn paste chicken. Packed with flavour and right on que with the crispiness for the chicken.\n\nHad the fish maw  but you can do without it as the price is pretty steep for $30, but it is a HUGE bowl for at least 5 pax so its worth it.\n\nThe minced meat with salted egg is pretty much a must when eating porridge. You  need somethinv salty.\n\nThe omellete is soft, nice and fluffy with fresh oysters that soak up the juices of the porridge or anyother dish sauce.\n\nKang kong is 'crispy' and spicy.\n\nI seldom talk about the free side dish but the braised penut and sour vegetables are damn good appetisers with your porridge.\n\nThe atmosphere is your noisy chinese restaurant in front of a park with a nice view as its glass all around.\n\nThe place is a 7 mins walk from Toa payoh mrt and there is no reason for you to not come and try. Highly recommended.\n\nOASIS TAIWAN PORRIDGE \ud83c\udf5a\ud83e\udd62\ud83e\udd63\ud83c\udfe1\u26f2\ufe0f\ud83e\udeb4\n\nBEST PORRIDGE VIBES EVER! \u2764\ufe0f\n\nThanks to a friend\u2019s posting, got reacquainted with Oasis Taiwan Porridge. It didn\u2019t struck me but this was the iconic porridge place that was once situated at Kallang but they had to move to make way for the stadium. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\n\nThey are presently at Toa Payoh garden where they still have a large restaurant facing the gardens, not quite as iconic as Kallang, but a very good alternative. Sadly, due to move again - last day 14 Jan and they resume business at a new location near Grantrall Mall 1 Feb 2024. \ud83e\udd79\ud83e\udd72\ud83d\ude1f\n\nA 52 years legacy and 38 years in the biz - fans of Oasis would no doubt reminisce the good old days when the food at Oasis was top notch. Nonetheless, still a comfy place to savour piping hot porridge with family or hosting friends. Overlooking the serene greens and tranquil pond - it\u2019s still quite a vibe. \ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc9a\n\nSo, head down to eat before they move, because I don\u2019t think we will be experience this kinda nice mood with Taiwan porridge and a scenery hand-in-hand. Best thing yet? - unlimited porridge, they open till 11 pm (great for supper option) and parking is so easily available. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\n\nRecommendations: Chai Po Omelette, Braised Duck, Salted Fish Steamed Pork, Pomfret in Black Bean Sauce, Oasis Beancurd, Bean Sprouts with Salted Fish. \ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc6\n.\n.\n.\n\ud83d\udccdOASIS TAIWAN PORRIDGE\n303 Lorong 6 Toa Payoh\nSingapore 319 393\n\nOasis Taiwan Porridge \u6d77\u4eac\u697c\u53f0\u6e7e\u7ca5\n\nFood is 3.5 stars, the pomfret with black beans and leek is good, so is the salted squids that is cooked right and chewy. The highly rated salted egg minced meat is so so. Worth return to try their other dishes.\n",

Sausages were great, beef rice was also great, haven't tried the drinks yet but will do so next time.\n\nA lot of my Taiwanese friends recommend here as well, so I guess that's a good sign.\n\nThe braised pork rice is good though portion kinda small. The cheese foam tea is excellent while the fried mushroom a bit oily and not very seasoned.\nService okay, staff quite relaxed and atmosphere good.\nOverall, a good restaurant. And it will permanently close soon.\n\nBraised pork rice has a nice taste but very small bowl.  Oyster mee sua was quite nice. Shredded chicken is available at top up.\n\nWe also had the garlic beef $26 after tax.. Had multiple pieces too chewy.. Personally find it overcooked and not much taste for me.\n\n2 pax : mee sua x 1, braised pork rice x 1, garlic beef x 1, aiyu jelly x 1, 1 plain rice total paid  $23 pax after svc charge & Gst.. \u5403\u4e0d\u5305 \ud83d\ude02\n\nNearest public car park is J0100 very walkable.\n\nLovely corner shop along Pasir Panjang Road with quaint, yet homely decor. Being in an industrial area, it was relatively quiet during a weekday dinner.\n\nFood was very tasty and the flavours were reminiscent of Taipei street food.\n\nOne inconvenience is the ordering system as you are unable to see the available variations (e.g. hot/cold drinks selection) unless you order one and check if the variation is available. Could use some improvement if you need to cut on waiting staff.\n\nMy favourite place for Taiwanese lu rou fan, it's the best in SG. Do order the onsen eggs as well, perfectly done with marinated and soft yolk. The Mee Sua is not bad too but the vegetable dish is overcooked and too soft for me. Best of all, prices are very reasonable. Take note that portions are small hence the name for big eaters.\nIt's a small restaurant so go early to avoid queues. Service is fast though.\nIt is the only restaurant I know where you not only order using your phone but pay also.\n",

When people are ordering, please tell them they're ordering too much or too little.\n\nDynasty fried porridge lady does this, and it helped us with deciding the appropriate portion size.\n\nFood at this place is really nice. Malaysian style. My family really liked it, and we'll be back \ud83d\ude4f\n\nBest fried porridge ever I eaten in Spore. The claypot bee Tai Bak is super sedaplicious. Can really match those in Msia. Ask for less salt as their food tend to be on the salty side.\n\nCame on a Mon around 6.30pm, coffeeshop had quite a bit of tables available. Ordered their signatures like Fried porridge, KL Tai Lok Mee, San Lou Beehoon and Claypot Bi Tai Mak.\n\nPersonally feel that their Claypot Bi Tai Mak was the best out the 4, followed by KL Tai Lok Mee, Fried Porridge then San Lou Beehoon. However, of the 4 dishes I would probably only recommend the Claypot Bi Tai Mak.\n\nClaypot Bi Tai Mak was flavourful and hits the right spot. Albeit a little on the saltier side, it\u2019s pretty good. Tai Lok Mee was alright, nothing special. Fried porridge was a little disappointing; no wokhei, every bite seemed to have some cuttlefish(?) while others had pork lard. Nothing special, didn\u2019t have the distinct fried porridge taste. San Lou Beehoon was just\u2026 chaota. Legit burnt taste, not wokhei kind of burnt.\n\nProbably wouldn\u2019t come back again.\n\nWas here on 15th May 2023.\n\nOrdered the claypot meetaimak/laoshufen which I found pretty tasty albeit salty. Enjoyed the generous serving of pork lard and meat in the dish.\nHad the KL Hokkien mee, the noodles were good. Thick and authentic. However, it was missing the wok hei taste. The lard however, managed to add a lot of flavour to it.\n\nOverall, for $15, I find the food pretty good.\n\nReally good fried porridge! Umami from dried seafood and great texture from yam. Sweet potato leaves were young and well fried.\n",

Keep you steamed up with\nRed dates and some Chinese herb. Not overly powerful but good to your throat\nAnd nice in your tummy. The cumin based shewers of mutton and pork slice\nTaste so good. The grilled squid is a must try, so chewy good. My wife just love the squid grilled to its chew chew\nShiokness. Don't miss this place if you\nCare for a not overly spiced powdered\nMala flavour. Must karry on makan.\n\nCame to this place during mid June this year. Overall the food quality is much better than other Chinese restaurants especially their \u8fa3\u5b50\u9e21 (diced chicken with chilli) - those diced chicken are well-seasoned and the taste is authentic. Do try their dumpling too, the skin is thinner as compared to other Chinese dumpling we usually had in other places. Mushroom skewer is a must-try item as well. The only item we don\u2019t appreciate it is their beancurd skewer which we find it tough to consume..\n\nIn sum, the food quality with such an affordable price will definitely make us visit here again.\n\nHappened to be walking around and found this Chinese restaurant that serves authentic Chinese food. Affordable, and not as oily. Skewers are priced pretty decently. Ordered a few skewers, potato slices, scallop with vermicelli. Thought the scallops were alittle tough. So I may not order it again. My friends enjoyed the potato slices. Surprisingly tasty. Good customer service as well. Compared to many other Chinese restaurants, I honestly feel their menu is one of the more comprehensive one. They even included pictures of the dishes, so if you don\u2019t know what to order, or how to read the Chinese characters, fret not, there\u2019s pictures!\n\nIn my next visit, I\u2019ll probably take more photos! Will be back again if I\u2019m nearby. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\n\nTry their skewers and diced chicken chilli !\nMenu comes with pictures for better illustration.\nThere are 4 outdoor seating but serving Robot can't can't climb stairs.\nThis Lady waitress has bad customer attitude, unfriendly and no patience in recommending the menu.\n\nThis place serves Chinese food that were as authentic as you were having a meal in China. Extensive food menu for you to choose from. Food was very tasty and served quickly. Their \u8fa3\u5b50\u9e21 (Chongqing Fried Chicken) is a must-try. Right balance of spicyness and flavour, not too oily and sufficiently crispy. If you like clams, then this is a dish you shouldn't miss, \u9999\u7092\u82b1\u5566 (Stir Fried Clams). Their clams were clean and fresh, no sand, very flavorful. They also served (\u70e7\u70e4) BBQ skewers here too.

The soya bean is original, you can taste the bean. There are no sugar added so you may adjust the rate accordingly\n\nThe drop in standard of yong he food is terrible! Not only is expensive, a small packet of soya bean drink cost $2. The \u70e7\u997c used to be crispy and fluffy, I bought 2 I can\u2019t even bite and cut using my home scissors! One look you can tell the \u70e7\u997c is made and stored for long time before it is sold. I am so disappointed with the standard, not sure if it will survive!\n\nWent to try their \u8c46\u6d46 soya bean drink and \u6cb9\u6761 fried fritter and also ordered a \u841d\u535c\u4e1d\u86cb\u997c carrot cake which is their probably signature dishes.  The fried fritter dipped into soya drink was pretty nice and not overly oily but the carrot cake (which reminded me of fried UFO) was a tad too oily for us. What was interesting was that they have a layer of egg omelette on top of fried skin and the whole setup is like that of a huge \u714e\u997c aka UFO.\nDin try the savoury soya beans which comes with vinegar. The ambience is old school and prices are reasonable though if you are looking at a cool place to have soya milk then it is a no no. Parking is limited and we were fortunate to get a slot along the many side lanes! Still I do think it is worth a visit for nostalgia and Taiwanese food if you have some craving! Geylang many fantastic food places and is a foodie paradise. If you can look beyond the heat and also limited parking it is a piece of Singapore that is not so frequently seen!!\n\nStandard dropped big time. Used to be a favourite supper place for many, but now...\n\nThe only consolation is the much smaller you tiao is not as oily as other stalls\n",

                  "reviews": "\n\nA meal starts with a soft warm bread with butter. Lamb shashlik and cherry jubilee are still good as ever!\nUnfortunately not so much on the borscht soup. Although tasting good as before, the Borscht soup was lacking in ingredients, very little cabbage and 1 piece of beef inside. Not worth the price.\n\nFood was excellent! Loved the onion soup, borscht soup. The steak on iron pan was really delicious and super well seasoned! Didn\u2019t expect it to taste that good. The tomato fish was sadly a miss for me! But the Irish coffee was delicious!!! Even my partner who is a super non-alcoholic person loved it and love the cream the whole presentation. What a gem of a place! Lovely!\n\nthe interior really brings you to a whole new place after walking up escalators of a seemingly abandoned and pretty run down building.\nwe had borshch soup which was really hearty and good we both loved it - must try when you\u2019re here! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\nthe upside down crab was also really good (tip: add salted butter onto the toast before adding the crab meat on top - the slight saltiness does a huge difference). We loved it though should have finished it while hot/warm because once cold, got a bit too jelat.\nI had the fish en papillotte which was not bad (not much special) and the fish was SUPER SOFT but probably better for sharing; got a little boring after a while. He had oxtail stew which had a little too much fats, it got too jelat after a while too so better for sharing too.\nWe ended off with the waitress recommended cherry jubilee but we both found it very underwhelming so we had say no harm passing!\nOverall a nice dining experience as the staff were really nice and attentive \u263a\ufe0f\n\nSet above Far East Shopping Centre on the 6th floor, Shashlik Restaurant is one of those establishments that blends fond memories with consistently pleasing meals. The journey through the aisle of shops from way back yonder, with its varied mix of some newer ones, together with that single-file escalator, makes a sweet start to a culinary venture that feels like a warm embrace of the past.\n\nThe ambience while plain is rather pleasant, with wooden furnishing making a calm statement where food takes the lead. The wait staff were a mix of the young and elderly, who infused our experience with a lovely blend of professionalism and genuine warmth. Adding to that, their friendly banter invites diners into a space that feels both upscale and homely.\n\nThe Borshch soup, a creamy treat made even better with sour cream is always a personal favourite. The Tenderloin Shashlik while looking rather plain on a sizzling plate, gave bursts of exceptional flavours, complemented with a simple side salad. My companion opted for the Impossible Meat Balls with Pesto Pappardelle Pasta, while the other ordered the Chicken Thigh Shashlik. The obligatory order of fries was, as always, a welcome addition. The rice ball was not what we expected with its crispy texture, but pleasant nonetheless.\n\nThe pricing is slightly above average, but it does find some justification in the consistent quality of food and service.\n\nShashlik Restaurant positions itself with its intriguing blend of Russian and Hainanese cuisine, stemming from an even more interesting history. The cuisine, varied yet harmoniously blended, is not merely a meal but an essential culinary adventure, offering a unique and memorable palette of flavours.\n\nOver the decades, Shashlik Restaurant is a testament of time-tested culinary delight. It stands as a resounding recommendation for those seeking a culinary journey that offers both unique flavours and a dash of nostalgia.\n\nAlways satisfied at the restaurant.\n\nLocation,  it's not really within the Orchard belt so it's great not to be in the traffic! There's an open air car park nearby.  Taxi drop off is next to the building.\n\nFood is really yummy and of good quality.  The bun served is super good! Hot,  soft and tasty!\n\nAmbience is good.  Keep a very cosy,  yet comfortable and exclusive feel.\n\nVery welcoming staff.  All are friendly,  approachable and polite,  and with a good sense of humour.  And they all prepare you for your photography or video time knowing one would like to do some picture or video taking.\n\nPrice wise,  generally it's good reasonable for the venue,  Ambience,  quality and service.\n\nEnjoy the time there for celebrations!\n",

More details below:\n\nFood:\n- Assorted dumplings are worth the try! Had lots of fun with the flavours and having them with the salsa and the sour cream\n- Cocktails came with fried dumplings, I loved how they were salted, super great bar snack.\n- Enjoyed the unique cold summer soup too!\n- Some of the mains were a tad salty (chicken patty and mash) but really homey and warming and all came with veggies\n- All food arrived in order so we had a cohesive meal\n\nService:\n- The staff came to give recommendations and talked to us about the dumplings, very attentive.\n\nAtmosphere:\n- Quiet, peaceful, a great place to go for a date!\n- Decor also very interesting and rustic\n\nwe made a reservation and were promptly served upon arrival.\n\nfood took a bit of time to arrive, noting they were all served hot and fresh.\n\nfood was nice and interesting, dumplings is their hit menu item here. I find the skin a bit thicker than the Asian dumplings, nevertheless they are flavourful. They have a variety of flavours for their dumplings.\n\ngood service and easy to order system.\n\nI always wondered what Eastern European cuisine will taste like and I finally had the chance.\nDefinitely come try the dumplings as the flavors are so comforting and homely. It's made with a slightly thicker skin and has a nice texture and bite.\n\nService was great as staff introduced the menu personally and poured the Kvass for us. Me and my partner was pleased with the experience!\nI will come back for another Kvass!\n\nFirst time trying Russian food, I must say that the food, particularly the dumplings are very delicious, they are very filling. This is one of the foods I highly recommend, the service are excellent too, the staff would give recommendations and explain the food when it\u2019s being served, thirdly, the restaurant is decorated with many Soviet era items such as Soviet newspapers, posters with Cyrillic text and even a Soviet Army ceremonial trumpet. Overall, good experience, food and service. 10/10.\n\nI actually visited here a few years ago to try their \u2018angmoh\u2019 dumplings before they rebranded and found them rather interesting as compared to the usual Chinese dumplings. Glad that I\u2019m able to try more dishes this round\n\nWhat we had\n\ud83e\udd5f Angmoh Dumplings Combo, $17.90\n8 flavours in total. Salmon, minty ram, black bull, wild hog, golden hen, siberian (beef & pork), paneer and potato. The dumpling skin is thicker than the Chinese style. Fillings-wise, I enjoyed the potato and chicken\n\n\ud83c\udf44 Cheburek, $22.90\nFried pastry with a choice of fillings. We picked cheese & white mushrooms. The pastry is crispy and filled with cheesy and juicy shroomy goodness\n\n\ud83d\udc1f Draniki (Rosti), $24.90\nFried rosti served with smoked salmon. The rosti here is more similar to hashbrowns in terms of texture and not the usual crispy grated potatoes texture that I\u2019m used to but it\u2019s definitely more flavourful and well seasoned imo\n\n\ud83c\udf70 Medovik, $12.90\nMulti layered Slavic honey cake that is great for those with sweet tooth \ud83d\ude1c\n\n\ud83e\udd43 Shots, $10/shot (inhouse infused vodka)\n\ud83c\udf36\ufe0f Ukrainian Red Chilli Pepper\nSounds scary but it\u2019s actually not that bad.. I think? It does have that spicy and peppery kick tho, give it a try if you dare \ud83e\udd2a\n\ud83c\udf4a Mandarin - slightly fruity\n\ud83c\udf47 White Grape - for those who like it sweet\n\nFor more food reviews, follow me on\nIG: @dtfoodaffair :)\n",

Stay nearby but have never been to this gem. Will definitely come back again.\n\nTrue-blue authentic old-fashioned Peranakan home cooking at old-fashioned prices. Try everything, the flavours and portions will be more than satisfying. The owner serves you rice from a traditional bakul. Decor is outdated, but that's part of the charm. Sadly, it is hidden behind extensive construction at Novena and custom is definitely affected.\n\nOn 28.8.22 ,7.30pm, we reserved a table of 10 for my eldest son birthday.This is the first time we went to this cuisine to eat.All the dishes we ordered are very delicious to eat .The lemon tea & chendol are very nice. The boss jeffery is a very humble man which my father praise him for his work talent & the way he served customers warmly. Thank you jeffery & your workmate for your excellent service & we will recommend friends to eat at your cuisine.\n",

The menu is small with a variety of options. The food was very good but certain dishes can be pricey. I will potentially come back and try something else.\n\nThe food is very good! I would consider it home style. I had the braised lamb and the pan fried potato pie. Both very flavorful and authentic. Good service, good atmosphere. I would recommend it.\n\nGreat food, good atmosphere, good service, good beer and wine selection.\n\nI started with the chicken and mushroom crepe appetizer, which was delicious. Then I got Tyask grape beer, which was unique. I tried the cabbage salad with sausages. Both were great, but the sausages were amazing. I also got the stuffed grape leaves, which I loved. I can\u2019t wait to come back and try more!\n\nWe went for dinner with live music.\n\nThe food is just delicious. I don\u2019t normally eat lamb, but they recommended it, so we ordered it.\n\nOrder the polenta.\n\nThe service needs improvement. It took 30 min to get our food. The waitress never came back to ask \u201cdo you like the food?\u201d, \u201ccan I get you another glass of wine?\u201d, \u201ccan I get you more water?\u201d. We could have ordered more wine, so that was a missed opportunity for the restaurant.\n\nIf you can scan and pay, why wouldn\u2019t you let me place my order using Toast? It would have been much faster.\n\nGo for the food, but be patient because the service is not the best.\n\nThw food here was ABSOLUTLEY AMAZING. The sour cherry desert was delicious, the Chicken and Mushroom crepe was so good, the chicken and mushrooms was minced together. The potatoe dumplings were very good and the Braised Beef was MOUTH WATERING.. the chef had to have cooked the braised beef for hours to make it that tender, the red wine sauce and seasoning on this meal is unexplainable good. This is a must try place.\n",

Excellent beer selection with good variety.\n\nWent tonight for the first time and although I saw multiple staff (including someone behind the bar) they all refused to look over at the hostess area for a good 5 minutes then we finally got seat on the patio. While seated, we waited a while, finally a server came out but didn\u2019t even acknowledge our table (they passed our table to go to another table) and went to another table. Came back our way with still no acknowledgment and went back inside. Waited a few more minutes and asked another customer if we needed to go inside to order and they said normally servers do come out but they have been really slow at that moment.

We ordered a borscht which comes with a pirozhok, which is like a savory puff pastry with meat inside (although they have a vegetable option as well). Both were really well flavored and the pastry was very crispy and fluffy, a rare find in the pastry world. We also ordered the smoked salmon blinis, which were very good. Blinis are not your typical crepes, they are slightly heavier and chewier, which is very satisfying with the sour cream and salmon. It\u2019s always a pleasant experience to go to a restaurant that isn\u2019t run of the mill, but has good food.\n\nA Delightful Journey Back in Time\n\nRating: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\n\nReview:\n\nI recently had the pleasure of visiting this hidden gem tucked away in the heart of the city, and I must say, it was an experience that left me utterly captivated. From the moment I stepped through the doors, I was transported to a bygone era, a time of elegance, sophistication, and culinary delights. Allow me to share my delightful journey at this charming establishment.\n\nThe first thing that caught my attention was the enchanting kitchen atmosphere. It exuded a nostalgic aura, taking me back to the days of grand dining halls and lavish banquets. The attention to detail was impeccable, with vintage decor, elegant chandeliers casting a soft glow, and beautifully set tables that evoked a sense of timeless elegance. The lady owner's touch was evident in every corner, creating a warm and inviting ambiance that was both cozy and refined.\n\nThe menu, oh, the menu! It was a culinary masterpiece, offering a selection of Russian fare that was truly a feast for the senses. Each dish was meticulously crafted, showcasing the rich flavors and traditional techniques of Russian cuisine. From the hearty borscht and tender beef stroganoff to the delicate pelmeni and indulgent caviar, every bite was a revelation. The infusion of vodka with various flavors added a unique twist to the dining experience, providing a perfect complement to the sumptuous dishes.\n\nTo further elevate the atmosphere, a talented pianist graced the establishment with their melodic tunes. The classical music filled the air, intertwining with the clinking of glasses and the laughter of delighted patrons, creating an atmosphere of enchantment and refinement. It was a true symphony of culinary delights and soul-stirring melodies.\n\nBut what truly sets this establishment apart is the personal touch of the lady owner. Her passion for hospitality and her commitment to creating an unforgettable experience for her guests shone through in every aspect of the evening. She effortlessly made everyone feel like a welcomed guest in her own home, ensuring that every need was met with grace and warmth.\n\nIn conclusion, my visit to this establishment was nothing short of magical. The kitchen atmosphere, with its nostalgic charm and elegant setting, took me on a journey back in time. The Russian fare, infused vodkas, and live piano music added layers of delight to an already exceptional experience. To the lady owner, I extend my heartfelt gratitude for creating such a haven of beauty, taste, and hospitality.\n\nIf you're seeking a dining experience that transports you to a world of elegance and grace, I wholeheartedly recommend paying a visit to this extraordinary establishment. Prepare to be enchanted, indulge in exquisite cuisine, and let the melodies of the pianist sweep you away. You won't be disappointed.\n\nOnce again, my sincere thanks to the lady owner for curating such a memorable and beautiful experience.\n\nVisited: July 2023\n\nAuthentic Eastern European cuisines served in a rustic vibe.\n\nMy friend and I came here a while ago to try authentic Russian fares. As expected, we were the only English-speaking group at the restaurant, but our server was very welcoming and accommodating. It seemed like there were several groups coming in to celebrate special occasions, and we were fortunate to enjoy live piano throughout the evening.\n\nWe shared a couple of apps and a soup, and I had the sturgeon tzar with Russian kasha for the entr\u00e9e. Served with a side of sour cream, both the blintze and the pirozhok were good, but the latter pulled ahead as a winner. Wrapped in a crispy baked pastry, the meat pirozhok was very flavorful, and I especially liked pairing it with the traditional beet-based soup - borscht. Sturgeon was also a nice surprise, and I liked that its texture was a bit similar to that of cod.\n\nOverall, our experience at Cafe St.Petersburg was definitely far from typical dining experience in Boston. Nevertheless, we really liked the feeling of being transported to a local restaurant in a small Eastern European country, and I would highly recommend giving them a try.\n\nVery yummy soups they have , pretty nice and polite waitress , adequate prices . Soups were around 8-10$ . They serve it with bread . Thank you for your warm welcome!\n\nif you want home cooked food. on a friendly environment.. with great prices.. this is the place for russian. Georgian. Ukrainian foods.. it is a large place to have parties.. staff is great.. not a fancy place but that is why you go.. prices are very reasonable.. food is fresh.. it is like grandma is cooking for you..  come home and enjoy here.. they open they are open.. if not they are not.. but if they are there they will cook for you. be nice and they are the best\n",

I love German food and there aren\u2019t a lot of German restaurants around. I\u2019ve been there before, but this was a wonderful visit. We started with the pretzel, big soft and covered with course salt. It comes with a very nice horseradish mustard, spicy but not overwhelming. For an up charge you can also get beer cheese, but I greatly prefer the mustard.\n\nThey were celebrating Oktoberfest, but I\u2019m not much of a beer drinker, so I started with a cocktail. They have a variation on a Negroni called Czech Yourself, made with Czech fernet, gin, and Campari. Although I\u2019m mostly Irish-German, I do have some Czech ancestry and as you well know I\u2019m a gin guy, so I had to try it. Very nice, I actually preferred it it to the traditional Negroni. After that I had a couple glasses of Austrian Gr\u00fcner Veltliner. I\u2019m not Austrian.\n\nFor dinner we split the Sp\u00e4tzle and the Schnitzel. The sp\u00e4tzle is larger than I\u2019m used to but nicely browned and served with spinach and onions. You can add a sausage to it if you like. We added a bratwurst. This dish is delicious but huge. I took some home, and it heats up nicely in a frying pan the next day.The schnitzel was also excellent. It is topped with a mushroom cream sauce and served with warm, bacony potato salad. I would get both of these dishes again with no hesitation. I\u2019d even get the sp\u00e4tzle to go because it reheats so well.\n\nFor dessert, we had the Apflestrudel, apples and golden raisins stuffed into a pastry and topped with buttermilk whipped cream. With it, I had a shot of J\u00e4egermeister, which I didn\u2019t shoot, I sipped.\n\nThe staff was dressed in traditional German attire and the small space was decorated for Oktoberfest. There aren\u2019t many seats and it\u2019s crowded, but definitely charming. The service was very friendly and the atmosphere was casual.  It was a relaxing feast. Union Square is about the worst place to park, but once you find a spot everything is great! I\u2019m excited to go back to try the sauerbraten and of course more of their haus sausages.\n\nAlways a blast during Oktoberfest! Don't forget it's there the rest of the year. Perfect to stop by and satiate your want for a soft pretzel.\n\nVery classy and authentic German gastropub in Summerville. Plenty of parking spaces, friendly and warm ambience! Food was amazing and priced reasonably!\n\nFun German pub with welcoming vibe. The burgers and wurst got high marks from our crew. The wait staff was flexible and fun.\n\nDon\u2019t skip the pretzel! Food is awesomely German (duh!) and so is the beer. Be brave and get the Liter.\n",

They did a great job of making full use of the outdoor space, so that should definitely be your first option if the weather is good. The restaurant should check that all the table umbrellas are fastened - ours was missing the tightening knob and it almost hit us when a big gust of wind blew. I love how they have a truly unique brew shop right next to the dining area.\nThe staff was very accommodating and as sweet as can be.\nThe food was very good. Salads were fresh, the pretzels were soft and warm, and the deviled eggs were top notch. The chicken curry chicken salad was a massive bowl of just chicken, and it was definitely tasty, but all the chicken we had was a little rubbery.\nThis is truly a unique spot and is a great place to chill, grab a bite and drink a few brews.\n\nThere is something nice and family about this place. My 7 and 10 year old grandkids love it, hot dogs and root beer, interesting German type food for grown ups and great big beer selection. It's in a basement, lots of benches and picnic tables. We keep going back.\n\nIt\u2019s always great to come here, drink great beers - both local and international, enjoy tasty food, and enjoy the company of others - everyone is just so thoughtful here, from the staff to other guests.\n100% a worthwhile stop if you\u2019re looking for a tasty brew (three different ounce serving options), food, and/or a family-friendly spot.\n\nGreat beer selection, nice outdoor tables (with view of parking lot...), decent German food. A good option in Belmont Centre [sic].\nSchnitzel was decent. Knockwurst and sweet mustard were good. Warm potato salad was a bit too vinegary for my taste, and didn't have enough bacon grease (but others will like that!).\nFriendly and efficient service.\n\nStopped by for dinner when visiting family in town, we must've stayed 3 hours and ordered the whole damn menu... Outstanding & unique dishes, everything was tasty. Plenty of perfect pairings with beer & sausages.\n\nStaff was knowledgeable and very helpful. Can't recommend this place enough. We'll definitely be back the next time we're in town!\n\nLoved the contactless menu & ordering as well. Such an efficient system that I wish more places used.\n",

Service was great and I was so excited about the food until I actually tried my dish. I ordered the seared tenderloin with butter poached lobster. It was the most flavorless steak and lobster I've ever had. Literally, every other steakhouse I've tried was better than this, and this is the 4th stop. The only downside to my birthday was the steak. The fries and dessert were good but for it being a fine dining steakhouse... highly disappointed.\n\nWe recently dined at The Capital Grille to mark a birthday, and our experience was truly wonderful. The waiter was friendly and knowledgeable. The food was superb, although the drinks could have been a bit improved. Nevertheless, we all had an immensely enjoyable time. The ambiance contributed to a fantastic birthday celebration, and the special birthday plate they presented added to the overall experience.\n\nWe celebrated my birthday last night in Chedtut Hill, MA and it was outstanding. My dirty martini was just right! The tuna tartare was delicious! And my filet mignon was perfect. Miranda took great care of us and made sure it was a special night. Can\u2019t wait to go back soon!\n\nChestnut Hill location. Fabulous restaurant for a special event. Just celebrated a birthday there. The cocktails are great. Try the Double Oaked and Rye Manhattan. One of the best Manhattans I have ever had. The tuna tartare appetizer was great. Beautiful presentation and great flavor. The bone in rib-eye was delicious. And the service is superb. Ask for Miranda-she is terrific!\n\nFirst time visiting TCG and I must admit, it was FABULOUS. First, the manager Jeff runs a smooth ship.  His staff are just an amazing group of people.  Feel free to ask for him, he is the real deal.  Had a minor hiccup and Jeff made it right without us even saying a single word. That\u2026is truly superior customer service at its best.\n\nMy waiter Patrick and his co-worker Jose were simply nothing short of remarkable.  I mean, you want a great dining experience, ask for one of these guys, I mean\u2026they WOWED me.  The food was absolutely amazing and the passion fruit mojito was excellent.  The bone-in ribeye\u2026..just O.M.G! The place felt like you were in a law firm.  They do offer valet parking at the front door and the bathrooms were very nice and clean.  Plenty of parking and dress appropriately. Don\u2019t wear t-shirts and your grandfather\u2019s overalls, dress nice, it\u2019s a nice and classy place that your significant other will truly enjoy.\n\nSo, amazing dining experience and would I return? That would be an emphatic HECK YEAH I WOULD.\n",

The pita on the side is always freshly made and delicious. The Greek lemon chicken soup and homemade gazpacho are also favorites.\n\nA deli with huge salads and sandwiches. They did not have table service, but lots of booths and tables were available. Most of the items on the menu are big enough to serve for two. I took home half of my Cobb salad. Wife took home half of her corned beef sandwich. Onion rings were enough for two, and were very good. We did not try any of the dinner items on the menu.\n\nOrdered a \u201clamb\u201d gyro and I\u2019m almost positive it was actually just beef chunk\u2026.

He gave me great suggestions for the menu and the amount. Everything was ready for pick up  at the time we agreed with clear instructions for reheating. The food was delicious, and we all enjoyed without stress. We especially loved the hummus, pita, tzatziki, the pie, kebab and the beet salad. Thank you Sean and Putterham Grille!\n\nA nice selection of sandwiches, salads and deserts. I went there for Lunch and it wasn't crowded, there quite a few tables were taken. We had the Mezza platter which was enough for several people to share. The decor is pleasant so are the wait staff. The food was very good, and the portions are ample. Prices are reasonable.

The Club stands majestic amongst a small quite town of residents.  Inside was just as jaw dropping.  Beautiful woodwork and so spacious with a large bar, dining area, stage for what appears to be live entertainment, massive pull-down screen for sports games and several pool tables.  Stopped in for a few drinks only so unsure of any food items besides the standard chip-bag stand.  Visitors and staff were all so friendly.

With so few neighborhood bars in the area, I'm so glad that I not only found one, but a great one. It looks like there is. Trivia night on Tues which I will def check out!\nThe atmosphere is bright and cheery despite a little sticky menu grime. While you wait they give you the most buttery salty movie theater popcorn to munch on. The food was very good. I recommend the surprisingly good clam strip roll and the burgers are juicy and delish. Gluten free rolls are available too.\nThe service here is stand out. The wait staff is genuinely friendly and they truly offer great service.\nI wouldn't come here to impress visiting in town family, but for those more frequent times where you want a comfortable friendly neighborhood spot where you can watch the game, enjoy a cold beer, and eat some comfort food, this is your place.\n\nEverything is great at this place food is amazing can't go wrong with anything here to eat. But a must try is the wings they are so big and juicy. I couldn't pick a sauce or flavor so I got plain bone-in and got sauces on the side. It is a home feeling kinda place not so updated but worth eating here. Don't miss out on a wonderful experience people. I been there two times already bringing more people each time I go.\n\nInteresting rustic pub feel.  The wait staff was on target. The menu consists of sandwiches, apps and a couple of entrees. The food was pretty good.  Basic food with reasonable costs.\n\ni have to say that this place has the best onion rings! i have had many dishes here but almost always get onion rings. this visit i got the smoke house burger and my partner had the ultimate chicken sandwich which i have had before. everything had a great flavor and was cooked to order. the staff was attentive and very polite. will definitely be going back.\n\nWe go there all the time! Love this place! Great food, great atmosphere. Great bartenders and servers. NEVER a problem. Unfortunately..  last 2 visits we got chicken wings which are usually perfect. Got Teriyaki a  thin sauce so we could see the freezer burn on our wings. It was disgusting. At home if you grab something out of the freezer and see freezer burn you throw it out as to not serve it to your family and friends. Disappointed in the cooks, as how would the owners know? They rely on there cooks to serve to their Guests quality food.  Cooks if you won\u2019t eat it throw it away! Owners talk to the kitchen! Are  you aware of it what\u2019s going on? We will NOT stop going just letting you know.\n",

It was so good! The biscuit was soft and flaky, the eggs were freshly cooked up and the sausage and cheese were perfect. I also ordered a cold brew which was really tasty. Not bitter at all and perfectly done. I wish I could have stayed because the atmosphere was super cozy. I will be back!\n\nThe tacos are delicious-light but filling and very tasty.\nThe blueberry scones are just wonderful.\nCan't wait to try some other of their breakfasts and lunches!\n\nBettina\u2019s is the hidden gem of Newton. I\u2019ve been coming back frequently to try new items on the menu and have not once been disappointed. My \u201cusual\u201d has become the delicious brioche egg sandwich along with a cold brew. Absolutely worth stopping in!\n\nBest breakfast and lunch around. Nice hand-made breakfast sandwiches. Their muffins tend to still be warm when they first open.\n\nBettina's Bakery is great. Their Honduran Baleadas are delicous.  i recommend add avacado.  They can even make it gluten free.  Everything is freshly made, but still very quick and friendly service.  Interesting Coffee ans Tea choices.  You can go for breakfast, lunch, or to just bring baked goods home for the family.\n",

Only downer... pay with plastic and 5% is added to the bill.\n\nIt'd be respectful if this were told to a patron before bill presentation.\n\nNot my most favorite meal. Also a bit confused by what they were offering since the meal I got, mushroom ravioli, was $10 on the specials pricing and I was charged $27. I didn\u2019t say anything because I didn\u2019t wanna be rude, plus the place was really cute and I really liked the environment I was in. Still, confusion on all, I don\u2019t think it was my style of food. It is mainly German food, still a great experience.\n\nVery nice to find you guys.

However, I am disappointed by the food.\n\nAlthough I really appreciate the big servings, this is not gen z vibe or flavor that we love. Starting off, there was NO salt in all of the food we got. Unseasoned, and really just tasted the flavor of the ingredients. The plate looks not aesthetically pleasing. Food stacked on top of each other and no special color or plating. I think the chefs know how to cook food cuz it looks nice to the eye, but they just forgot to add salt or any herbs or seasoning \ud83e\uddc2!!!!\n\nOverall, the deli captured the essence of tradition, flavor, and community, making it a must-visit for anyone looking to savory cuisine. I left with a happy heart and a full belly, already counting down the days until I can return for another memorable meal.\n\nThe knish's simplicity is its charm, yet it manages to pack a punch of flavor that always leaves me wanting more.\n\nBe prepared to be overwhelmed with the flavor from their sandwiches, complemented with a new dill pickle. The deli mustard is explosive with flavor.\nMake room for some matzo ball soup and bagel chips with your meal, it's good for you.\n\nWe were in Boston for our anniversary and heard we should try Zaftigs. We rode the green line and hiked over. What a wonderful experience. The food was terrific. Service extremely good. Atmosphere perfect. Highly recommend the visit.\n\nI had the challah French toast, it was great!  The fruit plate is big, could easily be split by two or three people. Syrup was really\nGood too.\n\nWe went here for lunch and it was absolutely delicious! I would highly recommend the Reuben, the Monte Cristo, the Pastrami and Swiss, and the French Fries. There was about a ten minute wait when we went on a Saturday morning, but they kept tables moving through quickly. Once we were seated, the service was prompt and friendly.\n",

The chicken fingers where frozen which is always sad and I definitely had regrets when I saw the Mac and cheese and burgers come out. We got two entr\u00e9es a side order of onion rings and appetizer and it came out to about 60 bucks. There was this strange surge of excitement in the air and it\u2019s hard to explain but it seemed like everyone was just really happy from the service people to other guests. 100%will go back.\n\nGreat experience \u2026 I live in the neighborhood \u2026 will definitely be back. Good food and good vibes. My wife loved the fish tacos and the drinks were good. Wish they had a few more local draft beer options but still a great little spot with good service/atmosphere.\n\nAfter reading about the post-pandemic debt problems, my husband and I decided to support the restaurant last night. Went in for a quick dinner and did not disappoint. Mindy at the bar was kind and efficient. Recommended great cocktails. Had delicious fish tacos and fish and chips with wonderful service. Vibe was friendly and relaxed.  Definitely a neighborhood place that needs to stay around. I\n\nI was a first time customer at Ritcey tonight, and I\u2019ll definitely recommend it as a spot to check out! The atmosphere is so friendly and welcoming: we were immediately greeted by two different employees and offered a choice as to where we would like to sit.\n\nMy husband and I ordered a burger and the fish tacos, respectively, and my pro-tip is to absolutely order the onion rings. Those were devoured instantly! My one tip on the fish tacos would be to add more seasoning to the fry batter for more depth of flavor. Otherwise, the portions were generous and we can\u2019t wait to try other items on the menu.\n\nP.S. We were thrilled to see that this restaurant is a queer friendly space. Just another reason to love and support this local gem!\n\nA favorite local spot! We love the burgers and fish tacos, and I usually enjoy a fun specialty cocktail. The staff are super friendly too!\n",

We are from Cambridge and our first visit to Needham. We ordered 4 dishes. Among them, the beef kofte was especially delicious. Normally I don't like meat, but it was well cooked. The salads and hummus were fresh and the food was cooked quickly. But the stuffed grapeleaves are cold to eat so we asked them to warm up. The staff was willing to do that. They are very kind. Thanks to this restaurant, I have a good impression of Needham. Oh! I also had coconut and pistachio baklava for dessert, but I forgot to take a picture. It was so good I ordered more and brought it home.\n\nIn the western suburbs, this is the best gyro/kebab restaurant I have been to. Solid value.  Fresh pita. Very fresh lettuce/tomato. Gyro meat is juicy and flavorful, as is the chicken Kebob.   Food is served hot and is prepared quickly.  The place is clean.

I ordered the NYS Strip with frites and did enjoy it but nothing extrodinary, I give 4/5\u2b50\ufe0f. My friend got the summer salad with chicken and thought it was just okay-there definitely could have been more chicken or could have came mixed in a bowl. The service was very quick with our server Brian and he made sure we had everything we needed!\n\nEven it was a little bit crowded I found a very kind service. The food was delicious, I got a hamburger with very well made fries. Highly recommend the place for taking a beer a having a good time with friends.\n\nI'll start off with the good; service and atmosphere was fantastic!\n\nThe bad.... Food was not worth the prices. A hamburger was $18 then in you wanted cheese it was $2, want sauce $2, maybe bacon $3. All in you're at $25 for a burger that looks like a bubba burger....\n\nGo here for the beer or the mac and cheese (just don't look at the up charges). If you want another food go to bartaco.\n\nGood place to hang out.  Good variety of beer, especially if you like German or Belgian beers.  Their lobster nachos are amazing!\n\nWell crafted cocktails and more! Food, cooked to order, is fresh and tasty with great portions. Servers were extremely attentive to what we may have needed and went above and beyond with making our dinner feel special. Highly recommend to anyone looking for a new place to try out!!!\n",

Then he realized and walked around to fill ppl\u2019s drinks. He didn\u2019t ask what spice level we wanted either. I am not coming back.\n\nThe absolute best Tom Yum soup. Order the one with noodles and you will not be disappointed. Every time there are 5 enormous shrimp that take 2-3 bites to finish one and these bad boys are the reason this is the best soup in the neighborhood. Huge portion and the broth is to die for. I salivate just writing about it. If you order it to go it\u2019s even better. All the ingredients are so fresh and packed separate so you can add more or less to taste. Last week I had it three days in a row and I never eat anything three times in a row without getting bored. The prices are very reasonable and other dishes are just as good.\n\nI have been coming here for 2 years now on a consistent basis. Today, I was made to feel extremely uncomfortable by the male server who serves during the day. It started with once I sat down which was 11:30 when they opened. I mentioned it was a bit hot and asked if their air was working (simple question) non-accusatory, the waiter then alludes to the fact that I walked right in once they opened and maybe the restaurant would\u2019ve been colder had I not come in when they opened. After letting him know multiple times I was fine with where I sat, he moved my menu anyways to an area I did not want to be in. The water cup I was given was broken and making pools of water on my table- he did not change it although noticing I was wiping water the table the entire time. Last but not least\u2014 after paying my bill in exact change he has the nerve to ask me where the tip is. After seeing my face absolutely mortified by that question, he tried to joke around and say \u201cwasn\u2019t the food made with love?\u201d My food wasn\u2019t packed up, and I was nowhere near ready to leave. Usually I leave the cash tip on the table as I head out. I responded by letting him know I wasn\u2019t leaving yet and I had planned on putting it on the table. I felt so uncomfortable by this exchange I wanted to let him know for future reference. After coming up to the counter and giving him his tip in hand, I told him he really should not assume someone is not giving him a tip and him asking me that way made me uncomfortable. He says \u201cokay have a nice day goodbye\u201d over and over again and I repeated- no you made me very uncomfortable and an apology would\u2019ve been nice. He laughed at me as I walked out. This was somewhere I went once a week easily and I really enjoyed all the workers I\u2019ve had thus far but this experience really made me uncomfortable to ever come back. Please don\u2019t allow your servers to do this again, this ruined my dining experience\n\nFriendly staff and nice atmosphere! First time trying this place and we ordered pho. Was pleasantly surprised how big the bowls were. The noodles and broth were delicious!\n\nVery good eats at extremely fair prices. Their Vietnamese food is certainly the best of their offerings, but it's nicecthat they have some Thai and Japanese options as well. The service at this location is quite slow (but very friendly) so don't expect a quick meal.\n",

The wood oven half chicken was incredibly flavorful and just as impressive. The overall dining experience was fantastic, and I highly recommend trying Prairie Fire\n\nLoved their fire pizza. It has a nice ambience and the servers were great. I was immediately seated next to the kitchen door while all the window spaces where available. I thought at the beginning that maybe because our chosen table was for two but then several pairs were seated at these tables which made us question if we were placed there by pure bias. I think customers should be asked where they prefer sitting if the place has empty tables.\n\nMy coworkers and I had our office celebration here. We were the first group there. The employees were all extremely attentive and consistent throughout the entire time (we had to have been there for two hours +). Our waitress Carmella was so sweet and had great energy.\n\nMy team and I were all so hungry, we had ordered the rolls and 1 of each pizza.\n\nWow. Wow. Wow. My manager Steve had asked \u201cWhat\u2019s your guys favorite style of pizza\u201d. I had answered \u201cThis\u201d and a few others on my team did as well. Being so serious.\n\nEverything was genuinely incredible. So fresh, temperature was perfect. Drinks were also really really good. Everything came out so quick too.\n\nThe squash, margarita, classic cheese and pepperoni pizzas were my favorites. But the others were not far off.\n\nSeriously all so so good and the rolls omg. A perfect appetizer, with the perfect cool down garlic herb butter to accompany the roll. Loved it.\n\nThe perfect place to unwind with your family/ friends/ coworkers, while still feeling good about yourself (I ate like 10 pieces of pizza and could\u2019ve kept going lololol)\n\nRise Realty thanks everyone at Prairie Fire for their incredible service and incredible cuisine. As for myself, well you guys will definitely be seeing me more of me \ud83d\udd25\u2728\n\nOrdered the squid ink Campanelle. It was delicious. Sat at the bar. Friendly server. Friendly host. Nice ambiance. They have casual outside seating with picnic tables. Like a beer tent minus the tent. Need to be redecorated. Maybe nice for families w small kids?\nDef recommend this place\n\nGreat food, atmosphere and service\u2026the mushroom toast to start and lamb pasta were excellent\n",

As for the meat some parts were juicy but some were too dry and hard. The accompanying vege also seemed a bit sad..\n\nEaten here twice - once in the evening and this time during lunch. The grilled pork belly is very juicy and slightly crispy on the outside, and has that awesome bbq aroma. I would love to eat that chilli but I did not as I would definitely break out in sweat. It\u2019s so satisfying just eating the pork belly and rice.\n\nWe had a Lechon dish ( roasted pork with rice) quite nice, but another time we try the a potion without rice, it was too many fat inside. We always eat in the timbre near expo. I guess should tell the staff give us the less fat one \ud83d\ude01. Their sauce is yummy with the meat\n\nDisgusting attitude from the large Chinese woman serving. I have bought Filipino food from here several times yet have never encountered the type of attitude I just received from this so-called server. I approached the counter and in my friendliest voice I asked \"Hello, do you have lechon?\" The woman totally ignored me and refused to answer me even though I asked three times. Eventually she snapped and shouted \"Yeah, I know you want lechon.\" I asked her if they had it (they often sell out) and again she refused to answer me. I will not give my money to support someone with such a disgusting and hostile attitude so I spent my $40 at the Thai stall next door where I received friendly service. Will not go back to this stall while this disgusting woman who doesn't understand customer service works there.\n\nI believe that this is the Filipino version of roasted pork rice. The meat is tender and skin is crispy. Soup that came with it was a tad salty but it blended well with the set.\nThe restaurant is located in Timbre+, a cool looking conversion from the typical JTC factory canteen.\n",

This may be the first restaurant that my eldest specifically asked if I was going to provide feedback because he loved the service so much.  I have to concur, the staff at Gerry\u2019s certainly made us feel right at home.  The dishes however were average at best, reminiscent of what I\u2019ve had elsewhere, but definitely on the pricey side and seemingly confused as to what customer palates they are catering for.  The sisig and grilled squid are worth a try.  We\u2019ll be back given it\u2019s family friendly and a convenient option when we have a craving for Filipino food.\n\nNever had Filipino food before, and was pleasantly surprised by the fare at Gerry's Grill. The restaurant has a friendly family restaurant vibe, and the service is good.\n\nRecommended dishes include the mackerel with grilled pork, and the Halo Halo dessert.\n\nBe careful of over ordering as portions tend to be very generous as well. Will come back again.\n\nStandard dropped :( I last ate this in 2019 and it was so so good. But in my recent visit in Oct 2023, it didnt taste as good as before.\n\nPork sisig was a total let down. I remember this place has my fav sisig but this time, it just tasted off. Very charred and lacking in flavour.\n\nAdobo was okay but veryyy salty.\n\nLumpia used to be very good too. Now, just average.\n\nPerfect place to go to in Singapore if you want quality Filipino food to satisfy your cravings! Service is quite fast. Place is clean and cool. Staff are friendly. Food is delicious. Very much happy and will visit again \ud83d\ude0a\n\nTried this Filipino restaurant as a reco from a Filipino friend. Food was ok, a bit pricy and quality is mediocre. We tried a bunch of dishes because it was out first time. Each dish is about $17 (nice portions tho). The grilled and roasted pork were the best. The yellow noodle dish (can\u2019t remember the name) was really weird but strangely addictive. Everything is a bit oily so be prepared. The place is very quiet (we went for a late lunch) so no issues to get a table. Overall a so so experience\u2026it felt like being in the Philippines which was the objective.\n",

Flavour was more towards (shredded) Lechon than a sisig fusion, lacked basic sisig ingredients like onion, soy sauce and egg.\n\nOrdered Laing and Bopis too. While I couldn't complain on the flavours, they were ala carte portions and of course priced as one dish. I asked if there's a side dish option so I could order more, but was told they don't. In the end, me and my company had too much leftovers.\n\nThis is a crook place. Twice I ate there, they charged crazy prices. I thought I wanted to try filipino food but never at this place again. A small bowl of beef lungs, he charged $7.50 & it stank and tasted bad. the same for a bowl of vegetables takeaway..$7.50 too!!

The Lechon was perfect - moist interior and crispy exterior\n\nThe beef soup is very nice. Broth is very tasty and the meat so tender. $14 for 2 bowls of rice and soup with big chunks of meat.\n",

Head up to the 4th floor and they are located beside Wing Stop.\n\nThe concept of this restaurant is interesting as they are not halal and serves premium pork, chicken and beef, even Wagyu for a personalized BBQ. Restaurant occupancy is about 40 to 60 pax and dining is allowed for 60 minutes. A QR code will be provided by the staff when they show you to your seat which will be used to browse their menu and order food. Staff are friendly and trying their best to serve you as fast as they can.\n\nThe meat they serve is acceptable and with the price of their value meals, it's really value for money. I would recommend paying a little more for the extra portion. Each value meal comes with a small bowl of kimchi and a variety of sauces on your table. Beef lovers might just love it here as you can grill your meat to your liking. Chicken would not be as easy as they use the thigh meat and when sliced, there are many small pieces which could drop into the grill. I have the say the pork is great and with the option to add on pork jowl, you have to come try it for yourself.\n\nOverall a must try for Yakiniku lovers that aren't looking for a buffet setup but just for a quick BBQ fix at an affordable price. I have snapped their QR code for you to take a queue number while you're heading down as the queue is longer during peak hours thus won't need to waste too much time.\n\nFood is as usual nice. However I still feel they should extend the eating time to more than 50 min.\n\nMy daughter and I were on the way to JEM for Yakiniku-GO, when this place popped up searching through Google maps. Attracted by the Taiyaki Mochi, we decided to try. It\u2019s almost, but not as good - sauces, smaller heating bbq area, less spacious. The one plus is the Taiyaki Mochi - was a real treat, but possible to buy frozen options online to do at home. So bottom line, still prefer our original place for Yakiniku.\n\nOverall a pleasant dining experience! Second time visiting this outlet. Restaurant environment is clean and the design of the grill makes it non-smoky and greasy when grilling meat. Restaurant staff are friendly and helpful too, they were quick and sincere in rectifying the mistake when one of the staff sent me the wrong kind of meat. And I think the quality of the meat cuts is pretty good for the price point! Nice kimchi side dish too.\n\nAtmosphere wise, your standard noisy yakiniku place.\n\nService wise, not exactly how they claimed on restaurant deco that they deliver food on table in 5 minutes, but still within 10 minutes.\n\nFood wise, I find them rather affordable and tasty. Many options of different cuts, completed with sauces. Visited twice and will visit again.\n",

From the flavorful adobo to the soup. there's something for everyone. I'm sure you found plenty of delicious dishes to enjoy.\n\nI had an incredibly disappointing experience at this restaurant. Not only was the food served to me raw, but the owner's aggressive and confrontational attitude towards my complaint was truly unacceptable. As a customer, I expected to be treated with respect and professionalism. I strongly advise others to be cautious when considering dining here, as my encounter left me feeling both unsafe and unsatisfied\n\nGreat Comfort foods here!!!\nShout out to Mamita's Kitchen\n:) Mapa meat or veggie ulam, panalo\n\nHelped my Filipino colleagues to buy their lunch from here and they were nothing but utterly RUDE! requested for vinegar, patis with chili padi and they commented \"so many requests a!\" When I reach our ofc and open the orders, they ended up not giving the requested vinegar. The service was ridiculously BAD. I have helped my colleagues from other Filipino stores in Lucky Plaza many time and they were never like this.\n\nFor all places I've tried, their bulalo is the best in Singapore.\n\nThe other food I ordered (longganisa & bicol express) is the same or better than other places but not the best.\n",

Place is spacious and clean.\n\n\ud83d\ude87 Orchard\n\nVisited the restaurant on a Tuesday afternoon. It's a rustic Pinoy place serving the familiar Philippines fair. If you really like strong tasting food, then this is the place to visit. Bulalo soup is SGD20 per bowl, and it's large enough for 2 pax. They serve desserts herr as well if you are game for it.\n\nTosilog is actually a combination of the different components of the meal - Tocino (cured pork), Sinangang (garlic fried rice), and Itlog (egg). The cured pork was so thick and flavourful, almost like a version of charsiu with sweetness to it, but might be somewhat tough for some. The Sinangang was the star of the show though, so fragrant and aromatic and paired so well with the meat and egg. The soup was sour (in a good way) and helped to cut through the oiliness. Overall, enjoyed this Tosilog Set ($7.50).\n\nHad the Maja Blanca ($2.30 per pc) too. Also called Coconut Pudding, this is made from coconut milk, cornstarch, and sugar. Corn kernels are also added to give added sweetness and crunch. Thick and creamy, this was similar to the Nyonya kueh of my childhood. The toasted coconut flakes at the side also paired so well with the pudding. Delicious!\n\nFilipino caifan with a large variety of dishes to choose from. Saw many filipinos choosing the fried bangus fish and took it. Was disappointed as it was cold and tasted like mackerel with a slight sour taste not worth the price of 9.50. The kare kare fared better. It was thick and rich in peanut flavour and came with soft stewed vegetables and chunky pork belly\n\nFeels very homely! I love coming to this place once in a while to try out the different dishes. Yesterday I had some sisig and other side dishes, it was delicious!\n",

Enter from the right through a small corridor to reach the restaurant. Self service so you order can get you food order disc and sit and wait.\nItems like pan de sal, kutschinta and flan are showcased at front with wafts of freshly baked bread enticing you to buy buy buy.\nIn the restaurant a simple menu awaits but a very tempting one as the grilled chicken and pork belly were excellent.\nThe presentation was simple with just one bowl of rice. You would need to order vegetables separately if you wanted a balanced meal.\n\nThis is just a regular butter cheese bread which is selling in a Philippines Bakery & Restaurant in Lucky Plaza, Singapore. Though it\u2019s fluffy and buttery, no other things stands out for these. Probably can give other items a try next time.\n\nOverpriced And Disappointing.  This restaurant serves classic Filipino dishes and priced a bit higher than other Filipino restaurants in Lucky Plaza so I thought its going to have at least good quality.  Boy was I wrong.. I ordered pork kare kare and its tasteless and is not as creamy as its suppose to be.  The meat is also very bland.  The bagoong saved the whole dish.  Order also took a bit longer than usual and its not crowded at all.  The dining area is poorly lit and looks like an abandoned warehouse.  Service also not great.  Never coming back.\n\nOrdered lechon kawali because it was recommended by my my friends. It was ok, but i think lechon in the food court b1 would probably be the better choice. It\u2019s slightly harder and quite pricier compared to the option mentioned. The good thing about inasal is that it also offers desserts and breads from the philippines which taste really good, will probably go back for those and maybe try some other dishes also. Another thing to add is that it\u2019s not as busy as other restaurants during the weekends when others are fully packed.\n\nDelightful Filipino restaurant no shrinkflation here beef bone soup is rich with taste of marrow and more meat than we can chew. Dont miss out their Liempo, nicely marinated and reminiscent of street side grilled meat.\n",

Overall flavor of the various dishes is more muted and tend towards a more thicker starchy type of sauce. Not so to my taste buds. If you like more subdued flavor and thick sauce then I think this restaurant is for you :).\n\nThe dishes that we enjoy the most are Lechon Sisig Meal ($12.8 comes with 1 drink) (grilled pieces of Lechon that is quite fragrant and has nice crunchy pieces) and Chopped Lechon Meal ($12.8 comes with 1 drink).\n\nTheir signature roasted chopped Lechon is a must-try. Crispy skin, soft tender juicy meat paired with the house made sauce. Next to try is the Mango salad and Sisig.\n\nThe Lechon $12.50 set is good. Very crispy skin. Goes very well with the sauce. On the other hand, the sizzling hot plate (Lechon sisig) $12.50 set is too salty. Just get the normal Lechon.\n\nThe Lechon skin was really crispy, and the best part is the tender and juicy meat under the skin!! Will definitely be back to order a half kilo slab of that. The lunch queue starts around 12:30p on a Sunday, so need to get there early.\n\nProbably the best Lumpia you can find in Singapore! The Lechon have some crispy skin that can hear the sound even when you are sitting opposite! The chicharon has a very unique taste as well! The soup sinigang taste very similar to what you get in Philippines. Highly recommended\n",

Ordered Briyani, and it came with a huge \"mountain\" of rice, and instead of chicken on the rice,  the chicken was served in a separate bowl and was soaked with curry to the brim of the bowl. It is heavenly for curry lovers. Recommended.\n\nNice place to have lunch, dinner or even supper. The food is rather good and the beverages like teh tarik and masala tea are delicious and not overly sweet.\nThe staff are a mixed bag. Not really good with customer service except for a young chap (either Malay or Filipino, not too sure) who is really pleasant.\nAmbience is reasonable for the category and price it charges.\nThe range of food is wide though it does not have the some of the offerings from Evans Road. They are nice enough to put the papadam in a basket for us.\n\nKosong prata was crispy and good. Chicken murtabak had bones bits so that's quite bad even though overall taste was decent. Tea drinks were alright. Burger was ok. Service was decent.\n\nWould still prefer springleaf overall but can't deny that this is more affordable\n\nScoody Dooby Doo Hotdog was very good. However 2nd order was incorrect (wrong dish came) and undercooked. 5 stars for the Hotdog, would eat again.\n\nStop eating from here a few years back. Back then, the food was not as good as before and the cost went up. Heard there was a change of boss. Decided to give it a try again. Cost consider ok. Luckily the food standard is good again. Love the fish curry n chicken marsala.\n",

From start to finish, every aspect of my dining experience was nothing short of exceptional.\n\nWe were warmly greeted by the attentive crew and immediately immersed in the inviting and vibrant ambiance. We sat right in front of the open kitchen, perfect backdrop for an unforgettable culinary adventure. Seats at the counter, highly recommended!\n\nThe menu are masterfully crafted with authentic flavors and innovative twists. Each dish resulting in a symphony of taste that danced on my palate, my all time favourite are the pork trotter and house aged ducks! Definitely coming back for these again! Love the Halo Halo presentation and it tastes amazing too!\n\nBig shout out to Chef Kurt and team for their impeccable attention to detail and warm hospitality. The best part was getting a sneak peak inside the open kitchen! Thank you!\nDefinitely a culinary gem that deserves every bit of its five-star rating.\n\nThoroughly enjoyable! If you like the natural, almost earthy flavours of cooking aromatics, you\u2019ll love this place! We sat at the kitchen counter which was a bit warm from their wood oven but worth the slight discomfort for the chance to see the passionate crew at work.\nThe dishes that stood out to me were the sisig, the mid-joint wings, the dry aged duck and the turmeric rice, which was refreshingly different. The octopus is worth a mention too.\nSome of the dishes can be a bit rich but that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing as those would go well with a beer or glass of wine.\nI really admire that they let the natural flavours of their ingredients shine.\nIt makes this place just that little bit more special in my mind.\n\nThe foods are extremely delicate and authentic, I can feel the dedication of chefs giving different layers of taste and texture of the food. The environment is really comfortable, an gourmet experience without lossing the natural and traditional theme. The staffs are super friendly too.\n\nI\u2019m not an expert of Filipino cuisine, still Kubo does not seem to be most authentic. Although not deal-breaking, since they market themselves as modern fusion dining. Hopefully it helps for those expecting otherwise and also sets expectations straight for this review. We really liked most of the dishes, especially anything to do with pork, they cooked them well. Random but i loved how the sweet potato leaves were paired with the barramundi. Turon with coconut butterscotch was a beautiful end to the evening. Staff was friendly and helpful. For cocktails, I wouldn\u2019t order again.\n\nHave been eyeing this place for a long time and wanted to try their elevated filipino cuisine, so my partner brought me here for my birthday dinner.\n\nFirst of all the service staff were really friendly and helpful in recommending dishes to try. The ambience of the place was also immaculate - warm hues and cosy vibes, perfect for date nights or gathering with friends.\n\nFor the food, we had:\n1) Chicharon ($12) - Great way to start off the meal. Loved the crunch and fattiness of the pork cheek slivers. The smoked plum ketchup tasted so similar to macdonald's curry sauce though, and that threw me off a little.\n\n2) Pork Longanissa ($20) - Like an open-faced sandwich with a perfectly grilled patty complete with crispy edges, pickled cucumber for the tang and crunch, cheddar cheese and mustard sauce to give depth of flavour, atop a fluffy toasted potato bread with briney ikura and gooey cured egg on top. This was a flavour bomb. Full stop. This was my fave dish of the night.\n\n3) Crab Fat Risotto ($22) - This was quite a disappoint as it was highly raved online but I could only taste sourness from the entire dish. Not sure if it was the fermented crab or the calamansi, but the sourness was overpowering in this plate.\n\n4) Duck Fat BBQ Corn ($12) - Simply corn grilled with duck fat and smoked paprika sprinkled on top. Flavors were nice with the sweetness of the corn and savouriness of the paprika coming through, but $12 for what I think is half a corn? Wouldn't order this again.\n\n5) Halo Halo ($14) - A scoop of purple yam ice cream with coconut jam and coconut corn custard. That's all. Thought I could eat the flesh of the coconut this was served in too, but it was too hard to scrape off. Overall, felt that this dessert leaned too heavily on theatrics instead of the food itself.\n\n6) Barbie Potion ($20) - A gin-based aperitivo with raspberry, balsamic and egg white. Felt this was pretty diluted and tasted more like raspberry soda instead. Absolutely not worth the price.\n\nOverall, had a nice meal but personally there were more misses than hits for the food. But I would say service is good; my partner told the staff that this was a birthday celebration and they took away the Halo-Halo (that they already served) while I went to the loo and when I returned they came back to serve it with a candle on top. Enjoyable experience, but would try the rest of the menu.\n",

                  "reviews": "\n\nAs I have seen in the Philippines during my visit, \u201cit\u2019s the house that Fried Chicken Built\u201d. They are after all famous for the more traditional Fried chicken that\u2019s unlike most of today\u2019s fast food places where chicken relies on batter to get it to be crispy. Here the chicken is friend simply, has crispiness outside and really juicy tasty inside. I like this option because it relies on quality meat, good marinate and precise cooking to get it this way. We also tried the BBQ belly, their soup sinigang (sour and yummy with pork ribs and lots of veggies) ant the new Tina\u2019s fried rice (smoke fish) to wrap it up. 4 dishes with good portions (2 guys with good appetite) we were full and still had a good leftovers for at least 1.5 meals. So if you are looking for a decent Pinoy cuisine, come here.\n\nOnly complaint I had was service was really understaff.\n\nGreat place if you are craving for Filipino cuisine. Ordered beef bulalo, signature fried chicken, pansit and lumpia. They had my favorite lumpiang ubod on the menu but it was sold out.\nFood were seasoned well, wished they use pansit canton for the noodles instead of the yellow mee. The serving portion was good for the price, and their service crew were very friendly and attentive. We went there around 5pm which was not yet crowded so we were able to settle in easily.\n\nTl:dr not bad! Quite nice. Spicy chicken is nice. I like the tofu too\n\nTheres also the lunch set, affordable and nice. Chicken is fried and is spicy.\nReally enjoy the food here.\n\nThis is our first time trying Philippine food and the experience was not so great\u2026everything taste amazing at the start, but near the end of the meal you will feel so gelat due to the extreme oiliness of all the dishes\u2026we had to go for a ice kacang after the meal.\nI also didn\u2019t expect Philippine food being so expensive, $55 for two pax (we had some leftovers)\n\nChicken is soft even though its fried tastes like it was boiled, then deep-fried.\nLechon sisig : good .\nAdobo rice : I was expecting fried rice in adobo sauce, but not its just plain rice mix in adobo sauce.\nSinigang milk fish belly : It's okay\nPancit:  Some parts of it are not fully cooked, but it's good.\nHalo halo: was the best if you like sweet \ud83d\ude0b\n",

                  "reviews": "\n\nAuthentic Filipino roast pork! Highly recommended the Lechon Laing set meal...mouth watering roast pork...this is Filipino style roast pork, so don't expect the pork skin to be thin...the sour soup goes well to cut through the fats..and the coconut potato leaves just adds a different layer of flavours..served with steamy hot rice along with the pickle onion vinegar...at the point of writing, only 12.50 for this well worth it wholesome meal...5 stars for taste portions and value for money, 5 stars for service the ates/aunties are very friendly and accommodating..the atmosphere rightly takes you to Philippines..\n\nRating this solely on the plate of Lechon w rice ($9.50). Don't scoff at the price; this is nothing like your run-of-the-mill $5 Roast Pork Rice from the local foodcourt. The Lechon is so much more meaty, crispy, aromatic, and fatty, and I guarantee you that you'll think that roast pork tastes so average after. Pair this with the sweet sauce and you're good to go. They also give a bowl of tangy soup to cut through the fattiness every few bites.\n\nThis is a hidden gem if you do not mind the super crowded food court. The Philippines style roasted pork taste very close to those Chinese\u2019s style (without heavy spices). This is the first time I\u2019m having Philippines cruises, so excited they served pork. The meat is tender and juicy, the skin is crispy and crunchy. It\u2019s roasted in house in the oven slowly and evenly turn rotating. This is not spicy as it\u2019s peanut sauce with veg as side. Although it\u2019s slightly pricier than the food selling at some other stall in the same location, but this is something that you may try as they are actually roasted the whole big piece of pork not by smaller pieces. This way can lock the moist from being dry out. It taste more on the original meat taste rather than overly spiced up, can appreciate the true taste of pork (the meat is clean and do not have those porky taste from frozen meat). This might not be great for those really preferred heavily flavored food.\n\nPaid $48 for this. Not coming back.\n\nOrdered Lechon Sisig which WASN'T SIZZLING, it was warm but NOT HOT. Flavour was more towards (shredded) Lechon than a sisig fusion, lacked basic sisig ingredients like onion, soy sauce and egg.\n\nOrdered Laing and Bopis too. While I couldn't complain on the flavours, they were ala carte portions and of course priced as one dish. I asked if there's a side dish option so I could order more, but was told they don't. In the end, me and my company had too much leftovers.\n\nTried bbq pork with rice, crispy skin but a bit oily, meal okay but a bit soften, must eat with the sauce, overall is good\n",

Good food choices.\n\nMy faves are: Mee Bangus, Khaki Yong Tau Foo and the Pisang Goreng \ud83d\ude0b\n\nIG @sporkandbeanz\n\n\ud83d\ude87Clementi\n\nHad the pleasure of indulging in a culinary adventure across different eateries, and here's my take on the experience:\n\nKhali Yong Tau Fu: A Flavorful Delight\n\nThe flavors were rich and satisfying, leaving me craving for more. The expertly crafted dishes showcased a perfect blend of ingredients, making it a delightful culinary experience. I wholeheartedly recommend this place to anyone in search of a delectable meal.\n\nMee Bagus: Volcano Ayam - A Decent Choice\n\nTried Volcano Ayam from Mee Bagus and it was decent, it didn't quite live up to the hype. The flavors were good, but it lacked that special touch that sets extraordinary dishes apart from the ordinary. It's a suitable option for a quick meal, but don't expect anything out of the ordinary.\n\nMakan Melaka: Cendol - A Missed Opportunity\n\nUnfortunately, my experience at Makan Melaka was rather disappointing. I ordered their Cendol with high hopes, but it fell short of expectations. The ice wasn't cold enough, resulting in a watery consistency that left much to be desired. However, I appreciated the effort in using fresh coconut santan, but it couldn't salvage the overall experience.\n\nHappy dining!\n\nFood choices varies. I ordered the asam pedas melaka and it was shiok. Drinks wise a bit let down. Menu stated as 'Limau' but it was the thick sour syrup lime. No choice cannot cancelled because the indian guy give me weird look and he already served the drink. My husband say the decorations was a bit too much though.\n\nFood place is clean and airy, according to my preference Clementi outlet is by far the best one, not too crowded and the food served not bad.\n\nMee Bagus is good but preferred the regular staffs to prepare the Volcano set as this time the taste a lil\u2019 slackened due to lesser paste/ taste. Liked it with rich flavours and noodles still \u201cspringy\u201d. Don\u2019t scold that guy, give him a chance to master it, I\u2019ll be back again..\n\nA halal coffee shop located in the heartlands. It's a 15 minutes walk from green Clementi MRT station or you can take a bus from Clementi interchange to get here.\n\nAll of their food served here are halal and tastes great. You wouldn't taste much difference compared to the non-halal versions. The drinks stall has unique specialty drinks that is hardly found anywhere else. The Zi Char stall here is by a recent popular franchise of Buey Tahan Seafood. Other than the usual Zi Char dishes, they do have Crab in a Bag or Seafood in a Bag.\n\nThe stall I would have to recommend is the BBQ store called Joy Satay(you have to try the mutton), they also have otahs and BBQ prawns which are sweet, fresh and amazingly tasty!\n\nThere is a halal version of HawkerMan here which serves Char Kway Teow and Hokkien Prawn Mee. Although they taste different from the non-halal version, they still try their best to make it as deliciously good.\n\nOverall this a good place to chill and gather with everyone of your friends. Since this is a halal coffee shop, everyone can dine without any fuss and food selections. Hope they have more outlets around Singapore.\n",

First time trying their bangus (milkfish) sinigang, and it was a favourite even among the non-Filipinos. Lechon kawali hit the right sweet-savoury note, too.\n\nSinigang was a good accompaniment to the rest of the spread, which was characteristically salty. Vegetable kare kare was alright, a bit bland compared to the rest.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong this place definitely deserves a 5 star for its food and service. The pork was chunky, crispy and delicious. It is the kind of food that you miss. However, we were unlucky enough to pay a visit on a rainy + windy weather, only to realise that the restaurant didn\u2019t have any indoor seat and the outdoor shelters & umbrellas were not really rain proof. The table was wet and seats were literally flooded. Still good food though, just check the weather forecast before you head there.\n\n3.5 stars for food. 1st time trying filo food. We came on a Wednesday before 8pm. Was served a plate of cold 1/2 kilo roast pork and rice. The pork skin was semi crispy, slightly thick and hard. Meat was very tender. The sauce seems to be missing a sour punch. Perhaps some lime chilli will liven up the greasy meat dish. As we didn't have any veg or soup, having roast pork alone felt quite greasy. Sat at the alfresco area. Found our own table, went counter to order, not much of a friendly service here.\n\nI think the bicol express and kare kare were really tasty and the Lechon was great.  Although the sisig dish was not bad, as in, if I came over for dinner, you served it up, that would be A-OK, I\u2019ll have to say it doesn\u2019t measure up to the pig jowl/cheek sisig of Eg Manila\u2019s Gerry\u2019s Grill\u2026it lacked the fattiness/cartilaginous and smokiness I associate with a good sizzling sisig dish.\n\nThe Grandlink mall outlet for Don Lechon is outside under some umbrellas next to the river. The kitchen is in the store, inside. Dress in shorts and tees. No frills and there\u2019s no shame in that. My husband and I were quite happy!\nCold drinks from the fridge include Pepsi and 7Up, lemon tea and coconut juice in a can, and bottled water. Ice is available.  They have also leche flan, ube and cheese puto, among others as dessert options.  They charge a nominal extra per dish for takeaway. 30c per dish, if I recall correctly.\nSimple and tasty Pinoy fare.\n\nLove their lechon!

Filipino food is not amazing Drink's prices are high.\nMinimum of 80SGD for a bottle of wine (55\u20ac).\nFried fish (half)+spring rolls+porc sisig+sparkling water+ginger ale => 85 SGD => 58\u20ac\n\nThe place is nice and the food is delicious too. You need a reservation to get into this place because it is mostly crowded on Fridays and weekends. Majority of the staff was helpful and supportive but there are few who were being rude. As also the glasses they gave us for drinks were not properly cleaned and when we asked the waitress to clean it she was being a bit rude and giving us looks. The prices are bit high but I think it is acceptable because of the location of the restaurant.\n\nWent to the Cuppage area, ordered Sisig, Kansi and garlic rice for 2 at 12:37. Food still not served at 1:25. Staff wasn\u2019t communicating when asked if food is being prepared and how long would it take. Sisig tasted like sprinkled with MSG. Kansi was ok. Hopefully they will improve their service.\n\nNot the most comfortable place to eat and the drinks were expensive, but the food are top notch. All the dishes tasted amazing, well seasoned!\n\nHad a great time last night. Haven\u2019t eaten a real filipino food for some time especially Isaw, Chicharon bulaklak and tuna panga. All the food we have ordered tasted really good. A great value for your money. On top of that Sir Angie really made our experience memorable. Kudos to Sir Angie. We will definitely eat here again.\n",

I think mango was substituted with sweet potato which was cute but pleasantly went well.\n\nPaid total $61 for these 3 dishes, 2 rice, 2 iced lemon tea.\nFor the price point, I had to hold back -1 \ud83c\udf1f.\n\nWill come back only for the Sisig and maybe to try the Lomi.\n\nGreat place. Amazing servers and super helpful as well as friendly.\nThey have a good wine selection!\n\nOf course I do wish they had more vegetarian options but all the vegetarian food I had was good!\n\nThe live music adds on as a great experience :)\n\nGood stuff!\n\nPs: this is how it looks in Christmas!\n\n08 Jan 2023\nThis is the 2nd time here.\n1st time experience is good, The hotplate pork sisiq came out piping hot. Fish also the same thing.\nBut not this visit. Pork sisiq came out and the egg was over cooked. Can't mix with the pork. The fish too, not really hot.\nProbably the kitchen was ready with the food but didn't serve it right away, maybe  short of staff cause only 1 guy is serving.\n\nPork spring roll : skin not crunchy\nChicken Wing :  standard\nPork with taukwa : don't like it\nFish, pork sisiq : love those\nVegetable : so so\n\nAn interesting place to visit with affordable range of wines, beer, food and live band that performs from Monday to Saturday starting from 730pm.\n\nThey serve good range of Western and Philipino dishes (hotplate pork sisig $15).  They also serve late night menu (fries, spring rolls) after the kitchen is closed while you enjoy the live music.\n\nWhile we appreciate the live performance, please consider tuning down the volume of the speaker.\n\nService is good and worth the visit.\nPlease make a reservation to avoid disappointment \ud83d\ude1e.\n\nOne of my favourite places to eat Filo food. The people are quite nice, accommodating and friendly. Really like their food especially my all time fave, sisig! We ate during lunch thus did not experience the bar and band at night but I feel it is good! Will come back again! Highly recommended!\n",

                  "reviews": "\n\n1. They serve u in kids plate. So imagine how small the serving is\n\n2. Stingy portion. Everywhere else when u order Turkish food, they give you some salad as side.\n\n3. Expensive for its poor quality and small serving.\n\n4. Tasteless. I ordered 2 times and all 2 times been disappointing.\n\nI've eaten here four times, and the latest visit will unfortunately be my last.\n\nTrip #1: Pleasant surprise to find a new store selling kebabs in the food court so we tried it. It was alright. Not nearly special enough that one would visit just to eat it, but I like an exotic food option so we decided we would visit again and support them.\n\nTrip #2: Take out this time. Ordered the same thing, two kebabs, but added one more dish to try more of the menu: falafel. The falafel ended up being delayed by about 20 minutes because the owner said they kept breaking up as he prepared them but there was some service recovery; he offered lentil soup for free which I thought was a nice gesture.\n\nTrip #3: This was just a few days ago. I brought more of my family members along to try the food. This time, the food tasted so much better than the first time two times (the chef dipped his head out of the kitchen occasionally, and I noted he actually looked like he's from Turkmenistan). The kebabs were juicy and crispy, and the rice was tasty. Slight hiccup, however, in that I ordered falafel (again, this seems to be a problematic food) and it was delayed by about 15 minutes. When I went back to check on the falafel, the owner handed me a plate of four pieces of grilled haloumi, saying that there were issues with the falafel and that the haloumi was of equal value. I didn't order grilled haloumi, and it wasn't what I wanted, so I just opted for a refund. The owner then said the haloumi would be free, and he would give me the refund. I didn't want to do that since he's running a business, so I reluctantly accepted the haloumi as replacement for the falafel. The saving grace, however, was that the haloumi turned out to be very good.\n\nTrip #4: This was just this evening. The order was put in at 18:36: two kebabs and a grilled haloumi. The first kebab came quickly enough, but was very dry and bland. We then went to retrieve the second kebab some 10 minutes afterwards, and was told the haloumi would take some time. Though the portion was a good size, this second kebab was just as dry and bland. Now by 19:00, we had finished our kebabs and were still waiting on the grilled haloumi. So, I walk to the store for the third time, and the kebab guy with the long hair tells me \"one minute\". 19:06 rolls around, and so I tell him again: \"Bro, it's been half an hour. Can I ask where my grilled haloumi is?\" Kebab guy with the long hair is clearly upset, he drops his chicken shavings and goes into the kitchen and yells inside to someone something along the lines of \"half an hour already\", echoing what I just asked him. Long hair guy comes out and raises his voice at me and tells me something about \"only one person bro\". I reply: \"I know you're only one person, but if the grilled haloumi was going to take 30 minutes you should have said so.\"\n\nI'd like to think that I was fair and mentioned the good and bad parts of this stall in this review. I like supporting local businesses but I won't tolerate being given attitude for something that's not my fault. There seems to be an preparation issue items like falafel and grilled haloumi on the menu, so it would be good if the owner could look into that. Not for me though, but for future customers. I have no more reason to return. There's Stuff'd downstairs at a better price point, faster service times, much better food quality and best of all \u2014 no bad attitude.\n\nPretty decent Turkish food for takeaway. Won't say it's the best I've had, but it does the job.\n",

Their attentiveness and friendly demeanor added to the overall positive atmosphere.\n\nHad a delightful dining experience at Derwish Turkish! The mixed kebab platter was outstanding; I was trying to control my carbs but I couldn't get enough of the fragrant rice. The hummus was good, although the bread was a bit tough for my liking. However, what truly stood out was the exceptional service. The staff was incredibly friendly and always had a smile on their faces, which added to the overall splendid experience. Looking forward to visiting again!\n\nEverytime I have a loved one visiting Singapore, I always take them here. I always come back here for the food and service.

Food is definitely wayyy more expensive than the usual, but the taste makes it not such a bad deal. Apple tea is really nice before eating the food, very refreshing and fragrant but after eating any food it doesn't taste as nice.\n\nPeter, the staff here, was exceptionally polite and gave us a warm welcome. When I needed to store my dessert in the fridge, he was incredibly helpful. Peter also recommended their signature dishes, and we decided to try them.\n\nThe Tajin lamb shank was a delightful surprise, with tender, succulent meat that practically fell off the bone. The flavors were rich and aromatic, making it a standout dish.\n\nThe Meze tabagi was a delightful assortment of Mediterranean appetizers, a true explosion of flavors and textures. It included a variety of dips, fresh vegetables, and savory bites, providing a wonderful contrast of tastes.\n\nFor a refreshing beverage, we ordered the Mango Ayran. It was a perfect balance of sweet and tangy, making it a great complement to our meal.\n\nUnfortunately, as there were only two of us, we couldn't order the traditional dessert Peter recommended. Nevertheless, we thoroughly enjoyed the atmospheric environment, delicious food, and excellent service provided by the staff.\n",

The standout dish for me was the lamb; it had absolutely no odor and tasted fantastic. The grilled items were a highlight as well, bursting with delicious flavors. The restaurant\u2019s ambiance was beautifully decorated, and the staff was both charming and incredibly helpful, taking the time to explain the dishes to us. While it\u2019s not the cheapest option, the prices are fair for the quality you receive.\n\nOne thing to note, though, is that the platter we ordered was described as \u201cfor two,\u201d but for Asians, it\u2019s considered a generous portion. So, if there are four of you and you\u2019ve already ordered other dishes, I recommend going for the platter for two only; it\u2019s quite substantial. Would recommend to anyone looking for a great dining experience!\n\nFirst time having Turkish food and was really\npleasantly surprised. Their dips and bread was really exceptional. The bread was steaming when it came out it was both crispy and fluffy at the same time. The platter for 2 was also great all the grilled meats was tender and flavourful. Portion was also huge.\n\nEverything from the service to food were impeccable. Staff were polite and always made sure we were well taken care of. I ordered before my friend came and they asked when the food should be prepared and how it should be served. Food was perfectly done too. It is the little things that make a difference and win them a return customer.\n\nVery impressive food & service displayed by the dedicated front staffs and chefs. It\u2019s nice walking in the street after a wine & dine session in the area. The staffs were very attentive, price is reasonable.\n\nWent here for a birthday celebration and the attention to detail from their service staff is amazing, didn\u2019t mention to the staff that it was for a birthday celebration, only had a note in the reservation. But they went above and beyond, having candles in the dessert and even giving us props to take pictures with and proceeded to then print out the photo of us to keep!\n\nThe food also matches the service, authentic Turkish cuisine done perfectly, the Hummus was so good we had to order a second portion! I\u2019m not usually a fan of chicken but the chicken that came with the platter blew my mind, so juicy and tender. Then comes dessert, my first time having Kunefe and the only thing I have to say is that I wish I didn\u2019t share it, wanted it all to myself \ud83e\udd23\n\nDefinitely coming back here again!\n",

The chicken Mandi was only ok.\n\nOverall, it was a very well laid out restaurant in line with the vibe on the street.\n\nThe latte and Turkish coffee were good.

I was pleasantly surprised that the full menu was still available!  Istanbul Grill\u2019s served up an delightful meal, with great humus, and  top notch Turkish coffee.  Our server even hand-made our delectable balaclava!\n\nHighly recommended!\n\nGreat food, great atmosphere. Not sure why there aren\u2019t more people. Do note the 20% offer!\n\nHummus was delicious, platter for two is a lot. Two guys and one of me girl\u2026 so stuffed. Great meal!\n",

Everything is always delicious, fresh, you can only enjoy food and views with such pleasure here! I would never have thought that there were such wonderful places in this city!\n\nI ordered the baked cheese rice with chicken and it was pretty good, adequate cream sauce with the rice, the chicken was tasty & the melted cheese made it all better overall. Although I would say that the portion is slightly small, but perfect for one person. The other dish was kebab chicken rice - the shredded chicken was really good and the rice had a delicious buttery taste too. It came with some salad on the side, although without salad sauce, when paired with the chicken and rice it was a good meal :) The drinks prices were too high though, does not seem worth it.\n\nAwesome food - awesome people - great location!\nTrue Turkish hospitality!\nOur favourites are\n-the Turkish tea\n- Adana kebab\n- Lahmacun (bread with Lamb meat )\n- Ekmek (Bread)\n- Lavash (Turkish Bread)\n\nPricing is a bargain compared to other Turkish Restaurants in Arab Street.\nFor us it\u2019s our everyday go to!\n\nFood is a little towards dry but fragrant and taste is acceptable. Service is not so fantastic, 2 people sharing but no side plates and only given 2 thin pcs of serviette which we used to  hold the pizza. Venue is still considered good and outdoot sitting is pet friendly.\n\nOverall, it's something can consider to try. Still grateful for making their outdoor sitting pet friendly.\n\nUnassuming on the outside with minimal decor on the inside, I thought that there\u2019s no way this place could be selling authentic middle eastern food!\n\nBut of course I was wrong. Meat dishes are decently priced and delicious, baked goods are fresh, and the Kunafe is deeelightful.\n",

The atmosphere was awesome and I definitely liked that you have a very modern style. Most importantly, every food and drink on your menu tasted great\n\nI've had lunch there. The waiters were friendly. They gave me a complementary Apple Tea \ud83c\udf75 since it's lunch time. The food is pretty good. The Turkish taste is there. They have plenty options. Unfortunately most of the beef items were unavailable. Had to choose the lamb ones. It's really tasty nonetheless. They also have good chicken and vegetarian options.\n\nWe used the Eatigo discount and its definitely worth it.. the foods are great, taste just fantastic to our liking! The waiter is friendly to recommend us their signature foods too..\n\nService by the Chinese guy was good, but the food was really so so and would have been very expensive (avg $25/main) if not for the entertainer app we used. We tried their most popular mains and switched the rice to pita bread. But the bread was very stale and tough, the meat was so so and we ordered hummus which tasted rather diluted. The only good dish was the kunefe, although somehow it's really oily. I'm not sure if that's normal cos this is only the second time I'd eaten kunefe and the last time I had it elsewhere, it wasn't swimming in oil. We literally poured the oil out on a separate dish and it was a lott of oil...\n\nSetting was pretty although it was mostly empty on a Sunday lunch time, not surprised \ud83d\ude05\n\nLove the food from this place. It is slightly expensive but the food is always cooked to perfection. The meats is always so tender. The server was also very attentive and welcoming. Will definitely come back.\n",

We are satisfied with the ambience, food, drinks, service and the atmosphere.\n\nThe staff are polite and helpful. We ordered the Mixed Jumbo Kebab Platter for us to share and followed by Kunefe with ice cream for dessert. They even sang birthday song to me when they presented the dessert with a candle on it. It is very nice and I appreciate their thoughtfulness.\n\nWe are impressed with the jumbo platter as all the meat and veggies are well prepared, well marinated and well cooked. We finished everything off the plate. It is simply delicious. We also enjoyed the Turkish Tea and dessert.\n\nWe will definitely return to try out other food from here again.\n\nIf you follow my Google reviews, you'll know I'm very critical. Yet, this is a restaurant that I'm giving a full five-star rating. That is because it's really perfection!\n\nThis was my third visit, and this time was with a group of friends. I was not kidding when I shared that I liked the food here more than what I had when I was in Istanbul! Was it because they catered well to the local Singaporeans? I'm unsure, but I really liked the Turkish food here! Most importantly, the service quality here had been great thus far! Please maintain!\n\nSuch a gem! The food was so I\u2019m very impressed!! Some meats are dry but overall the food is so good! I love the hummus dips! Our table was nxt to the glass so the view was amazing!!! The food does get cold fast because the place is cold!\n\nI love love love the desserts they are super sweet as expected of Turkish desserts but with their tea or coffee it is perfection! Will come back for the desserts!!\n\nMy partner and I had a wonderful anniversary lunch at Sofra Turkish restaurant. We were impressed by the authentic and delicious Turkish food, the friendly and attentive service, and the cozy and relaxing ambience. We ordered the mix platter salad, the chicken Adana kebab, the baklava, and the Turkish coffee, and we enjoyed every bite and sip. The salad was fresh and flavorful, the kebab was tender and juicy, the baklava was sweet and crunchy, and the coffee was strong and aromatic. The portions were generous and satisfying. The staff were very kind and helpful, and they even gave us an extra dessert to celebrate our special occasion. We felt very welcomed and appreciated. The restaurant has a nice view of the CBD and esplanade, which added to the romantic atmosphere. We had a great time at Sofra Turkish restaurant, and we highly recommend it to anyone who loves Turkish cuisine. It is one of the best Turkish restaurants we have ever been to.\n\nAmazing food. Would recommend! Good options but most of it are variation of similar items. Service is friendly and prompt. Prices are slightly above average but portions are good for sharing, so its good for groups. Great outdoor views (minus the heat). Would be good if there are those  mist-fans or coolers outdoor.\n",

The staff are always very warm and friendly, and service is great. Food is consistently very tasty. Dishes are best for sharing. Our favourites were the pottery lamb kebab and the chicken musakka.

Meats were succulent and well seasoned, all around excellent, there wasn\u2019t a dish we didn\u2019t like.\n\nPortions are generous, given the choice of would be nice to go with a group of 3+ but we won\u2019t complain about leftovers!\n\nhad an amazing dinner here! brought my family to try turkish food for the first time and they enjoyed themselves :) the owner was extremely hospitable and gave us a complimentary kunefe as well as some tea. the food was amazing! solved my middle eastern cravings ~\n\nMy first authentic Turkish food experience highly recommended by my friend. And it totally blew my mind - how hearty and flavourful the food was and how warm the staffs were. The biggest take away was the hummus & bread and baklava!!\n",

Firstly, I'm disappointed with their service, food came not as we requested, instead of Pita bread, we were served rice. Secondly, had to ask from 3 servers before our drinks were served. Food are not as delicious as we expected it to be, compared to other neighbouring Turkish restaurants there. Not attentive service. Tables are dirty, chairs not cleaned before sitting customers. Will not come again.\n2. After replying this review, I don't think the Owner is genuine with his reply. I'm not expecting for a refund neither a free meal but i am sharing my experience in the restaurant. I guess you should be sincere with your offer of apology or service recovery and not offer and giving an invalid number. Such a dishonesty!\n\nSivan was very approachable and friendly! Top tier service from the guys here and the manager as well. Food was good too! Highly recommend the meat platter and kunafe with goat\u2019s milk ice cream!\n\nGreat Turkish fare, with the best kunefe.

The hummus was creamy and smooth, with a rich and nutty flavor. The bread was warm and soft, and the perfect accompaniment to the kebab and hummus. We loved the service very very hospitable. We were very comfortable stayed there for more than 1.5 hours had a really good time they didn\u2019t rush us. Place is a little congested but overall I was very impressed with the Turkish kebab BBQ, hummus, and bread. It was a delicious and satisfying meal that I would definitely recommend to others.\n\nFood was pretty good and authentic. Beyti Lamb Kebab was the star of the night. Usually lamb dishes have strong taste and restaurants tend to use very strong sauces to mask it, but the lamb didn't have such a strong taste and the sauce was mild. A perfect balance. Hummus was good as well, although the pita was on the harder to chew side.\n\nHowever, service was a little off, hence 4 stars. Would, however, come back. Got 30% off dine in via foodpanda and ended up to about 30 per pax, so pretty good deal.\n\nThe food was served so fast. Everything was delicious and the priced were good too. Servings were more than adequate! JB still was sweet to serve us even though we came half an hour before they closed. Try the meat grill  platter! Love it!!!!!!!!\n\nFood are fantastic. The butter rice is very tasty.\nWith the herbs on Lamb and chicken. It really tastes good. Price abit pricy but it will not deter people from going back.\n\nVery good !!! We ordered the eggplant kebab, hummus and dolmads and it was so tasty!!!! Very good meal, perfect service. They were so nice to us and made us feel at home. Thank you! We will come back for sure \u2764\ufe0f\n",

The food was beautifully prepared. Everything was spiced nicely,  flavourful & balanced.\n\nI especially loved the chicken. It's really something special. \ud83d\udcafrecommended.\nEven the pasta had a unique taste we enjoyed.\n\nWe had DIY wraps & the bread was really soft!\n\nThe Baklava was light, nutty & not so sweet. You wouldn't want to share it \ud83d\ude05\n\nYou can tell all the dishes & sauces are made from scratch, made with love.\n\nI'd recommend it for family gathering. Enjoy!\n\nSaw this place from a news article, and decided to try it. Got this for SGD$12 and it's great value for money. The long grain rice is fluffy and airy, it soaked up the sauces and oil from the meat nicely. Surprisingly the meat is juicy and not dry. It has the right amount of spices that is not so overpowering like the other Middle Eastern food. The portion of meat is generous. The butter rice just has a hint of butter, which is very nice. Good balance of flavours, meat and salad. The mild sourness from the preserved olives adds a nice touch of tardiness to cut through the oil (don't get me wrong, the oil was kept at a light touch). The sweet was sweet which is a given so I suggest having an unsweetened tea to end the meal and sweets.\n\nOverall a balanced and healthy meal at a great cost. The portion is just nice for me but might be a bit more for a lady. Like the brand said, hotel quality at hawker center price. The boss is friendly and I got a free coin purse from him. Very likely I will be back for more.\n\nFriendly bros serving authentic Turkish kebabs, generous portions and high quality ingredients. Requested for the more charred bits for my kebab and theh were very gracious to comply.\n\nChicken kebap roll ($6) - Average. Strong paprika taste in the sauce. A decent portion for the price.\nBaklava ($5 for 2) -  Tasted ok. Rather small pieces for the price.\n\nChicken was the only meat that they had.\n",

Nice music and they gave us food at 11pm when others rejected us due to closed kitchen\n\nFor me to be honest, the price is too expensive for the portion of the food. The taste is fine though I feel it is not as authentic as what I was expecting. This all for 19 sgd.\n\nVisited this newly opened Turkish stall on a Sunday afternoon.\n\nWe got their Masala Tea, Lamb Shawarma with Rice, Pita Chicken and Kunafa.\n\nLamb with rice was good. They gave us a mix of lamb and chicken as the lamb wasn't enough. The lamb was tender and did not have a strong lamb taste. The rice reminded me of biryani rice which I like. The Mandi sauce was really good. Very spicy, herb-y and tomato-y which added a nice refreshing heat to the dish.\n\nPita chicken was not bad. The chicken was tender, vegetables were fresh and crunchy and the pita was crispy yet chewy.\n\nKunafa was delicious. First time trying this popular Middle Eastern dessert. The warm Kunafa went well with the cold cream and I like that it was crispy and sweet. But do order this early as it takes a long time to prepare.\n\nOverall a place you can consider if you're having a Turkish food craving. The people here are also friendly!\n\nOne of the best tasting sharwma and Turkish kebab I've ate around in town. Been here multiple times and the food has been consistent in quality and taste. Head down for a no frills Turkish foodie experience. Outdoor seating only\n\nI do not know that they are selling with the Baklava, and 3 pieces for 12 SGD at the first time I buy. I am shocked, but hopefully there is 6 inside. I can't acceptable. How about you? Might be the food is expensive, or\n",

                  "reviews": "\n\nStumbled across this place today and decided to eat here with my mum. Very no frills and simple place.\n\nShe had a falafel moussaka, and I had the mexican beef bowl. The moussaka was delicious but I feel like 5 pieces of nacho chips wasn\u2019t enough and mind you this cost $13\u2026..\n\nThe beef bowl was a little dry, could do with some kind of sauce but it was good and we finished both dishes. The churros came freshly fried and was good too, but would have preferred actual choc sauce vs the hershey choc syrup.\n\nOnly gripes; the overly sugary lemongrass drink that was served premade with no ice. Had to ask for ice twice but given few pieces\u2026..  also very weird that we dined in but were served with plastic cutlery when we clearly saw metal cutlery, it was a little strange. It was practically only 2 tables and the lady served my food to the other table\u2026. Could tell she wanted to take it back to serve me but they already started eating it.\n\nI think its a quaint little place but some things need to be improved. At $30 for 2 expected just a little more.\n\nExcellent service. The beef Mexican rice bowl was not bad. With the homemade drink, I spent less than $10. I was there alone at 5 ish and I had the entire place to myself. I don't remember music playing but it sure would be nice to listen to some tunes.\n\nSmall quaint shop located near Tai Seng Mrt, they had a $10 set meal that had a wrap, small hash brown and a lemongrass tea. There was a small side of nacho chips with salsa.\n\nNothing amazing but I guess it was better than nothing coz there wasn\u2019t anything there open before 11am\n\nDropped-off my 10-months old laptop at LENOVO Service Centre at 3 Irving Rd, #01-17 Tai Seng Centre. BITC, Singapore 369522 on Tuesday 18 April 2023,\n\nThus decide to settle my late lunch within the area too.\n\nOne will be spoiled with choices as there are so many small eateries and cafes. I was drawn to  Olive Mediterranean & Middle East which was located across the street at 11 Irving Place #01-14/15, Tai Seng Point, Singapore 369551.\n\nOrdered for myself a Mexican Rice (Celantro & Spinach With Beef) Bowl at S$7.50.\n\nIf you are a small eater, the serving portion is just right. However, definitely a \"No. No.\" for someone who has a heavy duty digestive system, I would recommend that you order some nachos or Quesadillas too.\n\nIn my opinion, the rice is mildy aromatic (I was expecting a more pungent aroma of Celantro and spinach).\n\nI will rate the minced beef topping as \"healthy choice\".  It is relatively quite nice BUT will not leave one any special impression.  It will definitely taste alot better if there is a little more fat (this will enhance the juiciness) and more spices are added.\n\nHowever, if you working in this area, it is a great place to meet up with your colleagues and friends after work.  You can sufficient outdoor sittings surrounded with plants.\n\nStumbled on this place as i happened to be browsing around. Been awhile since i had my tacos and wraps, decided to try this as i noticed they had very high reviews.\n\nHad the beef Quesadilla - loved it as it was simply nice\nChicken Saffron Stew - Soooo tender and nice but soup wasnt as thick as i wanted but thats purely due to my own taste\nHashbrowns - Thumbsup as we all loved it. Hearsay its even better than M's hashbrown but i leave it for u to judge.\n\nService wise was top, very homely feel given by the lady boss and staff. She took her time to guide me through the menu and shared with me what we should order.\nI must say the food takes a pretty long time to come for a quiet Monday Afternoon but i guess Good Food - Time to prepare so no complaints from me on this.\n\nOverall i recommend this place based on the food served + prices. Very nice and they deserves better businesses. should be pretty quiet when its after office hours.\n\nWill be back again :)\n",

                  "reviews": "\n\nWas recommended this nice little Swiss restaurant by a friend.\nThe food was overall good. The malakoff and coucou salad was very good with us feeling of wanting more. The crescendo of the evening would definitely be the venison striploin from their seasonal menu. Really nice texture and went perfectly with the cranberry sauce accompanying it. Wanted to have the chocolate fondue for dessert but we were so stuffed that we just opted for the seasonal dessert of vanilla ice cream with Chantilly cream.\nService staff was excellent and attentive. Always checking in on us to make sure everything was to our liking.\nThank you to Chef Yves and the staff of Coucou for the wonderful evening.\n\nNice place with interesting food. Cheese fondue is slightly expensive but unfortunately had a slightly bitter taste. Would not recommend this dish.\nRosti and steak is good. Desserts are ok too.\nService is great with many attentive servers, there was almost no wait for any requests. Atmosphere is good too, just slightly cramped but not to much inconvenience.\nOverall a good experience and nice place.\n\nMy second visit to Coucou: first time with a group of 6, the next with 2. Better to dine with a bigger group as you can try more dishes (the cheese fondue might get a too rich after a while). The meringue dessert was not too sweet and was paired well with fresh berries.\n\nThe service staff was very friendly and patient with us. As we were leaving the restaurant it started raining heavily , so we decided to head back in for some desserts. As it was getting quite cold inside, we requested for a table outside and the waiter was very accommodating where he took the extra effort to find us another table.\n\nThank you for a great dinner and will return again!\n\nwe called in to make a reservation instead of online and they were nice to arrange an indoor seating for us nevertheless \u263a\ufe0f\nwe ordered the original cheese fondue (comes with free flow bread) - amazing though gets a little salty after a while!\nwe also had cordon bleu which was crispy but quite lacking in taste (likely because of the saltiness from the cheese fondue which ruined our taste buds haha) and spatzli (very disappointing in taste).\ntotal damage was $150~\nnote: for the cheese fondue min order is 2 pax which is $70++ so can just order for 2 pax then whole table (more than 2 pax) share also OK \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\n\nWould rate this place 4.5/5!! We ordered the Cordon Bleu, Rosti Zermatt and the Ovomaltine Mousse. Cordon Bleu was nice - the breaded crust was well done, the chicken was yummy but could be a little more moist. Rosti Zermatt was slightly underwhelming for us - the cheese and ham were good, but rosti was a little too thick and hard. Ovomaltine Mousse was amazing - the ginger bread was yummy even on its own and the mousse was really light. We spent $97 for three dishes. Staff was extremely attentive - filling up our cups many times without having to ask for a refill. They also cleaned our table before serving the dessert. Had an enjoyable time here!\n",

I do not know remember the exact name of the food my friend ordered but here are the pictures! I like the red wine with fruits. Tasted sweet so good for ladies. The meat in the pan is the chicken.\n\nIt was a packed evening with a good crowd.\nWe ordered 3 dishes. I would recommend a party of 4 to really go enjoy the food as they are made for sharing.\n\nAfter a while, you start to see similarities in the ingredients and basically dipping into the same sauce and same protein spread across different wraps. I thought there would be more varieties.\n\nOn the whole, service was 5 stars.\nAttentive and warm.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing much you can do with the sewer smell when you sit outside and smokers from the neighbouring drinking joints.\n\nCame by for an afternoon lunch over a weekend. Found the food a bit underwhelming and under-seasoned. Had the fish tacos and quesadillas. Would have been nice if the taco shells were handmade. Anyway, the salsas and dips saved the under seasoned quesadillas for me. We were the only guests at the restaurant at that time.\n\nVivian was very welcoming and sincere in recommending us the dishes for the night. Dishes were cooked to perfection and we really enjoyed every dish. Pearlyn and Uncle Ben\u2019s service was also top notch. We were there to celebrate my sister\u2019s 18th birthday and she had a blast!

The tapas here somewhat more authentic than some other places. What really wowed me is the Paella which is so delicious. Definitely will come back when I have crave for Spanish fare.\n\nLovely food, great vibes and the service was excellent. The paella is the best we\u2019ve had in SG, really! The flies at the alfresco tables were a bit annoying, so might opt for the indoor sitting in the future. We\u2019ll be back!\n\nThe food here is good. We over ordered but still managed to  finished everything.\n\nMy only gripe is that\n1. I wished the anchovies (which were really great) came with bread to balance out the saltiness\n2. The Pedro Ximenez was abit pricey for 100ml\n\nHad lunch here on a Friday afternoon. Friendly staff, food tastes amazing and very authentic! I\u2019ve been to Spain twice and glad to enjoy the same authentic taste here. I love the vibes and will definitely come back here again!\n\nthe food is absolutely divine!!! (especially the brussels sprouts & patatas bravas). short ribs were really tender so that was great. paella was alright for me personally. really liked that the tapas came really fast.\n\nthe cafe is really quaint and cute, love the design but because its size is rather small, the noise depending on the crowd can get quite deafening, inevitably affecting the atmosphere.\n",

The staff was incredibly friendly, making it a delightful meal from start to finish. Can't wait to go back and savor more of their delicious dishes!\n\nThe meat platters and lamb rack at this Greek gem are culinary masterpieces! Each bite is a flavor explosion, and the tenderness of the meats is truly impressive. The dips, a perfect accompaniment, add an extra layer of deliciousness to every dish. A must-try for anyone who appreciates top-notch Greek cuisine!\n\nVisited for the first time after hearing good reviews from friends. Awesome ambience and child-friendly. Helpful staff who helped us with food orders and wine recommendation. Dips were great, octopus tender and flavourful. Desserts were also delightful. The standout dish was the lamb chops!\n\nHad dinner some time last week and the food was pretty good but it was quite pricey. The waiter asked if we would like sparkling or still water and we thought still meant free tap water, but it turned out to be $10 bottled water. Don\u2019t make the same mistake as we did if you don\u2019t want to splurge on water!\n\nUnfortunately, we found a piece of stainless steel dish sponge in our food which is quite unhygienic and dangerous. The staff were kind enough to take it off our bill but this was a very eventful first experience dining here.\n\nWe had an excellent dinner here at Blu Kouzina. The food was delicious, staff very friendly and helpful, and the restaurant designed beautifully.\n\nWe shared the meat platter, kebab platter, 4 dip platter (tzatziki, hummus, red pepper, harissa), and kanafe. Everything we ordered was cooked to perfection and tasted amazing. Stand outs include the lamb chop and the red pepper dip.\n\nThe restaurant even served us a few drinks on the house!\n\nOverall a great dining experience and easy recommendation.\n\nWent to celebrate birthday with a few friends. The food and service were good. Only disappointment is that when we were leaving the place, the wine was actually not finished.  The staff could do better to confirm if we still want it before throwing the bottle away.\n",

Portions are very generous and good quality as well so you get what you pay for! Heads up, do not sit outside unless you want to be a buffet for the mosquitoes like us\ud83d\ude2d\n\nStaff was very friendly, food came on time, not too crowded on a late weekday evening.\n\nPizza was as expected, thin crusts are my favourite and the sauce spread was in appropriate amounts. Ordered the marinara pizza.\n\nRegretted the aglio olio, noodles were too thick, rather tough and garlic was overpowering everything else. Ravioli was right on point with the amount of sauce as well, generous serving.\n\nDesserts were nice\n\nBack in Singapore for a quick trip. Caught up with an old friend and we decided on one of Singapore's OG Italian restaurants.\n\nSoup and pasta were okay. Competent. Tasty enough... although my Carbonara was a tad salty and the sauce was just a bit too thick for my palette.\n\nWas looking forward to the Tiramisu... which was like the go-to hip dessert there during my youth long long time ago \ud83d\ude09 ... I was disappointed. The fingers were not well soaked... it was dry. The chocolate powder was overdone... that was an overdose. My memories were slightly tainted \ud83e\udd28\n\nWas there for dinner on a Sat evening with my family of 8 person. We took the inside table with aircon. The ambience is cosy and nice. The taste and quality of the pasta is generally good. The cream sauced pastas are really thick and rich and can be a little to jelak to finish. My Carbonaro is too salty for my liking, it could be due to to bacon in it. If I am not wrong, I think their they used fresh pasta. Price is of mid-high range. Overall we had a great time and enjoyed the dinner.\n",

The sourdough with smoked butter was really good. The bread was crispy on the outside and soft and warm inside. The butter was smooth and smoked well. The rest of the dishes were good too. The jamon was flavorful.\nThe staff offered us to move to their bar for drinks and we moved there once we settled the bill. The bar was cosy and comfortable. Love the vibe.\n\nA beautiful restaurant with excellent and attentive service from everyone. Nothing much to complain about the food, as bread lovers we the warm sourdough and smoked butter did stand out for us, that we ordered another half way into the service. Meat were all well cooked. We were hoping for a chocolate based dessert. The alternative of the interpretation of cafe con leche works well too.\n\nI had a fantastic end-to-end booking experience at this restaurant. The hostess was not only friendly but also very accommodating. The food was delightful and, as a pleasant touch, \"muy rico\" as they'd say in Spanish. Although I was initially suprised to find a limited cocktail menu. It didn't detract from the overall experience. Based on my visit, I've already recommended this establishment to a friend. I'm also looking forward to visiting another restaurant of theirs - Next Door Spanish Cafe, in the near future.\n\nThis is one of those in my todo visit place for a while. The food and service surpassed all our expectations. The sourdough bread may look normal but it is so crusty outside but soft inside. What is more amazing is the house smoked butter which is unlike anything we had before. We were recommended the charred cabbage which is so refreshing before the main dish which is the dry-aged beef rib. It is enough for 3-4 pax comfortably to have room for other dishes. We ended with Pina Colada and a scope of lemon sorbet. It\u2019s a memorable experience I must say.\n\nThe foods are alright but pricing is on the steep side. There is a speakeasy bar in the restaurant itself called 60ml. They make great cocktail and ambience there is much better:)\n",

Food is generally appealing to taste buds, staff comes across as friendly, what I really love is the interior aesthetics and vibes.\n\nCertainly interesting for an experience, but perhaps not a return visit, and the prices tend to be a little high.\n\nService excellence goes to Marivel and Aeron. We had a great dining experience because of them.\n\nFood was great too! Kudos to the Chef!!!\n\nI couldn't say anything bad for the ambience of the restaurant as it bring more effect to the experience.\n\nHere for the four-hands collaboration and got to try dishes of very different cuisines. Very friendly staff and delicious food! Weekend lunch seems slightly crowded do make a booking if you can! There's a beautiful outdoor area that is pet-friendly!\n\nNice cosy Asian fusion restaurant in the heart of Katong with stunning casual interiors. We came on a weekday evening, and only 3-4 tables were occupied.\n\nWe had red wine and decided to have it along with the following :\n\n1) Chilli Crab Cake - Nice crispy croquettes that pairs well with the chilli crab sauce.\n\n2) Rendang Lasagna - Nice rendang sauce, that is not too fiery. Mix it well with the cheesy lasagna and you have a winner.\n\n3) Salmon main served on a bed of mash potato, some noodles and veggies.\n\nAs a guest of Hotel Indigo, we enjoyed their breakfast buffet and room service. The breakfast was included with our room rate so we took advantage and the staff was helpful to point out the vegan options and made us a veggie currie and roti to go with the buffet, we were full and taken care of. The fruit was a bit bland and the cappuccino was a bit bitter, but overall good variety for breakfast and we were full for hours.\n\nThe room service came in clutch after being exhausted after a long day of walking and shopping. We ordered the Assam Curry Seabass, the Chap Chae, Sauteed veggies, and jasmine rice - we didn\u2019t venture into the fusion dishes and kept it simple. Everything was flavorful, especially the Sea Bass, and it arrived quickly and piping hot, totally satisfying!\n",

Beer pricy at S$14+\nOverall OK for one off visit, especially watching cricket, soccer matches in groups since they have multiple large screens.\n\nFood was ok, service was acceptable. At the beginning, I took a spoon of the butter chicken and found a food wrapper inside. Still, ate and didn't complain. Towards the end of the meal, at the last pc of my naan, I discovered a strand of hair stuck inside. I must be unlucky to see 2 inedible items in 1 meal. Still finished our meal, but not gonna return here again.\n\nHappened upon this great spot for lunch right next to the beach , we had the mexican fare and it didn\u2019t disappoint - tacos , nachos, pasta and pizza - all good. They have a huge menu for both mexican and indian cuisine , next time we will try the indian menu. Service was good and staff friendly. Will be back.\n\nService is really bad. The staff seem to ignore you and you have to call them multiple times to get your order/ food.\n\nLocation is superb. Food is ok. Price is quite high.\n\nBeing on the East Coast Park and one side facing the beach is an added value for this restaurant. Good ambience and if we sit out, view of the water will be clear. Food was average, okie okie taste. We ordered a mix of Mexican and Indian dishes, all turned out to ve average. Prices are maintained as per the location. Staff is very friendly and during weekends orders will be served with a delay due to good crowd and many orders. Overall it was a good experience.\n",

Service went above and beyond, would absolutely come back again :)\n\nWe were greeted by friendly staff when entering.\nOrdered some paella \ud83e\udd58 . Delicious.\nFood was amazing not pricey for restaurant. Spanish delights well served.\nDesert was cheesecake with whiskey ice cream.\nThe staff recommended food which were incredible.\nOverall experience 100/10\n\nI like the Beetroot with smoked olive oil sorbet. Stunning dishes. Paella is super nice as well. Good experiences. Very happening places. Price meet the service and dishes.\n\nI think this should be the best place to have Spanish food in Singapore - very delectable and original dishes. Loved the beetroot and strawberry salad in olive oil ice cream. Paella was also very flavourful. No regrets for a Tuesday weeknight dinner.\n\nLively atmosphere.   It\u2019s a bit noisy so if one will need to speak louder to your companions.  Been here for a few times and experienced seated on a table and counter.   I personally prefer the counter just because I can see what\u2019s happening at the kitchen and it was fun to watch.

However, after the renovation, the food standard dropped drastically during my recent visit. Although, the food place is relatively clean and pleasant since it\u2019s newly renovated.\n\nThe truffle cream chicken chop was overly cooked hence it was tougher, drier and chewier compared to most food stalls out there. In addition, the mushroom was of low quality similar to a processed can food in my opinion.\nHowever, their food portion is decent. The garlic bread is nicely toasted with a rich taste of garlic for garlic bread lovers.\n\nComparing the quality of food in the stall with the same pricing out there in the market, their  quality of food is substandard. As for the loaded mac and cheese, the macaroni tasted burnt and without much cheese taste.. moreover, the chicken taste was off. However, the pulled beef quality is normal and their portion is decent.\n\nOverall, I am disappointed with my recent visit back to the stall. I hope they can improve their standard of food quality where they can match up the quality of food with their pricing, and their cooking method can improve such as less burnt macaroni taste and the meat can be more tender.\n\nThank you.\n\nHad our dinner here.. Ordered the Chitpole Fried Chicken Burger and Aglio Olio Chicken Chop.. Burger is good but for the aglio olio, the garlic was burnt and the spaghetti had the burnt taste.. Unable to finished up the spaghetti due to the burnt taste..\n\nBeing one of only a handful of halal gourmet burger joints, as well as the owner being an ex- co-founder of Burgs by Project Warung, comparisons would be inevitable.\n\nI think the Smoky Pulled Brisket burger is slightly juicier & succulent as compared to Burgs\u2019 Pulled Beef burger. The beef strands feels a bit more charred also. The charcoal bun is soft and fluffy, which I personally prefer a more toasted/firmer grilled bun. On the overall, it\u2019s a pretty good burger.\n\nThe beef patty on the Ashes Smash Cheeseburger also seems tastier than Burg\u2019s Classic Cheeseburger.\n\nThe straight cut fries are crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.\n\nWell done Ashes Burnnit crew!\n\nAbove average for a kopitiam western food. Ordered it's truffle chicken chop, serving is more than average too. Worth to try. Worth to return.\n\nBeen seeing the review but yet to be able to drop by and test.\nWe couldn't avoid comparing their burgers vs burgs so we ordered crispy mushroom and pulled beef and ribs.\n\nTheir burger is bigger than burgs.\nTheir fries is coated fries like kfc , and thicker cuts.\nMushroom was good but their pulled beef is better than burgs.\n\nService was prompt and friendly. Order was ready within 5min of waiting.\n\nThe only drawback is that they are located in a small,  packed kopitiam which could be difficult to secure a table.\n",

Wide range of liquor to choose from.\n\nIt's one of the best bars I've been too. The vibe js just amazing with an amazing service !\nTry the sotomein(fish ball) it's to die for ..their chicken wings crispy on the outside succulent on the inside ! Their stir beef fry with wagyu beef is just so mouth wateringly juicy !\nDefinite visit if you are looking for a good drink and good food with a great atmosphere..\nOh almost forgot, you can get a bottle and come back later and use it ! Worth every penny spent...don't miss going here if you're in Singapore.\n\nThe Pork Ribs was tender and tasty. The Chicken Tikka Pizza was crispy and had generous amount of topping. This is probably one of the best pizzas I have ever tasted in Singapore (I do like the crust thin and crispy). Definitely a place to come back to.\n\nExcellent place to hang out. Got outdoor & indoor. Indoor no cigarettes smell at all. Lots of beers & liquor options. Their small bite snacks order come hot and freshly cooked. My boss favourite place to hang out. He had been coming to this place for years. The staff basically knows him!\n\nYesterday went for second round for his farewell party.\n\nIt was a full house but took some time to figure out why? Impossible burger -must try!\n\nIt was my first time over there.  I sow a lot of good reviews and etc.\nSo we decided to   check it out.\nIt was a full house so it took a moment. But of course,  that how most of the people are going to choose the place. Nobody likes  empty  pubs and etc.  So far so good.\nWe got a small standing table for two. And we got a menu in 2 min. I was a good start.\nNow its getting a bit more complicated.\nService.   The staff were friendly enough.\nThe first lady gave the menu and another lady took the order.  Her hands were occupied with a dirty plates so she didn\u2019t write the order. Maybe it wasn\u2019t the case, but nobody cares as long as the result will be satisfying .  But it usually goes with the order mess up as we were predicting.\nSo we ordered 4 glasses of wine,  onion rings, impossible burger and pasta to share.  It was a different waiter every time so I was actually wondering about the result.\nAnd yeah, it was some mistakes like a missing onion rings and 4 glasses became 6. But I do aware about quantity doesn\u2019t mean quality. So even if 10 people will take the order it will take some time to get the job done.  So just be ready to wait and etc. I was prepared.\nFood. Food was tasty. I did like the impossible burger  the most.  It reminded me the time when I wasn\u2019t a vegetarian yet  . Good job.\nDrinks. The house pour wine was a good one as well.\nThis place has some drink promotions and happy hours till 8.00 pm so you can check it out!\n\nOver all> well\n",

Reasonably priced for that area and most of their full time wait staff are quite attentive and friendly.\nOn weekends, when it gets busy, service standards might drop a bit.\nThey also serve Thai and North Indian cuisine.\n\nTiffin serves great value North Indian cuisines. Al Fresca dining at sunset, perfect for casual chill out dining.\n\nFun place in Katong, super vibrant and happening.\n\nRecommend: Thai Green Curry, Butter Chicken and Fries\n\nThe food is decent, service is very slow and drinks are okay. It\u2019s a casual dive bar experience. I would not recommend this place if you\u2019re going for an all out dining experience.\n\nPros\nAmbience - Super chill\nPrice - Reasonable\nFood - Asian/Contintental/Indian/American\n\nThe number of options to choose from is an advantage. However, nothing is extraordinary.\n\nNice place for casual dining. This is a combination of 4 places. They have pizzas and burgers, Indian, Thai.\n\nGood decor, open air and indoor seating. Great staff, friendly and sweet\n\nWe orders veg biryani and chicken pad see ew. Loved both, decent priced for the portion size\n\nVisited this place twice during my stay. Nice food, although the service was very slow.\n\nPros,\nGood prices\nGood Food\nCausal dining\n\nI would recommend the pizzas and the butter chicken set which came with rice and a naan and was very good value.\n\nLots of menus which means plenty of choice available, however the service was a bit of a let down as on one occasion, I ordered two pizzas which came 35 minutes apart.\n",

Huge menu and would definitely come back again with a bigger group to try other items on the menu.\n\nGood place for lunch in Siglap. Only 2 of us so didn\u2019t get to try the different dishes yet \u2026 so may have to come back. Noodles were quite good. Satay was OK \u2026 I prefer the Singaporean/Malaysian style more.\n\nFood quality was good with each dish well executed and reasonably generous portions. Service was friendly and prompt. Restaurant had a retro feel but a bit spartan. Pricing was reasonable - $100 (inclusive of service and GST) for 5 dishes which was very adequate for 5 diners. The reasonable pricing contributed to the 5 rating\n\nIt is a very nice place for dining with family and friends. Food were slightly on the saltier side, probably the dishes were catered to pair with white rice. We highly recommend the gong bao frog legs. The meat is substantial and comes with a lot of cashews. I am not a fan of pork but do give the satay a try! The meat is tender and marinated well.\n\nThe drinks were a little pricey (a real coconut juice cost $8.88 and the passionfruit soda comes with passionfruit syrup and not the real passionfruit seeds >_\n\nNoodle dishes like mie keriting were well executed, with springy noodles of good texture.  The roasts - roast pork belly, char siew were ok. Nasi campur was ok, not overly impressed as the roasts were similar to that of the noodles. Ngo hiang texture and taste left the impression that it was very processed, the texture more like that of fish cake rather than regular ngoh hiang. Fu yong hai was average. Service was friendly and responsive and ambience was nice.\n",

Prices are also very reasonable as compared to other Peranakan restaurants you may find elsewhere.\n\nThe place is a little hard to find but please do not let that deprive your family and yourself of the chance to enjoy delightful tasting Nonya food! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\n\nJust randomly chanced upon it and tried the curry chicken. I walloped it super fast \u2026 cos it was so darn tasty! Friendly lady boss and she was introducing me to her other dishes. For sure I\u2019ll be back to try them !!\n\nCharming place. We hardly get to see such a shop setup these days. Everything else is modernised and highly commercialised. But this shop still retains an old world charm\u2026 just like chilling out !\n\nA hidden gem for delicious peranakan food in Siglap. The nice owner gentleman was crooning away live at the oldies he recorded many years ago, right at our table while also chatting with us. Not crowded but not many seats available. I finished all the chicken curry sauce, to 2 bowls of rice. Katong Delights is a delight for a natural windy afternoon lunch.\n\nAt first glance you'd think it's someone's home and then when you walk in you'll realise it's setup half a restaurant and half a home. That's because the main business is actually catering and the owners had this setup to accommodate customers who wanted to dine in. Great taste and great variety, serves fast too. Not too spicy or salty. Homely feel. Hidden Peranakan Gem of Singapore. Would come again.\n\nA very nice peranakan eatery. Wanted to try their food many times but always not possible. Finally got an opportunity today as it was quiet in the afternoon. The setup is very home like so if you want a grand setup than you need to go somewhere else. The food is very tasty but you need to wait for a while as each dishes are prepared individually. When the food is served you will noticed that the long wait is all worth it. I will surely return for more from this eatery.\n",

Yummy and generous mushroom portion (please don\u2019t change this!)\n\nPizza no.3 (smoked salmon one) would probably match a white sauce base better but it tasted good nonetheless.\n\nCappuccino was not amazing but very decent. Gluten free lavender and citrus cake was very sweet but pretty nice after scraping off the syrup layer above.\n\nThe ambience takes the hat.\n\nOverall an enjoyable experience. :) I\u2019ll definitely return.\n\nOverall service and food were good. My Americano was a little flat, and they forgot to put in my scrambled eggs order with the cook, but the friendly service and good taste and quality well made up for it.\n\nWe're all human, and sometimes, mistakes happen. It's how does a particular establishment handle their mistakes, and this particular establishment handled it in a friendly and professional manner instead of blaming the customer due to a bruised ego, which is a common thing in the USA. It's nice to see an establishment own their mistake and offer a solution to rectify it.\n\nA quaint cafe in the spirit of halloween. The staff were dressed as pirates and it was swarmed with families with children after trick or treat. Despite that, service was fast. Was amazed the food was ready so quickly.  The food was alright. Nothing for me to say it was awesome. Plating was good. The sourdough pizza was soft and warm. I was actually amazed that it remained soft despite cooling down. The prawn. aglio olio was made with black pepper, garlic and some crushed pepper. Prawns were fresh. It wasn't dry. That was definitely a plus. Truffle fries were ok..I will definitely visit the place again\n\nAbsolutely enchanted by the beauty and serenity of Swan Lake, nestled perfectly amidst the vibrant East Coast suburb of Singapore. A stone's throw away, Opera Estate stands as an epitome of a delightful neighborhood. The store managed by the dynamic duo, Franklyn and Felix, is a testament to excellence and passion. Their wonderful team ensures every visit is memorable. Highly recommended!\n\nThe Pain au Levain here is one the best sourdough in Singapore up there with TBB and Providore, so are their croissants, tarts and cakes. I use air fryer to lightly toast breads for a minute and it\u2019s the perfect balance of crisp and chewiness. I have to declare that the Multigrain Croissant is the best Croissant I have ever had. It\u2019s my fav now. Ultimate shiok.\n\nBack again for the Spelt Sourdough loaf. It\u2019s too dense and hard. Not for me.\n",

Ella and Noelle were great hosts with good knowledge and made us feel comfortable. The food was well thought of, tasty and we could feel the creative passion of Chef Mint. We also appreciate their thoughtful gifts. Thank you.\n\nElla (our host) was super friendly & helpful! Noelle, Tian and her team were all very welcoming too\nOmakase 7-course meal was superb! Service was really fast and Ella was super helpful in explaining the dishes & ingredients!\nAtmosphere was chill & mysterious, even the toilet (red room) is really interesting \ud83d\udc40\n\nFurthermore, they ensure that you leave their place full!

Would like to give my thanks to Ella, Noelle and Chef Mint for the wonderful evening.\n\nWill be seeing you guys again soon! \ud83e\udee1\n\nChanced upon some word of mouth recommendation of this rather elusive private dining! I\u2019m glad The Lover and I followed our gut and made reservations!\n\nWe were enjoying every course of this Omakase and the surprising menu kept us guessing! The only thing we knew? It was gonna be good!\n\nI\u2019m not gonna spoil the surprises, but will let the pictures do the talking. It was absolutely lovely paired with some chilled, delicious palette cleansing teas. Every dish was lovingly prepared with attention to details\u2014 I\u2019m feeling the SOUL man!\n\nPremium produce at not so premium prices.

Service was impeccable, food is beyond our expectations! Hey, if my 80 yr old grandma love their food and the people behind it, it shows a lot of how much she truly enjoyed the experience. My photos don\u2019t do justice to the creations they made. You\u2019ve got to experience it to know what we mean when we say we love every dish and moment of it.\n",

However, the standout was the fish taco, boasting an excellent taste. On the downside, the seafood rice carried a strong, fishy scent, which might not appeal to those less inclined towards seafood. Overall, a mixed bag with moments of delight and areas for improvement.\n\nCherished and had a great experience.\nSo far, their dishes are quite good, and appetizing just we're came here for a shot.\nWell, as their service is acceptable and their prices are quite extravagant but it's fine that we're first time visited here. We're all as never before.\nThe atmosphere here is pleasing and tremendous.\n\nNice ambience with 2 drinks @ $23 depending on what you choose. We choose a beer and a wine.\n\nFor food, it all tasted awesome and we love the food. The only downside is the price which is a little steep for the portion of food presented.\n\nIf you ask me whether I will come again, I am sure I can find the same quality food with a lower price range.\n\nIt is a restaurant where the service is fast and the food is fantastic. It was a good experience having my dinner here.\n\nThrowback August 2023. As we had reserved our seats, we had the best view in the restaurant. Food was fresh and yummy. Very authentic Mexican cuisine and staffs were great with their service and even gave us a free ice cream churros with candle for my daughter\u2019s birthday. So memorable and beautiful place. We will be back soon\n\nEnjoyed our meal at Tonito@Jewel. Beautiful ambience with wonderful view of the Rain Vortex. Excellent service from the crew and especially Pei Min who took the time to chat and introduce each dish in detail.\n",

Largely pub-grub fare but everything was well prepared especially the prawn tacos & calamari. Food portions were sizeable too.\nOnly slight down side perhaps was the choice of music. But definitely worth another trip for food & ambience.\n\nChilled out place, took a ride out and stopped off for refreshment. Nice location. Chilled out hippy style bar/cafe. The rustic look with barrels and pallets as table base fits the mood but desperately impractical for any visitors with legs!\n\nDespite not being too busy, I thought I was eating my invisibility cloak and ended up going to get some service. I guess it\u2019s a chill-out mood setting and if you are in a hurry - wrong move! Not sure why my salad took so long. Was ok though in someways basic. The Caesar dressing seemed very \u2018supermarketty\u2019 but ok. Prices were tasty though and as always must take everything into context. A look at neighbouring tables and it doesn\u2019t look too bad at all - and don\u2019t get me wrong, mine was fine, could just have been spruced up with a better dressing and perhaps a few pine nuts - but now I\u2019m being picky. All in all - will be back if I get the chance, quite ok.\n\nAmazing place for food, drinks and music. Live band sang really well. Food was good, and not too expensive. Taste was great! Beer could be colder, but perhaps the heat was just too high this period. Good chilling place. Come in the evening, best!\n\nGreat place to eat after some wakeboarding or if you're in the area. Wagyu burger (medium rare) is to die for here and live music (I think nightly) makes it all even better. Would definitely recommend!\n",

All the dishes were so flavourful & delicious!\nSpecial shout-out to Martin, the manager, and his team for the attentive & great dining service provided. We really had an enjoyable time at the restaurant.\nThis is our first visit and it will definitely not our last! (:\n\nCame here with my husband and in laws for his birthday. We started off with the doubles and plantain nachos, then had the spiced lamb, jerk chicken and fisherman stew, all of which were excellent! All of us had cocktails to go with our meal, and the house lime punch was so yum. We have to commend the manager for his wonderful service.  while we did not inform the restaurant that it was my husband's birthday, he made it extra special by giving us a cocktail on the house and also made our desserts complimentary. Thank you very much for the lovely experience and we will be back for sure.\n\nThe fisherman\u2019s stew which came with rice and beans was the star of the night - the sauce was filled with seafood-y flavour and goodness. Will come back again just for this dish, and try other appetisers like the Mac and cheese balls. The other dishes we tried were quite decent too, like the BBQ pork ribs.\n\nFirst time trying jerk chicken after seeing it countless times online. Fair warning, it packs a punch! \ud83e\udd75 I ordered the Jerk Chicken Skewers and Fish Taco. The taco was drenched in a delicious sauce and I highly recommend ordering this even though it is slightly on the pricier side.\n\nWould love to return with friends and family since none of us have tried Caribbean cuisine before!\n\nExcellent selection of food! We had the nachos, curry goat with rice and spiced lamb. Every one of them was well-seasoned, leaving our stomachs feeling happy.\n\nAn area of improvement would definitely be the space- lighting was terrible for good photos. It looked a bit rundown, unless that was the effect they were going for.\n",

Would suggest this place for both couple dining and team dining. For desserts, expect for vanilla ice cream nothing else was available. Little disappointed that I could not try out the creme brulee :-(\nNachos was too good. Must try. Food was served hot and we all loved it.\n\nThe Troublemaker\n\nAl Capone's Sports Bar + Dining\n\ud83d\udccdKallang Wave Mall, 1 Stadium Pl, #01-15, 397628\n\n\ud83c\udf5c Food wise: For bar food, this was surprisingly good! Better than good actually. Each item on this dish was made perfectly, although it was saucy but it wasn\u2019t too greasy.\n\nThere was this lamb masala, thought to be an oily dish, but it wasn\u2019t! It was fragrant, well balanced flavour of spices and it came with soft and tender lamb! The meat also had the nice aroma of the spices, they were generous about it too! They came with crispy hot bread that one can dip into the sauce of the masala, delicious!\n\nThen there was nachos, so good! Nice and crispy, the nachos were well layered with the guacamole, cheese, and salsa, so refreshing!\n\nThere were also a variety of sausages, 4 different sausages, firm, soft, and tender, some more juicy and the other. Taste wise, they were not very salty, not very sure what was the difference in them though.\n\nThe salad was also tasty and refreshing, fresh, sweet, and appetizing!\n\n\u2728 Ambience wise: Great bar! Very cozy and serves delicious beers!\n\n\ud83e\udd35\ud83c\udffb Service wise: Great!\n\n\ud83d\udcb5 Price wise: $45.90\n\n\ud83e\udef5\ud83c\udffcWhere else will you recommend?\n\nShare with me in the comments below\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffc!\n\n\ud83e\udd17Remember to follow me to see what can make you hungry!\n\nI hardly complain about stuff but i think the establishment needs to improve.\n\nWe waited quite a while for your meal to be served, while the others who came after us were served first\n\nThe lamb shank is such a disappointment! Unfortunately, it didnt make its mark. For the many lamb shanks i have eaten, this one had ONE slice of carrot and ONE slice of garlic bread. The whole dish tasted like it was bought from the wholesaler and heated up over the stove.  Sticking some rosemary and a chilli padi will not add any flavours. Huge disappointment \ud83d\ude44\n\nThe sea bass came much later and by the time it did, the lamb shank turned lukewarm. We requested for roasted vegetables instead of mash potatoes and were told that they can't do so. At least the bass was fresh, but nothing to scream about.\n\nWhen we aaked for more warm water, we were told they already gave us a complimentary glass and had to pay $1 if we wanted more. Hmmm I would imagine that the establishment had already factored these costs into its pricing... Anywayzzz\n\nI doubt we will be back again. We only went in because there werr seata and the other places we wanted to go had really long queues.\n\nWe came here with a big group after a great CrossFit workout at CrossFit Unit in the same building. I only took one for which is my Bangers and Mash but the group ordered all kings of food. The portions are very generous and worthy the price and can be for sharing. We also tried the wings, fish and chips and pasta. All were good.\n\nFood is goods and so are the beer taps. Have Guinness on the tap and have the rest of the team having beers and 1 bottle of whiskey. Food selections are a lot, and the same goes for alcohol selections. The only issue is short-handed and take some time for things to come.  Highly recommend on the platters and the fried chicken in the bucket.\n",

I still prefer the sanbei claypot chicken I had at another branch, but the fish was also good.\n\nUpdate: Decided to drop to 4 Stars after my 2nd visit.\n\n2nd visit:\nWent with my gfs to this outlet yesterday. Most of us ordered their set dinner menu which comes with main course & tea set - $15.90. Or, you can change your drink with an add-on of $3.80.\n\nThe consensus among my gfs and I is that although the price for the dinner sets are good, the quality of their mains needs improvement. My Mee Sua was way too salty. The fried salted chicken that came with my Mee Sua was quite tasty. The hot tea & drinks were also really good.\n\nAlthough the restaurant wasn\u2019t too crowded, the senior staff attending to us was quite impatient. I was trying to pay for the bill through my phone, and realised that the only way we can get the $5 discount is by signing up as a member.\n\nThe way the senior staff attended to my queries wasn\u2019t too professional. After I signed up as a member, our mobile order disappeared from my phone. She then came over to take our orders manually, and seemed impatient when doing so.\n\nI was very mindful that we keep to their opening hours, and asked the staff politely what time they close.\n\nWhen the same senior staff replied, she emphasised that it\u2019s 9.45pm quite loudly. I think the way she replied is quite uncalled for. She could have just given a neutral reply.\n\nAlthough I love their desserts, I am not sure whether I\u2019ll return to this outlet after the unpleasant experience.\n\n1st visit:\nMy lucky day! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 I had the restaurant all to myself for about 2 hours on a weekday late afternoon.\n\nFirst time at this eatery. Frankly, what caught my eye was the pretty interior with the huge Turquoise (my fav colour) Ceiling Centrepiece.\n\nI needed a comfy place to have some happy food (aka desserts \ud83d\ude02) & do some work. I asked the staff if I could sit at the big table at the back of the restaurant.\n\nThe staff told me that it\u2019s meant for big groups, but kindly obliged me with my request. That made me happy!\n\nWhat made me even happier was that the dessert that I ordered - Souffle Stackers with Honeycomb Ice Cream - was super yummy! I also ordered a decaf lemongrass tea as I was feeling a bit guilty eating the huge portion of dessert \u263a\ufe0f\n\nI had a good time at this eatery, and I managed to get my work done. It would have been great if the restaurant has wifi. I had to use my personal hotspot to do work on my laptop.\n\nI\u2019ll definitely be back at this outlet or their other outlets to try their other foods.\n\nOrdered a $6.90 small pot of tea and I was told the refill can only be once. I wonder how much does it cost for the tea leaves!?\nThe souffl\u00e9 pancakes are not bad, but the rest are not worth the $.\n\nStaffs are very friendly, very attentive on every table. Food are well-prepared, season and tasteful. Environment was also very nice.\n\nWe wanted to try the food typhoon cafe for quite some time and we are happy we finally tried the food here. The items we ordered were close to the taste we had in Taiwan! Dessert looks and tastes awesome! Staff service was excellent! We are sure to come back again!\n",

Likely to get crowded at night.\n\nIt\u2019s my first time in Singapore and this restaurant did not disappoint. The food is so tasty, the staffs are friendly. We met the owner and he\u2019s so accommodating. There is also a live band at night. CANT WAIT TO GO BACK!\n\nFood was ordinary. Ordered something but something else came. The staff was too busy and it was too loud so we ate it anyway. The staffs were disrespectful and not very accommodating. We told them that the booking was for 2 but they wrote it as 3 and gave us a table and kept on telling us to move to allow walk in customers and last minute booking customers. However, the atmosphere was fun and the singers made our night. Not sure if I\u2019d go back again though.\n\nWas a wonderful experience on Wednesday at Rocking Rickshaw! Amazed that as busy as it was, the waiter still had a smile on his face and tried his best to get our food and drinks to us fast! Food was very good and of course prices are more than competitive. Definitely a highly recommended place for a night of food and drinks plus the live band was great!\n\nWe won\u2019t be frequenting your establishment any longer. The absence of a bouncer or security became a significant concern for us, as we, a group of ladies, had to fend off numerous intoxicated individuals, disrupting our right to enjoy our time. The limited space also seems to attract unwarranted attention, and when we sought assistance from a waiter, he appeared preoccupied with dancing rather than addressing our concerns. Unfortunately, this experience has led us to the decision of not returning.\n",

While also offering limited Dim Sum options, the dishes are surprisingly tasty and won't break the bank.\n\nThe fried noodles outshine the fried rice, both enjoyable nonetheless. Fresh seafood is a highlight, with reasonable prices compared to other seafood establishments. Service may be a bit stretched thin at times, but the quality compensates.\n\nThe Bamboom Clams at $9.90 each are a standout \u2013 huge, fresh, and impeccably cooked with garlic and rice noodles.\n\nThe Hairy Crab, deshelled upon request, offers a convenient and tasty experience, although the $68 price tag might be steep for some.\n\nThe Boston Lobster, originally baked with cheese, transforms with my request to be cooked with minced garlic and vermicelli \u2013 a must-try modification.\n\nWhile it may not be perfect, this spot is an excellent choice for a satisfying lunch or special occasions in the area. The fresh seafood and surprising twists make it a memorable dining experience.\n\nI was in a dilemma... should I gate keep this place or write this review. Decide not to be selfish. Lol! I visited this place 3 times. Twice for dinner and once for lunch. The seafood and dim sum are so fresh and value for money. My family used to patronise a seafood restaurant in the west but the prices have been increasing. Yet, the quality of seafood we had on the last 2 occasions there was disappointing. So, when we found Ji Xian, we decided this will be our go-to place for seafood! However, do not expect much from the service nor the ambience. Enjoy!\n\nSeats a bit squeeze. Food taste is good Cantonese style. Serving seem to have shrunk. Service wise is still good. Helps if you know Cantonese.atmosphere old school type of restaurant. But highly recommended for Cantonese food.  Good and nice dim sum too.\n\nFirst time eating in this resturant. Started with some dim sum, love the chicken feet cos its so peppery \ud83d\ude0b Actually not a bad place to eat dim sum! Had the Geoduck sashimi, haven\u2019t had this for so long since hong kong. Slight crunchy texture, really individual preference but I quite like it. Bamboo clams, braised lobster noodles, veg with pork lard, fresh steamed fish etc all so good! Will definitely be back to try more of other dishes!\n\nCame over for dim sum lunch on a Saturday. Ordered their signature dishes, mainly dim sum. Firstly, quite impressed by the variety especially live seafood and the affordable prices. Ambience is like a friendly neighborhood restaurant with a cozy atmosphere. Foodwise is OK, pretty average, slightly better than those foodcourt standards. Portions and pricing are good so making it value for money. Service was prompt and efficient. Really wanted to try their live seafood next time. Anyway, really enjoyed the dining experience.\n",

My friend had the goat curry. I had the fish curry. Both were spicy but flavorful. The plantain chips are hot and crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. The coffee was amazing, presentation and taste.\n\nWe had a wonderful dining experience at this restaurant. The standout feature was their incredibly welcoming, friendly, and attentive service. The staff patiently recommended dishes and even showed photos of them when we needed assistance.\n\nWe ordered the peanut chicken stew and goat curry, both of which were absolutely delightful. The flavors were well-balanced with just the right amount of spice and heat, and there was no gamy taste from the goat meat.\n\nThe cocktails were also a hit, and the evening was rounded off with delicious desserts. The overall ambiance was cozy and inviting, making it a perfect setting for a memorable evening.\n\nWe'll definitely be returning, and I can wholeheartedly recommend this restaurant to friends. It's a gem worth visiting again and again.\n\nWent there for dinner and I had cauliflower and buttermilk fried chicken for starters and the portion is pretty generous. Absolutely love both of it. Got the fish curry too and it was amazing tho pretty spicy. However we didn't enjoy the Malindi Halwa dessert so much with it's jelly-like texture. Service is really top notch as they were always attentive.\n\nIt\u2019s my first time trying Africa\u2019s cuisine, and I\u2019m pleasantly impressed with the food.\n\nWe ordered a variety of curry based dishes, with different level of spiciness - and we enjoyed all of them.\n\nHighly recommended the Goat Curry, where in our opinion is the best one there.\n\nGreat ambience and fantastic customer service from the staff. Our waiter spent time to recommend us the dishes. The food is definitely on the pricier side and it felt that it might have been adjusted so much to suit the local palate that the food does not feel uniquely african. When the food tastes very similar to local dishes, it does not really justify the high price.\n",

I think the quality of the food has come down recently.\n\nOrdered flower crab paofan ($38) and prawn paste chicken ($12). Good tasting broth for paofan and generous amount of chicken for chicken.\n\nSome downside is the seafood ingredients are not fresh, prawn is so rubbery. Also very costly at $38. Good to try but don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be back soon as I think they\u2019re many paofan that are cheaper with better ingredients in the food scene now.\n\nDespite the good reviews, unfortunately, not for me. The Ginseng Chicken Claypot taste more of wine than ginseng. The Pork Ribs is total disaster, the waiter pour white spirit and lights up before serving. He doesn\u2019t check if the fire burned off the spirit. Imagine you could taste the heavily liquor pork. Vegetables & Tou Fu are normal.\nService is below average.\nPrice is not cheap as the area is not consider a prime area.\n\nTaste: 8/10 Chicken breast is slightly dry but otherwise the flavour is pretty alright. Mild ginseng taste. Love the variety of mushrooms in it!\n\nCost: $38 (3-4 pax)\n\nWaiting time: 10 mins on Saturday 1230pm\n\nOverall: Will come back to try the flower crab paofan\n\nTried the Ginseng Chicken Pao Fan. Love the combination of egg rice and broth. Portion was huge with lots of ingredients. Chicken was very well done and fall-off-the-bone tender. Would definitely come back again to try the other dishes.\n",

The floor staff attend to you immediately and ensure the food served are hot. Unfortunately, there were some mishaps with the food served. When informed, it was immediately rectified and a new dish was served. I am very impressed with the service and the quality of food. Kudos.\n\nYummy food but I think they need more staff for the weekends. Hard to get their attention especially for water refill. Can\u2019t blame them as there\u2019s only two of them managing everything. Might want to consider self-service for the water though.\n\nUPDATE:\nWent back again and now they don\u2019t even serve tap water but charge for bottled water at $6? Not sure if I will revisit.\n\nWe were there on a weekend for a late lunch. The place was very empty. We were ushered in quite quickly, but when we wanted to place an order, we waited quite a while to be able to get someone's attention.\n3 out 4 items we wanted to order were not available, but we were not informed when we sat down, hence very disappointed. They also have a pasta menu that is not available for weekends too..\nFood came quite fast, but the plates have very disgusting dirty and wet cotton string wrapped handles. I cannot imagine anyone's hand touching that and then touching the fries or wrap. Mocktail was a glass of diabetes, 15% to 20% syrup, coloring and milk. The orange cake was a miss too. It tasted like tapioca kueh.\n\nWe had a comfortable good time on a rainy Sunday evening, eve of PH, at Ela (Bukit Batok)! Our favourite dish was actually 'Keto' with Pulled Beef - the cauliflower rice was very well done with a generous portion of pulled beef! #mustry\nWe would like to do a special shout out to the one and only floor staff that night, Yani! She was like a wonderwoman, running the floor service alone, serving at least 5-6 tables of guests professionally - from bringing guests to tables, to taking orders, clearing tables, making drinks, serving the dishes etc.! Mad respect! Thank you for being so attentive and patient with your warm services! Will be back at the new outlet to try other items soon too! \ud83e\udd73\n\nIt was so cozy and absolutely loved the vibes. The food was exceptional and the service was great.\n\nThe smell of the pita was sooo good and the pita on my lamb was soaked with flavor. Tho you may want to note that lamb generally has a strong smell/taste. My suggestion is to maybe elevate their dessert as the cake tasted like any ordinary lemon pound cake with an ice cream scoop on top. Wish there were smtg more special.\nhonestly would come here again.\n",

Not tasty, too salty, the ketchup sauce tastes so much better.\n\nAs much as I enjoy the staffs mingling and enjoying their work, but the chefs were talking a tad too loudly.\n\nYummy food, big portion. A variety of sauces like ketchup, garlic, herb and those with different level of spiciness.\n\nHad the Tuesday deal which is Chicken Pita bread (buy 1 and get another for 50% discount) including 2 sides each. Added a pineapple ring for additional $1.\n\nRecommends also the quarter chicken. Free flow water provided! However the water tasted weird so 1 star less.\n\nmy experience there was amazing. i love the food and how nice the people are over there. personally, although it is a little pricy, the wild herb sauce there made me love the food but the amazing service there made my experience even better. you should definitely go down and experience it for yourself!\n\nOne of the better Nandos outlet in Singapore. Service is fast and friendly despite it being a peak hour lunch. Food came hot and relatively fast. Get up to 25% off if you\u2019re an NSF with 11B. Good atmosphere. Nandos, pls open up an outlet in the North!!\n\nNando\u2019s is well known for their peri peri chicken, we had boneless thigh and chicken breast, they are both cooked very well and tender. Love the sides too. Quality of food is fantastic, just the quantity has reduced quite a lot. The restaurant is very beautifully decorated as you can see from the pictures. Service was also great. However we feel a bit warm in the restaurant, seems the aircon is not too strong. Got to order and pay for the food online before the order is placed. Cutlery and sauces and side plates are all self service at a corner counter. Will be great if they operate like a normal restaurant instead of having to order and pay online and take cutleries on our own.\n",

Everything is self service but easily navigable.\nLimited menu but yummy and fresh\nFood was served colder than usual which used to be piping hot. A not fancy but good for a simple non fussy meal\n\nGood food at good price. There is always a queue here during meal hours. Popular place for the young & elderly, even for people who ate not here to shop for furnitures. The all time favourites are the Swedish meatball, fried chicken wings. They offer special items from time to time like Mala crayfish, baked chicken with curry sauce, black pepper pork chop etc.\n\nGreat, tasty food for sharing at affordable prices, though it can get very crowded and queues can be long. Recommended to go during weekdays or non-peak dining hours to secure seats and have a less bustling environment.\n\nNeedless to say much more about this iconic eatery. Visited again after a long while to buy furniture and have lunch there. The chicken wings and meatball are still tasty like I rmb. Tried their salmon dishes which are decently priced given the ingredients inflation. Cheese cake is super smooth. Very value for money. Minus point is the crowds\n\nClassic meatballs are delicious as usual. Pork ribs were also juicy and tender at affordable prices. However, they were clearly under staffed as each staff has to manage a food section on their own. They also looked frustrated and overworked, which led to them snapping at some customers. The ordering was also slightly confusing as peole could order differently but the price for some meals were not stated upfront.\n",

Highly recommended for those that are looking for brunch menus that are not generic (like your eggs benedict, pancakes, etc). Also their plating was on point and the ingredients were super fresh & well prepped. I will definitely come back again.\n\nSmall cosy joint that serves excellent Scandinavian food. Though menu is limited yet the curated specialities are made with such excellent culinary standards. Enjoyed the shrimp toast and fish stew so much, we practically wanted to wipe the utensils dry. Love the simplistic clean look of the place and inviting ambience. Will surely return to try the other things on the menu.\n\nCosy, relaxed little cafe serving Nordic style toast with some amazing toppings. Just the one vegetarian toast option which was the mushroom so tried that with the bean side salad. Both really fresh and tasty. Also had a delicious herbal tea. The staff were very friendly and took a lot of pride in the venue and food. My friend had the seafood stew which looked generous and she really enjoyed it. Worth a try\n\nDelicious open faced sandwiches in a beautiful, unpretentious and welcoming space staffed with warm family vibes! The potatoes were great as well and the tomato with fennel seed soup is a winner. The level of detail in the tableware and decor is admirable too. 10/10 will come back!\n\nThis is a cool little spot for having simple but delicious Scandinavian food! I especially loved the bread that came with the fish stew. The meatballs, too, are certainly not your run-of-the-mill IKEA meatballs!\n\nIt would be nice, however, if there could be stricter rules against people bumming a 4-person table by themselves, with a laptop, during lunch hour, with nothing but a glass of water.\n",

However there isn't good ventilation and it does become stuffy.\n\nOne of my top three hawker centers for the food and ambiance. Wide range of food options from leicha and caifan to Penang and SG-style laksa. Also parata options, chicken and duck rice, soba, and more. It\u2019s also spread out so the breeze gets through. there\u2019s ample seating at 11-1230pm on a Sunday. It\u2019s well lit so you don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re eating in a dungeon. Extra points for being close to ikea\n\nABC BRICKWORKS, a heartland hawker center. Open all day - Chinese India Malay food. Have a reasonable good food to try. Today manage to try THE MEEPORK - the minced soba was great (see photo) and JASON PENANG - the char kway teow ( the light ) was excellent, Penang laksa was good too. There are still plenty to try on my next visit.\n\nThe claypot chicken rice ( Yuan Yuan ) was so satisfying ! Rice was soft, drizzled with black sauce brought to mix round with all the ingredients. Chinese sausage not hard, chicken tender and not overly dry, and bits of salted fish just nice for the portion and not an overkill. Veg can be a little bit more but it\u2019s not a deal breaker :) love it when it is served piping hot and warm all the way to the end digging the burnt rice crusts out from the sides of the pot. Maybe I don\u2019t eat claypot rice for a long time so the experience may sound a bit exaggerated.   The or jian ( oyster omelette) just a few doors away on same row was nice and crispy that put a smile to my face when I crunched the omelette bits in my mouth combined with the oysters oozing. Oysters were of good size - not too big. It too small.  Ended with iced Ching Tng  with generous ingredients! Impressed ! Uncle has a cheerful demeanour too ;) .\n\nA place with good and tasty food from Chinese, Malay and Indian hawkers.\n",

The smoky, tender and juicy chicken was great on its own even without the gravy (though it would have been nice if the sauce was slightly saltier). Fries was crisp and piping hot, while the tanginess of the coleslaw was perfect.\n\nMy only gripe was there was too many tendons in the chicken chop, disrupting the overall eating experience. It would also be good if customers are given the flexibility to select their own side dishes, instead of sticking to the usual fries and coleslaw.\n\nI ordered a sirloin steak, medium rare.\n\nThe cut was a bit dry and less seasoned to my liking.\n\nI have yet to try the rest of the dishes. I hope my dining experience can be better refined the next round.\n\nFor the price of $13.50, there was definitely some expectations plus i actually tried since I seen xiaxue raving about it. I reached around 6pm and there was only 1 staff. He was busy frying stuff for the western food options and took my order for noodles while informing that I had to wait for a while. I was damn annoyed when he took my order as he kept frowning. The best part is he frowned again when I requested for no meatball and guess what? Check the photo \ud83d\ude02 he was the same guy who made my noodles but I think he may not be supposed to be the one, maybe he just took over cos his colleague was not there... Anyway, scallop is not fresh, fishball is standard factory made type, soup is a weird diluted msg taste, soft shell crab was hot but batter is very thick, and noodle texture is poor. I would say if you really like bak chor mee (No. 25), go to next block 161 stall during day time the young couple makes amazing bcm you won't regret.\n\nWent over on Saturday night, no queue. Had Aglio Olio Meepok with grilled chicken and Carbonara with grilled chicken. First mouthful Aglio was better but the Carbonara grew on me. Aglio Olio looks like Indomie but doesnt taste like it. Chicken was tender but like that lor. The star for the hubby was the Mashed Potato, apparently inspired by Joel Robuchon? Place also sells mee pok hahaha\n\nWow. Honestly did not expect finding this gem in this coffee shop. Best combo is to get the crab tobiko pasta and add on the chicken chop. If you\u2019re going with friends, get the seaweed fries to share. I didn\u2019t like the mentaiko fries as much cos I felt there was more mayonnaise than usual, but my companions liked it. Truffle mushroom soup was not as viscous as I would like it but overall still tasted better than most mushroom soups out there. Overall a really good place to try! Will definitely be back\n",

Nice hangout place if you wanna have yakinuku and beer at night. In the day, wanton mee and liver bak chor mee are good choices.\n\nRong Fa Bak Chor mee: If you love pork liver, or just lots of ingredients in yummy soup accompanied by al dente noodles, this is the place! The liver served is in HUGE chunks, and lightly blanched, so it is tender and melts in your mouth. So much ingredients in the soup too... 2 meatballs, 1 fishball, fishcake slices, sliced taupok, chunks of minced meat... The noodles are well-cooked and seasoned too. If you order the double balls soup, you get a range of fish balls and meatballs with fillings.\n\nOnly downside is the wait. We went at about 1.30 and waited for about half hour. Fortunately, it was worth the wait and we were not in a rush.\n\nWorth the price we paid, which was a total of $13.\n\nTasted the wanton mee and minced pork noodles, waiting time for for mee pok was 45 min for a non busy day. Wanton mee char siew is nice!\n\nBunch of variety of food stalls hiding inside this industrial canteen slash beer garden. There is thai, vietnamese, western, bachormee, japanese don, chicken rice. Quite varied options to try, however location is a bit obscure. Food was generally good and tasted above averahe for it's price point.\n\nNice place for beer. They have draft and bottles beer. Only 4 stalls are open on weekday nights.\nTried the thai food. Ordered the egg, fried rice and noodles. All was good except fried rice was salty.\nWestern food was nice , tasty and priced reasonable.\n\nExcellent selection of affordable beer on tap served in chilled glasses. Only $8.80-10 a pint. Happy Hour from as early as 7.30am (yes, morning!) till closing, every day. Even credit card payment was available.\n\nFood stalls seem to have a rather high turnover rate. Currently, there are stalls selling Thai, Japanese, Vietnamese, Ipoh cuisine, Grilled lamb, Western and Bak Chor Mee. However, there is nothing much left to eat after 8pm except for mookata.\n",

Coffee is not your usual kind of coffee but more to western taste so some might like it.\n\nIt's overpriced at 4.30 for a set (because no butter), but maybe because of the coffee.\n\nCame here for lunch during weekday on several consecutive days. They have a good variety of rice, noodles, vegetarian food available. Tried their vegetarian store, chicken rice store and Yong Tau foo store. Prices are affordable and food tasty. Can get quite crowded during lunchtime due to nearby office crowd. Please continue the great work. \ud83d\ude4f\n\n1) 2 fried kway teow stalls, both equally good.\n2) The cheong fun stall has vegetable fillings or 3 other fillings (e.g. char siew). Good.\n3) The dessert stalls has a variety of hot / cold desserts. The bubor cha cha & chendol are highly recommended. \ud83d\udc4d\n4) The chinese pancakes stall has the usual peanut filling, red bean, coconut & peanut jelly ones.\nUsually sold out by 2 pm.\n\nNice Food  Center with numerous stalls at affordable price. A bit warm.\n\n02-26 Yong-tau-foo stall (see pic). Lady seller is super friendly and serve with a smile. Very Hygiene way of keeping the yong-tau-foo items in enclosed cabinet for selection! Price is super good in the midst of today's high food inflation (display on stall signboard). Variety of items good enough for most patrons. Laksa & Tom Yam soup is good.

Especially when it is hot. The marinade is savoury and fragrant. If you like fattier cuts, I recommended to request for \"fatty char siew (\u80a5\u53c9\u70e7)\" The thick and warm gravy rehydrates the grainy white rice and coats, each spoonful with meaty goodness.\n\nLike all chefs who place their heart into their cooking, emotions play a huge part in our daily life. A few times, the quality of the portion and cuts are not very consistent when the staff are in a bad mood \ud83e\udee3 The lean meat portions are slightly tough at times, and the marinade is not very infused. But those are like.. 15% of the chances out of all the times ordered.\n\nIf you need to find a plate of good char siew rice to satisfy your craving, this is the place to be. The lightly charred surface with the tender meat is much desired. Even the rice quality is good, which I think is very important as it compliments the char siew with every bite I take. Do try.\n\nThey have one of the best char siew around. The food is generally very good and I like their sausage.\n\nThe secret is also in their unique sauce.\n\nWould have given a 5 star but my current visit when ordering a plate of rice with 3 meat cost close to SGD10. I have ordered such combi before and it was never this expensive.\n\nIt\u2019s been quite a few years since I last had the wanton mee here and was glad to have it for lunch today as I was in the area. At $4 a plate, it\u2019s very reasonably priced given the portion size. The charsiew is as good as I remember it to be and the noodles were also of a really next texture\n",

Soy sauce chicken\n5. Balonglong juice and avocado shake\n6. Prawn mee\n7. Muffins\n\nThere has been a general revamp and change in stalls.

Always spoilt for choice when I come here. It gets crowded and bloody hot during lunch hour, though.\n\nVery good food court...great choice and great taste with all dishes Asia can offer, at reasonable prices...go where the locals would go\n\nPatronized this \u53e4\u65e9\u5473Big Prawn Noodle Stall in Alexandra Village Food Centre. It was 3pm, hence no crowd in the Hawker Centre.\nI was second in queue. Ordered a Pig\u2019s Tail Prawn Noodle and another Pork Ribs Prawn Noodle. Our orders were served within 5 minutes, self collect.\nI was a little disappointed when the orders were collected - the two bowls of Prawn Noodles did not appear like those in their photo displays.\n\nIn the Pork Rib Prawn Noodle, the prawn were pretty small - 4 halves small prawns deshelled without prawn heads but with the tails attached. Two pieces of pork bone chunks instead of pork ribs and four slices of lean pork. One miserable strand of vegetable.\n\nFor the Pig\u2019s Tail Prawn Noodle, the prawn serving, lean pork and vegetable servings were similar. There were 4 pieces of pig\u2019s tail.\n\nHowever, we must say the prawn soup was really good. The pork bone chunks were well seasoned and texture were nice. The lean pork slices were quite tender. And oh\u2026the pig\u2019s tails were really soft and the skin and meat slide off the bones easily.\n\nBesides \u201cfeeling deceived\u201d by the photo displays and the small sizes of prawn, the servings were reasonably sized and the meals tasted good overall. $6 for each bowl of noodle was reasonable.\n\nRelatively cheap place to eat with lots of options. Went here around 10am and it wasn't crowded. The place is clean and food was served quickly.\n",

The hawker centre us a little run down and could definitely do with some upgrades. It is also not easy to find parking especially during peak hours and weekends\n\nGreat old school hawker centre. Enjoyed the NaNa Curry. Spicy but tasted good. Hokkien mee was also tasty with bits of fried pork crackers on top and mixed with into the noodles. It was hot in the afternoon but will go there again.\n\nNow this is the real deal. With a plethora of options, I stumbled upon fantastic selections at incredibly reasonable prices. Situated in a bustling location, it exudes a wealth of character that makes the visit absolutely worthwhile.\n\nThis hawker center (recently renovated in Nov 2022) caters mostly to the breakfast and lunch crowd and come dinner time, many stalls are closed or their food sold out by 7.30pm+.\n\nOne notable and nondescript exception is the Vietnamese Cooked Food stall located at the corner of the hawker center (next to the Modern Old School coffee stall) and facing the carpark.\n\nThis is a one-lady operation helmed by a hardworking Vietnamese lady, Ann who speaks Mandarin, English and some dialects. For carbo eaters, check out the Ribs with Rice (Com Suon) (generous rice portion!) and Bahn Mi (bread). They are both delectable and very filling even for those who feel Vietnamese food are light. Many customers, especially the ladies, are seen ordering the Pho with Beef and Noodle Soup.\n\nThe stall operates from 10.30am-10pm. Something to consider if you are coming here for a late dinner, or wish to skip the lunchtime crowd at the other popular stalls. At 9pm+, most stalls, except the drinks stalls,  at the hawker center would be closed. Paynow and Paylah are available.\n\nA Huge hawker center with many stalls some a few with Michelin Bib.  Nice airy and clean environment with ample parking around the hawker.\n",

                  "reviews": "\n\nHidden Gem Unearthed - Redhill Food Centre Singapore! \ud83c\udf72\u2728\n\nAmidst the bustling city, I stumbled upon a culinary oasis at Redhill Food Centre. This unassuming hawker centre revealed a hidden gem - a delightful $1.5 chicken rice with a mouthwatering taste of soup. The flavors danced on my palate, leaving me pleasantly surprised by the incredible value and authentic taste.\n\nRedhill Food Centre is a treasure trove of local delights, where passionate hawkers craft affordable and delicious dishes that satisfy both the stomach and the soul. A true haven for foodies seeking a taste of Singapore's gastronomic delights without breaking the bank.\n\n\u2022Bak Kee Satay BeeHun\n\nI recently had the pleasure of trying \"Bak Kee Satay BeeHun\", and I must say, it left me thoroughly satisfied. The star of the dish was undoubtedly the satay sauce, which perfectly complemented the noodles. The rich and creamy satay sauce had just the right balance of sweetness and spiciness, creating a harmonious flavor explosion, which I find it very creative.\n\nThe noodles, accompanied by tender squid, succulent pork liver, and thinly sliced pork meat, were a delightful addition. The variety of textures and flavors added depth to each bite, making it a truly memorable experience.\n\nOne word of advice to fellow food enthusiasts: devour this dish quickly! The noodles have a tendency to soak up the flavors, and while that might sound tempting, it's best enjoyed when the noodles are still slightly firm.\n\n\u2022Fried Oyster\n\nOut of so many dishes the stall offered, I would recommend their Fried Oyster, non-greasy, and the oyster was just cooked right. Not too raw or not too cooked.\n\nChar Kuey Teow was just so.. so only in my opinion, and nothing to shout for.\n\nLittle do you know:\nThe difference between fried carrot cake black or white are not only the colour of the sauce itself, but also the taste. To all tourist, remember to choose the white instead as that's what local Singaporean will choose. If you are curious with the black sauce, it tends to be sweeter if you like it.\n\nOne of my go to Hawker for breakfast, lunch probably not recommended for dinner.\nPrata, duck noodles, Chee Cheong Fun, Nasi Briayani, chicken rice, curry rice, bread and toast, soya beans, soft boiled eggs. What you name it, will definitely full-fill your 90% of your choice.\nPrices might not be as economical as you thoughts, but it won\u2019t be rocket high. Saturday & Sunday are packed, avoid peak hours.\nEnjoy!\n\nGood variety of food stalls here. Been here thrice but so far all the stalls I have tried are good. Only tried the pancake this time which I personally like for the crunchiness as well as softness and non-dryness (if this is the right way to describe it).\nWould update next time upon visiting\n\nHere to mention that this dessert stall\u2019s chendol is weird. Taste more like ice kacang. Forgot to snap photo of my tau suan, but they are good \ud83d\udc4d at tau suan.\n",

They don't play loud music either.\n\nWill try their pastries next time!\n\nParking is within the building, though the lots are strangely laid out.\n\nEasily accessible by car, parking places available downstairs.\n\nPastries selection limited when we were there. ( left with one choice)\n\nTruffle brie mushroom pastry was not bad. Mocha was not bad. Comfy seats. Nice vibes. Water served by friendly staff.\n\nA hidden gem in an industrial building. Love the decor and ambiance. Great place to chill out over great coffee. Love the coffee so much that we purchased some beans to enjoy at home.\n\nA proper coffee haven in an area you least expect it. But once you enter the cafe, you know it takes its coffee seriously with all the pro gear, experienced barista and beans/gear available on retail as well. The menu offerings are all about the coffee with some pastries to snack on. Quality stuff all round in a nice, gothic-themed atmosphere.\n\nCoffee - 3 stars, ambience and aircond 5 stars. Lovely cosy cafe at an industrial place. A little disappointing as coffee was quite milky. The iced one seems strong than the hot one. Maybe I will stick to iced next time but since the environment is quite comfortable, I will probably be back whenever I\u2019m in that area.\n",

                  "reviews": "\n\nOrdered apple crumble with a huge scoop of ice cream. Delicious, could be a little more seasoned. Fisherman pasta was filled with plenty seafood. Prawns were especially fresh. Pasta was Al dente. Sauce was delicious although a little salty. Great service and environment (indoors)\n\nService can be warmer. It really doesn\u2019t cost much to wear a smile when introducing your patrons to their table. Had a steak with warm potato salad, received almost well done instead of medium rare.  We asked for more water once, and it didn\u2019t come. Water comes with a small charge. Our group was seated upstairs, and one of us had to make our way down every time if we wanted to ask the service staff for assistance.\n\nIt\u2019s been a while since my last visit to Fika. Was rather disappointed by the quality of the food and service rendered this time round.\n\nI recalled the server used to take order but now we have to self-order at the counter.  As we were seated at the second level, it was rather a hassle to go up and down a few time just to order and ask for water. If they want to have self-service ordering, at least allow customers to scan and order via QR code.\n\nThe meatball was rather dry and the grilled chicken was slightly salty too. We requested for candles and they did not offer too. Could feel a huge difference in the overall experience this visit, and would likely not return again.\n\nNever fell in love this easy with food before and yes i said it. I love how tasty the meatballs are and the beef stew are made with almost perfection. Definitely come again next time to try some new dishes next time.\n\nAlthough the food was alright, the seat I was at was vibrating throughout the whole meal and it was really annoying. We later realised that we were seated directly above a ceiling fan installed on level 1 which is likely the cause of the vibration. Our table was next to a window and I found it rather glaring but was sternly told by one of the servers that the curtains must be kept open. While I respect that the restaurant might have a good reason for such a rule, the message could have been more politely communicated.\n",

Would have recommended if not for the long wait (30min on a Friday lunch)\n\nI'm on a ketogenic diet. Happened to see that there are many google reviews on this shop selling pork liver (without noodles), dry style.\n\nThe pork liver is cooked to perfection - Tender and bloodless. Not flaky like some of those served elsewhere. There's also some minced meat inside. I requested more pork lard. The chilli and vinegar mix was done properly.\n\nService was great. I was told to sit and the food was served to me.\n\nWould definitely be back again!\n\nWow! If you love pork liver, or just lots of ingredients in yummy soup accompanied by al dente noodles, this is the place! The liver served is in HUGE chunks, and lightly blanched, so it is tender and melts in your mouth. So much ingredients in the soup too... 2 meatballs, 1 fishball, fishcake slices, sliced taupok, chunks of minced meat... The noodles are well-cooked and seasoned too. If you order the double balls soup, you get a range of fish balls and meatballs with fillings.\n\nOnly downside is the wait. We went at about 1.30 and waited for about half hour. Fortunately, it was worth the wait and we were not in a rush.\n\nWorth the price we paid, which was a total of $13.\n\nPrice : $$\nTaste : 8/10\nValue for money : 9/10\n\n# Specializes in the freshness of pork.\n\nIf you are a BCM lover , you will find that the liver is fresh with no powdery texture.\n\nEach slice varies about  0.5 cm thick and its tender when u bite it across.\n\nNoodles were normal and the sauce were good.\n\nSoup needless to say , plenty of ingredients and the freshness of mince pork and slices.\n\nWorth the make the trip and their customer service is good. \ud83d\udc4d\n\nThere\u2019s so much good reviews about the BCM of this stall so have to try it out myself.\nCame on a Sat morning and be warned of the long waiting time, 30-45 min is a norm.\nThe highlight of the BCM is the thick and chunky pork liver, you may req for the liver to be cooked medium well else it may turn out to be slightly bloody.\nThere\u2019s option to add side dishes which is assortment of fried tofu, fish cake & etc.\n",

The mentai aka ebi capellini was ok, would be better if the pasta was al dente. The salmon avocado toast was disappointing. It was not stated in the menu that the salmon steak is not fully cooked. Due to personal reasons I was not able to eat raw food. After 5-10 mins, they brought it back and said the salmon steak is actually meant to be \u201csashimi style\u201d as quoted by the staff. But they cooked it further as per my request, which I was thankful. However, to my dismay, it was still raw. The photo uploaded is AFTER they brought it back out. Luckily I ordered another chicken katsu curry don while they were preparing my salmon steak further as it really came back still raw. But the chicken katsu was so tough and dry. So disappointing. The curry was tasty though. After such a slow and disappointing lunch, we decided to go elsewhere for dessert. In total, for the 3 dishes, the bill came up to $70+.\n\nThis is a nice Japanese themed cafe in Tanjong Pagar. We came here after a badminton session, and it was a nice place to cool down.\n\nCasual place for a conversation or to catch up on work with comfortable seating. Service is ok, but quick.\n\nWe ordered the following -\n\n1) Kombu Truffle Fries - Fries sprinkled with kombu (seaweed) and cooked in truffle oil. Liked how crunchy and well spread out the flavours were.\n\n2) Pork katsu sando - Liked this sando, crunchy and well toasted. Pork flavours were good and the pork was soft and not too chewy. Good dip of curry leaf mayo to go with it.\n\n3) Beef fat short ribs sando - Another sando with crispy toast. This one was a bit heavier compared to the pork katsu, but likeable. Comes with sliced tomatoes.\n\nCosy cafe with minimalist interiors. Food are mainly inspired by or fused with Japanese food. What I really appreciate here is the warm and friendly service. Coffee here is nice too, not the acidic kind, which I like.\n\nWe were given a room for our dine-in as we had 7 people.\n\nService, ambience and vibe were solid. Appreciated the check ins from the owner, ensuring everything was good. We ordered 2 servings of truffle fries to share. Recommended to get that to share!\n\nAs for mains, all the dishes that we tried (shown in the images) were really yummy.. although i had a bit of difficulties finishing my curry don because the portion was slightly big. But my guy friend finished his, so i guess it varies from individual to individual!\n\nWe also got the grape ricotta toast as dessert, i liked it! Something new and unique in taste :) Also appreciated the owner prepping cakes for a birthday celebration, despite sharing that there weren\u2019t available cakes ready then!\n\nWill i come back again- defo! \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\n\nGreat Chicken Curry Rice for a good price with a bottle of free water. Loved that the (kind) waiter was also the cook. Will definitely eat here again if I'm in Singapore\n",

Meat ball is good too, although it is factory make. $3.50 is very affordable.\n\nVFM meals at $3.50/$4 for all dishes except for satay bee Hoon $4/$4.50. Laksa is good too.\n\nNice bowl of fishball bcm.  Noodle mix is nice and soup is delicious.  Meatball forgettable as taste like supermarket type.  Fishball and fish cake is ok.  One of the better bcm around.  Enjoy the noodle much.  Friendly owner and affordable price of $3.50 only.\n\nMee pok dry was too dry, the noodles lacked fragrance and disjointed with the ingredients in the same bowl. Meatballs tasted like those from supermarkets. Fishballs were soft and the soup was pretty tasty. Overall, not too bad for $3.50. Seller was polite and e-payment was available.\n\nFriendly uncle and auntie. Bfast and lunch. Closed from 18-Jan to 2-Feb-23. Reopen 3-Feb. Closed on Wed and Thu. Personal favourites: tasty Mushroom Minced Pork noodle meepok 4$ in picture, Fuzhou fishball noodle. Guo Tiao option available.\n",

I like mine with added shredded chicken - their shredded chicken is not the dry breast slices so again, really juicy and tender!\n\nStall is run by 2 elderly aunties and an elderly uncle. They are really nice people!\n\nEverytime I come, I think I must try the laksa, but I still have not managed to do it. I could eat this everyday. (For info my portion isn't 3.50 as I added chicken. Pls don't expect this from auntie.)\n\nSuper full sia, nearly can't finish my food! I kei kiang (Act smart) go and order a large portion of wanton mee at Swee Kee Wanton Noodles in ABC Brickworks Food Centre. Good and affordable!\n\nI dug into their wanton noodle, and I love the traditional type of wanton noodle and char siew the best! The noodles were springy, and the wantons were stuffed with flavor.\n\nTheir wanton soup was especially sweet and savory and I wanted to ask for one more bowl, but paiseh to ask lah.\n\nCame by during lunch hour, there was a short queue but got my Laksa bowl pretty quick. Ordered my Laksa with yellow noodles with cockles and chilli. The bowl also came with fish cakes and toufu puffs. The Laksa broth is not as oily as you might find from other stalls, it is flavourful and it tasted a little on the sweet side. I like the texture of the noodles, toufu puffs are well cooked and they gave a good servings of cockles.\n\nA good and traditional wanton noodle store manned by an old couple.\n\nBraised chicken feet can be added as a side to your wanton noodles at additional cost. The braised chicken feet is flavourful, soft and tender. Highly recommended as an add-on!\n\nA decent plate of noodles $3.50. not much more u can ask for. Friendly auntie duo at the helm.\n",

Come before 11am and you should be able to get a seat of your choice. The sundaes are still selling at 50 cents per serving.\n\nConvenient here instead of the long queue at lvl 3 upstairs. The self service kiosks doesn\u2019t seem to function though, the staff is slightly rude serve the hotdog bun upside down while I pop open the box  But the hotdog bun and mango ice cream is good.\n\nLove that they have the full menu up so it's easy to see instead of those flashing menu that keeps changing.\nThere's 3 self order kiosks but only one was working.\nNo crowd on a weekday late afternoon. We went once on a weekend and it was really crowded.\nKudos to the staff for their speedy service! I remembered being impressed by how fast the queue moves even with the crowd. And today only one staff was serving and she's faster than McDonald's fast food service!\nGood that they serve different types of food from the one at level three so that there's more variety. Delicious food at affordable prices! Ice cream is a must have! Get the twist!\n\nOrdered a gourmet hot dog with nacho cheese, tastes much better than the hot dog from Level 3.\nThe self-order kiosks were not working and some dishes were not available as well.\n\nExcellent concept IKEA Tampines should have rolled out years ago. This snack bar has some menu items not present in the upstairs outlets. Quality control has to be improved however; food is haphazardly cooked and packed.\n\nGourmet hotdog with nacho cheese isn\u2019t properly laid out and centred in the bun \u2014 although it tastes better than the usual IKEA hotdog.\n\nFries are borderline edible: most are soggy with occasional hard (and not crispy) bits \u2014 evident lack of oil temperature control.\n",

Many regular followers, greens include cabbage / french beans. Also sells spring rolls, mini potato puffs & \u2018goose\u2019 cracker toppings. Friendly folks with new hires (ah ma sometimes here) & chain store Vista & Pagar. Special mention here as their Hor fun & Mee hoon great wok hei here On weekends there is curry too, but queue longer too\n\nFor $5, its a hearty meal with a lot of ingredients \u263a\ufe0f A solid value breakfast; pretty good although the bee hoon noodles are a little bland but mixing it the green chili definitely makes it tangy and more flavorful! Definitely kid-friendly too! \ud83d\ude06\n\nI would revisit and eat it when it\u2019s convenient but wont queue up / wait for a long time for this!\n\nRead a lot of positive review about this stall hence tried it on a Saturday mid morning.\n\nThe queue was acceptable and moving quite fast. This stall has an interesting concept where there's 2 queue - one is to order and after that, you will have to join the other queue to collect your food.  For 1st timer like me, it does get a bit confusing and luckily it was pointed out to me by another customer.\n\nOrdered 2 plates of bee hoon with all the ingredients mixed together. The portion given is rather generous and reasonably priced at S$4.00 per plate. This by far one of the store that I feel gives the best bang for bucks in terms of quantity.\n\nIn terms of taste, I would say its slightly above average. The white bee hoon has relatively nice flavour, char siew is soft and the zai er (fried bean curd skin) is crispy. But I find the rest of the bean curd items doesn't have that much of a flavour and overall all the items are rather oily.\n\nIn my opinion, this is a store that serves a very decent plate of vegetarian bee hoon at a reasonable price.\n\nI have been trying this branch located in a coffeeshop next to the Redhill Food Center. Usually spotted with a long queue, the price for a plate of vegetarian noodle has risen to S$4.00. However, the  ingredients are fresh and noodle is tasty. Worth a try!\n\nOrdered Kway Teow with bee hoon. $3.50 per pack.\nQueue: 15-20 mins\nTaste: Full of flavour (salty and peppery) but quite oily (grease coated my lips), bee hoon is tasteless, kway teow not much taste\nPortion: Typical portion for lunch.\nPrice: not worth $3.50, there are better ones that cost lesser.\n",

There are many pieces of intruige throughout the store, and I typically find new pieces everytime I go. Walking into the store is like entering a museum of Scandinavian and Danish furniture design. It's an excellent source for well-made and thoughtfully selected vintage pieces. I almost have to stop myself from visiting too often as I always find something to fall in love with when in the store.\n\nThey are highly knowledgeable in not only the provenance their select pieces, but also the design history. I will most certainly be back to add to my ever-growing collection, and highly recommend for you to pay a visit to Copan too.\n\nIt is always a welcoming experience visiting the showroom, Desmond and May are friendly and patient in sharing with us about the products and how to care for it. We are now happy owners of a beautiful Danish dining table and sideboard :)\n\nMay was knowledgeable and also extremely accommodative and patient in answering my queries. Their showroom have a wide range of rare vintage pieces at competitive price range compared to similar players within the vintage furniture business. Will definitely deal with Copan again in the future. Keep up the good work guys.\n\nMay was very helpful from the moment I asked questions, she also gave me enough privacy to explore all the beautiful furnitures by myself and when I stumbled upon something that speaks to me, she kindly shared the story of where it came from and how they got the piece all the way to Singapore. They also did some touch up to fix up the piece and sent me pictures and even opened up the store early (as I had a plane to catch) for me to view it before they arranged the delivery to my apartment.\n\nOverall the experience is great and I am saving up for the next piece for my home.\n\nBought an exquisite looking glass cabinet and am very happy with how it sits beautifully in my residence. Desmond was very cordial and helpful with the information and knowledge he had to offer  generously about the products.\n",

We understand the humidity, the heat in Singapore and the hawkers needing to stand for a really long time (if the business is good). However, my recent experience with the service staff was bad tempered and unable to convey what further information he needs to take my order. The food was mediocre. People only queue for this stall because the good stall (selling the same thing) was closed.\n\nPretty average. But the serving size though. At $4.50 the hokkien Mee is really one of the larger serving size I have encountered. This is the thick bee hon variety which I don't prefer. Should have asked more chili for the taste.\n\nEdit (Jan 2023): doing my dd to review their fkt. Small plate cost only $4.\n\nIt was better than their hokkien Mee. Generally more savory (salty) [my preference] than sweet, Chinese sausage is a contribution to that as well. Cockles was very small and few in between.\n\nNoodles is just slightly on the softer side for me but i am sure many will find it enjoyable.\n\nAdded: White carrot cake $3\n\nThe bigger chunk variety, it is pretty average. Chill has a kick and the preserve radishes add a more savory profile to carrot cake. Otherwise if u like scramble egg this might be up your alley. The egg isn't crispy at all but large chunk of scramble egg so is like 50% scramble egg 50% average carrot cake\n\nNot sure how this place was even awarded the Michelin bib gourmand award because the food tasted pretty ordinary. Ordered 4 dishes from the stall and NONE stood out at all. In fact there was no queue at all for it in that forever bustling Chong Pang Market. Ironically, it was a stall selling similar stuffs just diagonally behind it that had a queue of over 20 persons.\n\nWe saw a long queue for this stall. I can say it is very popular and many locals really like their cooking. We ordered the white carrot cake and it was pretty good. The chilli goes very well with it and the egg was perfectly fried. So nice. We like the fact that we can ask them to put more onion chives on top 'coz it adds more flavour to it.\n\nDespite the long queue, it moves fast and they also cook and serve the food very quick. The uncle is also very nice and cheerful.\n\nChar kway teow not bad, the wet kind. Feels abit like mee goreng in fact only sweet sauce instead of tomato sauce...\nQuite big cockles and not stingy with the numbers.\n\nCarrot cake ok only, maybe should try the other stall next time\n",

Unless you are desparate to eat else stay away as there are lots of eateries around the area.\n\nAnd the 101 Rojak....sigh....\n\nBought a $5 rojak to go as Nine Five Rojak was not open. Ate at home after a 10min walk. The rojak was mediocre - sauce was watery and not flavourful at all (no lime zest or rojak flower or anything like that, although anyway they wouldn\u2019t have been able to lift the prawn paste sauce which just didnt taste good), the pineapple was soggy and not the least bit sweet, not generous with the ingredients either, taupok and youtiao were also not freshly toasted. The only plus point was that service was fast at 1pm.\n\nMy favourite black pepper lamb chop... better than any restaurant. Black pepper sauce was fully originally created by them. The one and only sauce. Totally different from outside.  Worth trying. Almost 300gm lamb chop sold only $11.00.\n\nOne of the favorite coffee shop which I will visit whenever I am around this area.\nThey have stalls that offers delicious, cheap and affordable bee hoon noodles and wide variety of food to go along with.\nAlso there is a Muslim stall that sell cheap and delicious nasi lemak that used to be popular in town area.\n\nTerrible tea. Plain like water. Very small cup. Indian rojak is terrible. Prawns not fresh and starchy pieces. Cucumber not fresh.\n",

Not worth going out of your way for this place\n\nOrdered Run Down burger\uff0cFirebird burger, Carbonara spaghetti with chicken, Spagetti with Steak. Serving is very generous. Steak is overcooked and hard although we ask for medium rare. Spagetti was just nice. Firebird burger was not to my liking because it is fried chicken and oily. My stomach did not feel too well after that.\n\nDisappointed with my order of rib eye. It didn't look or taste like rib eye. Very rubbery & I didn't finish it. Waitress was kind enough to serve me a serving of chicken chop but I Was still charge the full price for rib eye. Chicken chop was OK. Pasta so so. Mushroom soup was not bad. Unfortunately, it'll be my first and last time coming here...\n\nGreat service and ambience. Portion was big and affordable pricing. Taste wise, can be better! Fish and chips was too oily for my liking and steak was a little tough.\n\nThe food here is priced competitively and the quality is good. We had a great time catching up with friends and the food is so good. I think it has good value and recommend people to give it a try.\n",

I wouldn't personally say that the waffles were more extraodinary than other places I've been but they're pretty good! some cool flavours too :D\n\nImmediate 5/5! Great service, food and variety at an affordable price! What is there not to like?\n\nPersonally I loved the Vietnamese coffee ice cream (Little Saigon) when paired with the soft and chewy waffles \ud83e\uddc7 which went swimmingly well!\n\nPerhaps what can be done better is that the cappuccino could be serviced in a ceramic cup for a better tasting experience. Flavour wise it is good \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\n\nOverall this is the kind of place you would happily want to return to. Kudos!\n\nCozy ice cream place at Yishun and there's constant crowd during the time I'm here. Decided to try the Blue Hawaii (bluepea flower with choc chip & a hint of sea salt) that seems to be their popular item but don't have much of the choc chip and the sea salt is not hint though. Am pretty disappointed and won't recommend for me but the Pistachio is smooth and flavourful. Waffles is crispy on the outside and soft inside.\n\nNice ice cream, cool ambience, affordable prices. Had the mint chocolate. Inside can seat 25pax max, but turnover quite fast since ice cream melt fast and it\u2019s so sweet. They serve waffles too! Overall it\u2019s nice place to have a hangout and chill.\n\nBeen a loyal customer for a long time, but I was let down by the service I received today. The lady named Eugene who assisted us was impatient and came across as rude when we wanted to try some new flavors. It would be great if the staff's attitude could be improved to enhance the overall ice cream experience. Fortunately, the delicious ice cream and waffles helped make up for the disappointing service.\n",

For example, I think there are at least 5 stalls selling fish all noodles and 4 stalls selling prawn noodles, none of which are particularly outstanding and nice. Price wise: most stalls are very reasonable.\n",

                  "reviews": "\n\nThis Yishun Mos outlet serves quality burgers and fries. Love the fish \ud83d\udc1f burger \ud83c\udf54 because I think is the fillets that a difference for Mac fish. The hamburgers though uses onions which Mac burger uses  pickles as the favour enhancement.\nOnly drawback is the size of the outlet, small area so gets quite crowded at times.\nThe burgers are now pack in boxes, use different tapes to differentiate the contents.\n\nJust wanted to share my favourite order of fish burger, milk tea and fried chicken! Just $10 for this set :) Their milk tea is light and refreshing, while their fish burger is the best! Japanese Mayo and mustard with crispy fish patty, onions, cheese, all between two soft buns.\n\nThe buzzer rang twice when my food wasn\u2019t ready though... hope that the technology improves here\n\nV disappointed, 2nd time I order this burger but the standard at Northpoint is so lousy. When I approach ur staff, he asked me I want more guacamole is it? I mean do I look like a beggar? Ur ala carte burger is $9.\n\nThe fries were hot but hard and stale and tasted like they have been fried a few times and left to sit there for some time... the staff was nice to change a new one for me however the second portion was still the same as the first... Northpoint outlet needs to look into how they fry their fries to ensure it\u2019s fresh and good tasting when served to customers.\n\nI know this can\u2019t be right because I\u2019ve tasted better at other Mos Burger outlets. Come on Northpoint team you can do better. This is not the standard of your fries.\n\nOne of my go to fast food joint. My personal favourites are yakiniku rice burger and ebi rice burger. The French fries are also better tasting then other fast food restaurant. The reason why I gave it a 3 star? Their lemon tea drink is always very diluted. Feels like drinking sugar water doesn't taste like tea at all. As for service, the staff is always on the ball and serve with a smile. Will still patronize from this outlet. Please give a 'Like' if you enjoy this honest review.\n",

                  "reviews": "\n\nFood served very fast. Servers responsive when called. Meat is well marinated. Pork belly very thick though. It would taste and cook better if sliced thinly. Buffet price is cheap at $20.90 per person. Would be good if they increased the price by a few dollars more and make it drink free flow. The sweet soy fried chicken the best and so yummy. So sweet and flavourful and skin so crunchy and meat so tender.\n\nThe price is reasonable for the quality of food. I've tried both buffet and ala carte before and both types are equally good.  The meats and vegetables and noodles served taste good and authentic. Service is also very good and the staff are very friendly and helpful. The only downside is the barbeque smell that is left on your clothes and hair and skin after you leave the place but I suppose this is unavoidable even when you are seated and dining outside the airconditioned area.\n\nOverall it's a pocket friendly restaurant. Good for group dining but ventilation wise can be a bit stuffy. Buffet variety is limited but sufficient for those who are meat eaters. Their friend chicken is good. We are not so in favour of the seasoned meat as it tend to be on the sweet side. Dining time is 90mins and will have penalty charges for unfinished cooked food.\n\nOne of the Korean BBQ which I always visit. Value for money depsite the increase in price recently. Barely tea used to free, but now chargeable. Fried chicken still as good and servicing portion quite okay, since is buffet, you can always order as long as you can finish it. Dinner more worth it as just $3 extra, you get more variety of the ingredients as well as ice cream. Owner may want to look into serving ice cream during lunch too. It doesn't cost you much as not everyone likes, but it do helps in your business. For those who drive, is not easy to get parking lot, but you can always park at the opposite HDB carpark.\n\nFinally had the chance to try this place despite knowing it exists for years \ud83d\ude02 tried the cold spicy noodles and soy sauce fried chicken. Noodles were close to lukewarm \ud83e\udd79 but flavour was decent so maybe next time I'll bring my own ice cubes to add haha but the chicken was very good! Crispy and juicy and the sauce was on point without being too overpowering. Not mind-blowing but it checked off all my boxes for good fried chicken - no complaints. Sides wise I think the Mac and cheese tasted gross and sad and cheap - especially the cheap mayo used but the kimchi was good. Tastes exactly like the one from wonderful bapsang.\n",

Very satisfied!\n\nThis is my 2nd time here.\nVery very disappointed!\nThe platter didn\u2019t serve hot, said exchange but end up even worse:\nMedium rare become medium well and smelly\nThe chicken wing went back kitchen for reheat then serve again.\nDo u think the customer can be cheated easily?\nSigh\u2026. Won\u2019t come again. Sucks\n\nOnce in a while you find a restaurant that greatly exceeds your expectations and Kingdom of Belgians (KoB) is one of them.  I've now eaten here twice; two nights in a row. Each night I tried completely different things. All of it was outstanding. Highlights are the beef stew, Flemish asparagus, Belgian wings and the two desserts I had. Belgian waffle with ice cream and the spiced apple tart. To die for. They had a special on a bottle of wine in my photos too and for the price was great also. Staff, while busy, are great and friendly. If you are in Singapore don't miss a dinner here with family or a date. The prices are very reasonable for SG and the food really is outstanding. Kila approved!! \ud83d\udc93 PS:  I didn't even try the mussels yet haha! \ud83d\ude00\n\n3.3/5 (3/5 food; 5/5 service; 2/5 atmosphere)\nIt's ok. Honestly, we came because of the mussels and belgian beer. The mussels were alright. Decent portion, however i felt that the seasoning was off, and the flavours over powered the mussels. We also had the cauliflower and asparagus, the seasoning was off also there (lack of salt). Asparagus under cooked. Unfortunately my partner got sick afterwards (we had to go straight home - we don't think it was the mussels as i was fine, but something was definitely off. Things can happen the vote is not influenced by that. I was a little dissapointed on the beer selection. It's your commercial trappist or lindeman. Was hoping for some lambic/geuze or other artisinal beers. We didnt stick around for desert  (as partner was unwell). The atmosphere was also very strange - we stayed indoors, and the decor, lighting, seats all make it feel a little fast foodish. Maybe that's the point, but it did feel a little weird. There is an outside though which looked very nice and may have a totally different atmosphere.\n\nIt's my third visit here. KoB is a riverside spot which specialises, as you may suspect from the name, in Belgian beer and food. Waffles, fries with mayo, Blue Moon Belgian witbeer (actually not a Belgian beer; it's American, but let's not quibble \ud83d\ude03), Leffe etc.\n\nThe restaurant has a pretty amazing deal where you get two beers for the price of one during happy hour, which is 1100-1900. Most people come for the beer and sit outside under the umbrellas to enjoy them but the food is surprisingly good. Pesto pasta with parmesan and croutons at just $13 (lunchtime special) is terrific, the fries with mayo can be variable (twice they've been well cooked and crispy, just how I like them, once they were a bit soft and floury inside), and the jalape\u00f1o poppers are die die must try!\n\nSolid ice-cold beers at a great price, great food, ideal location by the leafy riverside in Robertson Quay...definitely going to be visiting this place a lot!\n",

The chill vibe and cooling environment with fans made it a pleasant spot, but be warned about the mosquitoes. Luckily, we arrived early, as the place filled up quickly. Although the food took a while to be served, the quality and generous portions made up for it. It might be a bit pricey, but the overall vibe is worth it. We will visit again with friends next time.\n\nDiscovered this hidden gem after driving by and the atmosphere was alluring. Looked like a full house, but staff made space for us. I was already expecting a bit of a slow wait, so bearing that in mind, food was definitely worth the wait. Drinks (root beer and Heineken bottle) came within 5 minutes of sitting down, first dish (fried rice) came around 30+ min after, and everything else came quite quickly after that.\nHighly recommend the onion rings, satay and fish and chips. Serving sizes were generous and tasted great.\nNot sure what\u2019s with the recent low reviews - this place definitely is a charm for what it is. If you\u2019re expecting super fast, quick, and \u201chigh class\u201d restaurant vibes, then this isn\u2019t the spot for you. If you\u2019re looking to chill, have a hearty meal, enjoy the atmosphere without rush, then this little gem of a cafe does the job.\n\nOur experience at woody\u2019s cafe was okay . Food was overpriced, my wife and i ordered the bua keluak burger, pork ribs, onion rings and satay . We only enjoyed the satay and onion rings. The burger\u2019s sauce was too salty for our liking, and the pork ribs was not that meaty and tasted bleh. We liked the unique atmosphere though.\n\nA lovely place to chill. As I was driving so didn't drink. They have a good selection of food and drinks. Must try if you're ard the area or at least Tey to make yr way there. Secluded and quiet. Go on a weekday as I heard it is usually very packed on the weekend.\n\nGood satay. Avoid the chicken salad if you want less calories n vegetables, it\u2019s loaded with chicken and sauce. Rustic and great place to hang out for a drink at night. The next time I will try their peranakan dishes. There is no ac, so it can get hot in the day.\n",

I should have checked but I was in a hurry. Not the first time they didn\u2019t give me carrot cake\n\nI recently visited here and had the pleasure of trying out their latte, mocha, and cheesecake.\n\nThe latte was expertly crafted with a smooth and velvety texture. The coffee was strong and bold, but not overpowering, and perfectly balanced with the steamed milk. The latte had a good foam and the taste was well balanced.\n\nThe mocha was also delicious, with a rich and chocolatey flavor that was well balanced. The chocolate was not too sweet and not too bitter, and the drink was expertly crafted with a rabbit and a leaf latte design.\n\nThe cheesecake was heavenly. It was creamy, rich and the texture was perfect. The crust was buttery and crumbly and the topping was fresh and sweet.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this caf\u00e9 for their delicious coffee and cheesecake. Their staff was also friendly and attentive. A great spot for a morning coffee or a dessert break.\n\nAlways my favourite place for morning breakfast as there are only few opened in the morning before 10am. However, the area is a bit hot and seems like no air con in the morning\n\nHighly recommend\n1. All day breakfast fry up - chicken bratwurst, scrambled eggs, mushrooms, baked beans, salad mix, and 2 pieces of soft whole grain toast.\n2. Skillet sous vide eggs with chicken bratwurst, melted cheese and cherry tomatoes. This is so yummy!\n3. Mushroom melt on a ultra soft brioche bun\n\nFor cakes, we love the lychee rose and key lime. So delicious. So fragrant. Not too sweet. My friend and I typically can\u2019t finish an entire slice of cake but we polished both slices up in no time!\n\nService is good and attentive. We asked for hot water refill for our rose Earl Grey (very fragrant) and it was done immediately, no questions asked.\n\nPrices are reasonable too - especially if you buy their stored value card (for drinks)\n",

The pistachio ice cream is quite nice, but Oat Milk dark choc is a disappointment- not dark choc at all, more like super sweet white choc. Waffle is average, can be better.\n\nEnvironment wise it\u2019s a really small shop with a few small round table and small stools. Not comfortable\n\nIf you're in the mood for a tasty treat and don't want to break the bank, then look no further than this amazing spot that serves up some of the best waffles and ice cream in town. The pandan gula melaka waffles are perfectly crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside, making every bite simply heavenly. And let's not forget about their incredible selection of ice cream flavors that perfectly complement the warm waffles. Whether you're a fan of classics like chocolate and vanilla or more adventurous flavors like salted caramel or cafe mocha crunch, this place has got you covered. The ambiance is laid-back and friendly, making it an ideal spot to catch up with friends over a delicious dessert.The staff service (Chloe) is exceptional as well \u2013 friendly, efficient, and always ready with a smile. They make you feel welcome from the moment you step through the door until your last bite of waffle. So do yourself a favor and head over to this hidden gem \u2013 your taste buds will thank you! And me and my girl friend come here almost every night.\n\n1st and last time. Came to the shop & sign was \u2018 toilet break 20 mins \u2018 the staff was outside using phone , not sure is lady boss or what . After finish ordering the staff said \u2018 eh it\u2019s done already \u2018 , apparently it\u2019s self service . We were the only customer there as the place was empty , there was no music or anything in the background so it was completely silent and it make the experience very awkward . This place really doesn\u2019t have any customer care or service , I agree with the other 1 star reviews . Waffles was also so so only , ice cream give so little . 11.50$ paid , totally not worth the experience & price . (7$ for waffle , 4.5$ for 1 pathetic size scoop of ice cream) Refer to photo for the portion of the scoop given\n\nThe waffles and gelato at No Horse Run Yishun is exceptional! Very tasty and well prepared and you can chose among many menu options. I love the service at the place and the crew(Chesca) is so friendly with the guests and always takes care to offer the best quality! I highly recommend this place. You must visit right now!\n\nLovely place. Felt super cosy when i first entered even though it's small. Me and my partner decided to drive down to takeaway 2 scoops of ice cream and waffles. Even after we arrived back home the waffles was still crispy. One of the better heartland cafes around the north area! Ice cream portion was super generous too!\n",

Daughter enjoyed the pretzels very much and she gave a thumb up \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb for the sausage platter.\n\nPork Schnitzel was nicely done and goulash was so amazingly good!\n\nBest of all the pork knuckle is so crispy, goes so well with the accompanying sauce.\n\nDefinitely will come again to try their signature fried beehoon.\n\nTonight we thought we would try something a little different, European style food with the opportunity to sample a nice cold beer.\n\nBrauhaus with its old charm and quiet setting seemed a great place to start our evening.  Upon arriving the bar/pub you can  view a large selection of glassware and beer bottles from Germany and other countries around the world which was rather exciting.\nBut sadly that's where the excitement ended, having ordered the sausage platter x 2 and roast potato's we thought we were in for a special treat. The sauerkraut was from a jar, served slightly warm, and tasting of vinegar, the sausage platter was supposed to be four different kinds of sausage where only two types of sausage were served.\nThe roast potatoes were boiled, tossed in oil with onions, mushrooms and a few slithers of bacon, topped with cheese and grilled in the oven, hardly roasted and tasting rather bland due to the lack of seasoning.\nIt was a far cry from the Brauhaus in Sydney Australia which truly is representative of German cuisine.\n\nBrauhaus may have been back in the day (2013) a bar to be reckoned with something different, but today in 2023 it falls well short of what it actually boasts about. A place I would not recommend, or frequent again!\n\nWeirdly enough, the dish I enjoyed most was their pig's trotter bee hoon. Meatloaf and oxtail were pretty alright as well.\n\nStaffers were friendly and made sure all our glasses were always filled. That ensured a most enjoyable evening out.\n\nLove the bee hoon. Sausage platter not bad. The knuckles were delicious too.\n\nThe beer selection is more than normal.\n\nNice place to chill and eat and beer!\n\nWide variety of beer and very homely. Been here for years and they stayed consistent. However, not all beers on the menu are available and you should check with the staff before ordering. Always order the sausage platter here as you can\u2019t go wrong with sausages. However, the table beside us was having beehoon which looked and smelled super good. Will try next time.\n",

We had a long wait for our food to be served. Food portion was huge and was tasty. Price is also on the higher side. But ambience was good. Especially if you wanna chill with friends and family over food.\n\nThe food taste average. The only nice thing is the hot chocolate which serves with the Turkish tin. Not so satisfied with the service. We finished the food and decided to stay for a while longer. Without asking for the bills, the waiter passed us the bill. Would appreciate if they don\u2019t do this to customers \ud83d\ude05 it made us feel like we are supposed to leave right after eating without the peace to stay a bit longer and we were there from 4.10pm to 4.50pm and it wasn\u2019t even crowded. Very disappointing for such quality and service at such a venue.\n\nVery nice brunch option. Great atmosphere. You should be mindful you should book a reservation to avoid eating at the bar and that there is a time restriction after which the next batch comes in.\nThe menu is pretty good but it was surprising to see some classics missing like veg scrambled eggs or eggs benedict.\nDishes are pretty big and high quality. We will definitely come back.\n\nFirst time having wild honey.\nNice food.\nWe had quite a \u201csurprise\u201d on the first time ever at wild honey. It ended well.\nI hope to see improvements over the check in the supply of bagels.\n\nI had a wonderful birthday dinner here \ud83e\udd70. The space is cozy and spacious, the food is delicious and healthy (not too sweet, or too salty). Staff are enthusiastic and friendly. The restaurant also gave me a surprise when giving me a slice of birthday cake beautifully decorated with candle. \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffb Thanks\n",

The white beehoon was like a sticky gooey version with lots of egg. Came with 2 small prawns and 2 scallop which was honestly quite little at this price point.\n\nThe XO fried rice was also just average- quite spicy, nothing really outstanding.\n\nService was very good and friendly. Ambience was quite warm during a hot afternoon. Overall really quite average food for this price- I will probably not try again.\n\nI had previously tasted their white bee Hoon at Jewel, and it was delicious. However, last night's dish lacked the wok hey flavor. Additionally, their yam ring was small and missing key ingredients like cashew nuts and other vegetables. Just to also note, there was no air conditioning.\n\nMain seller white bee hoon is still nice as always.\nBeancurd quite typical, not much tofu fragrance.\nNgor hiong also quite normal, gave chillie sauce not black sauce.\nClaypot chicken gravy is nice, but chicken meat abit dry.\nPeach gum dessert hardly find the peach gum inside.\nOverall food is decent, only the white bee hoon has a reason for return. Quantity of food is very little even though price is on high side.\n\nI went there on a Saturday Night around 6pm. There is a slight queue but the wait is not too long. It's is my first time trying Singapore white beehoon, and yesh I'm honestly grateful that I have my first dish here. It's sooo good, the lime makes it so much better. Asides from white beehoon, the Signature Meat and Seafood Roll is nice too!\n\nDisappointing experience! Broccoli and naibai were sold out before 7.30pm (normal dinner time hours). Ordered \"Homemade Tofu with Dried Scallop and Mushroom\", naibai got changed to 5 snow peas without informing us and toppings were pathetic (See comparison photo of the same dish at the Vivocity outlet).\n\nHad high expectations of the original outlet after relatively good experiences at both Vivocity and Waterway Point. Not coming back again.\n",

Not crowded. Food was okay. The best is indeed their prawn pao fan. The pao fan was soooo flavourful. Just this dish is enough to feel happy and full. Ee fu mee not bad, oily enough. Get the luffa fish ball soup. Soup was yummy and fish ball was full fish paste.\n\nGood for family gathering.\n\nHave been here a few times with friends and family. Will often order a variety of Dim Sum here. The Mango Pomelo Sago is my favourite too esp when it comes with full load of good stuffs!\nFor Dim Sum and Pao Fan lover, this will be a good place for you!\n\nA place to enjoy the old school vibe. It has a good selection of dishes and dim sum, from the typical Zi char items to Hong Kong style quick bites. Their pao fan (rice is rich broth) is a must order. Thoroughly enjoyed that.\n\nPlace is generally not overly crowded. Parking can be an issue if you go at lunch time. Expect parallel parking lots.\n",

I wouldn't classify this place as having authentic Hong Kong Dim Sum, maybe more local style.\n\nWhat I was not happy about was the service. We were still eating, and there was one staff who kept trying to clear our table or asking if we wanted to take away the rest.\n\nI get that there are people waiting outside, but you should let your existing customers eat in peace!\n\nWhen were trying to pay they kept asking us for our order form, which we never got back.\n\nSo all in all when it came to service, this place did not impress. I only gave it 2 stars for service because there was one really sweet waitress there.\n\nSafe to say, we will not to racing to go back any time soon.\n\nDim sum acceptable. Roast duck is great. Curry fish head is the best dish ...\n\nOmg very nice. Was looking for late dinner place in the north and chanced upon here when my train ended its service at springleaf and wa rly damn nice\n\nRoast pork and char siu rice is good (roast pork nicer than charsiu) and the chilli and the sauce is damnnnnn good\n\nDimsum also very nice (carrot cake and cheong fun)\n\nMy friend\u2019s HK noodle also not bad\n\nService is good, they will even warn u if the saman auntie coming.

Not so nice today both service and food. Had porridge, crispy noodles, crispy rolls, Siew Mai. Size of Siew mai very small compared to last we had. Wont be gog there again.\n\nWent there for dinner few times. Up to 4 stars from 3. Hor fun was good.\n\nDecent food for late night supper.  Parking is abit challenging as there isn\u2019t any parking lots nearby.\n\nThe tim sum is excellent. Ordered the Carrot cake, chicken feet, liu sha bao and seafood roll are flavorful with right texture and serve piping hot. the fish head steamboat soup is well brewed, tasty and fish head is very fresh with yam, corn, cabbage, seawood and beancurd. Highly recommend.\n",

Their tandoori corner starts from 5pm onwards. Price wise expect to spend around 10 dollars per person. Their drinks are consistently good.\n\nThe Mee Siam has depth and is full of flavors.\nGreat selection of food and drinks with good service.\nLong established brand with large loyal customers.\n\nEveryone knows this is the place for decent Indian-Muslim food at any time of the day or night. The daily cooked Indian Mutton soup is a must-try, but they are ready only around 4pm. Actually, best after 7pm.\n\nHave been coming here since I moved to Yishun in 1986. Nothing much has changed except they now have an air-conditioned area next door and have some digitalisation. They now gives out receipts. See photo\n\nOne of the best Roti prata shops in my opinion. The curry puffs are great also. Will only eat when free parking is available along the row of shops.\n",

Maybe they can do more promo.\n\nDecent teochow Chinese food here at chin Lee\nQuite a hidden gem as it\u2019s tucked all the way in a corner on the second floor\nWe ordered set menu. Dishes we quite liked include the chicken, fish and prawn\nService is good and They were very accommodating with larger table as we came with children . Overall pretty good food and service\n\nIt\u2019s a hidden gem that only got to know this place now whereby they have been here for almost 2 years (open during covid time). Its actually sister restaurant from its main restaurant at Bedok. It\u2019s family friendly with mostly all round table setting. Easily good for 6-12 pax. This place can be very crowded so be there early to avoid disappointment. It\u2019s very spacious, nice ambience and comfortable to dine in. It\u2019s a Teochew restaurant, hence must try their signature dishes. Chilled Teochew Pork Trotter Jelly, Homemade Teochew Prawn Ball, Teochew Kway Teow are some of the must try. There is currently promotion on extra value set on weekdays dinner only which is really value for money. You can have choice of fish/prawn, chicken/duck/meat & veg/tofu/omelette on top rice, soup & tea/water. All good taste great and portion is decent for 4 adults. Especially the coffee pork ribs, it\u2019s tender juicy and yet flavorful. Kway Teow also got wok hey. The only disappointment we have got is we did not manage to get our oyster omelette \u8814\u714e order on our table during our 45 minutes dining time (6:45pm-7:30pm). Not sure if they missed our order but they claim that its still on order queue even we finished all our extra value meal. We just have to give up with disappointment. You can\u2019t expect customer to wait oyster omelette for another 30 minutes whereby you have already finished your dinner. Probably they just couldn\u2019t cope with the order and do not mind missing one or two customers along the queue in any case they will still sell it to a later customer (probably a shorter time).  That\u2019s a 2 star rating for Service. Hopefully can try it when my next visit (with reasonable waiting time).\n\nHad an assortment of dim sum for lunch. Overall pretty average. I reckon the cooked food might be better? It was quite crowded during lunch hour. The charsiew pau was probably the best of them all.\n\nAuthentic Teochew Cuisine.\nSat Dinner, luckily we have made a reservation as the place is almost full .\nBeing first timers we ordered a fair bit from the recommended list.\nFood is served very fast and they asked if we want to slow down the pace... and then last 3 dishes did not come till they activate again\ud83d\ude05\nI would say the food is within our expectations of a good teochew cuisine and portions are good.\nOnly exception is the teochew kway teow, L portion but hardly enough for 8 of us.\n",

The gentleman at the orders and cashier desk is efficient and the chef and plating staff work with a smile. The seating is abundant and the restaurant is clean and neat. All of this just adds to the actual taste of the food. Thumbs up to this branch of this franchise!\n\nEat this fried chicken from many outlet across Singapore, but this one still serve the best food. Not sure what different from others but the pieces cut in consistent every time and the flour batter is evenly spread on the chicken.  All the side dishes are good and fried to crispy when serve. It\u2019s come back if I crave for this fried chicken.\n\nChicken was a little bit pepperish. Seems a bit too much black pepper on it for my preference. The skin was crispy, didn't taste any spicy even though ordered spicy one. Overall ok only. Not that fantastic.\n\nUsually have a lot of people on queue that I never order this but today was less queue and I tried the chicken at last.\n\nThis place was quite busy around dinner time. Manage to visit before the crowd. It was quite sunny though around 4 to 5pm. We have to queue and the cashier will assign table for us after order over the counter. The fried chicken is quite nice, the sides can be chosen from various options. I took the onion rings and twisted fries but ended too much, should have gone with salad instead. This is a must try if you guys have not try it before to exercise your taste buds and find your preferences.\n\nNice fried chicken with various choice of side dishes. Alot of seatings as well, just avoid peak hours as they conviniently opened till 10pm. The staffs were friendly and nice ambience with not so loud music as well.

Service is prompt, and the taste of the food is delicious. Recommend.\n\nThe pork cutlet is expertly prepared, boasting tenderness on the inside and a delightful crispiness on the outside, complemented by a flavorful sauce. However, it's worth noting that the prices lean towards the higher side; my meal, along with a drink, totaled $30. Nevertheless, the restaurant's charming ambiance, infused with a touch of history, makes it a great choice for special occasions or an occasional treat. With both indoor air-conditioned seating and non-ACed options available, and the beach just a stone's throw away, it caters to various preferences. Moreover, their diverse menu spans Chinese, Western, and local cuisines. For those looking for a budget-friendly option, they offer a more affordable brunch set before 12pm on weekends.\n\nGreat place to escape the crowds. Nice and quiet most weekdays, especially at lunch. Fusion menu, think British Hainan food. Pork chops and satay are great. Wash it down with beer or a Long Island Iced Tea. Best part is the ambiance. Throw back in time. No wonder the black and whites are so popular. On cool day try sitting in the non aircon areas under the fans. From an era a long time ago!\n\nWas here for a Saturday lunch. Service was fast and the staff were very attentive. The portions were generous (ordered all small except for fried rice) and was sufficient for 6 + 2 pax!\n\nCelebrated our Mother\u2019s Day here.\nWe make an advanced booking during this special day.\n\nThe restaurant is in the heart of Sembawang park, ppls who stay near by should know the restaurant but due to location not near to town so this many be their weakness point to attract crowd.\n\nRestaurant very vintage , n colony style, it\u2019s quite spacious & quiet, there have aircon n open area.\nVery good for taking nice picture\n\nWe ordered quite some foods , portion was just nice but all taste was good, reasonable price and aft food can just slow walk around the park. definitely will come back again\n",

The chill vibe and cooling environment with fans made it a pleasant spot, but be warned about the mosquitoes. Luckily, we arrived early, as the place filled up quickly. Although the food took a while to be served, the quality and generous portions made up for it. It might be a bit pricey, but the overall vibe is worth it. We will visit again with friends next time.\n\nDiscovered this hidden gem after driving by and the atmosphere was alluring. Looked like a full house, but staff made space for us. I was already expecting a bit of a slow wait, so bearing that in mind, food was definitely worth the wait. Drinks (root beer and Heineken bottle) came within 5 minutes of sitting down, first dish (fried rice) came around 30+ min after, and everything else came quite quickly after that.\nHighly recommend the onion rings, satay and fish and chips. Serving sizes were generous and tasted great.\nNot sure what\u2019s with the recent low reviews - this place definitely is a charm for what it is. If you\u2019re expecting super fast, quick, and \u201chigh class\u201d restaurant vibes, then this isn\u2019t the spot for you. If you\u2019re looking to chill, have a hearty meal, enjoy the atmosphere without rush, then this little gem of a cafe does the job.\n\nOur experience at woody\u2019s cafe was okay . Food was overpriced, my wife and i ordered the bua keluak burger, pork ribs, onion rings and satay . We only enjoyed the satay and onion rings. The burger\u2019s sauce was too salty for our liking, and the pork ribs was not that meaty and tasted bleh. We liked the unique atmosphere though.\n\nA lovely place to chill. As I was driving so didn't drink. They have a good selection of food and drinks. Must try if you're ard the area or at least Tey to make yr way there. Secluded and quiet. Go on a weekday as I heard it is usually very packed on the weekend.\n\nGood satay. Avoid the chicken salad if you want less calories n vegetables, it\u2019s loaded with chicken and sauce. Rustic and great place to hang out for a drink at night. The next time I will try their peranakan dishes. There is no ac, so it can get hot in the day.\n",

My girl couldn't finish her food and she was so pleased because the food was packed nicely w napkins and a small tub of sauce that she had initially already finished.\n\nCame first time for a quick lunch without expecting too much, but the steak was surprisingly good especially for the price! Ordered coleslaw and baked potato for sides and they were fresh and delicious too. Overall affordable and good quality food!\n\nUpdated\nOrdered herb grilled fish. Chosen mac and cheese and potato salad. Cost $12.50.\n\nFirst of all it took like 30min. Second the fish was terrible. Very tough. Taste wise the cream sauce pulled it through.\n\nMac and cheese was undercooked..\n\nPotato salad was good but need smaller potato.\n\nOverall just get the chicken instead.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nOrder black pepper chicken chop for $11.90. Side I choose pasta salad and mash potato.\n\nGodly\nChicken. Damn tender and juicy. Maybe char can be better or it can be more chicken taste but black pepper covered the taste. Luckily black pepper sauce was awesome as well. This is really better than their steak, it should be legendary chicken.\n\nPro\nBlack pepper sauce. Tasty! Only down side is it over shadows taste of original food.\n\nU can choose your slides\n\nMeh\nPasta salad. Still better than coleslaws I guess.\n\nMash potato. Not very good, not buttery or as smooth as some hawker mash potato.\n\nI've been here countless times.\nOne word of advice: don't be there at opening as the grill items may not be cooked to perfection.\n\nThis round I went at lunch time on a weekday and no crowd so was great.\nNo need to order and pay at the counter. You will be directed to your table, to scan qr code to view menu and payment to be done through the link. I love this, finally!!\nWe ordered 2 meals:\n1. hickory bbq grill chicken with 2 sides -mac and cheese & potato wedges\n2. Black pepper grill chicken with same sides as the above.\n\nThe mac and cheese is different from the ones you get from other shops. You can taste artificial cheese in it but the taste just grows on you, haha. I love it. The potato wedges goes so well with the cheese sauce too.\n\nPrompt and efficient service too. Will come back for more.\n\norder beef steak Medium cooked and it came rare so spoke to waiter and told him it is medium but came rare so he made kitchen to recook and came as a new steak but still slightly rare but abit better so the end we had it instead as not to waste food.wrote to aston and they said will notify the outlet thats all..not sincere about the experience we face and they cant cook medium at all very poor service nowadays..\n",

Will definitely recommend anyone to come and try\n\n1/10/2023\nBack here again, food and service still as amazing!!\n\n2022\nGreat restaurant. Great service, food was great and their portion is big. Would definitely recommend to all! Celebrated my uncles birthday here! Thoroughly enjoyed ourselves! Staff was accommodating as well! :)\n\nNice Hokkien restaurant serving traditional dishes. Try their version of UFO which is the deep fried bun with oyster. Love the traditional Hokkien Mee also with thick gravy and that flavour that only comes with pork lard, love it! Must try!\n\nNice tasty dishes and very affordable. No svc charge! Generous servings and attentive service. The roast peking duck looks v crispy,  shall try next time. Will revisit again with more friends after our next walking trip nearby windsor/thomson nature park/lower pierce/bishan park.\n",

Had to split seating 3 at 1 table and 1 more at another \ud83d\ude12 What to do. Anyway, other than the slight inconvenience, it was still a wonderful dining experience. The promotional meal set was worth it. Came with 1 main, 2 sides and drink. Gyu Don was tasty. Other sushi dishes were ok.\n\nFood was average until the soft shell came. The dish was a disaster,  horrendous ! The 1st bite of it my husband spit out! The meat inside was actually still raw. He was so uncomfortable and told the staff. Guess the staff is a part time, without apologizing she just took the whole plate behind. Moments later she came back with the food , same plate cos it's the same portion. Hubby gave it another try. Then again , he spit out ! It's beyong savage ! The crab was really smells! It's so bad! The taste lingered in my hubby's mouth tat he wanted to puke !\nThen after we spoke to the incharge Miss Laura. A very pleasant incharge whereby she expressed her apologies over the incident.\nJust would like to nudge the management please look into the quality of your food as this is F&B industry which who knows may result in food poisoning.\n\nThe food quality is above average. But too pricey for its quality.\nThe only selling point I can think up is that this restaurant is halal.\n\nDecent meal at one of the pioneer Halal sushi joints in Singapore. Slightly on the pricey side, requires a bit of experience in choosing food items that are value for money.\n\nSalmon sashimi is thick and fresh, however without the 1-for-1 promotion it\u2019s rather expensive. The rest of the food items are average, special shoutout for the Spicy Salmon Gunkan which is a must for me everytime I come! :)\n\nOverall, with more and more Halal Japanese joints on the rise, I\u2019d come visit again if it\u2019s convenient.\n\nHonestly the foods here aren\u2019t fresh. Wasn\u2019t my first time eating at Hei Sushi but the one at Woodlands Civic Centre is much more fresh then the ones at Sembawang Shopping Centre. Took a bite of the sushi and the rice was super rock hard and didn\u2019t taste nice at all. The fish portion was smaller then the ones at Woodlands. The fishy smell was even there too. Its like the fishes has been kept for a few days before it was served. Not to forget even their edamame too, some of it taste sour already. Half portion couldn\u2019t be eaten after i take a bite of it. Service was also quite disappointing. When i mentioned that i came alone, the server looks like shock and just pointed to the sit without saying anything. They were seen like they were just talking more then actual working. But i am really disappointed with the foods there. For such an expensive menu, your foods should be served fresh just like how Woodlands outlet does. Wouldn\u2019t recommend anyone to come to Sembawang outlet. For a total bill of $68 for 1 pax, its a major disappointment. The only item that\u2019s not disappointing is only their dessert.\n",

Claiming to offer authentic Persian cuisine, the reality is a disappointing mix of flavors that lean more towards Indian than Persian. The kebabs, dry and tasteless, are a stark contrast to the rich flavors expected from Persian cooking. Equally disheartening is the rice \u2013 cold, undercooked, and lacking the basic essence of Persian culinary art. This establishment, once perhaps a bastion of authentic cuisine, now serves as a reminder of how far it has strayed from its original glory.\n\nFlavourful middle-eastern cuisine, the dips were delicious.\nNice al fresco dinning areas.\nThank you, Ronny for the great host that makes our dinner wonderful. We appreciate your service.\n\nCame back to this lovely Persian restaurant after 3-4 years to celebrate the Wife\u2019s birthday. Last time here was for dinner, with the belly dancer floating around!\n\nThis time we were seated indoors due to the afternoon heat! Last few times were seated outside by the river which is lovely in the evening.\n\nIt was quite busy on a Sunday afternoon ! The food was as good as we remembered it to be.\n\nLook forward to coming back here\u2026 sooner this time :-)\n\nflavourful and appetising Persian food! had an enjoyable alfresco dinner by the river with a very accommodating food attendant. the dessert was delicious but the faludeh shirazi was a tad too sweet for us. maybe next time will just stick with the saffron ice cream on top of the faludeh, sooo good. will go back to try more food on the menu!\n\nWe enjoy a spread of 3-Course Middle-eastern set lunch for $48++ per person. \ud83c\udf77And we add on 2 hours of Toi Toi Sara\u2019s Rose free flow for $40++ per person.

The flour/starch was super hard and all in small bits like fried crumps. There were only 5-6 pieces of oyster and they were over cooked and felt mushy.\nOnly the chilli is good, but it is the same chilli you get everywhere, nothing special\n\nDate of visit: Wed 4 Oct 2023\nTime : 9.50 pm\n\nTried the fried oyster omelet flour \u8017\u714efor the first time. Priced at $5.\n\nEgg was over fried. The flour was too oily. See what remains on my plate.\n\nCarrot Cake / Chye Tow Kueh (SGD $5) @ Bedok North 85 Fried Oyster Carrot Cake.\n.\nThis remains a popular stall in an equally popular hawker centre, though allegations that quality varies by the mood of the chefs has some truth.\n.\nGenerally above average and decent value for money, the plates borders the edge of smoky goodness, with soft moist texture to the carrot cake, and a good spread of egg over.\n.\nThe black is better, as the dark sweet soy sauce with the egg creates a tasty sweet eggy savoury salty flavour. The white loses slightly as it lacks crispness, and the savoury sweet eggy salty flavour is mild.\n.\n.\n.\nFried Oyster Omelette (SGD $5) @ 85 Bedok North Fried Oyster.\n.\nThis popular supper spot has decent quality of dishes.\n.\nTheir version has more distinct chunks of fluffy egg and soft crisp potato starch, making it great for those who don't like it mixed.\n.\nThe oysters are medium sized and juicy. Lends briny salty sweet flavour to the smoky eggy savoury notes of the base. Chili has a nice spicy sour kick that builds on the palate.\n\nThe oyster egg portion is big for 8 dollars. The best part is actually the sauce that comes with it.\n\nDespite the 2.8 goggle review, still decide to give this bedok north oyster omelette stall a try. The S$5 hokkien mee is decent, and I like their chilli so I asked for more \ud83d\ude0b.\n\nReview as posted on my IG: Yummymich\n",

Ordered a small meatball noodle soup priced at $3.50.\n\nQuite many people ordered. Got the beeper to inform you when it\u2019s ready.\n\nSoup is alright but salty. Noodles are springy maybe tough for old folks. Portion quite small.\n\nOverall taste is good.\n\nMore than 10years apart, the taste and flavour are well maintained!\nComfort food.\nSoup is simple yet comforting.\nNoodle texture is done just right. Minced meat blends well with the hot soup and tastes really great with the noodle.\n\nRelatively clean and very organised in terms of ordering system and buzzer.\nSpeed is quick as there is a system within the store.\n\nI love the broth so much as even though it is very greasy and oily, the soup has a sweetness from the minced meat, and the alkalinity of the thick mee kia noodles is not too heavy. The noodles are so chewy and quick thick. I love it!! Minced meat is soft and generous as well. The addition of the dumplings is a must! It has sa fragrant sole fish flavour in it.\n\nUsing the old school style of ceramic bowl, it feels like I'm eating my grandma's food \u2764\ufe0f\n\nFirst time trying a soup version of Bak Chor Mee! Maybe because I was never a fan of bak chor mee, this soup version tasted underwhelming for me. The soup felt under seasoned and the noodles were quite average. The only thing I like about this dish is that they gave a lot of pork balls at only $4.50! Overall a underwhelming experience for me....\n\nThis is a nice bowl of soupy bak chor mee. They do one item and do it well, and no wonder it has a big following and long queues.\n\nTried the $4.5 Bak chor Mee on a Sunday morning. Luckily, no line and was served in 2 minutes.\n\nOne thing that is distinctly clear is the number of meat balls, which are really soft and nice to chew.\n\nThe soup is nice and not like water. Good flavour. Asked for extra chilli, and that adds some much needed spice. Good amount of minced meat as well. Noodles are soft.\n\nThis is a feel-good meal.\n",

They has improved a lots. The curry flavour was well balance, not too salty, spiciness just nice, not too oily and portion was decent and price is reasonable.\n\nAs compared to the famous and popular curry chicken noodle at Hong Lim food centre, they are not as good as that top standard, but their flavour and taste was already very close. In fact, their portion is bigger than the popular one.\n\nGlad to see their great improvements and no wonder always long queue. Highly recommended if you like curry chicken noodle.\n\n\ud83d\udca5 Welcome to my food sharing Instagram: jkgourmets. \u6b22\u8fce\u6e38\u89c8\u6211\u7684\u7f8e\u98dfIG: jkgourmets\n\nA simple above average curry noodles.\nPro tip, adding too much chilli yourself will alter the taste. You will not taste the curry aroma and instead you will only taste peanut flavour kinda gravy.\nThere may gut be a long queue during peak hours.\n\nRemember to put extra sambal into your curry chicken noodles for the spiciness and fragrant. Always ordered the medium size, as small size was never enough for my craving of it. A single bowl of CCN served with a generous portion of Hainanese Steamed Chicken and tau pok, the meat was juicy and tender. Overall it taste good and delicious.\n\nLong queue for a reason, and will queue for it again!\n\nThere's always a long queue. It's my second time (gave it a second chance), but i can't quite fathom why still. The soup is the most distinct part of the dish here imo; it's more milky than most others and perhaps this is its draw, but my friend and i couldn't get into it. Everything else is rather on par with the average curry chicken noodles, and you might get better cuts of chicken if you're lucky. As a bonus, the chicken portion is rather generous.\n\nSo not worth it! Just 2 pcs of chicken meat and so many tau pok and 1 pc potato.  I'd rather get the curry noodle at golden mile market. So much tastier.\n",

The price and taste of the food are 5 stars but the atmosphere is 3 star because it can be a bit dark if u are dining at the inside of the hawker centre.\n\nOne advice I give is to avoid stores that always have no queue during lunch and dinner hours. There is a reason why they have no queue think about. I would not name stores but u will notice it yourself\n\nLots of nice local food here. Many long established food stalls are here too. Seating areas quite spaced out and with big ceiling fans. Shouldn\u2019t miss irbid hawker centre I f you are looking for good and affordable local foods. It\u2019s next to Bedok Mall, Bedok Bus Interchange and of course Bedok MRT Station. There\u2019s a Djitsun Mall nearby too.\n\nThese is a huge hawker centre with Many delicious and famous food here! These hawkers have been running their stalls here for years!\n\nThis is one of the best place that you can get almost all the best tastes of Singapore food at the affordable price!\n\nLook for those with long queues and let the patrons guide you to find the best!\n\nMy Recommendation:\nBedok Chwee Kueh\nNasi Lemak\nTiong Bahru Pau\nMee Goreng\nNasi Briyani Mutton\nMee Rebus\nStewed soup\nVegetarian\nSatay Bee Hoon\nSteamed Chicken Rice\nFish Soup Porridge\nFried Carrot Cake\nPrawn Noodle\nFried Hokkien Mee\nDesserts\nHerbal Mutton Soup\nMala Hotpot\nSpinach Soup\nSatay\nSugarcane\nKway Chap\nFishball Noodle\nBeancurd Desserts\n\nFood variety \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\nWallet friendly \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\nCleanliness \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\n\nFew things to improve for this place that I can see are the hygiene issue and the birds\u2026\n\nI grew up eating at this hawker center for nearly 20 years.

Always order the large one.\n\nMeatballs are good and the noodles are quite al dente.\n\nThere are a few bak chok noodle stalls in this hawker centre.  This stall served not only soup noodle but also dry noodle.\n\nThis is my preferred stall as the meat balls and minced meat were tastier for my liking.  I also prefer their ordering system.\n\nYou will be given a caller after your order.  You do not have to wait there.  While waiting for the food, you could queue for other stalls.\n\nSoup was thick and rich filled with minced meat, noodle springy. Pair with generous amount of fishballs and meatballs.\nA bit tough to find seats and parking lot during weekend peak hour.\n\nOrdered the small portion. Was quite satisfying. Love the overall taste. Bring back many memories of those late night supper at Bedok 85 back then. Will definitely come back again.\n",

We will be back to try new dishes~\n\nwaiter and waitress(chinese) was very hospitable.\n\nOne of many outlets in Singapore serving hearty German fare and beer. Akin to a German beer hall in atmosphere with friendly staff serving the delicious food. Visiting during Oktoberfest presents more food and drink options and that makes it very popular, requiring advance booking. Value for money considering the amount of meat that\u2019s served.\n\nI am a Germann living in the US and visiting Singapore. This place is absolutely amazing. The food is authentic and delicious. They even import the breadcrumbs for the Schnitzel from Austria. The Erdinger Helles was one of the best I have had. Five stars all around! (and yes, I went 3 times here in 4 days)\n\nHad a great time at this place. As much as I love Asian cuisine, after about 13 days it is always nice to go back to some western comforts and you can\u2019t go wrong with a chicken schnitzel and a beer. The staff were all great and always made sure to serve your beer with the obligatory \u201cPr\u014dst!\u201d which is generally used to say \u201cCheers!\u201d The deserts were nice and the ambience at this location was quite calm which is a welcome change to the busy street markets, food courts and hawker centres. Really glad I visited!\n\nThis is a nice German beerhouse in Katong and has a few branches around the island. A reservation is recommended as it's quite popular and fills up fast.\n\nService is friendly and quick. Beer are strong and taste great in the sweltering Singapore heat. We tried the following -\n\n1) Schweinshaxn (Signature Pork knuckle) - So so good. Crispy but meaty, this is a good rendition of pork knuckle. It was so much that we had to pack some of it. Served with bacon sauerkraut and potato salad.\n\n2) Brezn (4x Pretzel) - Liked how this was presented, but the taste is okay.\n",

Overall a tasty treat able to satisfy your dessert cravings and at low price of 3 dollars per bowl. No take away fee.\n\nThis is the best Cheng Tng in SG! A refreshing dessert featuring the natural sweetness of sweet potato, the chewy richness of dried persimmon, and the subtle crunch of winter melon strips.  It's thirst-quenching and perfectly balances flavors and textures. With each bite, you'll experience a symphony of tastes that rejuvenate your palate on a hot day. Do note it's with ice chips, not shaved ice.\n\nUsed to come here for the Cheng Tng in the past. However, standard has dropped over the years and it is not as good as before.\n\nOverall, still a decent bowl of Cheng Tng, although price has also increased due to inflation: $3 per bowl.\n\nVery generous with the variety of ingredients they used!\n\nSurprised to find strips of dried permission and even sweet potato chunks in it! Portion was huge and it\u2019s was such a delight to have this on a hot day.\n\nOnly wishing for it the be less sweet and served in shaved ice.\n\nFor cyclist, this is a great stop for a break!\n\nA nice bowl of cheng teng.

Dry laksa is also amazing.\n\nAll is nice but really recommend the signature mee tai mak!\n\nOmy the mtm is really good! so much textures & flavours...can't really pinpoint everything but it is defo a pleasureable one!\n\nLaska was lemak fragrant & really special!\n\nMee siam was OK, but I think cos I was wowed by the earlier 2 dishes more! But still a lovely dish though I wished it more tangy in its flavours!\n\nPrawn paste chicken wings and prawn rolls are very nice. Dry meesiam is great after adding lime! Dry laksa is pretty good too. Mee tai Mak is not bad.\n\nTried the dry laksa small portion and the prawn roll. Was blown away by the taste. Also bought a calamamsi spread home to try. Will be back to try the mee tai bak and har cheong kai next round. Love that everything on their menu is tasty yet fairly priced. Will recommend that one order the medium size portion. Small portion is just not enough.\n\nOrdered the dried laksa and mee siam. Both are bad. Dried laksa lacks the usual laksa aromatics eg. haebi, laksa leaf. Can only taste coconut milk. Dried mee siam is sweet and too wet a consistency. Overall just badly executed.\n",

Quite a small hawker centre with limited tables so it is best advised to be early to get your seats. Some of the stalls like the famous bak chor mee can be busy during peak periods and waiting time can be up to 45mins. Most of the stalls are self service. Not so much service there as we order and pay first, when the beeper beeps then you go collect. Tables are quite clean at times as most of us clear up after we eat. Prices of food are quite reasonable depending on what you order. Nice place for gathering with friends.

Only few stalls are opened. Tried foods as per photo. Amazing delicious!!\n\nPig organ soup with mee sua- vey thick herbal soup, pork kidney and pork liver are very clean without smell. The pork slices are very think and smooth.\n\nNasi lemak- OMG! It looks so ordinary but ho\u2026 I tell you, the chicken wing is a MUST to try! Marinated with spices and very juicy!!!! Lemak rice taste good as well.\n\nTeow Chew fish ball noodle- the soup was long boiled with soybean and ikan bilis. Very clear soup based. I saw the soybean and ikan bilis still boiling in the soup. I couldn\u2019t resist and asked a small portion to taste. OMG!!! Indeed very fresh ingredients! Fish ball also very chewy without fishy smell.\n\nI also tried the Teow Chew laksa- their sambal got dried shrimp and shallot. Very fragrance and can eat bowls of rice just with it! Laksa gravy is very thick and fragrance. Beside si ham, they also served lala with the laksa.\n\nMy sons told me food here are even better than Bedok 85 food market!

Dishes were not too salty. Can\u2019t ask a lot on the service as it is a hawker stall. We spent $30 for 2 of us. Might come back and try other dishes as stall owner seemed passionate and diligent with his craft.\n\nDecided to do a dinner take-away at  this zi char stall at Blk.16 Bedok South. Wait time was slightly shorter than 20 minutes even though there were a bit of a queue. Pretty fast I must say. Ordered the following dishes and my taste bud's verdict: 1) Sweet sour fish; It tasted ok. Nothing to shout about. 2) Black soy sauce pork with ginger; The pork slices were tender with a nice gingery taste. The bits of fried pork lard gave an additional porky flavour. 3) Fried sambal kangkong; Sambal flavour was nicer than most places. 4) Fried rice; The rice was lumpy and soggy. There wasn't any wok-hei flavour in it. Disappointment. 5) Fried prawn paste chicken (Har cheong gai); Perhaps the best dish. The chicken wings were crispy on the outside and tender and juicy inside. My favourite dish here. 6) Fried tofu with vegetables; Tasted just like any other zi char stall. It's saving grace was the bits of fried pork lard which added an extra texture to the dish. Overall verdict: It's about the same as the average hawker centre/coffee shop zi char stalls.\n\nWe (3 covers) had Har Cheong Gai, crayfish soup, bitter gourd pork ribs, prawn omelette, and mixed vegetables with one rice for $48.\n\nIt\u2019s a busy stall so it\u2019s best to arrive and order before 7pm. Make your payment at the point of order and make sure you know your table number. Har Cheong Gai was amazingly juicy and crisply fried! The meat inside was tender but not very flavorful.\n\nOverall it\u2019s a great value, and delicious to boot!\n\nGem of a zhi char store at the hawker centre of Blk 216 Bedok North street 1. The food is generally delicious and cooked with good wok hei.\n\nThe prawn paste chick is crispy on the outside with good prawn paste flavour, and juicy on the inside. The braised red garoupa fish head with bitter gourd is very well seasoned, and for us the star of this meal. The Kang kong is properly cooked.\n\nPrices are not quite Hawker centre level, but for the  food you get it\u2019s well worth the money in my view.\n\nOne slight drawback: if you\u2019re going for dinner, there are few other stalls open except for Sin Ho, so you\u2019ll have to buy your own drinks.\n\nHighly recommended.\n\nThey served a delicious seafood soup with a awesome broth. And the prawn paste chicken was equally tasty. It was nicely fried and had a fragrant prawn paste taste.\n",

The little more heat with its chilli sauce would be great!\n\nExpect to queue for 20 minutes \ud83d\ude09\n\nExcellent comfort food, especially on a rainy day! Totally worth braving the rains for.\n\nConsistently delicious ever since they opened years ago. They have the most tender and flavourful pork ribs I\u2019ve ever tried from a prawn noodle stall, and they have such great balance of fat and meat. Decent bite sized pieces for ease of eating and they literally fall off the bones.\n\nThe prawns are so fresh, succulent and sweet! The bright orange hue on these prawns are the most vibrant I\u2019ve seen at a prawn mee stall. The shells are peeled too, but fret not they meticulously leave the heads on for extra flavour boost! The soup has a well balanced richness without being too sweet or heavy (generous amount of soup too).\n\nThe chilli sauce really hits the spot of savory and heat. The fried garlic and shallots atop add great aroma and I especially love that they don\u2019t scrimp on the vegetables! I\u2019m in awe watching the team at work. Dining here is really always a treat.\n\nWanted to order $5 prawn bee hoon soup but the guy serving the customers asked me if I wanted to top up to $7 for more prawns. Since I waited for 20min, might as well. Regretted it though cos although the prawns were very fresh, I didn't think it was worth $7. There were 4 prawns, some bean sprouts and kang kong, fried pork lard and bee hoon. Soup was not flavourful enough. An OK bowl of prawn noodles but not worth queuing 20min for it. Not sure why there is a queue for this.\n\nSaw many people eating it so I tried too. Prawns are big and fresh, not like the wrinkled ones some stalls serve. Noodles are nice. Soup is really good. Tried the $5, was good portion but I think I will get the $7 next time.\n\nOperated by 2 young guys keep it up!\n\nAmazing prawn mee with pork ribs. Pork ribs are very soft and you even can chew and eat the soft bone. Prawn soup is also very good. Love it when the prawns are not in halves and are de-shelled. Heartening to see young hawkers whipping up really good prawn mee. There are always long queue, even with aunties and uncles.\n",

Had ordered for 2 person and added additional pork trotter and additional pork belly. Meat was so tender with the right amount of fats. Kway was smooth to the taste. Chilli was great addition to bring it up a notch. Worth every kilo, I m putting on. Hahahaha. Keep it up.\n\nVery very long queue and expect to wait up to 30mins time. The kway chap is peppery and different from the usual. I believe they used many ingredients to boil the soup.\n\nIt is worth a try, if you are ok to wait in the queue!\n\nBeen wanting to try for quite some time but always didn't manage because of the long queue. Decided that I should at least try once.\n\nWaited in queue for about half hour or so. They served standard set at $6 for 1 pax. You can state what you want or add more ingredients if you like.\n\nOverall, the kway chap was delicious and certainly lived up to the long queue everyday!\n\nOrdered 3 pax worth of kway chap for 2 pax. No awful/stinky smell, intestines are cleaned thoroughly, hair on pig skin is also removed (bought from this store multiple times, didn\u2019t recall any purchase having observable hair follicle on the pig skin). Kway is silky and light. Overall, a hearty meal.\nOnly downside, definitely be prepared to q if you come on weekends. Waiting time is at least 15-30mins, depending on the time you come by.\n\nSo-so only. Very soft but ok nothing to shout about. The queue is long but the speed of serving is even worse. Which I think is why the queue is kept long always. I ordered one more egg and chicken feet so that set me back by $10.\n",

I am so glad that I did, or else I wouldn\u2019t have known what I have missed out all along. This is definitely quality nasi lemak. For $4.40 for the ingredients shown, it is really value for money and delicious till the last bits - big and juicy chicken wing, authentic otah, thick-cut luncheon meat and crispy ikan bilis, and top notch rice and chilli. Because of the constant queue and quick turnover, the food is hot which adds to the pure enjoyment.\n\nValue for money nasi lemak! You can expect a continuous long queue (as seen in the picture) in the early morning or lunch time. Fried chicken wings are well done, crispy and tasty.\n\nLong queue but it\u2019s move fast because there\u2019s 2-3 staff at the counter helping with the ordering and packing of foods. Their fried anchovies very nice and crispy. Fried chicken was soft and nice too. Sambal chilli not too spicy. Overall is not bad and will definitely come back again.\n\nBeen eating the nasi lemak from this particular stall at bedok 216 hawker centre for at least the last 20 years. Used to takeaway their food on the weekend in the past. Happen to be running some errands near to 216 market decided to pop by for breakfast. I was quite surprised there wasnt a queue when i reached the stall. There were only 3 people ahead of me.\n\nOrdered the stir fried long bean, fried boneless chicken thigh and sunny side up egg. Paid SGD$3 for my meal. Food was still nice after so many years. Room for improvement for the stir fried long bean as it tasted a little undercooked. Chili is on the sweeter side.\n\nShortly after purchasing my food, the long queue started.Overall, still enjoy the food. They only do takeaway over here.\n\nOne of the best Nasi lemak in the East, Otah & boneless chicken is the highlight! Otah is spicy yet savoury and boneless chicken is crispy and juicy, waiting time varies from 10-30 minutes! If you are driving, there is a carpark just right beside the hawker center, if it\u2019s full, alternative there is a linked multi-story carpark.\n",

Undoubtedly, this humble hawker stall remains an unbeatable classic, continually serving what I consider to be some of the best porridge in Singapore. The porridge remains as mesmerizingly smooth as I remembered, capturing the essence of this beloved local staple.

You can tell the stall puts in effort to use only the freshest, highest quality ingredients. But the standout for me was their homemade chili sauce. It had a uniquely rich and complex flavor that packed just the right amount of heat. The sauce alone is worth a return visit for.\n\nService was quick and friendly without being overbearing. There's a reason people were lining up even on a weekday - the food here is truly that delicious. I'm obsessive about finding the best hawker fare, and this little gem easily blew all my previous favorites out of the water.\n\nThis will definitely be my first recommendation anytime someone asks about must-try hawker stalls in the area!\n\nFirst time at bedok 85.

For a basic $4 order of fish ball mee pok, you get a fish dumpling, 2 meatballs, and about 3 or 4 yellow-tail fish balls with the noodles. You can also get 10 meatballs or fish balls for $3, or 20 fish dumplings for $6.\n\nEvery component is done really well, especially the yellow-tail fish balls and chili for the noodles. The fish balls are a good balance between springy and tender, and are flavorful. The chili is fragrant and leaves you wanting more with each bite. No frills, seemingly no secrets, just a fantastic and humble bowl of fish ball mee pok.\n\nThis stall is located within the popular Bedok 216 hawker center. Been patronizing this stall for more than 20years and the standard is the same till date , the only thing that stop me from eating it often is the waiting time and long queue. So if you wanna try, do be prepared to queue more than 30mins. Noodles was nicely cooked and springy, soup was excellent, light and tasty. The highlights is actually their handmade fishball, smaller size compared to those we usually eat but the freshness and texture make up from it. Personally I find the seasoning is alittle too salty to my liking else this will be one of the perfect fishball noodles around.\n\nA long queue snakes a corner unit of Blk 216 Bedok Food Centre and Market on a typical Thursday lunchtime. Queue moved quite fast and was informed there has to be mix of Fishballs and Meatballs as they were running out of Fishballs.\n\nService wise, the lady taking the order will help you take the tray, chopsticks and spoon, a rare occurrence amongst hawkers.\n\nFishballs tasted good, meatballs tasted generic but I have no complains. For the $5 portion shown, it provides exceptional value amid rising costs.\n\npayment options: cash and cashless\n\nOpening hours:\n630am - 130pm\nRest day: Wednesdays\n\nIf you are a fishball noodle lover, it is very likely you have eaten here (as well as the one at 538 Bedok North) many times. Somehow I like the presentation here better, and it seems the portion is more generous. The fishball is very soft and I particularly like the soup here which tastes sweet it is boiled with soy beans. There is some queue so expect some waiting especially if you go at peak hours.\n\nThis stall always has a long queue.  today I wanted to give it a try, which required a queue of more than half an hour.  curious about the taste, the fish ball is not too salty and I like the texture which is soft and not too chewy, not too fishy either.  the noodles are not that much different from other stalls.  the soup is fresher and not too salty.\n",

Sold out by 6pm :o love the herbal soup :))\n\n538 kitchen stall foods are nice, and prices are reasonable.\n\nLotz of food variety here at very reasonable prices. Can come and try. I had 1 bowl of Laksa plus 1 ice coffee, cost me $5.10.\n\nI saw a few trays of eggs being sun outside at the temp of 35-37c.. that's a risk of breeding bacteria in the raw eggs and can subject to food poisoning esp in the elderly who has weaker immunity. I cannot confirm which stall does that, but it is sun together with some dried fish. And only 1 stall facing the tray of eggs uses dried fish and plenty of eggs in their noodles. Go figure out. NEA should do an investigation in this.\n\nThere\u2019s this small unique shop in between the hawker Center and the wet market #01-14 that sells attractive and value-4-$ stuff; check it out!\n",

Good value meal!\n\nIt been years since i last came here, since my mom wish to visit this hawker after watching some youtubbers video, so came see see and find some nice food. I start my day with a bowl of pretty nice soy chicken noodles, noodles was springy and chicken was tender. Kwap chap not bad also, forgot to take pictures of it.\ud83e\udd2d since we sitting right in front of fried kwap teow so we decide join in the crowd\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f. 45 mins of wait, char kwap teow was okok but the wait is way too long. The kopi o from jia ping coffee stall was nice and fragrant. \ud83d\udc4d\n\nA market that comprises of both the wet and dry market. Good variety of food here for the locals to consume and fill their tummies. Very convenient place situated beside a Junior College! Friendly bird also that sometimes visit your table to check up on you and want to share your food\n\nThis has always been one of my favourite hawker centres since young. After renovation, it is now clean, spacious and airy. There are lots of good food here for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Famous stalls include the fishball noodles, rojak, nasi briyani etc. My favourite drink stall is Farah\u2019s cafe. The owners are super friendly \ud83d\ude0a. Cheers.\n\nMy friend from Temasek JC (right opposite this hawker centre) claimed that this place has the best mala in town. So I came here and chose a bunch of veggies to make a vegetarian mala bowl for my friend and I, and oh my god, it was so delicious, the peanuts gave such a good crunch, the spice was just right, the lotus stem and bean curd were so yum and the overall meal was so flavourful and filling. Definitely a must try!!! And I must say, the lady who made our mala was also so sweet :)\nThe opposite stall had Teh Peng which was amazing too but just a note, they only accept cash and CDC vouchers, so do bring cash/vouchers along with you!\n",

The bean curd vegetable dish was on the bland side. Our fried rice had some wok hei but the portion is more for a person instead of 2. The herbal prawns (6 of them) soup was not over powering of herbs if one is not fond of angelica. The free dessert was white fungus with red dates. Although sweet, it was cold and a nice way of ending my meal. Good thing abt this place is no GST or service charge and actually the service personnel is attentive and polite. Food was served fast as well.\n\nPutian style food place. Neat and nice location. Ordered the set meal for 2 pax. Food is tasty enough but portion is more for small eaters. In fact the portion can be finished by 1 person with big appetite. Drinks like tea and coffee can be ordered from the coffee shop next door and consumed.\n\n1. They have worms in their broccoli. I found 2 worms so i minus 2 stars\n2. They served me one of the hardest and toughest chicken i\u2019ve eaten so i minus 1 star\nThe rest of the food served tastes fine, not too bad lor.\nBut if you have a fear of worms I don\u2019t recommend you to come (:\n\nFast turn around, fast serving, attentive staff, friendly and great food.\n\nHighly recommended the xin hua thin noodle if you like stir fried bee hoon. If you like soupy kind, you can op for fujian noodle.\n\nIf you can take raw seafood, you can try the garlic raw cockles.\n\nA very popular small eatery in Lorong Ah Soo. About 4 tables inside and 4 outside the restaurant. Can get crowded at peak hours for lunch and dinner. Ample parking available.\n\nTried the Putian Lor Mee and fried sweet potato noodles. Flavour is mild but delicious. At $6 for 1 pax it is reasonable price for restaurant setting.\n\nCan order dishes when dining with more pax. There is enough variety for a yummy lunch or dinner.\n",

But I think their usp is the sauce of the chicken chop, so the fish and chips just soso lah and they even didn\u2019t give tartar sauce just a normal mayonnaise. Recommended for all their chops except fish and chips.\n\nTried this stall many years ago and ventured to try out again with my son and daughter. There's a pretty long queue but it is moving fast with efficiency. We ordered mixed grill ($12), Pork Chop ($7) and Chicken Chop ($7). The friendly service crew processed the orders very quickly and deliver the food to our table within 15 minutes.\n\nPortion wise, they are huge! Taste wise, I would say there's some room for fine tuning and improvement. But its already pretty decent and tasty.\n\nI noticed that the several tables around me, all ordered mixed grill too. So its a very popular choice here. Your have Chicken, Pork and lamp meat on the same hot plate. Very satisfying experience, dining here.\n\nThe legendary Hougang Ah Beng western.. The food is excellent.. But at the price point don't expect very good service.. Want service, go restaurants and pay service charge. Atmosphere, coffee shop, don't expect air con.. Want air con, go restaurants and pay service fee..\nNothing to complain, just simple western food..\n\nPatronised this store more than 20yrs ago, i rem manned by a few ah bengs at that time, very popular stall with a messy q system. Fast forward 20yrs later, still popular, seemed to be manned by same guys and chicken chop is still good. Pork chop can skip though, too hard. Portion of the sides quite generous.\n\nOne of the best western food hawker stalls I've ever tried. Seriously don't know why it has such a low rating, portions are good, meat is well cooked and tender, and prices are very reasonable. Will be able to enjoy it more since I'm moving across the road very soon!\n",

Chicken cutlet reminds me of my secondary school fried chicken snack. The price increases a few times. I order online but they gave me wrong/missing order. If order at their stalls, the preparation could take sometimes, then sometimes they will closed their stalls to go smoking at the carpark.\n\nGenerous portions, delicious food, friendly staff! Western Ambeng idea was definitely a hit with the family as usually everyone is so fickle for iftar choices and they love the variety of sauces as well!\n\nUnderrated western food that happens to be halal. Warm and friendly staff that greets with a smile. Food portion is very very generous. The aglio olio is especially superb. Worthy of #cleanplateclub\n\nDecided to check out the long queue that is consistent during peak hours. While cooking time may varies depending on what you order. There is a buzzer system and I will say it is worth the wait. Taste wise I got what I paid for.

Expect your Benedict\u2019s with salted egg sauce, chicken with Milo and ice cream served in tempura style.\n\nAmbience is a little warm for me despite Aircon running at full blast.\n\nMade a reservation but was late but staff were super friendly and understanding. Ordered Egg Benedict and Salted Egg Chicken Burger, upgraded to the set with Cappuccino and Mushroom Soup. Food came super fast, like within 5-10 minutes of ordering! The cappuccino and mushroom soup were great, loved the latte art \ud83e\udd70 Also the eggs Benedict was on point, compared to other eggs Benedict dishes I\u2019ve had at other cafes. Servings were generous and left feeling very satisfied.\n\nReasonable prices, good service and atmosphere, waiting times can be a bit long. Coffee was fragrant and not acidic. Unfortunately I found the raclette to be too pungent, even more so than blue cheese. Otherwise this is a nice small Cafe to hang out at.\n\nHad dinner here. Found this place by accident. The food was delicious. Certain portion was a tad salty but not a deal breaker. Definitely need to make a reservation the next time I'm coming here.\n\nWe came here at 2pm on a Sunday, not crowded but the service was damn slow and bad. We ordered at 2:11pm, 1 steak with 5 dollars top up for the cheese and 1 salmon. Half an hour later at 2:41pm, the food were still not here so we went to ask the staff, they said 6 more minutes. Waited for about another 8 minutes still no food so went to ask again and they replied rudely \"now, now, now!\" Ended up our food were still not here. Finally my salmon arrived, only the fish was hot, the sides were all cold, terrible! Steak arrived around 2:52pm and we had to wait another 5 minutes for the cheese that we paid $5 for. Of course the steak turned cold! Ordered medium rare, what came was medium well to well done. Come on... you all can do better, waited more than 50 minutes for trash food. My hubby ate 1 mouthful and asked for refund. Within 1 minute, the female cook came to clear the food angrily making quick and noisy moves. Wow, serve so slow clear so fast, worst service I've experienced.\n",

The porridge is tasty and smooth. Don't mind coming back again to try the other options . It's crowded during lunch time but the shop assistant will help you find seats\n\nthe congee is well seasoned and the ingredients inside are soft and flavorful too. the you tiao is crispy and not too oily, the century egg has a very distinguishable ginger and vinegary taste, plus being served cold helps to cool down the porridge and giving you a much better experience. in addition, the kaya toast is well toasted and crunchy and the soft boiled egg is perfect.\n\nHow can a porridge restaurant garner such a high number of reviews and such a high rating? The answer is the porridge is really that good and very affordable.\n\nThere weren't much seats in the restaurant so most people would opt to takeaway. The queue was quite long and I had to wait about 30minutes for my porridge. Even though I ate it about an hour later, it was still piping hot.\n\nThe porridge had a slightly smoky aroma with a gooey consistency like typical Cantonese porridge. Initially I was afraid that I wouldn't be full so I added on some sliced pork to my pork ball and century egg porridge, and a youtiao but I kinda regretted it as they were so generous with the ingredients that I felt like I just came back from a buffet after finishing the porridge.\n\nI would recommend getting the minced pork ball and century egg as the combination works the best.\n\nBest porridge in town! Be prepared to queue for at least 15 mins and then wait about 30 minutes for your piping hot bowl of creamy goodness chockful of ingredients! Go for the signature porridge. My parents frequently travel accross the island just to eat here. Ingredients are generous and great quality, squid thick and tender, liver so velvety and just ooh la la. It can be confusing to secure a table, approach the lady manning the delivery station. Price? Cheap! For the quality you pay!\n\nThis is one of the best porridge in Singapore. A must try. Their porridge, by default, is already salty. Remember to taste before adding any more soy sauce.\n",

Pork chop was tender though we wish there\u2019s options to choose the sides. Mushroom soup was decent and fried was well fried. The cheesy escargot was unique. We dipped the Fried with the cheese! Generous portion for spaghetti. Staff were friendly too. Cashless option via QR code payment available.\n\n1st time there. Their grilled pork chops (bestseller) was really tender and especially flavourful (eat with their mustard). The portobello was nicely breaded and fried under their Portobello with grilled chicken. Good deal to add soup with drink for extra 5.90. Place coikd do with some background music to liven up thd restaurant. Will be back tk try others in menu.\n\nThe staff was coughing badly and didn't wear a mask! I am irked by this behaviour after the COVID pandemic. The prawn and grilled chicken pasta was not bad, but the \"aglio olio\" lacked parsley flavour. It tasted like garlic and chilli pasta. The mushroom soup was also not flavourful and lacked texture. I prefer to have some bigger bits of mushrooms for texture and bite.\n\nWe were there to hold an event on behalf of Make-a-Wish Foundation for one of our wish child. Very impress with the food and services.\n\nJust bought oysters for takeaway, and I'm impressed how well packed they are. Even more impressive are the plump and fresh oysters! They are really juicy and super tasty!\n",

Some could be a little bit salty though, but generally we enjoy the food. It\u2019s almost a monthly must have. Price could be on the high side when you choose a lot of dishes.\n\nTheir sides are really fragrant and delicious! Just wish it wasn't so pricey and had bigger portions. We spent about $10 for 3 pax since we got 4 bowls of porridge and 5 sides.\n\nTheir duck is so chewy and delicious! Paired with their crunchy taogeh and just a strip of parsley :)\n\nI like their braised tofu which had a LARGE pirtion of minced pork on top. Dip a cube into their braised sauce and its so tender to tear into the tofu skin!\n\nTheir sweet and sour pork is nothing special, just a little cold.\n\nOverall its good but just too pricey and a little expensive. But good quality and fast!\n\nLong standing Teochew Muay of this area, famous for customer fighting and smashing the stall some years ago. Overall the food is good and service is not bad if not busy hours. Authentic old school dishes that comfort the stomach. Pricing is on the very expensive side, good to bring foreigners here to get sticker shock on how expensive road side food can be in Singapore. Parking is as bad as forever. The best dish is the salted veg chilli stingray, the sauce pour into the porridge wah like shiok and feeling old school childhood. Overall it\u2019s good.\n\nReally love the food here \ud83d\ude0b\ud83d\ude0b\n\nThey have large variety of dishes to choose from.\ud83d\ude01\n\nParticularly I really like their sweet & sour pork, egg tofu dish and their mince (pork) meat w/ salted egg.\ud83d\ude0b\ud83d\udc4d\n\nTheir prices are very reasonable too \ud83d\udc4d\n\nAnd they are strategically located along the Upper Serangoon Room and within walking distance to Kovan MRT Station.\n\nWill definitely comeback here again for dinner or supper \ud83d\ude01\n\nWide variety of selection.

Price remained unchanged but size has shrunk w fewer pistachio bits. Dry inside too :(\nThe cendol cake is less sweet and not cloying altho coconut fragrance is very light so probably friendlier for those watching calories.\n\nI went down to buy mini cakes, trying them to decide if I want to get them for my baby's full month.\n\nI like the apple tarts - crunchy and nice.\nThe chendol cakes and mango pomelo cakes are on par - both taste interesting and refreshing.\nOndeh ondeh cake is also not bad.\nChocolate mousse is a boring choice but my kid loves it.\nPistachio eclair looks nice, but was disappointing as it tastes too sweet.\n\nReview is for their online purchase, got the 25 pieces corporate gift box. Most of the cakes are variations on the swiss roll theme, with \"traditional\" flavours and fillings. So onde onde is pandan swiss roll with a coconut/gula melaka filling (our favourite), while chendol was pandan swiss roll with gula melaka as the \"jam\". The mango cake was more ordinary, while the choux pastry was good. Prices are very reasonable, the cakes look really attractive, and it feeds 25 people, or 12 very greedy people.\n\nBought 2 boxes of 25 pieces for my family gathering. The cakes in the premium box are perfect, just open and can serve my guest. I love the apple crumble, very nice and crunchy. Love the ondeh ondeh cake, resemblance of the real ondeh. I ordered online because they sold out really early some times, so in order not to be disappointed, I ordered online and collect at their shop. Lady at counter was really nice, swift and easy collection as it was ready when I arrived at their shop. Recommended and definitely will order again!\n\nBought 4 different cakes to try. All are nice. Personally I  prefer the onde. Will come back again!\n",

Kong Ba Bao looks good but the meat is about tough to chew and also prefer more five spice flavour. Fish maw and noodles are average.\n\nVisited on 24 Sep 2023 for birthday meal. Ordered 10 dishes.. food generally good like the claypot tofu, fried oyster came instead of oyster omelette.. fried horfun with cai po, and lor duck.. but the rest not so tasty and was told its not teochew enough, though I am Cantonese.. Still the service is not too good when it's busy. Asked waiter 3 times to order food, but nobody entertained us.. the food here is pricey.. our bill comes to $218.60 for 9 pax..\n\nThis is my first time here, and I came because my Teochew cousin invited me. Personally, I feel that the food doesn't quite taste like traditional Teochew dishes, such as Or Nee. Most of the dishes seemed tailored to suit the customers preferences. They were also quite salty, and we provided this feedback.\n\n(P.S. I\u2019m Teochew grew up eating traditional Teochew dishes)\n\nFood is good but generally expensive. Situated in a old shopping centre with narrow car park.  Timing of food served can be inconsistent. Some dishes were served very late\n\n1st time trying. We ordered 6 items + 1 dessert, and total cost $300. Good is generally good, with outdoor (aircon) seating inside the mall. Easily accessible and parking is available just below the building. The Teo Chew fried Hor fun is very tasty and have Wok Hei. The fish soup cost about $100, and fresh fish and can top up the soup. Overall is good and recommended.\n",

Volcano sauce is \ud83d\udc4d and spicy.\nLifetime membership for cashback discount  next visit.\n\nThe place is rather neglected. But customer service is number one . The staff are mostly older aged and I really respect them working despite the difficulty they may face . Came during off peak and really enjoyed the company . But the place was neglected in a sense that the lights were dusty and the walls painting are rusty and browned.\nThe food was alright , I got the tomyum chicken ramen and the tomyum was actually rather good . Got the fish cakes too but not really to my liking . It's like those Thai fish cakes that are super thick and hard to chew .\n\nService is good. Aunty very kind to refill drinks.however gyoza is meh ..do not order it.. Total failure. Ramen cmi. And the miso soup taste so weird i did not want to take second scoop. I tot it was some new ramen restaurant . Only found out it is ajisen..........\n\nVery rude staff. Especially the middle aged woman with a bun. As a vegetarian, I sincerely hoped that the restaurant could accommodate to my dietary requests and help me modify the broth for the Veg Ramen.  My friend and I had dined here previously so I called her up to explain my dietary request more explicitly and clearly in Chinese to the staff (since I don\u2019t speak the language). However the lady was SO stuck up and kept making snarky remarks \u201cExcuse me, we speak English\u201d and also told my friend \u201cYour friend doesn\u2019t understand how to order you should clarify to her\u201d - which was SO unnecessary and uncalled for especially if the customer is confused about the dish. Upon clarification, I placed my order. Then she served the incorrect topping (spice). When I inquired, she dismissed my request altogether and just spoke to my partner saying \u201cI don\u2019t think she understands so let me explain it to you instead\u201d - first of all, they are making me pay extra for a VEG set with no protein (I was basically paying $2 just for the spice) and ON TOP OF this daylight robbery she has the audacity to be plain rude. To anyone reading this, save yourself the trouble and go to a better Ramen place :) The 1 STAR is literally just for the gyoza cause it was yum.\n\nFood was served promptly and noodle is Q and just right. Just that their Vocano ramen isn\u2019t spicy. Staffs are polite and especially an auntie who is very friendly and helpful.\n\nSad to say, today\u2019s f&b in most restaurants out there, most staffs only do what they need to do and doesn\u2019t bother to even show you a smile. Appreciate the auntie who chatted with our toddler and did not gave black face when he made a mess on the dining table and floor. While we tried to clear up, she stopped us and told her not to worry (seriously we had seen many others just kept quiet - we parents clean up, they can do lesser work, ain\u2019t?) and chat with our toddler.\n",

The food stall are majority new with the old stall holders moved out.\nFood choices are average but prices of drinks have risen fairly since the renovation.\n\nCoffee stall staff ability to make cofee and tea is so so and they are slow and with strange attitude. 118 coffee shop has such a better standard.

Dal curry is plain salty w/o fragrance nor texture.\nThe Mutton Mysore is soso and the fish Assam curry is surprisingly good despite some reviewed that it's sour and watery\ud83e\udd14, hello it's Assam curry!\nCan come eat the prata kosong \ud83d\udc4d\n\nOrdered bull\u2019s eye and Egg Benedict Prata. Bull\u2019s eye nicely done. But sadly Egg Benedict\u2019s yolk was broken during the process. Staff apologised to me and I said it\u2019s okay. Good service. But the Prata still taste good \ud83d\udc4d\n\nTried the kosong, the thosai and the paper thosai. The prata was fluffy and crunchy on the outside. The thosai and paper thosai texture is nice.\n\nAs for the fish curry, find that it is lacking in flavor. Mainly can taste sourness. I feel that a dash of salt will bring up the flavor. Possible that the chef wants to create a healthier version and reduced the salt. Anyway, I am giving feedback more based on the taste :).\n\nTried this Prata stall run by young enterprising owners. Their food is made to order. We ordered the cheese Prata and Egg Benedict. The cheese they used is mozzarella cheese, not the normal square ones. The Egg Benedict Prata is very creative and it elevates the prata dish to next level. Love how the egg benedict was done and it goes well with the prata and turkey ham and cheese. The mutton gravy was thick and full of flavour. Very shiok. What impresses us is the cleanliness of their stall. Will definitely frequent this stall. A must go to for Prata craving.\n\nBriyani and the chicken was very dry and so little curry provided. Somehow was not provided curry for the bull's eye but it was still nice but my expectations is certainly dropped\n",

So you feel a little looked upon by everyone working there. I also think price wise for the all you can eat and drink package I think it's expensive, really the same as a hotel price, the portion sizes maybe could be a little small and reduce the price a little, we didnt have room for dessert, but they were already included on the menu, we did ask for another drink but was refused. We had a good time and probably would come back in the future\n\nNew Moroccon restaurant run by a very friendly Moroccan owner who's super helpful and has built a great varied menu that we thoroughly enjoyed.\n\nGoing as a group to this restaurant is probably a good choice so you can order a few different dishes and try as they are all good for sharing.\n\nThe specia slow cookedl lamb shoulder dish was our favourite, the lamb was so tender and juicy and meat falling off the bone, cooked perfectly with rice and the combination was wonderful.\n\nWe tried Tajine and few other dishes which were all good and made it for a wonderful Moroccon feast.\n\nGlad we have Tajine joining latest scene of diversity in culinary works. The salty sourdough mini buns gave quite an interesting pairing compared to usual pita bread. I love the light intensifying broth that comes with braised monkfish. Lentils dip surprised with almond flakes, while the hummus and grilled eggplant are lighter than the norm Indian and Middle East buds.

Would hope to see more well maintained restroom, for it's the only one for all.\n\nVisited this TRADITIONAL restaurant yesterday, so it claims. I thought the meat was well cooked and all. Unfortunately the flavours were underwhelming and portion was small. Please note this is a 2 persons portion. The lamb stock was very light in colour too seems like watered down. One is suppose to pour the lamb stock over the Royal couscous dish. I expected a more robust flavour and looking forward to more spices. We are in Singapore and very exposed to diff\u00e9rent foods with lots of spices like briyani, and all the dishes available in a Nasi Padang joint. So I was surprised to learn from this restaurant that North African food seems \u201cvery clean\u201d.\n\nI love th\u00e9 cocktails though, they were really yummy. We would have come back to try the starters and some other dishes but we won\u2019t be coming back. So why two stars? It was very odd that the Israeli floor manager asked for our feedback and when we provided our truths that we love food just that the spices were underwhelming. She seemed defensive but most importantly she said that the Chef is just interpreting Moroccan food in his way and has tone down the spices for Singaporean taste buds. I was surprised to hear. Aren\u2019t you marketing Tajine as a traditional Moroccan restaurant so I expect that? Not a watered down or modern interpretation. Just traditional please.\n\nOh and food prices were really expensive.\n100 plus per person for Royal Couscous, corne de gazelles (dessert) , 2 cocktails and one mint tea each.\n\nWanted to try something different and chance upon this restaurant at Mohd Sultan. The dishes cooked from the tajine are awesome. We had both chicken and veal. Both are savoury and flavourful. The batbout which is a round, firm and chewy dough goes extremely well with the tajine dishes.\n\nDo notes you must order two portion for the tajine dish which will cost you almost $70 per dish.\n",

Portion pathetic . $13 for this food !!\n\nNice nasi padang. The beef rendang is good and traditional. Rempah of the rendang is great and fresh. Ask for extra gravy for rendang as it is more traditional dry style. Other dishes is good too. They are generous with the gravies so that added complexity to the dish. I think firstly the dishes are traditional and what dish we choose to balance with each other is important. It is almost the same for all nasi padang too. Overall it is a great gem for authentic nasi padang. Well done!\n\nOne of the best nasi Padang in Toa Payoh. The beef rendang is stew till very soft n tender.\n\nAuthentic Indonesian style nasi Padang done very well at good prices. Very popular with a queue during lunch time. Can tell many are regulars.\n\nThe gravy is flavourful and not overpowering spicy which is great for me. Also lotsa variety to choose from. The beef looks really tender even though I chose the Sotong, which is fresh and tender.\n\nIt is a true local treasure that brings the authentic flavors of Malay cuisine to our neighborhood. If you're in search of a memorable dining experience that celebrates the heart and soul of Malay culture, look no further. This eatery is a must-visit, whether you're a local or just passing through.\n",

I ordered from their Weekday Brunch Special Menu which is available from 11am to 3pm.\n\nI ordered Pan Fried Dory Fillet in Cilantro sauce with some greens and fries ($12.90++) plus $4.80++ for the Meal Upgrade to include the soup of the day and a drink.\n\nRating for the main course: 4/5 (the fish portion is just nice it is well cooked but the fries are slightly salty.\n\nRating for the spinach soup and bread:\n4/5 (the soup is delicious and the bread is nice)\n\nOverall, this place is ideal for lunch and dinner with family or friends but it does not impress me enough to give a 5-star rating.\n\nThe Larder cafe has never fail to make my day. Standard of the food is still there. Ambience good. Enjoyed the Truffle fries & Salmon thoroughly.\n\nHidden treasure of Toa Payoh! There are not many cafes in TPY that offers, coffee, food, all day breakfast, beer, ice cream in a cosy setting.\n\nScan QR code and self order but the servers are friendly and easy going. The layout inside lean toward a bit of Retro settings, nice pics with warm lights.\n\nFood was good! Every dish was a 4-5 stars but hands down it\u2019s the desserts that\u2019s gonna kill! Ice cream, Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e, waffles! If I had more space, I will try the rainbow cake.\n\nThe Waffles and Ice Cream is really very good.  The other food I would say so-so and can be missed. So I'd only be back for Waffles.\n\nThe place is really noisy when running full house. We can't wait to leave right our meal. It's so stressful to eat in such noisy environment.\n\nCafe is on 2nd level. Not wheelchair friendly.\n\nThe food was good! Got the brunch set meal of the chicken skewer and pasta, with soup and drinks. Go if you would like to have a cafe feel at a reasonable 'cafe' price (for the set).\n",

However, the lady at the cashier wasn\u2019t friendly at all.\n\nOur go-to nasi padang stall! We come here weekly, and the standard is consistently great! There is a huge variety of dishes to choose from, and the spread is delightful! The dishes are neatly arranged.\n\nWe have tried and recommend their ikan pedas, curry fish, fried fish, sayuh lodeh, fried chilli potato, fried tempeh (our favourite!), omelet, Paru, beef liver, etc. We have tried their fried chicken wing, curry chicken, beef rendang, ayam Penyet, but still overall perfer the ikan dishes. You have to ask for any of their curries to be added to your rice! Sometimes they have desserts like banana ball (?) and lopez... Order them! They are yummy!\n\nTheir drinks are also strong and tasty. We usually order teh and Kopi tarik kurang manis.\n\nThere is usually a queue but it moves pretty fast because the servers are efficient.\n\nI have brought my mother here, and she claims that this is the BEST nasi padang stall in Singapore! We also dabao some dishes every time we visit. Do come and support!\n\nBeen coming here frequently during lunch.\nPlace is packed and well organised.\n\nThey have daily specials and I tried the nasi lemak and follow up with the mixed rice meals.\nBoth were below $10.\n\nThe fried chicken is awesome, tempeh is delicious, beef rendang fantastic. Prefer when the fried chicken is hot out of the fryer but still awesome.\n\nWill return again and again.\n\nHari Raya Haji package :\nI am really impressed by the Raya Haji packaging! \ud83d\ude0d  This is really very smart! The food is really delicious, not greasy and has a balance in taste!\n\nI subscribed to the Lunch tingkat for my Mom too.  She sends me photos when she receives her food.  She always compliment that the food and dessert is always delicious and the generousity in its servings.  The menu is balanced with good protein (array of meat, seafood) never repeats and I can sense that is always thoughtfully crafted.\n\nHad Nasi Padang ($7) for lunch on 2/8/23, was good.\n",

We went out of the way to come to this place. Will definitely come again. Really nice ppl serving, clean and they take pride in what they serve. Forgot to take pictures though...but though it's in a hawker centre setting, it definitely taste better than some restaurants I hv been to.\n\nOrdered the teriyaki salmon don at $5.50. Love that they top the salmon with lots of stir-fries onions and also generous amount of lettuce. Comes with miso soup too. Portion is good too. Gave it 3 star as it didn\u2019t taste Japanese even though it was a good meal that I enjoyed.\n\nI hv bought their food many times and this is my review. Food is good, good price and at times generous portion. Good place for me to buy Japanese halal food at a cheaper price. If they have a lot of orders, u need to have the patience to wait yeah. But the wait is worth it.\n\nCheap and value for money! It can be hard to find something different to eat that is halal in Toa Payoh and this was not bad!

I tried Kebabs on day one and man it was delicious. Atmosphere is great and all servers are friendly, specially three girls Urmi, Wendy and Fina are super nice, they make sure to get you a table quickly, take the order in timely manner and also make valuable suggestions on the menu. They always keep checking if everything is fine and customers are enjoying food. I loved the desert suggestion after eating my dinner. After first day I have been to this place 7-6 times and was always greeted with same service. I highly recommend this restaurant and will go again before I leave Singapore for USA.\n\nWe had the sultan's delight and mussels with garlic cream and cheese toast. The sultan's delight is really enjoyable. We could taste the smokiness from the eggplant puree and the lamb stew is really tender with tomato based sauce. It's tangy and smoky with some crunchiness from the pine nuts. Really enjoyable. But the mussel is pretty standard. It didn't taste really fresh but they're quite generous with the amount. The garlic cheese sauce is ok only.\nService was good and attentive.\n\nVisited for my birthday meal with my family as I was craving some Mediterranean food and this place had great reviews. However, the whole experience ended up kinda disappointing - as I had high expectations too on my first visit.\n\nService:\n- It\u2019s a restaurant but I felt like there was not much service per say.\n- It\u2019s a pretty high price point but they don\u2019t serve complimentary water (charged at $3 a pot of hot water, or $11 for Evian water only)\n- Ordering isn\u2019t as fuss free as they try to make it. Online ordering only from mobile app, with just one physical menu at the door. Asked for any extra copies for easier viewing but none available. You also have to pay upfront in mobile order.\n- Feels like I visited a restaurant but received fast food style service.\n\nAtmosphere:\n- Overall atmosphere is okay. Like a typical restaurant\n\nFood:\n- Average, I\u2019ve had much better at other places for a similar price point.\n- Pita bread, spreads and kebab grills were okay.\n- Saffron rice & Briyani rice were disappointing. They use basmati rice which gave a nice texture. However, flavour is so subtle that I could barely taste the difference between the 2.\n\nSummary:\nWould I return? Definitely not! For the price point, the food and service didn\u2019t live up to expectations for a highly rated restaurant. Will continue on my hunt for yummy Mediterranean food!\n\nVisited on a Thu night, it's superb crowded and busy in the restaurant. 3 dishes for 2 people, very filling. Overall the food is pretty decent and the price point is on the higher side.\n\nExcellent experience with vibrant dining experience. Food has great range of taste to excite the palate. Service is welcoming and top notch, they also gave a complimentary cake.\n",

                  "reviews": "\n\nMade the effort to come here after numerous recommendations from different parties.\n\n10 minute wait. Decent portion size for $6.\n\nLooked good. The flavour tells that very good quality shrimp paste is used. So it was such a pity that the fried fritter was limp and cold. The same goes for the tau pok.\n\nTried this Soon Heng Rojak due to good reviews and highly recommendation from a colleague.\nThe gravy is thick with much peanuts and the sauce was favourably nice.\nThe rojak was very tasty in the mouth, the you tiao was not tough to chew.\nWaiting time was longer as the orders kept coming and queuing took some time.\nOverall experience was good and highly recommended.\n\nA really famous rojak served by a masterfully efficient chef \ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffc\u200d\ud83c\udf73\n\nAt $4-7 a plate, they are churning these out really fast compared to the other rojak stalls - and at a good quality too.\n\nHaving tried it for the first time, I could understand why there\u2019s a demand for it - though I didn\u2019t love it enough to give it a perfect score.\n\nThat said, definitely a choice for desserts for a lovely generous plate of peanut goodness \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\n\nSoon Heng Rojak was founded in 1988 and is supposedly made the very same way to this very day.\n\nSince rojak isn't generally eaten as a meal on its own, this stall seems to rack up a short queue no matter the time of day.\n\n$4 gets you the smallest plate, and if you want to add a preserved egg on top of that it'll cost an extra dollar. The portion seems regular, or perhaps I don't eat enough rojak to know the current market 'standards' of size and portions, but I do know that there wasn't any cured garlic slices and that the egg looked like it had an abusive parent. To note, I also ordered it less sweet, for I remember it to be unbearably briney and sweet the last time round.\n\nGenerally if you order the default plate, you would get a wetter rojak that is wading in 'hei ko' sauce. Personally, the brininess and sweetness of the default plate is too much for me as it gets to a point where it feels like I'm eating rojak in 'seafood jus'. Even with my less sweet order it was still too much for me. The pineapples were sliced thinly which meant they were coated more but could also mean you get less of it. The you tiao was slightly dense, but the sauce rehydrated it enough to still be enjoyable. The best thing for me was the preserved egg. It tasted good and had no unbearable pungent or ammonic taste and smell.\n\nAll in all I just feel something is lacking with this rojak though I can't quite put my finger on it. Maybe it's the lack of garlic that throws it off balance, as well as the excessive hei ko sauce.. or maybe it's just a very traditional taste I'm not used to. You be the verdict of this one.\n\n@goodfoodwrite - instagram & YouTube\n\nRelatively short wait as it was off peak hours . Generous amount of peanut . Tasted well balanced , can see why its very popular\n",

Was good! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\n\nAlong Toa Payoh Lorong 1, this is a food heaven for local food lovers but it gets crowded during weekend and meal times!

A lift is available for elderly folks.\n\nFun hawker centre with a big selection of food. Many stalls and many different types of food, such as carrot cake, fish soup, chicken rice, ban mian, soya bean drink and pudding, fried you tiao, and even satay (in the morning!!)\n\nAsked for mixed fishball, fish dumpling and shredded chicken noodle soup. Was told $6..After having it, rest of ingredients are okay, except the fish dumpling is over rated..imagine you need pay $1.20 each, I would go for Song Kee.\n\nClean & airy place. Food is good. Must try the hokien mee. Yummy.\nAlso the Chee Cheong Fun, though done with a slight different look, but really delicious.\n",

Can also help us doing charity if we pay forward \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\n\nPerhaps the only place where you can get $1 Nasi Lemak.

Thank you for keeping the price down when most stalls are raising the price. I went there at noon and there was no queue.\n\nBought the $1 nasi lemak and added a chicken wing. The rice and the chilli is 5 stars but the chicken wing is 3 stars and hence the 4 stars rating.\nThere was a queue but it move quite quickly. Next time will have only the nasi lemak and will try out the mee rebus and lontong.\n\nDelicious Nasi Lemak! Portion is good and the rice is extremely fragrant. Will definately be back.\n",

Fair share, more than enough to eat.\n\n5. Price a little expensive, 2.70 for an egg prate. 7.50 for butter chicken.\n\n6. Well affordable and worth a try!\n\nI love this place and come frequently. I do think that they have the best prata in Singapore - they are crispy, not too oily and has the right thickness giving it a little chew. The curry dipping is flavorful and also very generous portion.\n\nThe place has indoor and outdoor area. It\u2019s air conditioned so it\u2019s comfortable to dine in with group as well, not just get and go. The menu is also diverse from prata, thosai, naan, fish head curry, chicken briyani and mutton briyani to please the different preferences in larger group!\n\nIts a very nice experience. The staff were very friendly and welcoming. However, I had the butter chicken but the butter chicken was quite spicy. Dont know if its suppose to be spicy. The milo and teh was awsome. Burst of flavors. Would reccomend totaly!\n\nMr Vasanth and his team were excellent help in planning and delivering a \u201clive-prata\u201d party. The catered food was very delicious, the curries good especially the mutton was super soft. The kids enjoyed the special pratas the Chef recommended them.\n\nAfter 2 years in India, it feels really good to find an Indian place with the taste of india for a correct price. Order and within 5min your food is on the table ! We love it and highly recommend!\n",

Very special, the water is not that hot, with mint leaves inside. Something sweet.\nPink pink color inside, pretended on holiday!\n\nIn general, it\u2019s good and a new experience for Moroccan food.\n\nCelebrated a friend's birthday and everything was BEAUTIFUL. The reservation was a breeze, super responsive on whatsapp! The place and ambiance brought me to Morocco! Love love the food we had the dips and platter. Serving is huge, perfect for sharing! They gave us 2 complimentary cakes as well for the birthday girls. Will surely come back!!\n\nVisited La Fez restaurant for dinner, wanting to try Moroccan cuisine, but was left quite disappointed.\n\nThe decor and the interiors are nice, and the service is friendly enough.\n\nThe food, though, is quite disappointing. Ordered the marrakesh dip platters which comes with 8 pieces of pita bread and 4 dips (hummus, baba ganoush, zalouk and Muhammara). Tasted quite average and nothing to shout about considering it is priced at $23.\n\nAsked for the chicken and vegetarian tagine but were told they didn\u2019t have the vegetarian option. This is supposed to be the main, so seems weird that they didn\u2019t have it.\n\nThe chicken tagine seemed quite bland and devoid of character. Nothing remarkable. It was served with pita bread too, and you can also opt for Mandi rice as sides.\n\nThe only saver of the evening was the Turkish apple cinnamon tea - was nice, warm and soothing.\n\nNice idea - there aren\u2019t many similar options in Singapore - but average execution at best. Dips platter, tagine, harissa were all somewhat bland. That\u2019s despite the fact that the harissa is already meant to be the spicy tastier option for the lamb. Tagine and Harissa dishes don\u2019t come with rice or couscous, only pita - maybe a grain would be nice.\n\nThere are some \u201ccomfort food\u201d options - maybe for kids - we had the fish & chips which was simply awful. The fish is fried hard like a rock and barely edible. Fries were bland.\n\nThe hot baklava cheesecake was tasty but tiny for the price.\n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be back.\n\nWe dine in here for a family dinner.\nCozy, pleasant & lovely ambience.\nStaffs were friendly.\nServing was quite fast.\nWe were lost of what to order at first & the waiter there recommended Mandi Platter which was in fact a sumptious one. The Strawberry Dome for our dessert was yummy.\nFully recommended & would come back to try other menus.\n",

Hummus & tea on the house as well.\n\nA little on the pricey side but expected for the popular location. Wld return\ud83d\udc4d\n\n4th time here. Food was good with big portions. Love how tender the lamb is. Staff here are friendly as well!\n\nBoss and staff are polite, friendly and helpful. Very attentive as well. Would say it's definitely better service than you would get in general in Singapore.\n\nFood-wise I enjoyed the dishes. Boss Jamal was really nice to offer me vegan options for the hummus as well as the moussaka vegetables. Was my first time trying this style of hummus. It was served hot and when the boss saw that it looked dry, he automatically brought out olive oil for me to pour to my liking. Hummus was tasty for me although would have preferred it wetter. I'm guessing it's because usually it contains a bit of yoghurt but I had to have the yoghurt removed. Bread was OK. Moussaka was amazing! I would definitely be back for it. The signature mint tea is a nice-to-have after so much oil... \ud83d\ude02\n\nPrice-wise it is quite expensive for the portions, but it's very comparable to the other restaurants in this area. Probably because it's a tourist area. Good news is that price is nett. So no additional charges.\n\nDecoration of the restaurant is done well! The Moroccan tiles on the table is Instagram-worthy!\n\nNice place to eat. The staffs are friendly.\nFoods are affordable and yummy :)\n\nHad dinner on 19-Dec-20. It was a mixed bag of experience.\nLocation: great. Right in front of the Sultan Masjid\nReception: v cordial & helpful (but so are all the other restaurants around it)\nSeating: comfortable since a gentle breeze was blowing\nCovid Safety: v poor. If we had known this, we wouldn\u2019t have eaten here. No Safe Checkin, no safe distance between tables, and some of the people serving weren\u2019t wearing the mask properly. Scary.\nService: poor. We were promised our lemonade would b without sugar or ice, but they didn\u2019t care. The people serving were mixing up dishes for the tables multiple times.\nFood: tasty, but not the authentic type. Having eaten in Turkey we didn\u2019t find the eggplant kebab the way it should have been.\nPresentation: Good\nPrice: Fairly ok\nI am not planning to go there again\n",

The beef (with prunes) is tender and flavorsome. I particularly like the chicken with a hint of lemon, it's delicious and goes very well with bread. The lamb however was quite disappointing, there was very little meat and the dish mainly consists of veg and cous cous.\nPrices are on the high side but it's worth trying. We love the ambience of the restaurant too, peaceful and quaint. We had a chance to chat a little with the friendly owner, overall a great experience.\nFeedback - please consider rice in the menu, it goes well with beef and chicken. Singapore locals are generally fond of rice :)\n\nNice atmosphere. Great place to dine Moroccan cuisine. Although the price is on the high side but worth for its value.\nI has chicken with preserved lemon and stewed beef with prunes. Both are served in traditional tagine. Mint tea was excellent.\n\nGreat spot for Moroccan cuisine. The lamb and veg couscous was delicious, and we really enjoyed the chicken and preserved lemon tagine. Bonus for serving wine and beer! Definitely recommend this spot!\n\nThe food is really yummy! I expected to be spicy and super flavorful but it\u2019s not spicy & I like it this way \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb The food still has lots of flavour but not the overwhelming kind. Love their bread with all the dishes.\n\nTheir pancake dessert is a must to order & Moroccan tea is jus super nice \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\n\nGreat to go with friends and share the different dishes as it\u2019s super filling to the tummy !\n\nCame here for a birthday occasion. Recommend the bread and dips. Warm bread was comforting and the dips a flavourful compliment. The chicken pastilla was also authentic and on par with what I tasted in Morocco previously. The chicken tagine was fairly good.\n",

Each table is equipped with one, allowing you to make the most of your waiting time by browsing the web, shopping online, or enjoying a game. Additionally, they provide wireless chargers, so don't forget to charge your phone while savoring your meal. The staff is exceptionally friendly and accommodating.\n\nTo be fair, this rating is based solely on their signature chendol. Was graving for dessert and chanced upon their chendol advert outside their shop. Looked so good so proceeded to order their signature chendol as take away. My work place is only a few shops away and not that far. Almost immediately I opened the tub and was disappointed that the 'shaved ice' was all melted. The ingredients were also very pathetic plus the coconut milk was very lumpy as seen from the photo. I think they use ready-made coconut milk as I could see boxes of them at the counter. Very heart pain that I paid $5.09 for this lousy 'signature' chendol.\n\nOmg~ so nice! I love the texture of the noodles, the small little container of chilli yet potent enough, the fried wanton that has filling and not just fried wanton skin and the overall portion of the meal! The soup is strong in flavour, slightly to the the salty side. Bakso is good. My complete set cost about 10.50 with a drink (lime juice or lemon tea) (i prefer lemon tea), 2 wanton and 2 bakso. I thought quite reasonable! Please don't change ur taste or standard for this particular Jakarta chicken noodles~~~ I always love indo chicken noodles! The sulawesi noodles is just as good too, just that the chicken feels lesser but chilli spicier. No matter how, am coming back again and again! Note: Service may need to slightly speed up when there's more customers but I'll definitely wait for good food! Also, this particular section of shop has always been small so seatings very limited and slightly feels more cramped with people eating and queueing.\n\nFriendly Staff and very attentive to customer.\nLove the springy noodle texture that is authentically indonesian! Must try is the Bakmie Rica Rica and Bakmie Yamin Bandung.\n\nComplete the set with a cup of Cendol, its the real indonesian cendol and you could choose jackfruit or durian topping.\n\n\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\n\nGood option if you are looking for authentic bakmi and cendol. The cendol is great, choosing the less sugar option has the right amount of sweetness for me. The pangsit goreng is also good. The bakmi however is just average, but with not much option in Singapore, this is a good option.\n",

Dessert medley sgd19 was alright but hits and misses (4/5 stars at most). Giving this place 5 stars coz they serve complimentary water and service was attentive yet not obtrusive. Great ambience too, chairs were comfy tables were large. Serviettes were thick and luscious. Place was dimly lit, quite romantic, yet so many diners were large groups of family, still able to enjoy. Plenty of baby chairs available and children's cutlery also provided. We will definitely be back for the fettuccine and the pizza.

Got a good understanding of expresso as well as palatte development in this two hour coffee course. Put my hands on the grinder machine as well and got some basic ideas of how to recognize and appreciate good expresso. This course is truly helpful if you wanna learn everything about coffee bean's history, global logistic and how to make your own decision to get the best suitable type for yourself. Looking forward to the upcoming course about Coffee Cocktail Mixology in 2021.\n\nA fantastic workshop that taught me more than I could have hoped for about coffee and its making! The barista course was very informative, well explained and fun at the same time. We got a lot of information from history, over beans to coffee quality and equipment. I can highly recommend this workshop held by our lovely host Serge.\n\nHad the original greek recipe Cafe Frapp\u00e9 prepared by the amazingly friendly Serge\ud83d\ude0a it is always a pleasure to enjoy a great coffee and company!

He can catch any joke you throw out.\nThe coffee looks good and tastes good;\nThe drinks are healthy and look great;\nThe wines are carefully prepared and are full of innovation compared to traditional bartending.\nDon't miss it\n\nCoffee cocktail is a new feature of our store and is rare in Singapore.

Chili is very spicy and what you\u2019d expect from indo food.\n\nTerrible gado gado, the tau gua s cold, the sauce is cold, the egg is cold(overcooked, and kept for long time) the vegetable is cold and soggy.  How can such restaurant sustain\u2026disgrace to this dish..\n\nTheir ayam penyet is not even smashed.

THIS IS HANDS DOWN THE BEST AND MOST DELICIOUS AND TASTY nasi Ayam penyet. the curry + crumbs mixed with the rice is AMAZING \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d and the chicken is well cooked and tender. Thank you.\n\nHi managers, could you please tell your staff (Chinese woman) in Pasir Ris Hawker centre beside the Sports Centre to PLEASE be aware of how she speaks to her customers? She is very crude and raises her voices to old folks who buy from her 90% of whom are Malay elderly people. Tell her to improve her behaviour or will escalate this matter to the town council\n\nI had steam chicken with brown rice , service wise is good from the workers . They are friendly but not the boss, the boss is a Chinese owner non Muslim employed Muslim workers, unfortunately she only speaks mandarin when I tried to communicate with her, she not that friendly and had a stuck up face .\n\nThe business about 5years .\n\nOk back to the food, no standard at all.\nBrown rice so smashy, steam chicken tasteless no marination at all even they have a big part of the chicken but tasteless, really tasteless, their chillies no match at all with the steam chicken.\n\nMy conclusions go and buy steam chicken rice from the Chinese stall way much better than eating steam chicken from this stall.\n\nFor ayam penyek I dare not try after I alreday tasted the steam chicken with no taste at all in the meat, marination is very important to have a good chicken flavours.\n\nThis is my own opinion ya, so for this , I only give 1 star \u2b50\n\nOne of best Ayam Penyet I have ever had. The chicken is crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. Pair with rice and curry sauce which makes the whole dish very satisfying. The sambal belacan is spicy which makes the chicken tasted even better.\n\nThe staff are friendly and helpful.\n\nWorth to queue/travel to eat: Yes\n\nThe food here is surprisingly good. What stood out the most is the portion of the chicken; They are generous with the size of the chicken, hope it remains this way. The size of the chicken is bigger as compared to most Ayam Penyet places. The set comes with rice as mentioned on the menu below. Service is just as fast despite having to serve orders collected by delivery riders waiting to collect. Also kudos for treating them nicely, reminding the riders to double-check their orders.\n\nI like that they provided sauce and chilli in smaller separate containers for takeaways, easier to make hot if I choose to eat it at a later time. I also like that they provided curry gravy such that the rice is not dry.\n\nOne star missing for charging the extra chilli (at 50 cents each tub) and not separating the chicken from the rice for takeaway.\n",

I like how the food were served really hot and portion was decent too. Kangkong was a little too salty. Very nice deco in the shop, service was prompt too. Might drop by again to try the breakfast.\n\nGreat breakfast !  Quiet and cozy environment\nTruffle egg mayo croissant with Milo  $5.90 , great taste and generous portion ..\nPrawn Sando breakfast $6.90 with 5 big prawns , and drink ..\nreally good value for money , will definitely come back again :)\nBut have to wait for awhile for the food to be serve\n\nOct 2023.\nVisited this awfully happy place for late dinner. Omg, had an awfully yummilicious meal. The highlight is the sambal sweet potato leaves. Not many eateries serve this dish. Its a must have. Thanks Ms Ai and team. What a way to wrap the hectic day. Am happy.\n\u2248===========================\n\nHave not visited this eatery for awhile. The service and meal served are still awsome. Highly recommended, especially for family get together. Thank you Ms Ai and team!\n\nNice fun cheery place tucked in a corner. Food was a total let down sorry to say. Far far cry from established eating houses with zi char style. Food had zero wok hey and rather tasteless and almost bland. I looked around and I am pretty sure I wasn't alone given the handful of half eaten food. Quantity is reasonable and menu had good variety which was probably its saving grace. Hyper fast serving time as well if you need a quick fix.\n\nDelicious food that we had here on a Saturday, 22nd October.. we went for the $28 set meal for 2 with Hotplate Stingray, Sambal Kangkong, Tom Yam Soup complete with two plates of white rice . The servings were generous too. Food was served very fast as well\n",

                  "reviews": "\n\ncame here to try their nasi lemak set A (+ luncheon meat, sausage, fish) and a teh o bing. Dish came up to about $10.20; but the best thing about this dish is the flavourful sambal!! the sambal did the dish justice, spice is just right and all the different ingredients to the dish are made hot and fresh on order!\n\nchicken wing is well seasoned and crispy, fish filet was a tad over-fried though.. and the rice is decently hot and importantly flavourful too! Definitely coming back again for the sambal and the rice - the rest are supporting ingredients\ud83d\ude05\n\nas for reviews about the staff being rude or what not, i dont ever see them being like that..even when there is a long queue and they\u2019re busy. they have character but so long as you\u2019re not out of the line, i doubt they would too. in fact, they\u2019re friendly and helpful!\n\nVery nice cozy food corner in HDB void deck along Pasir Ris Drive 6.\n\nDropped by for breakfast while on an early morning cycling trip in the area because it was the only place to open that early (7am). Auntie is brash in character and blunt but it makes the place more endearing as a heartland food corner IMO (as long as you haven't been an annoying customer to get on the receiving end).\n\nOrdered the set A nasi lemak with otah, yuan yang and bean curd with longan. The main food was alright. Nothing outstanding about it, though it's nice that it's light on oil and freshly cooked, and the \"otah\" was basically flavoured sponge rather than actual otah, which was disappointing.\n\nI like their (seemingly handmade?) dessert offerings, and the cold bean curd, sweetened by the longan, hit the right spot to bookend the meal. It helped that there was a seat with a view of the road outside and some nice greenery.\n\nCan't really comment on comparative pricing for the area (or the recent price hikes) since I don't live in Pasir Ris, but as someone who's used to the higher prices in the North-East, it definitely remains on the affordable end of the spectrum.\n\ntl;dr nice cozy heartland breakfast spot. Don't mind the auntie, try the dessert.\n\nEnded up ordering food here over two days and it was a mixed experience. The service was friendly and quick.\n\nThe morning  kway teow noodles were tasty but there was too much tofu in the ngoh hiang and fishcake.  The mee goreng was enjoyable, if a little sweet, and I liked the chicken chop with rice. The ayam goreng with fries was disappointing though. It did not look like the menu photo at all, and was in fact over fried till black and the meat was super dry. It seemed as if it was someone else\u2019 order that was cancelled and then refried. It was inedible.\n\nI have been patronizing this place for more than 7 years. The food is decent and the price is reasonable. This eatery has its character. I have no problem with the operator. It's either you love it or you hate it.\n\nTried beehoon mee 1st time, expensive & taste ordinary like any beehoon mee stall. Serve cabbage in a separate bowl. Portion for beehoon mee little, over fried fish fillet, wings nothing to shout about. Halal certified thats why ex maybe! 1st & last time .\n",

Highly recommend!\n\nEdit: was great but quality slowly getting worse.\n\nPork chop - overcooked, dry and tough\nChicken chop - undercooked\nNuggets - feels reheated as tough and hard\n\nNice and affordable western food in Loyang point , would like to recommend anyone to try their chicken chop pasta\nYou can see how much effort they put in even the price is only 7 bucks\nThumbs up to the friendly boss\n\nRude attitude stall owners and lousy food.

I should have gotten the latte instead.\n\nThe English breakfast style platter is actually one of the best I've tried in Tampines and other areas, even the more astute parts of town.\n\nI'm a westerner and sometimes get tired of eating soft boiled runny eggs, so the scambled eggs fit a nice niche for my sensibilities.\n\nThe Tampines location is tiny to dine-in. I could see a scenario of not being able to get a table during peak time quite easily, so plan accordingly.\n\nI wished they served Kopi C Kassong, but of course, it's Singapore, so not very hard to find nearby.\n\ngreat ambience and delicious food but also pricey (average cafe prices but still expensive) the cafe itself is a bit small and can be cramped if ur more than 2 people visiting, but there's a bit of outdoor seating. the desserts were genuinely so good! the bottled drinks not worth getting tho - too sweet.\n\nNot too bad, just a pity the Angus beef burger sold out by the time I reached. Drinks were okay food was quite nice. Paid about $55.\n\nStopped in here for a quick coffee and dessert. You order and pay via a QR code.\n\nThe flat white was okay, but was a tad expensive for what you get.  I wanted the ondeh ondeh cake or the double baked cheese cake, which we had before at the Frankel store, but the missus had a hankering for the carrot cake.  It was nice, creamy and full of fresh chopped hazelnuts.\n\nPolite staff, who is very transparent and make sure to keep us in the loop despite the long line\n\nFood is yummy! I really liked everything, except maybe the sausage that is a little too Herby for my taste.\n\nThe coffee was great! The staff recommended the Brazil bean and I liked it. :)\n\nDining limit is 90mins\n\nTbh it can be a little pricey, but the food and ambience is great! Using the thub passion card gives you additional 10% if you order at the counter :)\n",

The coffee is great  - the Piccolo latte is rich and creamy, and the long black is elegant and fruity. My favourite is sourdough toast, sunny-side-up eggs and some bacon - and they have exactly that and I wouldn\u2019t mind eating that every day. The other big plus is the soothing ambience of the place, which makes it a perfect place for a laid back morning.\n\nFood was not bad and the ambience was nice! Great place for a gathering!\nWe ordered:\n- Honey lemon mint tea (refreshing!)\n\n- bottled water\n\n- strawberry shake\n\n- choc shake\n\n- matcha latte (choice of hot or cold)\n\n- turmeric oat latte\n\n- Caff\u00e8 latte\n\n- vanilla shake\n\n- herb crusted salmon\n\n- seafood marinara linguine\n\n- soup of the day (mushroom soup and comes with 2 slices of sourdough bread)\n\n- Angus beef burger\n\n- Hearty breakfast\n\n- PBA toast\n\nCoffee is good and been to this cafe for sometime. But! Today ordered a chicken pie and it came cold inside ask for a reheat and in the end the food served is what shown on the pictures. Left the pie it is and left the place. Now I dk if this place is worth or not\u2026.\n\nIs a very pretty place to have lunch. The salmon was well cooked, just the crust was too salty for my taste. Matcha had soya option, very nice indeed.\n\nHaven\u2019t tried the food yet but will definitely come back for the food. Coffee was good\n",

They said they didn\u2019t touch it, but I\u2019m not taking his word for it, plus there are 3 people at that table talking and laughing, so not that very most sanitary in my eyes.\n10 minutes later I got my food again, new? Or not I don\u2019t know, however it was not creamy, and I as very bland, oily water base, spaghetti, and meat that tasted like pork and not chicken. Really unappealing\n\nPizza was ok, just remember you\u2019re not eating a actual pizza even though they mention they have ingredients imported from Italy, it\u2019s a plain wheat tortilla with toppings. The topping were ok, but the rest wasn\u2019t, I would give food 0 stars if i could. As well as service as some had masks serving food, and some weren\u2019t.\n\nLast but not least, I few flies flying around, so I suspect the restaurant is sanitary unclean, probably violating a few health codes, I would r come back here, however great vibe and place for teenagers to come to. Comfortable seats as well.\n\nOrdered the Garlic Brocolli Salad, Crispy Chicken Strips, a Chicken Pasta, Mussels and a beverage (Free Flow)\n\nTotal bill was \n\nI have been patronising Saizeriya at their various locations. White Sands is the best outlet so far in terms of food and the customer service. I ordered Black Pepper Pasta Chicken the other day and requested for chicken to be replaced with mushrooms as I am a vegetarian. The young and very petite staff named Shu Hui (or Shi Hui?) obliged and I got what I requested. Very courteous and professional. Think the company should implement Crew of the Month as incentive. Each staff should wear a name tag so that we diners can give the due compliments.\nWould suggest that the online ordering portal to build in the edit function for special request. Overall, Saizeriya is my favourite cafe to go to. I love \u2764\ufe0f the Oreo Cheesecake especially. The Semifreddo is too sweet for my liking.\n\nPortions are reduced. Does not taste as good as before. This could be the last time i patronize Saizeriya. This could be why there is no more lunch time crowd or long line.\n\nOur favorite family restaurant. Great selection of food. Value for money.  But all their outlets always seem shorthanded. Hope they can hire more servers!\n\nWe ordered seafood stew from the seasonal menu today. It's comforting to eat this on a cold day. Wish it is a little bit more spicy though.\n",

Go through the photos I have posted and you will realise why I rated so high for the location.\n\nThey also  have an open to sky arrangement for family to bring their food and prepare barbeque,just by the bay\n\nFriend booked a glamping staycation here and it was horrendous. Inside the tent was very humid and the air cooler is so small that it literally does nothing. We originally booked a dome for the night but all of it was so dirty and in the end they downgraded us to a smaller tent. The dome tent has a fridge that is mouldy and a fan. But when they move us to a smaller tent, all we have is an air cooler and our mattress downgraded to an air mattress that is very uncomfortable to sleep in. Our tent has fairy lights that keeps flashing on and off and it caused everyone a headache and there is no proper lighting inside the tent. Overall it was a very unpleasant stay and we won\u2019t be coming here again.\n\nMouldy ceilings. Dirty and sticky tables, chairs and floor. We had to ask the management for a mop and cleaned everything by ourselves. Some chairs were very unstable, seem like they were gonna break easily. Air conditioners were useless. Some didn't even function properly. External light for the bbq pit didn't work so it was very dark. The bbq pit wasn't cleaned when we arrived, there were still old charcoals. Refrigerator didn't work on the 1st day. Bathrooms were extremely dirty. The washing machine leaked water and made a pool in the kitchen.\n\nChalet is huge and good for young groups to party. However , you have to limit your noise due to the distance between the glamping sites. Management will keep calling you to lower your volume. All doors closed , yet management ask u to reduce volume. Chalets are old , no televisions , olden days facilities , not well upgraded. If u do not drive , it will be very far. No food nearby. U have to only rely on grab. Bedroom beds are very hard , stiff pillows , stale smelling toilets. Not for family or ladies.\n\nThe tents are equipped with airbeds even though proper beds were promised to us. The rooms were to be air conditioned, but there is only one pathetic air cooler which doesn't even really work. It was very very warm. It was an uncomfortable stay. The toilets are dirty and it wasn't the most ideal. The kids couldn't sleep well as every movement made sounds. The service is not up to standard because the place is run by foreign workers and they can't make the decision when the boss is not around.\n\nThe only plus point here is the location. It is near the beach and the playground. The bbq was also alright.\n",

The mookata grills were relatively new and staff were attentive to us most of the time.\n\nGreat place to eat and relax and chitchat with friends! The atmosphere is very laid back thus very relaxing. Great variety of food! Great variety of chilli sauce to go with the food! The Thai Ice Milk Tea is great! Comes in a tower for family sharing too! Their beef is great! So is their chicken and fish glue!\n\nOrdered the ala carte mookata for 3 pax which costed around $55 inclusive of service charge.\n\nPrice-wise is very affordable! The prices of the ala carte dishes range between $1.80 and $4+ and the portion per set is generous too (definitely enough to be shared).\n\nFood-wise was just average; wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s exceptionally delicious because the meat quality is just so-so. However, they do offer free serving of ice cream per ala carte mookata order; the ice creams were great though and appetising!\n\nOverall, really affordable and suitable for group meals (although I am unlikely to patronise again unless I am really craving for it).\n\nThe food was excellent, especially the chili sauces. I'd recommend getting the Thai fish sausage, prawn paste, and fish noodles in particular. The prices were reasonable too. The service crew got the job done, though they could be friendlier.\n\nHad dinner yesterday. I usually enjoyed the food from other outlets but this one it was horrible.\n\nThe meats was bland and beef was off taste, I'm guessing the preparation was badly done. Only to be saved by their special chilli sauce. Prawns were also not as fresh.\n\nRice was of either bad quality or undercooked as they were quite hard.\n\nWould not come back here anytime soon. Maybe will go other outlets.\n",

Decent good food with great service! By the way, it\u2019s a pet friendly restaurant with live band on certain days.\n\nFrequent this cafe cause it's next door and how their chicken wings are just amaze-balls. Jumbo wings with a solid prawn paste flavor and fried ti perfection.\n\nThe location is pretty ulu and far flung but it's quite nice to eat there! Out door seating and pet friendly as well. Really like their mee goreng\n\nMy first visit at Bark Cafe was excellent and surely will visit more times! It is not so easily accessible and u will need a car or cab to get here conveniently. The food quality is super high and we loved every dish ordered. Well done chefs! However, the food variety HAS to be improved. So many of the dishes contain pork. Arent there more types of food to be offered? Please review and improve your menu.  You dont need to put pork in everything! About the place.. The ambience is fantastic! Love the open air seating and the pet friendly atmosphere. Service staff are very warm and friendly as well. Wonderful human beings! One girl made an error into an intrusion to my privacy but I took that as innocent ignorance and Im sure she will learn from it. Overall, a fantadtic place to have a meal and chill out.\n\nGreat place for dine in and food was good. Will be back again next round. Thanks for the great service experience.\n",

Their food is delicious and reasonably priced. Their service was fast too. Great place to have breakfast as it opens as early as 8am.\n\nShop does not entertain reservations.\n\n***\n\nVisited without reservations anyway. Food was not all that great. Orders were delivered wrongly. (No word of apologies).\nNot worth time and effort though Lorong Chuan is a cool enclave. Give it a miss.\n\nThere wasn't cold so I liked it. Best of all, the coffee's tasted so good!!! It wasn't sour and I loved that I could taste two different types of espresso. I think the price is reasonable, too.\n\nDecent brunch place. I love that tax & GST r inclusive in the menu price\n\nMy go to is the chicken burger set. Really filling and tasty, esp the generous sweet potatoes\n\nCroissant egg was decent. The croissant should be more chewy and buttery.\nThe added chicken was very generous, but quite dry and boring\n\nThey will serve free water if u ask. In a small glass, but won't refill\n\nThe seats r limited. I always prefer coming in solo for some quiet brunch time\n\nSourdough with avocado and coffee were really good. Chocolate croissant not as great but not bad neither. Service staff was so friendly and welcoming. Place was clean and tidy. Not crowded during a Sunday afternoon which I like it too.\n",

I added pate for $2 which is creamy and complements the sauces and meats.\nGrilled BBQ pork - the meats is well marinated and kinda like a savory sausage. Not bad.\nSlat baked roast chicken - children like this cos the meat flavour is milder than the pork I guess\nSpring rolls - quite large pieces, suggest to buy and share esp is also buying the banh mi.\n\nOverall must eat! I believe the rat saga is well over and I wish the staff and business all the best to continue providing great Vietnamese fare!\n\nI am not a fan of Banh Mi but this changed my mind about this humble sandwich. The bun was crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside while the generous fillings were flavourful but yet not too salty. The coffees were good too and were huge enough to be shared. Glad that dine-in is available again as the ambience was very quirky and authentic. Friendly service too. The menu is diverse and includes pho, spring rolls and flan. Those who stay nearby to this gem are really lucky.\n\nCame here cause I was recommended by a friend, wasn\u2019t a fan of Vietnamese food in Singapore and bahn mi but this stall changed my mind about it.\nUtilizing a super crispy and crunchy baguette for their bahn mi, I would say their bread is the star of the show. Not forgetting their generous toppings, given that it\u2019s about $9 making it priced fairly in my opinion.\n\nThe other \u201cplated\u201d stuff like their rice noodles and rice meals are also great, I had the grilled bbq pork rice noodles for $10. It\u2019s a little pricey given that it\u2019s not exactly a cafe , however the taste is great and you should try it for yourself.\n\nThe stools provided are a little uncomfortable for adults but they bring a certain cute atmosphere to the place hence I gave it 4 stars here for atmosphere.\n\nOrdered number 4, with the roasted pork, and all the fixings (cucumber, coriander, spring onions, pate). They\u2019re super generous with the servings, and there\u2019s lots of ingredients stuffed in the lightly toasted baguette; the whole thing was the length of my forearm!!\n\nThe takeaway corner also has friendly staff, especially the cashier who patiently asks every customer how they\u2019d like their order, and helps make recommendations when the extensive menu makes choosing just 1 thing too difficult.\n\n10/10 would love to come again!\n\nI recently had the pleasure of dining at Banh My Saigon in Singapore, and I must say, it was an absolute delight. This unassuming gem of a restaurant offers a culinary experience that is nothing short of exceptional.\n\nThe first thing that struck me about Banh My Saigon was its cozy and inviting ambiance. The warm and welcoming decor creates a comfortable setting for a memorable dining experience. The staff, too, were incredibly friendly and attentive, adding a personal touch to the entire visit.\n\nNow, let's talk about the food. Banh My Saigon specializes in Vietnamese cuisine, and they do it with an authenticity that's hard to come by. I started with the traditional pho, and it was a flavorful bowl of comfort. The broth was rich, the noodles perfectly cooked, and the meat tender and full of flavor. It truly transported me to the streets of Vietnam.\n\nThe real star of the show, however, was their banh mi. The crispy baguette, fresh vegetables, and a choice of mouthwatering fillings make for a sandwich that is an explosion of flavors and textures. Whether you're a fan of classic options like the grilled pork or daring enough to try their unique creations, you won't be disappointed.\n\nOne thing that stood out for me at Banh My Saigon was the attention to detail in their dishes. It's clear that the chefs take great pride in their craft. The presentation was as impressive as the taste, making every meal a feast for both the eyes and the palate.\n\nWhat also impressed me was the affordability of the food. You get high-quality Vietnamese cuisine at reasonable prices, making it an excellent option for both casual dining and special occasions.\n\nIn conclusion, Banh My Saigon in Singapore is a true culinary gem. With its warm ambiance, friendly staff, and delicious, authentic Vietnamese dishes, it's a must-visit for anyone looking to embark on a culinary journey to Vietnam without leaving Singapore. I can't recommend this place enough, and I'm already looking forward to my next visit.\n",

Always faced with very bad attitude from both the younger and older female vietnamese ladies. Only the Chinese guy working there is polite. No choice as this is the only vietnamese place in the area to satisfy cravings.\n\nToday was the last straw. Faced with the usual bad attitude and was charged $10 for the above meal which was prepared in 30secs.\n\nMost vietnamese people I've met have been so friendly and warm. Quite sad that these people come to Singapore for a better life and instead start to cheat and abuse Singaporeans.\n\nWill stop patronizing this stall from now on.\n\nNice Vietnamese noodles at reasonably price. A hearty portion and flavorful soup. Can try.\n\nChanced upon this when craving for Vietnamese rice rolls and it is such a great find! Although $7 for 4 rolls for a stall at coffee shop, the fat rolls are worth it! The prawn and beef noodles soup (although there were pork ribs inside) was nice too. Glad this can be found at AMK\n\nNot common to get hu tieu namvang so I decided to try.\n\nTaste wise is quite nice though I think too salty w msg taste. For $7 they do giv quite abit of meat n prawn is fresh\n\nWill look forward to try other dishes.\n\nSuper delicious Vietnamese food.\nI rarely give good comment for Vietnamese food in Singapore as not much good tasted as my country.

But really no standard. Ordered lemongrass chicken rice. But the whole thing taste like garlic and black pepper. No lemongrass taste. And the chicken was heat up in microwave. Not my kind of food.\nI dont know what gravy they use also.\n\nFlavourful hearty bowl of Pho, noodles were springy and light along with tender beef slices.\n\nThe soup is nice. It is just nice. Not f-ing shiok, not taste bad. Just \"meh\". Fragrant but blend. Its has a strong flavourful smell but when you drink the soup, it didnt live up to the expectations.

There must be an interesting story behind their decision to sell these 2 unrelated type of food :).\n\nAnyway, decided to try their banh mi. The bread was soft inside and crispy outside. Nice sauce and well marinated meat.\n\nVery rare to find Vietnamese cuisine in food centre. Laksa seems to be the popular for most residences. But decided to try the original Vietnamese pho. No regrets. Tasted very nice nd generous with the shredded chicken $3.50. The broth is so flavourful. Another must eat is their spring roll \u00d72pcs $2.50. Usually you need to travel downtown to Vietnamese restaurant. So this is the place if you want to enjoy simple Vietnamese food. My next visit will try the Laksa and rice item. For tourist, come and experience this and other local food stalls. No regrets.\n\nOne of my go to lunch places at Mayflower Market. From Mayflower MRT station (TEL) take exit 2 or 3.\n\nAuthentic taste and really value for money. The stall serve Laksa that is equally delicious too.\n\nSpring roll noodle and special pork chop rice are my favourite but you can also try their fresh vietnamese spring roll, banh mi, and chicken ph\u00f3\ud83e\udd24\ud83e\udd24\ud83e\udd24yum!\n\nThis is the laksa i been having since i was a kid, which is also my late father favourite laksa. Elderly uncle no longer cook the laksa now. maybe that reason the laksa taste abit off but still not bad.  Elderly uncle will still come to stall and see see look look. The stall now focus more on vietnamese food.\n\nLaksa sauce was thick and flavorful. Quite typical ingredients like cockles, sliced fish cake, tau pok and bean sprouts.\n",

                  "reviews": "\n\nWas planning on visiting FIC for a very long time already, and we managed to drop by this sunday afternoon! Owners were very friendly and heartwarming, and the food were delicious!\n\nWe ordered FIC Fried Spring Roll Vermicelli Bowl, Fresh Spring Rolls, Paper Pizza (Lemongrass Chicken + Mentaiko Crabmeat), Phin Viet Coffee (Iced, White) and Fried Ice Cream (Coconutti).\n\nVermicelli Bowl was full of herbs and flavours, and it was not too spicy (good for people who can't take too much spice).\n\nFresh Spring Rolls were packed full of ingredients, and the dipping sauce elevated the whole dish.\n\nPaper Pizzas were true to their names - they were really crispy rice paper(?) topped with generous amounts of ingredients and 1 pizza can fit 1 pax perfectly (the owners mentioned that it was actually a side dish).\n\nViet Coffee had a very unique aftertaste, and I really enjoyed it even though I'm not much of a coffee person. The sweetness level has been adjusted to suit the local tastebuds, so it wasn't too sweet/bitter.\n\nWe ended our scrumptious meal with a serving of their famous Fried Ice Cream (FIC), topped with a nice amount of coconut shavings and nuts! The ice cream was vanilla-flavoured, and the outer crust layer was fried to a nice crisp.\n\nOverall, we enjoyed ourselves and will definitely return to check out other items on their menu! Thank you for having us :) Highly recommended!\n\nYummy experience at FIC at a local neighbourhood area. Owner created her own dishes to suit local Singaporean with her unique twist of viet cuisine. Super yummy! Definitely worth the try, our favourite was the Cold white coffee, spring rolls and paper pizza. Do come down and support!\n\nGreat little cafe with affordable food with food that easily out match the pricing by a mile!\n\nThe coffee and vermicelli bowl were the highlight dishes for me! The Viet rolls and pizza came in a close second. Despite not being the top rated in my book, every single dish that came out of the kitchen was beautifully presented and satisfying to eat. No complaints in the food department!\n\nThe service was excellent as well!! The owner gladly and proudly introduced dishes to us and took her time to let us know what to expect from the dishes. She was absolutely easy to talk to, more than happy to answer any questions that you may have. Note: There are items that aren't on the menu. Strike a conversation with her, and she'll gladly tell you about the items that weren't shown on the menu.\n\nThe coffee took a while before their ready, but absolutely worth the wait. My advice is to order another drink together with the coffee to sip while you wait.\n\nThe vermicelli bowl is bee hoon based, soaked, and marinated with beautiful flavours of Vietnam! If this is your first time eating Vietnam cuisine, this would be a great introduction, something familiar to welcome you into a new cuisine. The only thing people might not be accustomed to is that the vermicelli bowl is served cold.\n\nOverall, it's a must try! Even if you're new to Vietnamese cuisine, this would be a great place to start.\n\nLoved the fried spring rolls, super crispy and tasty. The fresh rolls were also super generously stuffed with prawn and pork. Overall really yummy & will be back. The owner is super sweet too :)\nOnly downside for me was the ventilation (the place was abit smoky)\n\nFried Ice Cream sounded like a very interesting proposition so we thought to give this restaurant a try. First impressions is that the food was carefully prepared and looks good. We liked the chicken wings and vermicelli more than the rice plates. The pizza was by far the best dishes but not filling as it\u2019s super thin. I think this restaurant is still new as orders still gets mixed up (serving later customers earlier). The Fried Ice Cream was very beautifully prepared but all of us felt it was kinda watery inside probably due to the heat from deep frying. Very friendly service from the cashier.

                  "reviews": "\n\n3pcs fresh spring roll ($5.50)\nFresh ingredients, large amount of pork belly and fresh prawns. 3 pcs for that price is worthy and considerate esp at neighbourhood area. Will takeaway again if im around Marymount.\n\nCold milk coffee ($2.80)\nNice thick viet milk coffee, even the ice has melt I felt the drink was still great. It doesnt cut on the amount. As compared to coffeeshop price it may be pricey, but the thickness of it is worth the try.\n\nDownside of the place is more for takeaways, nonetheless the food are prepared esp for rolls are done upon request. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\n\nI ordered the black pepper beef banh mi. They were really generous with the beef, every bite I had was full of it. The bread was also very fragrant and delicious. I would say it wasn\u2019t as crispy as other banh mi places I\u2019ve visited, but again that could be due to condensation from having to take away the food (no seating).\n\nAlso, if you\u2019re a student, you get 10% off every set meal (banh mi + drink). So it usually works out to be around $7, which is extremely affordable. :)\n\nAll in all I would absolutely visit this place again.\n\nIf I could give 3.5 stars I would.\nTL:DR new stall finding their footing, wait time too long, food nothing special.\n\n**But I do think they will continue to grow and change since the stall is pretty new.\n--------------\nOur usual Vietnamese stall at the nearby market is closed and on one grocery trip we walked past this and thought to give it a try.\n\nWe got the Signature Pork Banh Mi ($6.50), Chicken Banh Mi ($5.50) and Beef Rice Vermicelli ($6.50). It seems you can request for no spicy / less spicy / more spicy for the Banh Mi.\n\nIt's a takeaway-only stall with no seats at the bottom of a HDB block. There was one lady assembling the Banh Mi, another at the back whom I assumed was preparing ingredients, a man manning the cashier. I do hope they are refining their processes because I waited 20-25 mins for my order. There were 2 people who had ordered ahead of me. It didn't help I needed to rush off to work, but I did feel the wait was a bit too long.\n\nSignature Pork Banh Mi looked like it was made from sliced ham - to be fair the slices were tasty, we were just expecting actual meat. It was also unexpected that other ingredients (veggie and condiments) weren't very tasty / present. Perhaps we have been spoiled by Banh Mis that cannot be closed due to overflowing veggie and meat for a slightly lower price....\n\nFlavours-wise, the rice vermicelli wasn't very exciting - that is, compared to the usual market stall or even the one I have at work. I'm not sure if the sauce is diluted or if it's their recipe, but it's somewhat flat and mild. I was concerned it would be spicy but had zero issues. The amount of meat given was pretty good for the price. I did feel there could have been more veggies though!\n\nWe're not in a hurry to purchase again, but never say never :)\n\nI was walking around and saw this newly open place selling banh my and coffee. It looks authentic so I decided to try and loved it. The person who was making banh my was actually a Vietnamese and the taste was great. It was crispy and delicious.\n\nI also ordered a coconut milk coffee and it was very good as well. It was strong but refreshing at the same time.\n\nThe B\u00e1nh M\u00ec was assembled by herself infront of your eyes with fresh ingredient and toasted after. The crispy loaf had its unique taste from p\u00e2t\u00e9, french word for paste that\u2019s usually made from some meat.\n\nB\u00e1nh M\u00ec & Coffee by Phan have 4 different B\u00e1nh M\u00ec you can choose from.\n- Signature Pork B\u00e1nh M\u00ec $6.5\n- Black Pepper Beef B\u00e1nh M\u00ec $6.5\n- Shredded Chicken B\u00e1nh M\u00ec $5.5\n- Golden Egg B\u00e1nh M\u00ec $5\n\nThey also served other authentic Vietnamese cuisine like Spring roll(3pcs $5.50), Shredded Chicken with rice vermicelli($5.50) and Black pepper beef with rice vermicelli($6.50) which are really affordable to the hood.\n\nThere\u2019s a distinct fragrance from the Milk Coffee ($2.50 Hot) that I couldn\u2019t really describe what it is. I also recommend trying their Ice Coconut Milk Coffee ($3) here.\n",

Chicken pho costs only $6 but you get a ton of food, light/refreshing/authentic broth. $9.80 Grilled lemon grass chicken with egg and rice, acceptable price, grilled chicken was tender and comes with appetizing sauce. Fried chicken $7, a bit on the dry side but i think the flavor's good. Though there's room for improvement on the food, but i do think we should support new F&B establishments in north east area that adds to the vibrancy in the food scene!\n\nHaving the chicken cutlet with garlic fried rice, still eating halfway but already felt the need to share! Surprisingly good; fried rice with wok hei, cutlet with right crispiness and flavour, spicy but shiok chili. More veg would be nice though. Will be back to try the other items on the menu. Owner/staff also said Banh Mi will be added soon\n\nAte here because I happened to be in the area. The stall doesn't look like much but the food is on point! Had the cutlet and fried rice, fresh and well fried. The cutlet was legit and the rice was surprisingly solid with good wok hei. Better than your average zi char for sure.\n\nOrdered chicken pho for my daughter and char kway teow (spicy) for myself.  Both were very tasty, and they were quite generous in terms of ingredients!  Good value!\n\nHad the Taiwanese chicken cutlet and fried kway teow. Nice!\n",

It has, hands down, the best Vietnamese barbecue in Singapore. The staff are always so friendly and accommodating, and the owner never fails to make you feel at home by personally greeting each guest. And let\u2019s talk about the food - absolutely delicious every single time! The raw prawn dish, in particular, is to die for. It\u2019s obvious that a lot of care goes into every aspect of this restaurant, from the carefully crafted menu to the overall atmosphere. I always look forward to my visits to Lang N\u01b0\u1edbng Vietnam and highly recommend it to anyone looking for authentic flavors and top-notch service. It\u2019s always a treat to dine here!\n\nFood very nice. I like their cockles in tamraind sauxe as well as the prawns steamed in herbs. Service staff very approachable and friendly. Very attentive to your needs. Ambience very nice, feels like you are transported to a local eatery in Vietnam with the low tables and chairs. Vietnamese music in the play too .\n\nStumbled into this restaurant on a Sunday and it was empty compared to the rest of its neighbours.\n\nWe ordered the BBQ meat dishes as recommended and asked for them to help us with the BBQ in the kitchen.\n\nPork was the best of the lot.\nThe premium beef was out of stock and we opted for the VN beef. It tasted like protein just not beef. It was coated with alot of sweet sauce and we could quite make out what meat it was.\n\nThe coke we ordered was flat and there wasn\u2019t and fizz left.\n\nWe packed some more food home.\nThe usual, Pho, spring rolls to continue out dinner as it was really stuffy and hot in the restaurant.\n\nStaff was friendly except a little forgetful.\nWe waited half an hour only to be informed they ran out of the dish we ordered.\n\nSelf proclaimed first Vietnamese BBQ in Singapore that transports you to Vietnam with its low tables and chairs, making you believe you're eating on the streets of Saigon.\nMeat never tasted this refreshing with their generous serving of herbs and tangy sauces.\n\n29 May 2023:\nthe most authentic Vietnamese food I\u2019ve tasted in Singapore so far. grilled pork & vermicelli was really good!!! fried spring rolls made us gasp a bit so definitely must try. the shaky beef was not good, too tough- lesson learnt, don\u2019t order a dish just cause the name is funny. their coffee is nice but wished it was stronger (Vietnamese coffee has to knock you off your chair to be of standard right?)\n\n3rd July 2023:\nDecided to try their broken rice. It\u2019s as good as the vermicelli! really loved the meatloaf too (it has tiny noodles inside) overall great, clean & fills you up.\n",

                  "reviews": "\n\nThis unassuming joint in Kovan has a small but tasty menu of Vietnamese salad bowls and banh mi. It is a quick-serve concept that caters to healthy eaters with less sugar and salt, and virtually no MSG or oil. Special mention goes to the avocado mousse ice cream \u2014 a rare find in Singapore.\n\n[What it\u2019s good for]\nThe banh mi classic (S$9.50) is stacked full of pate and butter spread, Vietnamese pork ham (cha lua), pork floss, pickled carrots and daikon, and enough chilli to make you sweat. The ham is the standout star, thanks to its meaty juiciness. The banh mi beef ribeye (S$13) features premium beef ribeye that's sliced fairly thinly and roasted perfectly with a flavourful tenderness and a touch of five spice. The sandwich is stuffed with a heap of coriander and fresh chilli. The pork belly bowl (S$10.80) comes with a generous portion of chunky and fatty pork belly, which is tender and nice to chew on. There\u2019s also a certain smokiness from the marinade that melds harmoniously with the other ingredients. For the more health-conscious, try the regular pork bowl (S$10.80) that is less fatty than the pork belly version and vibrates with a more savoury umami flavour.\n\nVietnamese coffee (S$4.60) is the only drink served here. It's rich and has a dark flavour profile, with strong chocolate and caramel notes. The avocado mousse ice cream (S$6.80) \u2014 dark green avocado mousse at the bottom of the bowl, with coconut ice cream, desiccated coconut, almond flakes, and chopped peanuts on top \u2014 is a beautiful dance between the decadently creamy mousse and denser, milky ice cream.\n\n[What it could improve on]\nThere was a lack of sauce (think sriracha) and oil \u2014 perhaps olive or sesame \u2014 that could take the banh mi here to another level.\n\n[Our quick takes]\nIs it conducive to conversation? -\u2014Yes, but I can\u2019t imagine it\u2019s the kind of place you\u2019d want to stay at for long.\nIs a reservation necessary? \u2014 No reservation needed!\nHow to get there? \u2014 A 13-minute walk from Serangoon MRT station should get your appetite started. Otherwise, there are several buses from both Serangoon and Kovan MRT stops.\n\n[Things to note]\nIf you like the salad sauce, you can add 50 cents for another container \u2014 totally worth it.\nDo note that this place is hardly suitable for groups \u2014 there are just eight stools and three wooden tables. I\u2019d consider it more of a delivery and takeaway spot.\n\nRead more at HungryGoWhere for the full review\n\nA hidden gem around upset Serangoon, nested among the boutique cafes. Well toasted bahn mi with generous ingredients, could be stronger in taste with more sauces but still great overall!\nOrdered the grilled pork bowl filled with lots of well charred grilled pork balanced out with crunchy vegs and rice vermicelli, will try the other bowls next time!\n\nLocated deep within a commercial space in between Kovan and Serangoon is this humble Vietnamese restaurant.\n\nDishes ordered were the chicken bowl and pork banh mi. Personally I would give the banh mi a miss mainly due to the tough pork meat used. On the other side, the chicken bowl was such a great deal, ingredients were generously given, mints and greens were so refreshing and crunchy while the nuts within gives a good crunch in texture.\n\nLittle downside would be its price and location.\nAlso please take note that there are very limited tables (3) for dine-in as this place mainly serves takeaway.\n\nWe tried the Pork Bowl, Chicken Bowl and also the Tofu Bowl. I like the char-ness with the roasted pork and chicken in both the meat bowl. I like that there is the option of tofu bowl which is vegetarian, as you know, we have all got one of such friend.\n\nThey are filled with greens including romaine lettuce, japanese cucumbers, big cherry tomatoes, mint, basil, pickles carrots and daikon. The mint gave a refreshing taste. There\u2019s also chopped roast peanut for that addition crunch and taste.\n\nThe Chilled Vietnamese Coffee is really bold and strong with added sweetness from condensed milk. A little sweet and could do with some melted ice for that perfect taste.\n\nDelicious Vietnamese food! We had the pork belly and chicken bowl which was very flavourful. The chilled Vietnamese coffee tasted bold and refreshing. Will come back again!\n",

Very no frills and simple place.\n\nShe had a falafel moussaka, and I had the mexican beef bowl. The moussaka was delicious but I feel like 5 pieces of nacho chips wasn\u2019t enough and mind you this cost $13\u2026..\n\nThe beef bowl was a little dry, could do with some kind of sauce but it was good and we finished both dishes. The churros came freshly fried and was good too, but would have preferred actual choc sauce vs the hershey choc syrup.\n\nOnly gripes; the overly sugary lemongrass drink that was served premade with no ice. Had to ask for ice twice but given few pieces\u2026..  also very weird that we dined in but were served with plastic cutlery when we clearly saw metal cutlery, it was a little strange. It was practically only 2 tables and the lady served my food to the other table\u2026. Could tell she wanted to take it back to serve me but they already started eating it.\n\nI think its a quaint little place but some things need to be improved. At $30 for 2 expected just a little more.\n\nExcellent service. The beef Mexican rice bowl was not bad. With the homemade drink, I spent less than $10. I was there alone at 5 ish and I had the entire place to myself. I don't remember music playing but it sure would be nice to listen to some tunes.\n\nSmall quaint shop located near Tai Seng Mrt, they had a $10 set meal that had a wrap, small hash brown and a lemongrass tea. There was a small side of nacho chips with salsa.\n\nNothing amazing but I guess it was better than nothing coz there wasn\u2019t anything there open before 11am\n\nDropped-off my 10-months old laptop at LENOVO Service Centre at 3 Irving Rd, #01-17 Tai Seng Centre. BITC, Singapore 369522 on Tuesday 18 April 2023,\n\nThus decide to settle my late lunch within the area too.\n\nOne will be spoiled with choices as there are so many small eateries and cafes. I was drawn to  Olive Mediterranean & Middle East which was located across the street at 11 Irving Place #01-14/15, Tai Seng Point, Singapore 369551.\n\nOrdered for myself a Mexican Rice (Celantro & Spinach With Beef) Bowl at S$7.50.\n\nIf you are a small eater, the serving portion is just right. However, definitely a \"No. No.\" for someone who has a heavy duty digestive system, I would recommend that you order some nachos or Quesadillas too.\n\nIn my opinion, the rice is mildy aromatic (I was expecting a more pungent aroma of Celantro and spinach).\n\nI will rate the minced beef topping as \"healthy choice\".  It is relatively quite nice BUT will not leave one any special impression.  It will definitely taste alot better if there is a little more fat (this will enhance the juiciness) and more spices are added.\n\nHowever, if you working in this area, it is a great place to meet up with your colleagues and friends after work.  You can sufficient outdoor sittings surrounded with plants.\n\nStumbled on this place as i happened to be browsing around. Been awhile since i had my tacos and wraps, decided to try this as i noticed they had very high reviews.\n\nHad the beef Quesadilla - loved it as it was simply nice\nChicken Saffron Stew - Soooo tender and nice but soup wasnt as thick as i wanted but thats purely due to my own taste\nHashbrowns - Thumbsup as we all loved it. Hearsay its even better than M's hashbrown but i leave it for u to judge.\n\nService wise was top, very homely feel given by the lady boss and staff. She took her time to guide me through the menu and shared with me what we should order.\nI must say the food takes a pretty long time to come for a quiet Monday Afternoon but i guess Good Food - Time to prepare so no complaints from me on this.\n\nOverall i recommend this place based on the food served + prices. Very nice and they deserves better businesses. should be pretty quiet when its after office hours.\n\nWill be back again :)\n",

They need to learn how to walk while looking around rather than looking at the floor. Myanmar, India, Philippines staff good! The rest better wake up. Nonetheless Vibe wise band is good. Service can be better on a slow Monday Night. Good draught promo but bottle wise still expensive. Food was decent! Overall I\u201dm just truthful.\n\nThere's live performance on Friday. I enjoyed the performance and the setting of the bistro. The place has a big seating, so during peek hours, you need to be patient. Food are always good. Their lamb chops were nicely done. Seafood marianna and chicken wings were nice too.\n\nIt's an ok bar to chill out with friends. its annoying with their Chinese live band, no international vibes. Was ok at first with English songs from the stereo till the live band started. Price was ok for a bar standard. Had a calamari and soju with coke for about 40 bucks\n\nHighly do not recommend. UNHYGIENIC PLACE, FULL OF INSECTS with bad service recovery.\n\nLizard on their counter. Black bug in my cocktail. My drink was still a full glass as I only had tiny sips. The staff (lady with short hair) tried to return me the same drink sans the bug. Told me to speak to her supervisor instead.\n\nHer supervisor was apologetic but insincere. He gave me a replacement drink that was extremely diluted with water. Based on the other reviews on here, this is their standard SOP.\n\nAvoid at all cost unless you are willing to put your stomach at risk. There are much better bar options elsewhere.\n\nGreat place to enjoy a drink or two with family or friends. Live music entertainment helps liven up the atmosphere. It's getting crowded over the years compared to when it first started.\n",

Always love their baby back ribs, juicy soft and tender moist from outside to inside, their mussels are also very good. Friendly staffs and serene surroundings, serves very good beer, will definitely come back again.\n\nNice area at Punggol settlement. By the seaside on the 2nd level, you can feel the sea breeze and occasionally sighting of climbing monkeys on the trees. Enjoy the sun set and enjoying the beer.\n\nService staff was excellent and attentive. Great service I must say, kudos to the team.\n\nDespite been a bar, there\u2019s kids menu for my kido so the adult can drink at ease without worrying what to order for the kids.\n\nThe beef burger was superb, as the veg were fresh as it can be and the patty is as juicy as it should be. No wet buns or whatsoever.\n\nMussel was well prepared, and my family enjoys it.\n\nI regularly bring family and friends as this place has a great atmosphere, excellent food and perfect service. It's an enjoyable moment every time we go.\nIt's very cozy. The sea is litterally 10 meters away. There's a huge fish tank to make your kids busy. And the staff especially Melanie and Ken are very friendly and always go the extra mile to wow our visit giving us not choice to come back regularly.\nThank you.\nGregory\n\nMade reservations for a simple dinner with a friend here. The location itself, which is at Punggol Settlement, is really inaccessible if you aren't driving a car. The nearest LRT station is Punggol Point, after which you would have to walk 1.2km. Not too sure about the bus, but I am pretty sure it's not too frequent as well.\n\nHowever, this restaurant was worth the long journey. First of all, we were really lucky to be able to sit indoors because it had started to drizzle slightly. We were also seated directly in front of the TV, which was coincidentally showing the Women's World Cup between Colombia and England. Although we don't usually watch soccer, the atmosphere and the hype made the experience all the more worthwhile and we found ourselves watching it intensely too. For the food, we ordered spaghetti aglio olio, truffle fries, mojitoh and peach coolers. The aglio olio was delicious, although the portion could have been slightly more. The peach coolers was perfect to cool me down during a hot day, after which I ordered one more glass of it. The staff was also really professional in ensuring that our orders were swiftly prepared and that the food came out fast. Overall, if you are willing to travel a bit further, we recommend coming here for a chill night with friends or family. You can even walk along the coast after dinner, which was really relaxing.\n\nWe had a last minute family gathering (25 adults) for dinner at George's by the Bay.  The atmosphere was great.  The service was slightly slow but understandable given our large group and other guests at the restaurant (it was also a public holiday).  Kudos to staff for being accommodating - we had reserved tables for 16 but had to accommodate an additional 9.  All the dishes ( chicken satay, chicken wings, fries, chops, fish and chips, mushroom soup, garlic bread, and more) were delicious.   Will highly recommend and return!\n",

Food was quite average in taste.\n\nWent here to past time till my friends came. Bought the Mee Thai Goreng and a delish Bandung , just enogh milkiness which I don't always get and sweetness.\n\nThe meal was sweet, mild spicy and savoury. The mee is on the wet side akin to Those mildy wet hokkien mee. Not the dry fried kind of mee Goreng I'm used to.

Makes for a great place to chill out with friends/family. Can get loud and noisy at times. The cycling and walking trail from Sengkang goes through the settlement.\n\nThe public toilet though can be pretty disgusting  especially during public hoildays and weekends.\n\nThis place was delightful to eat at, the seafood was very fresh and portions were very large, staff also were very friendly. The yam meal was one of the most tastiest things I ate in Singapore. I will eat here again!\n\nCame here because of good reviews. Indeed, it didn't disappoint us.\n\nIf you want to enjoy the happy hour beers, the best hour is come before 7pm to enjoy the special price.\n\nLive band only available after 8pm.\n\nIt's next to the sea.

Thumbs up\n\nNice spot for a relaxing day! Outdoor or glass window seats are preferable as we can enjoy the greenery scene outside while having a meal. The staff is helpful. The food is not outstanding but not bad at all. Will definitely go back!\n\nHad their seafood pan. I must say the bread they served was amazing. It\u2019s crispy on the outside, soft and moist on the inside, more importantly, the bread was warm when served. A perfect combination to dip into the seafood pan.\n\nVisited before and tried the Lamb and Prawn Rose this time around. The Lamb was super soft but a little bland, while the Prawn Rose was nice.\n\nThere is a playpen for kids at the outdoor tables, hence we weren't able to enjoy much of the nature ambience. However, those with kids would enjoy it.\n\nFood will always be subjective but for us, it's good! Especially the shrimp aglio olio, calamari and the mini burger. Their breakfast is not bad as well, love the sandwich. Their milk shakes are tasty, must try the baileys espresso shake.\n",

Not super special but nice!\n\nIn the middle of Arab street you find this restaurant. We were welcomed\u00a0by a real Turkish guy. Very friendly and he could advise us what was the best to order. We sat outside, along\u00a0the street. Within 15 min the table was full with all kinds of grilled meat. Real Turkish flavors and a nice apple tea were enough to make my day complete. Eating here, and watching the people pass by is a big joy.\n\nParking in this area is very hard, as you can understand.\n\nHad a great dinner here today.

The standout dish for me was the lamb; it had absolutely no odor and tasted fantastic. The grilled items were a highlight as well, bursting with delicious flavors. The restaurant\u2019s ambiance was beautifully decorated, and the staff was both charming and incredibly helpful, taking the time to explain the dishes to us. While it\u2019s not the cheapest option, the prices are fair for the quality you receive.\n\nOne thing to note, though, is that the platter we ordered was described as \u201cfor two,\u201d but for Asians, it\u2019s considered a generous portion. So, if there are four of you and you\u2019ve already ordered other dishes, I recommend going for the platter for two only; it\u2019s quite substantial. Would recommend to anyone looking for a great dining experience!\n\nFirst time having Turkish food and was really\npleasantly surprised. Their dips and bread was really exceptional. The bread was steaming when it came out it was both crispy and fluffy at the same time. The platter for 2 was also great all the grilled meats was tender and flavourful. Portion was also huge.\n\nEverything from the service to food were impeccable. Staff were polite and always made sure we were well taken care of. I ordered before my friend came and they asked when the food should be prepared and how it should be served. Food was perfectly done too. It is the little things that make a difference and win them a return customer.\n\nVery impressive food & service displayed by the dedicated front staffs and chefs. It\u2019s nice walking in the street after a wine & dine session in the area. The staffs were very attentive, price is reasonable.\n\nWent here for a birthday celebration and the attention to detail from their service staff is amazing, didn\u2019t mention to the staff that it was for a birthday celebration, only had a note in the reservation. But they went above and beyond, having candles in the dessert and even giving us props to take pictures with and proceeded to then print out the photo of us to keep!\n\nThe food also matches the service, authentic Turkish cuisine done perfectly, the Hummus was so good we had to order a second portion! I\u2019m not usually a fan of chicken but the chicken that came with the platter blew my mind, so juicy and tender. Then comes dessert, my first time having Kunefe and the only thing I have to say is that I wish I didn\u2019t share it, wanted it all to myself \ud83e\udd23\n\nDefinitely coming back here again!\n",

Thanks to receptionist Mahiti for always giving a great smile to all guest. It definitely makes a difference.\n\nWe celebrated my brother's birthday here and had a great time. The restaurant is beautifully decorated with classic Turkish designs and really put us in the mood for their cuisine.\n\nWe ordered the mixed grilled platter to share and they portioned it for to the seven people in our party. The salads were fresh and the dessert was delicious. I highly recommend their kunfa as it's authentic, made fresh and absolutely scrumptious.\n\nMy only drawback was the warmth. There could have been better distribution of air-conditioning, other than that we had a swell time. I know there are many other restaurants in the area offering a similar experience but Byblos stands apart with class and authenticity.\n\nLOVE the food!!! Hot, freshly baked lavash bread, delectable and well seasoned kebabs, even the salads appealed to my picky 11 year old. Ambience was lovely, only downside was the music is a wee bit loud (I was sitting indoors), but the staff brought down the volume. Our plates were all cleaned out, clearly we enjoyed dinner at Byblos. Highly recommended!\n\nThere are many Turkish food restaurants along Arab Street but this is the best one I've had here. In fact, I daresay it's the best Turkish food I've ever had. The Chef and waiters were all very welcoming!\n",

Nat took the time to show us around the house and it was beautiful.\nWe were led to the roof top during sunset and the view was stunning.\nWe had some snacks at the roof top while they were preparing the dinner.\nAfter sunset, we head down to have dinner.\nStrongly recommend!\nLove ALL the dishes presented.\n\nCelebrated our engagement at Med@59JCT and had such a wonderful and charming experience! Al and Natalie were the best hosts you could ask for, from start to end. They were so generous, kind, and charming as they shared the intentions and origins behind each dish and design choice. I loved hearing about how they chose to emphasise some of the Peranakan and Chinese design elements of the house whilst infusing it with their own identity and culture!\n\nThe house was as beautiful as the food was delicious - we came here for a meal, but left with so much more!\n\nGREAT dining experience at Med@59JCT. We had enjoyed the delicious Mediterranean food prepared by AI. AI explained the food and story about the food. Love it all.\nNot only the delicious Mediterranean food, a good chat with AI make the dining experience even better.\nWill be back again.\n\nHad the best private dining experience with my closest friends at Med@59jct. Al and Nat were the most friendly and welcoming host, Nat brought us on their house tour and explain patiently to our questions.. we were very intrigued by the many interesting displays in their place. Al, is like a master chef! The dishes were amazing one after another, with each dish explained by Al carefully. We were belly full!!!\nSpecial mention to the moroccan spiced carrots and tomato zucchini bake. Al mentioned that food doesn\u2019t have to be complicated\u2026 We can feel all the love that Al and Nat has put in for the private dining experience.. My friends and I enjoyed ourselves throughout the dinner and will definitely be back for more.\nBonus tip, just add on the wine pairing.. You won\u2019t be disappointed! \ud83d\ude09\ud83c\udf77\n\nWent in a group of 4 in early 2023.\nFood - delicious, varied, made with a lot of care and accommodated 2 vegetarians in our group. Portions were very large so go hungry.\nHospitality - Al and Nat were very warm and answered all our questions patiently and in a lot of detail.\nShophouse - really tastefully renovated and love that all the pieces have a story.\n\nHighly recommended and hope to return. Thank you Al and Nat for the lovely dinner.\n",

Authentic Turkish cuisine and we especially love the creamy hummus, chickpea stew and delightful kunefe. Great service as well. Will recommend to visit in a group to try a variety of sides and mains!\n\nEverything is delicious here! Staffs are friendly, the Kunefe is one of the best, and the Karavan kebabs, both beef and lamb, are amazing! \ud83d\ude05 The hot pita bread is also great. In the last 4-5 months, we've visited this place many times, and our friends love it too. Whenever we want to enjoy a meal without worrying about quality and taste, we head straight to this restaurant. \ud83d\ude0b You won't regret giving it a try!\n\nHummus! Good! The lunch set is value for money - comes with a main + drink + soup + bread + dessert all for $20!\nThe pita bread is baked to perfection and the submarine bread looks so amazing! However the price for the submarine bread is a little high. Will probably not order this again the next time.\nThe soup of the day was lentil soup (vegetable soup) its really rich and herby. Very different from what i usually have.\nThe chicken dish is the highlight of the meal. The chicken meat is sooooo soft and tender. The seasoning is on point. Goes really well with the breads. The rice that comes with the dish is really fragrant as well.\nLots of vegetarian options.\nOverall a positive experience and will recommend \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\n\nTotal bill is about $85++\n\nOrdered quite abit for 2 person.  Love the cauliflower salad. Hummus, eggplant dips. As we were celebrating our birthday, the restaurant gave us complimentary tea and a kind of Turkish delight. The staff were attentive and friendly. Will definitely go back for the cauliflower salad and hummus.\n\nThis was my second visit today and my colleagues and I absolutely loved the food! I am usually not a fan of Turkish or Mediterranean food but this place is an exception. After trying the food a few months ago for the first time, I have been wanting to visit them again.\n\nEvery dish was delicious and tasted fresh and   wholesome. The Mezeplate is a good option if you are not sure what to order as it has a bit of everything and you can to try the different dips and appetisers. I enjoyed the hummus, cauliflower salad and eggplant dip very much. Their lentil soup was very good too - comforting and tasty.\n\nFor the mains, we tried two of their lunch set meals -  two rice dishes with the different chicken kebabs which were served with tea, soup and a rice pudding dessert. We also ordered their salmon which was so tender and flavourful. Several colleagues commented that it was the best salmon they had ever tasted!\n\nThe highlight of the meal was their dessert - Kunefe which was absolutely delicious! The taste and texture was so complex and had so much depth! The crispy stringy pastry with the creamy sauce, nuts and ice cream was indeed like what the menu described it to be - \u201ca slice of heaven\u201d!\n\nThis is seriously an underrated restaurant which serves amazing food and I would highly recommend it :)\n",

                  "reviews": "\n\nI came to Singapore few weeks ago and was looking for Mediterranean restaurants. I stumbled upon this gorgeous place 5 minutes away from my hotel. I tried Kebabs on day one and man it was delicious. Atmosphere is great and all servers are friendly, specially three girls Urmi, Wendy and Fina are super nice, they make sure to get you a table quickly, take the order in timely manner and also make valuable suggestions on the menu. They always keep checking if everything is fine and customers are enjoying food. I loved the desert suggestion after eating my dinner. After first day I have been to this place 7-6 times and was always greeted with same service. I highly recommend this restaurant and will go again before I leave Singapore for USA.\n\nWe had the sultan's delight and mussels with garlic cream and cheese toast. The sultan's delight is really enjoyable. We could taste the smokiness from the eggplant puree and the lamb stew is really tender with tomato based sauce. It's tangy and smoky with some crunchiness from the pine nuts. Really enjoyable. But the mussel is pretty standard. It didn't taste really fresh but they're quite generous with the amount. The garlic cheese sauce is ok only.\nService was good and attentive.\n\nVisited for my birthday meal with my family as I was craving some Mediterranean food and this place had great reviews. However, the whole experience ended up kinda disappointing - as I had high expectations too on my first visit.\n\nService:\n- It\u2019s a restaurant but I felt like there was not much service per say.\n- It\u2019s a pretty high price point but they don\u2019t serve complimentary water (charged at $3 a pot of hot water, or $11 for Evian water only)\n- Ordering isn\u2019t as fuss free as they try to make it. Online ordering only from mobile app, with just one physical menu at the door. Asked for any extra copies for easier viewing but none available. You also have to pay upfront in mobile order.\n- Feels like I visited a restaurant but received fast food style service.\n\nAtmosphere:\n- Overall atmosphere is okay. Like a typical restaurant\n\nFood:\n- Average, I\u2019ve had much better at other places for a similar price point.\n- Pita bread, spreads and kebab grills were okay.\n- Saffron rice & Briyani rice were disappointing. They use basmati rice which gave a nice texture. However, flavour is so subtle that I could barely taste the difference between the 2.\n\nSummary:\nWould I return? Definitely not! For the price point, the food and service didn\u2019t live up to expectations for a highly rated restaurant. Will continue on my hunt for yummy Mediterranean food!\n\nVisited on a Thu night, it's superb crowded and busy in the restaurant. 3 dishes for 2 people, very filling. Overall the food is pretty decent and the price point is on the higher side.\n\nExcellent experience with vibrant dining experience. Food has great range of taste to excite the palate. Service is welcoming and top notch, they also gave a complimentary cake.\n",

The sauce was watery, diluted. But the \"cardboard like\" salmon is just unforgivable... first and probably last time ever gonna try this again.\nNot worth it at all for $11.90.\nWould also like to highlight that I had this for dinner afew blocks away from the outlet. (10mins Walking distance). So you can rule out this as a reason.\nCheck out the video to see the toughness of the salmon.\nNo one should suffer this. Really.\n\nIt was a terrible experience. The chicken was all black and burnt and he told me I do not know what is kebab. I've bought it many times before and it's never been this charred. And the shop assistant was very rude and discriminated against women, and scolded me very loudly. Pointing his finger at me the whole time and telling me not to talk to me because I'm a woman.Very angry, very angry\uff01\uff01\uff01\uff01as a consumer to be pointed at by a man is very angry. And no apology at all\uff01\uff01\uff01\uff01\n\nFood was a bit pricey compared to stuff d. Options were not as many as well.

Quite a variety of choices although food could do better if kept warm.\n\nPersonally I feel the meat griller shld be placed at front of shop instead of the back. The smell and sight wld definately bring in more crowds. Almost missed the stall if i was not purposely looking for a halal stall.\n\nPrice is abit high but understandably since its lamb.\n\nNothing was warm. Food was alright. Service was great.

Grand Konak team is even so nice to accommodate our request as it\u2019s their staff party too. They made sure that the food we are gonna have will be warm by the start of our party. I highly recommend Grand Konak for parties and gatherings, everything is just so delicious plus the service is really fantastic! We will for sure have them again for our next event \u2764\ufe0f\n\nNice Ambiance and Authentic Turkish and Mediterranean Cuisine.\nWe had mezza platter, Lavash and kunafee all were amazing\n",

Quite a chill place to have a few drinks and some skewers with friends. Very long walk from the nearest LRT station though. Better to drive or cycle there.\n\nStaff was friendly and helpful, food was good, the grilled oyster is no more which was very good, but the current fresh oyster is also very big, juicy and fresh. The grilled lamb and pork was superb. Very nice to be back again.\n\nThe food and ambience is great, I had a late night snack that became a whole meal instead but well worth the calories. (You can always walk it off later at the park nearby.)\nFood was well seasoned and grilled, particularly enjoyed the squid and fried rice.\nThey offer a wide range of alcohol as well and offered to extend our menu from the shop next door which was selling Thai food.\nOverall a great experience and would recommend to visit if you are in the area to support their family business :)\n\nVibe and feel is great. Staff are really friendly and food is generally good. Loved the garlic rice especially, didn't manage to take a pic as it was the first to serve and I gobbled it up in no time. Beer is cheap IMO - $26 for a jug, skewers' price is on the high side though. Nice place to chill nonetheless.\n\nGreat place to chill! Service is great. Food is alright. Pets are allowed\n",

The food worth 2 stars. The meat was pretty hard, the starter was too sour. The dessert was really not able to match our taste. The house wines was tasteless, but the red wine taste better when it pair with the meat. I will strongly recommend you only order the red if you want to have their one for one house wine promo.\nOur bill was $128, you can get a much more better grilled meat platter and better food at other restaurants. :)\n\nLe Rida has a rustic ambience somewhat akin to an old time eating house in a small town. Quaint and homely\nFreshly baked pita bread with lemon chick pea hummus was delicious and filling\nMains of Lebanese lamb kafta kebab had the right balance of flavour and crunchiness.\nWash it all down with 1 for 1 Heineken draft at $17.90\n\nManager Sanjiv was both friendly and helpful in his recommendations and unlike in some establishments, he did not push you to over order.\nDefinitely worth a return visit!\n\nA quaint no frills dining place with excellent food and good service. The staff are simple people but are very hospitable, often checking in on the food quality and our experience. If you are looking for a good meal away from hustle and bustle, this is the place to go. Oh.. U can definitely have a conversation with your company and hear them loud and clear\n\nDidn't think the food was thaaaat amazing. Nor was the service. But at least they let us drink outside drinks.\nHOWEVER, i requested for no garnishing on my hummus. When the guy brought it over, there WAS parsley on it. And all he said was \"just pluck it out\". --.--\nSo if i was allergic to that, i should just pluck it out.... nice. The hummus wasn't good either. I've tasted better. Like a friend who went with me commented... it isn't creamy enough. Also, comments about the baklava was that it was too hard... and wasn't good.\n\nAbsolutely loved the food, I am heavily into Mediterranean food. I have tried most of the places around Bugis as well. The food here was so fresh, with perfect taste and presentation. It was completely worth it travelling from East.\nThe service was quick, the portion size was generous . We ordered mezze plateer and tabalu salad. They were scrumptious loved the customised heart shaped Pita bread. Hummus, was so creamy and so were all other dips.\n\nWould strongly recommend.. It has become one of my favourite place..\n",

Promotion pricing for meals was quite affordable.  $30 for 3 course, $40 for 4.  Definitely worth the price. Wine was also not marked up too high.  Food was good.  Shoes required.\n\nA cosy place for family and small group of friends to gather. The service staff all did a great job from welcome to preparing and serving the food. An old English setting but filled with warmth. The food is all great and will definitely be back again next month.\n\nMy family regularly dines here for special occasions as we're members of SGCC. We're never disappointed with the food or the service. Do look out for monthly promotions as they'll focus on different cuisines, and they normally have a weekend semi-buffet (choose a main, while the appetizers and desserts are buffet).\n\nAmazing steak! Cooked medium rare :)\n\nHave been coming here with my parents since I was a kid, and it's always been good. The food is great and the service is always top notch.\n",

Siew Maii was quite good but personally don\u2019t like the mushroom flavour.  Braised chicken feet was abit too sweet for me but overall was good.  Bo Lu Bao char Siew filling was really good, but the bun dough have a very good yeast smell.\n\nWe love Chinese cuisine, we avoid eating at high end Chinese restaurants, we prefer hardworking independent chefs who have small eateries with authenticity in their cooking, this place is the cherry on top. As usual we ordered dishes we are familiar with, their dim-sum selections for dinner is a mini menu so we choose 2 , and 3 main dishes, quite enough for us as we are small bites people, more on quality of the food than quantity, I must admit Chef Wong have skills. And we will be back soon for lunch. Service was great too, happy we came !\n\nI can vouch that it\u2019s the best and most underrated dim sum in Singapore - in terms of its taste and presentation \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\n\nIf you\u2019re skeptical like us to think that the signatures beautiful dim sum are probably just gimmicky, think again! so glad we tried them, they are so delicious \ud83e\udd24 \u828b\u89d2 skin was so flaky yet not oily, taste of yam filling is so well balanced and not overly sweet like the average ones. \u867e\u997a skin is very delightful and thin. Everything is done to their perfection *chef kiss*\n\nHighly recommend and would definitely visit again!\n\nP/s: Room for improvement- we can smell waft of cigarettes \ud83d\udeac coming from the outside as we\u2019re seated near the entrance.\n\nThis is the best dim sum place in the area. Food is affordable and so much better than many other dim sum places in the same price range. I really enjoyed everything that we ordered. Service is also very good. Will definitely be back again, and also try more dishes! Highly recommended! Safer to make a reservation as it can be crowded at certain times and the place is quite small.\n\nThis is one of the must go restaurant for Dim Sum and Chinese dishes \ud83d\udc4d All their handmade dim sum are delicious and tasty.  The ambiance and services are good too.  Will go back for more!\n",

We reserved well in advance as this place requires reservation during the peak hours.\nOrdered Grilled Tilapia in spicy fragrant sauce and few veggies like potato, lettuce, tofu. The flavours were amazing and fish tasted really fresh and there was no fishy smell as you usually feel while eating any seafood. We got a plate of home made buns and rice to go along with it. Cooled ourselves with cucumber salad. For drink we got sour plum four seasons tea and local craft beer. Everything we ate or drank were worth it.\nStaff was friendly and accomodated our request of getting rice later and also getting some of those buns take away. Definitely will visit again, Cheers :)\n\nGot the mushroom seabass, medium spicy and added Chinese cabbage. Portioning is quite little, can only find a few pieces of veg and that's about it.\n\nService was also slow. Our noodles was not served as we were almost finishing our food. We checked twice with one stuff who told us that he will check for us. Then we checked a third time with another staff and staff told us they forgot our noodles. She asked if we would like to cancel this item since we are almost finishing our food. We said ok. Our noodles came shortly.\n\nSeasoning and food is quite nice and flavourful.\n\nWe brought our friends to experience mala cusine and were told that the Classic set meal for 4 pax offers whole seabass so we accepted their recommendation. The medium seabass was slightly small in our perspective because we were expecting a larger fish since fish is the main item in this set. Each one of us got a little portion and it tasted fishy and unfresh, we didnt enjoy the fish at all. Nonetheless, we thought the presentation of this dish was beautiful and the side dishes in the fish tasted yummy. We were wowed by all other side dishes like Spinach, Lala, Sweet&Sour Pork, Watering Chicken, etc.  We feedbacked to the Server on our experience and glad that they will inform their kitchen. In general, their service level is friendly and helpful.  It is the fish dish that ruined the overall eating experience.\n\nSaturday lunch at 12pm, only customer in the restaurant for a while. We ordered the set with the grilled fish and several side dishes. Fish was fragrant and flavorful, but the portion was a little small for 4 pax. Generally on the saltier side as expected of Chinese cuisine. We had a good lunch together.\n\nExcellent food and customer service. My food was in a mess when the grab driver delivered to me and was irresponsible to reply or answer my call. When I call in the restaurant to ask for a solution, immediately after seeing the photos that I send them. Without second they arrange to send me those damage food to be replace and resolved my issue. Would like to thanks chong Qing grilled fish serangoon for your fast reply and your efficiency. Especially to Jia Zhe for your help.\n",

The food did not disappoint and everything was really delicious ans savoury. The chef and waiters service was friendly and attentive. And there was also a free flow of cabbage for us as well.\nOverall a five star recommendation for this place so do come and try!\n\nService is great.\nPlace remains same for a Monday before 6pm .\n\nMiso ramen is still well flavoured and appetising. Helps chase away Monday blues.\nPrices have increased for adding noodles so I opt for a add on of rice instead.\n\nCheers.\n\nWe were very happy with the taste of our food and the service level provided! Big eaters like me rejoice with free flow rice and cabbage!\n\nFamily\u2019s go to dinner place for tonkatsu sets. Love that the rice and cabbage is free flow!\n\nThe tonkatsu is well breaded and fried. Not greasy and still juicy.\n\nRice is properly cooked, always nicely done. Loving the soup that comes as a side with the meal itself. Cabbage is shredded nice and thin, and the dressing is tart and delicious!\n\nOverall a really good experience!\n\nIf you are keen on noodles, the ramen is pretty good as well. Extra serves of noodle and soup can be purchased to top up the meal itself.\n\nOverall, really yummy! Get there early for a table!\n\nOne of my favourite Oyakodons(and store, too!) in Singapore, while I often visit for their Katsus, if I ever crave Oyakodons I often find myself back here. Affordable Authentic Japanese Comfort Food.\n\nThe Oyakodon has half-cooked eggs which lends an extremely smooth texture to the dish. The Mirin is rich but not overbearing. Chicken chunks are tender, eaten with rice, it\u2019s truly something I come back to again and again.\n\nThat said, most dishes here are tasty, so if it\u2019s not your bowl of rice, you can\u2019t really go wrong with the Miso Katsu either(not pictured).\n",

Love their service where they given a piece of cake for my husband\u2019s birthday and sang him a birthday song! So warm! The cake was nice too and I think Ram had choose wisely.. Will definitely go back! Thanks Ram & Shafeeq for your great service!\n\nAnother good option at serangoon garden village. Liked the outdoor seating (if it is not too warm). Food is decent. It has a little farm's market next to it if you need to grab some groceries. Quite popular on a weekday afternoon. Most of the outdoor seating were filled. Good place to explore.\n\nVery nice and cosy environment. Feels like we are in Austrialia already. The food was good, awesome crews service and the seating area outside the restaurant good too.\nOrdered the Croque Monsieur $22, Aussie $28 and cappuccino.\n\nReally like the ambience here. Cool, windy night, nice music and good service. Fried chicken thigh meat is really nice. The grilled cauliflower was huge. The mushroom pasta is good. Carrot cake is normal.\n",

A wonderful culinary experience that captures the essence of our local food and gave me a different perspective of what the dishes could be. A lot of attention was given to the details of each dish and you can tell a lot of \u201cheart\u201d was put into it.\n\nReally appreciated the energy and sincerity of the chefs too. The sake pairing was amazing.\n\nMenu changes every two months, will definitely be back to try their new menu!!\n\nA delightful culinary experience. Local Omakase with a touch of Japanese. I loved the tsukune with black chicken garlic soup, squid rojak and crab chawanmushi. The dessert was outstanding - banana fritters with home made macadamia ice cream. The restaurant is in a small shophouse in Serangoon Gardens and only seats 14. Reservations open on the first of every alternate month. The next window is 1 Feb for March and April 2023. Set your alarms. You won\u2019t regret it.\n\nI\u2019ve had the privilege of dining here a couple of times including once this month. It\u2019s pretty difficult to get reservations if your fingers aren\u2019t nimble enough. Out of the few times they were, every meal was a memorable hit.\n\nTheir cuisine borrows influences from Singapore, Malaysia and sometimes Japan and I can\u2019t really find another place serving anything similar which makes this place really special. Every bite is an explosion of flavours, yet delicate enough to not de-sensitise the palate. I would always come back if ever presented the opportunity.\n\nManaged to snag a reservation at this hard to book restaurant. It can sit around 15 for each dinner service and there is only 1 service per day, hence the difficulty in getting a reservation.\n\nI was very impressed by the standard of the food here. It is one of my top 5 meals in 2022 at this price point. Each dish was unique and leaves you anticipating for the next dish.\n\nDo note that payment is only via cash or paynow. If you do get a chance to dine here, please cherish the opportunity.\n\nBeen fortunate enough to eat here several times, and I will definitely keep coming back. I would give Mustard Seed 11 stars out of 5 if I could - from the first meal at Chef Ming's home private dining a few years ago, every meal has been exceptional. I'm constantly astounded by not only the constantly creative dishes that Ming and Shin churn out, but also by their execution. Seems impossible for every dish to be delicious, but they have really been.\n\nService is impeccable and warm, like eating at a friend's place (if your friend is insanely talented). For me, hands down best restaurant in Singapore.\n",

I really liked the soup and it came with good serving of veggies too. The portion seems smaller as I had ask for lesser, the normal portion is pretty good\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\n\nNot bad. Noodle portion quite okay, not much liao. Soup is sweet tasting and I believe they use mani Cai. Ikan bills is crispy, chilli is special (green chilli, with a sour note)\n\nIf you love \"QQ\" kind of noodles, this might be the place for you. Whenever I come to Serangoon Gardens, I somehow gravitate towards this stall if the queue isn't too long. My friend tried this but he didn't like it, so pretty subjective here.\n\nBossi banmian is SUPERB. Extremely flavourful and unlike any other banmian out there. I\u2019ll get to the flavours but first the noodles are cooked on point - if you like al dante / QQ noodles, bossi is for you. We had both the banmian and u-Mian. Guess what the u Mian was chewy too! Normally stalls will screw up the umian cause of how thin it is. Next their soup is truly one-of-a-kind, it\u2019s sweet, it\u2019s salty and super comforting. I think they added preserved veggie in the soup and it elevates the whole dish. We finished the soup... lastly their chilli is unique too! Reminds me of the Indonesian sambal ijo with an added spicy kick. And it\u2019s really different from all the sour orange chilli usual banmian stalls use. A must try! DONT be fooled by their weird sign board.\n\nSoup was excellent, chilli was unique and appetising, noodles and ingredients were on point and fresh. Love this ban mian!\n",

Well it certainly serves the immediate needs of the residents in the neighbourhood.\n\nThe anchor tenant here is Fairprice Finest and rightfully so considering the upmarket neighbourhood.\n\nA couple of restaurants like iSteaks adorn the mall.\n\nIs the mall worth a visit ? I would not make my way here if only to visit this mall. Like i said earlier it serves the immediate needs of the neighbourhood and it is a nice mall.\n\nA very peaceful shopping mall that is clean and lovely. Please maintain this way forever.\n\nNice smell and peaceful.\n\nBest shopping mall in Singapore.\n\nMy Village is a small boutique kind of mall in Serangoon Gardens. There is a FairPrice Finest, gifting shops, apparel boutiques and nail salons. There is food court with decent options as well.\n\nIt\u2019s situated on Maju Ave opposite Tiong Bahru Bakery. I like to go here for casual shopping when I\u2019m around this area.\n",

Kong Ba Bao looks good but the meat is about tough to chew and also prefer more five spice flavour. Fish maw and noodles are average.\n\nVisited on 24 Sep 2023 for birthday meal. Ordered 10 dishes.. food generally good like the claypot tofu, fried oyster came instead of oyster omelette.. fried horfun with cai po, and lor duck.. but the rest not so tasty and was told its not teochew enough, though I am Cantonese.. Still the service is not too good when it's busy. Asked waiter 3 times to order food, but nobody entertained us.. the food here is pricey.. our bill comes to $218.60 for 9 pax..\n\nThis is my first time here, and I came because my Teochew cousin invited me. Personally, I feel that the food doesn't quite taste like traditional Teochew dishes, such as Or Nee. Most of the dishes seemed tailored to suit the customers preferences. They were also quite salty, and we provided this feedback.\n\n(P.S. I\u2019m Teochew grew up eating traditional Teochew dishes)\n\nFood is good but generally expensive. Situated in a old shopping centre with narrow car park.  Timing of food served can be inconsistent. Some dishes were served very late\n\n1st time trying. We ordered 6 items + 1 dessert, and total cost $300. Good is generally good, with outdoor (aircon) seating inside the mall. Easily accessible and parking is available just below the building. The Teo Chew fried Hor fun is very tasty and have Wok Hei. The fish soup cost about $100, and fresh fish and can top up the soup. Overall is good and recommended.\n",

My partner and I ordered scallion chicken rice, veg, pork floss egg roll with cheese, milk tea, honey butter toast.\n\nI don\u2019t usually eat rice bowls but I thoroughly enjoyed the scallion chicken rice which was flavourful and fragrant! Would definitely recommend this dish.\n\nLoved the hot milk tea at 50% sweetness too. I don\u2019t really eat pearls but this one was nice!\n\nWould have preferred the egg roll to be more cheesy with the usual crispy kind as it turned out to be more of a soft chewy dough - still rather interesting and some may like that.\n\nHoney butter toast was a nice dessert to end our meal!\n\nHad a nice dinner at this Taiwanese restaurant. The staff is really friendly and the cafe itself is cosy. Loved their scallion oil chicken rice. It was very flavourful. We ordered 2 mains, 2 side dishes along with their signature pearl milk tea. The price is reasonable and definitely worth the visit.\n\nOur favorite to go when we craving for Taiwanese food. The Pork Belly Rice is a mix of fatty and lean braised pork, pickled veggies, all on fluffy white pearl rice. \ud83e\udd24 The Scallion Oil Chicken Rice has this killer fragrant sauce and perfectly shredded chicken. Worth the try\n\nService was impeccable and food was served promptly. Their chilli is really good. Mixed it with the \u5364\u8089\u996d&\u5927\u80a0\u9762\u7ebfand it gave both dishes more flavour.\n\nMilk tea is really fragrant, I had ordered 0% sugar.\n\nAiyu Bing was nice, but could have been colder and it would be even better. Portion is huge. Worth it.\n\nHad a great dinner at 8degrees with my family, we really enjoyed the signature pork belly rice as well as the other dishes! The prices are affordable and it\u2019s a hidden gem in Kovan. Definitely worth a visit if you enjoy authentic Taiwanese cuisine. Highly recommend the milk tea with pearl \ud83d\udc4d and scallion pancakes!\n",

Nevertheless, we tried four items in small portion - roasted duck, prawn vermicelli, sliced fish and tofu, and the bill came up to about $105. After our meal, we all came to the same conclusion. The roasted duck was the best being crispy on the skin and tender and fragrant for the meat. Sadly, we didn't enjoy the other three items at all.\n\nThe dishes were served promptly and it was delicious! Service staff was also friendly and attentive. Price is also reasonable. \ud83d\udc4d\n\nWe enjoyed the food! Thumbs up especially for Curry fish head and frog leg. Service is swift too!\n\nDim sum were piping hot when served n prawns were fresh n crunchy. Many mains to choose from. Love the garlic n black pepper prawns. Service a bit slow though the staff were trying their best to serve the packed restaurant. Guess they are short handed. Worthwhile when they have promotions such as 40% off dim sum n 15% off mains.\n",

                  "reviews": "\n\nI came here with my family on a Saturday afternoon around 3pm and it was not crowded.\n\nA small vegetarian cafe located in the Serangoon heartlands, it serves mainly local and fusion Japanese food.\n\nWe ordered the Hotplate Unagi Rice, Chicken Rice as well as the Hokkien Noodles.\n\nOverall the prices are affordable and reasonable. Well worth the visit!\n\nI ordered a Sweet and Sour Pork Chop King Rice and a Teppanyaki Chicken Cutlet Rice. Both meals included an egg and a bowl of miso soup. Even though my husband is not a vegetarian, he found them delicious. The flavors were just right, not too salty or greasy. The environment was clean, and the owner was very friendly. The food was made to order. Highly recommended.\n\nLocated within the heartlands and at a hdb block, it was probably our most surprising discovery. Tried the vegetarian chicken rice and salted egg chicken rice. The chicken was fine but the chicken rice was delicious and surpassed some regular chicken rice stalls outside and the chili sauce was a nice complement. The salted egg sauce was full of flavour too and i finished up my plate of rice in a flash \ud83d\ude02 Will return again \ud83d\ude42\n\nI came on Sunday and reach the place minutes before 6pm. Waited for food for more than an hour. Counter staff very blur and couldn't cope with the orders. Staff bring my order to every table who arrive later than me. She was going to serve the dish to someone who ordered the same dish and arrived later than me. Restaurant also does not issue receipt so if there is anything wrong with your order, she will be in denial.  Even though she apologise for the delay but it is not sincere.\n\nFood is fine but definitely not worth the wait. First time visiting and also my last. \ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffb\n\nEnvironment was quiet and homely.\n\nThey had air cooler installed and lots of fan around which made the place very cooling and comfortable. Fans were not too much to blow your hair all over the place either.\nFood prices were mostly reasonable to the taste and portion\nOrdered 2 main dish to try, the hot plate cod fish rice which was dissapointing as it costs $7.90 but only with 1 serving of fish and normal rice portion that would barely be sufficient for a average grown adult. 2 slice would be more acceptable for the price. Taste would be a 6 to 7/10, sauce of the hot place cod fish goes nice with the rice but again not a filling meal and too small portion for the price.\n\nOn the other hand, the chicken cullet rice was a 8 to 9/10. Rice was the legit chicken rice kind of rice instead of plain rice. Did not expect that until I took a bite. The chicken cullet was fried nicely, not oily or greasy, and came with a very touch of sauce on top of it. Sides of broccoli was cooked nicely, tasted fresh  and came with a decent portion of fries at the side.\nIt did not come with chicken rice Chilli but I checked and you can ask for Chilli to go with the rice if you're a Chilli lover.\nDrink price was reasonable and portion was acceptable. Drinks like tea, red date teas were available.\n\nParking was decent and easy to find a slot.\nWent on a Saturday dinner and wasn't over crowded  food was served within 10 to 12 mins which was ok waiting time for us.\nLady wearing glasses at the shop was really nice and friendly .\nOrdered some take away before leaving as well for the family.\n\nOverall feels like a very healthy meal.\nWould rate overall as 6 - 7 /10\n",

The sauce was one of the better parts of the dish, and the new edition just barely gave any sauce in it. I would rather pay more and have it still be as delicious and have the same portion as to have it be reduced and taste worse.\n\nBut on the bright side, maybe it's finally time to try other food options they have.\n\nOrdered their vegetarian nasi lemak. Huge serving of rice that is very fragrant. Generous serving of ingredients too.\n$4.00 only.\nVery friendly owners and helpers.\n\nMee rebus must try. Shiok. A lot of ingredients. The queue gets crazy during lunch.\n\nVisited a little after 5pm today.  There were around 5 staff at the stall.  Some of the staff seemed a little confused with orders through food delivery platforms.  I waited almost 30min for my food.  I paid $7 for luohan toufu hotplate but was given something which looked like baoluo wanxiang that costs $6.  Upon my enquiry, 2 of the staff still insisted that it's what I had ordered.  The dish didn't even contain a single piece of toufu.\n\nOrdered Xiao wan mian and ba kut teh.\n\nXiao wan mian soup were tasteless, just salty.\nIt is mostly veg which were good because I don't like mock meat. The noodles were good though!\n\nBa kut teh soup taste better than the other one.\nBoth rice and noodles portion were too much!\nPlease ask for less if you don't eat a lot.\n\nThey have a wide range of menu though, would try it again if I'm around the vicinity.\n",

Best chocolate fondant I ever had (but wish there was a scoop of vanilla ice cream).\n\nI've to caveat this by saying that perhaps Argentinian food isn't for me. So please view this review with a (huge) pinch of salt, especially in view of the other glowing reviews here.\n\nTo me, the food just doesn't hit the spot. I'm left feeling confused - and cold inside. Ordered the Chapa for appetiser - it tastes like normal bread with cheese fondue - nothing to comment about. For my mains, I ordered the grilled zucchini stuffed with risotto - and it's fairly disappointing. It was served with white sauce that has a subtle milky flavour but no risotto to be found. It may be hidden. I stopped eating after the first piece because there's nothing exciting about the dish. I was left stagnant and not looking forward to my next bite. We also ordered the vegetable platter - the vegetables tastes raw and bland, and the potatoes taste a bit coarse inside.\n\nOverall, I don't find the food value for the money. It didn't even attempt to take flight. Apologetically, I've to say that it was a fairly sad dinner for me and my company.\n\nThough the staff was very friendly and attentive. I've to credit that.\n\nSince I am a vege lover, I selected this restaurant because I saw good options of vegetables dishes in their menu. My first time tried Argentinian grilled food and we love so much of their potato rescoldo in grilled vegetables platter. Grilled potatoes are crispy outside and soft inside, saltiness is just nice. I love the smoked asparagus with fried garlic too. Steak is ok and lamb is good too. My hubby likes the Empanadas. Dessert - Dulce De Leche Cookies, Love it!!. I should have ordered more cos the size is a bit small. Service is great, attentive and know customer needs without a need to ask. View is great. Can see the fireworks at Marina bay for NDP rehearsal.\n\nFood was really delectable and I would return for a second round! Loved the black cod. Beef was really flavourful and savoury. Their dessert chocolate hazelnut cake was one of my favourites! Wished the table service could be better in terms of knowledge of their menu. Overall a pleasant experience in a warm and welcoming environment.\n\nBeef was really flavourful and savory. A little overcook for me on medium. Their dessert chocolate cake was very good.\n\nPrime location at Ion and your can reach Fire by dedicated elevator from 4th to 55th fl.\n",

Thirdly i ordered chicken chop but fish and chips packed to me. Conclusion, dont ever try to take away for western food. They are more interested to fulfil grab order then walk in.\nMookata is ok but not the western food or zi char.\n\nHad the hot plate tofu, unfortunately the taste was just 1 layer which is savoury!\n\nTried out the Halal Mookata. Service is satisfactory. Item served quite fast. Price is reasonably cheap with about 6 items costing us $25. What lacked is the variety of food items available.\n\nNote: I can't comment on Buey Tahan See-Food x Halal Mookata as I didn't patronise this stall for its food or service. This review is for the coffeeshop experience.\n\n1st time visit this so-called 7 stars signboard coffee shop but the experience was an awful one. The drink stall uncle wearing spec was sitting biting his thumb on his lips. Then we ordered homemade herbal tea as indicated in the posted menu. He said don't have and stared at me with face \"very long and black\". See how rude that was. I told him if off the menu already should take down that menu poster. After taking the drinks to our table, he keep staring at us for few mins with the same expression. I came all the way from Bedok to this sengkang coffeeshop only to get badly treated. This coffeeshop should change their name to 1 star coffeeshop instead. The service rating here is for the drink stall. My experience here was really \"buey tahan\" See-Uncle.\n\nWe tried the japanese food stall, the food portion is good for its price. The tray quite heavy to carry when ordered for 3 pax. The outer area of this coffeeshop is quite spacious with natural ventilation and high ceiling.\n\nmy 9yo son loves the Brown sauce chicken chop + baked bean + coleslaw. the chicken and mushroom sauce was bubbling when served. Do take note that the western food takes sometime to be served.\n",

Especially love the tenderloin, it\u2019s so tender and yummy. Also love the bread we had, it\u2019s well worth the price of $16.\n\nFantastic steak & food & service! You\u2019d probably also be able to get a decent steak here for \n\nIt was our first time visiting Bochinche. The restaurant has a lovely ambiance and the staff are polite and helpful. The manager kindly explained to us the differences between each cut of meat.\n\nFor starters, we had the SD bread basket and ox tongue carpaccio. The bread slices were delish with butter. The ox tongue carpaccio was an interesting blend of flavours that worked well together.\n\nFor the main, we ordered the Heavenly Meat Board with 4 different kinds of steaks. They were perfectly cooked medium rare, served with a bit of smoked salt, garlic confit and padron peppers, which elevated the flavour immensely. Sides were chips, broccolini and wild mushrooms. Kiddo had the cheeseburger and finished the entire thing off!\n\nTo finish off, we shared the nectarine tart and espresso creme brulee while kiddo had a scoop of vanilla ice-cream. The creme brulee was delicious. Creamy with the wonderful fragrance of espresso. We enjoyed that immensely. Were not too crazy about the tart though. The nectarine slices were not ripe and still hard after cooking. The sharp tang wasn't to our liking.\n\nAll in all a wonderful dining experience. We'll be back for more!\n\nGreat place with great food.\n\nThe staff were amazing as I celebrated my wife\u2019s birthday. The steak was beautifully done and all the food recommendations were good.\n\nKudos to the people for making this place awesome.\n\nEdit -\n\nForgot to mention that we also ordered the hand cut beef empanadas. Sad to say my nenek can make better epok epok.\n\nOrdered the \u201cRobbins Island\u201d Wagyu Bone In Striploin (MS7) along with the creamy Mac-cheese pangrattato, broccolini pomegranate (without bacon bits) and Chips Provencal.\n\nThe wagyu striploin was cooked well but lacked the juiciness that wagyu steaks typically have. The steak was also under seasoned but was accompanied by smoked Maldon sea salt and roasted peppers.\n\nChips was fried well and had a nice crisp bite to it and was salted just right.\n\nBroccolini was grilled perfectly and had a nice charred smoky taste to it but was overly salted. Portion was a tad too stingy in my opinion for the price. Served on a medium sized plate it looked like a few broccolini might\u2019ve escaped during plating.\n\nSurprisingly the creamy M&C was the best of the lot! Very creamy with gooey cheese and a nice layer of bread crumbs on top to give it a welcoming different mouth feel and texture.\n\nOver all I think Bochinche is worth a visit due to its lovely homey interior but do be prepared to spend a few dollars here. 3.6/5.\n",

They were all well-spiced and flavorful. The prices were also very reasonable for the quality and quantity of the food. The only downside was the customer service, which was not very attentive or friendly. However, I did not mind it too much, as the food was so good. I would definitely visit this restaurant again and suggest it to anyone who likes fish heady curry and prata type food.\n\nPlain prata is recooked it is hard as rock. First time having tissue prata without any sugar coating inside. Asked the staff abt it, he pass me a bottle of sugar. The standard has dropped tremendously. During payment the staff/ owner just talking on the phone without interaction with the customer/ telling how much and all.\n\nGreat mutton briyani! Meat is tender, non gamey at all! Paired with it's flavourful briyani and thick curry, each mouthful is a match in heaven!\nPortion is huge@$9.50, would come back to try other dishes.\n\nFood coma kicking in while writing this review\ud83d\ude05\n\nthe Worst cheese prata i ever taste. The cheese taste like plastic.and the Masala thosai too much cinnamon stick till i ate like afew and throw back.\n\nPretty disappointed with the food here. No longer serving yummy food. Many places serve better Prata than here, plus the food is not hot! You can give the Nasi Lemak a miss too! Served Cold and rice has no coconut taste and fragrance.\n",

                  "reviews": "\n\nThis is probably my favourite Indian restaurant. Food is excellent and everything is mostly very good.\nWe've tried many dishes and most would not disappoint except for the squid. The biryanis and pratas are of huge portions and the sides are generous and tasty.\nSome signature items tend to sell out early on weekends so you may wish to go early or try them on weekdays instead.\nThe staff are friendly too and they also give good recommendations and advice. The seating arrangement may not be the best but it still offers relatively comfortable seating and acceptable views.\nThere are vegetarian choices too so those with vegetarian members amongst friends or family can eat happily together.\nWe will certainly continue to visit. Car parking is of no issue as it is within the neighbourhood shopping mall.\n\nFantastic dining experience at Banana Leaf Rivervale mall! Prem, the manager, was gracious enough to set up a table for 10 people for us! The food tasted fantastic! Very good customer service! Prem checks to see if everyone at the table is satisfied by asking if we need anything or if there is enough food. He goes above and above in his service! He will always beam while he serves us, without fail! Definitely returning here! \u2665\ufe0f\n\nTasty food & great service! Serving was generous and definitely filling for sure\n\nKudos to Premnath who helped us changed our vegetable dish that was way too spicy for us.\n\nWill be back for more!\n\nI had a rather heavy day at work, and whenever this happens, I love to imbibe in one of my favourite foods, Indian.\nThere\u2019s something about the spice, the smell and the flavours that give me that \u2018kick\u2019 I need to continue with my workday!\nSo I drove to the Mall and walked into this place. I always (well, almost always) have my Garlic, butter naans with mutton keema. Minced mutton cooked with a spicy thick broth, with peas to pop, and something magical happens with I top my naans with this dish.\nAlas! They don\u2019t make keema here, but the nice gentleman who attended to me offered me an alternative. Keema naan!\nI thought about it awhile, and reluctantly said yes!\n\nCertainly a great recommendation from him! What I had was a paper-thin, buttery, garlicky, naan, sprinkled with seasoned minced mutton on the insides. It\u2019s amazing how they do this! The whole concoction still looks like it\u2019s half the thickness of an average plain prata! Don\u2019t be fooled ok? Bite into it, and all that buttery, garlicky goodness pops in your mouth, and the insides render flavours reminiscent of a mutton murtabak, but only ever so slight, and not as overwhelming. What can I say? It was a delight to eat! I savoured every bite, as I downed this delectable dish with an equally spicy but delicious rasam soup and some fish curry for a sip.\nThe naan was so good, that after a few bites, I realise the fish curry had become redundant, and remained untouched until I finished all of my Keema Naan!\n\nGreat service, good food, and I love the quiescence of this place amidst a crowded noisy mall! I\u2019m happy, and will surely be back:)\n\nOne of the best fish head curry ever in Singapore.  Fish head was meaty and FRESH..curry is superbly tasty and tangy.A MUST TRY!!  Masala chicken is fantasic , a good portion meat , soft and juicy. Staff Gulshan from Rivervale Mall is commendable..attentive and polite . Will definitely  come again and recommend  to all my friends! Hats off to the chef!!\n",

The restaurant service was not up to the mark as the server was inexperienced and didn't seem to know what to do. The service was slow, and it took us more than half an hour to get our food served, even though we arrived early.\n\nThe black pepper crab, which was supposed to be the restaurant's signature dish, was overcooked and not very fresh. The taste was average, and it didn't live up to its hype. The best dish we ordered was the vegetable dish, which was delicious.\n\nThe fish maw soup disappointed us, and the prawns were not very fresh. It was the least worth ordering.\n\nThe restaurant had an upmarket and elegant setup, but the food quality and service standards didn't match up. It could be a concern for those who are short on time due to the slow service.\n\nOn the bright side, the restaurant had a clean toilet, which was a good experience. Overall, the restaurant wasn't a great dining experience, but it was worth it if you're in the mood for good veggies or a clean restroom\n\nSimple dinner, just ordered steamboat Ang Go Li and chrysanthemum tea. The food was delicious and fragrant. My husband doesn\u2019t like fish but he was enjoying. Just nice for 2.\n\nThe Mala grilled fish is our must-order dish every time we visit. The portion is enough for 2-3 pax. It's the best-grilled fish I have in Singapore. It comes together with some potato thin slices, black fungus, peanuts, and cabbage. The fish is fresh, so the meat is very tender! Please try it out, everyone!\n\nWe ordered the \u56de\u9505\u8089, but it is a bit oily for us.\n\nWe have come back to visit serial times. The food quality maintains good, and the service is excellent!\n\nNice little \u716e\u7092, air-conditioned, neat and clean. We had deep fried squid, tofu and broccoli. The prices may be steeped compared to coffee-shop prices but I think it is worthwhile as it is after all air-conditioned. I like it that the food isn't salty or taste like msg. The tofu was soft on the inside and crispy on the outside. As I don't eat pork, I simply scrapped the pork toppings from the tofu. I appreciate that the waitress is service-oriented. She was attentive and the food were served very promptly. Oh yes, their barley was homemade without the canned drink type of taste. We'll definitely be back!\n\nThis is a Chinese style stir fry dishes with BBQ spicy while fish as it's signature dish! the fish was large and fresh, fragrant and spicy(non spicy sauce available as well) and only costs $35! other dishes we ordere includes sambal paste long brand, sweet sour pork cubes, hotplate seafood beancurd, hotplate beef slices all were flavourfully executed too. We were surprised even drinks offered was wide range: Pu er flower tea, coconut sugared milk tea was fragrant yet not too sweet and smooth to have. Overall highly recommended to come and savour if in this part of SG!\n",

I can take spicy food well, but level 3 was already quite spicy. Recommend to pair with some beers for even better taste. The live band was a plus esp if sitting indoors. The music can also be enjoyed outdoors as the sound system was pretty decent.\n\nWent on a Thursday night, rather crowded but managed to find a seat for 1 pax.\nThe drinks selection is pretty good but do ask the price before ordering as the menu price is before ++\n\nFood wise it is ok, edible and nothing to shout about. The impressive bit was the live band. They were good and made up for the avg food.\n\nOrdered the grilled chicken, seafood marinara and take out pizzas (Pepperoni, Hawaiian).\nGrilled chicken was slightly tough and too salty with sides(mushroom+potato and some greens)\nSeafood marinara with spicy tomato sauce was nice and not that spicy actually.\nPizzas topping were slightly salty and well done.\nWe were seated outdoor and there were bug flying around and one went for a swim.\n\nSecond try: Ordered burger, fish n chips, buffalo wings and ice cream. Burger was ok, salad was black at the tip. Fish and chips was well done. Buffalo wings - sauce was not nice, spicy level 2. Ranch was not cold while celery stick was too thin and soft, no crunch.\nIce cream was creamy with tiny marshmallow and nuts.\n\nFirst visited to this place and did not expected it to be crowded. They have indoor and outdoor seating. Only limited seats in the restaurant which have air-cond. Outdoor can be breezy too as it\u2019s near the river. They offered limited but general choices of Thai/Viet food, Pasta/Pizza and Western grills. Not wide selection, but it\u2019s good variety to choose from. Thai prawn cake abit salty, probably it\u2019s from vendor, not house made. But glass noodle seafod is good, quite refreshing and appetizing. Carbonara cooked to al dente and we like the creamy sauce with well smoked bacon. Pizza is a missed as we think taste like from frozen food. They have beer promotion at Happy Hour (\n\nCouple of good selection of beer choices. Food varieties are good too. Really like their luncheon fries, given very generous portion.  Their prosciutto pizza are just average. And had jug of beer and a bucket of mixed beers.\n\nThe ambience is great both outside and inside seating for chilling.\n\nThe live band was nice but inside seating will be harder to chat with ur company.  Outside seating will be preferable for chatting. Inside seating sound system are better.\n\nDo take note: if it rains, the cantilever shelter only able to extended to first 3 rows. The rest are not covered.\n",

                  "reviews": "\n\nWent right after they open to reserve for 2.30pm timing. Food wise uncooked food like meat is like what usually you would get in a normal hotpot buffet and not beauty in the pot standard but cooked food wise is probably more like beauty in the pot standard.\n\nDuring lunch or tea time, is worth to get the premium set which has better product at a reasonable price. Dinner maybe not.\n\nOverall, not bad but with hard to book reservation online, the queue system and chances not getting seats even if arrived, probably would be worth the trip if live nearby.\n\nThe front desk is really a minus, unprofessional in the way that she didn\u2019t guide us on how to order and proceed with the electronic menu, and do not have the heart to genuinely serve the customers. She was in a random and long conversation with one customer instead of serving customers who are in real need and there is no one who is doing the cashier duty coz she is busily talking :\u201d( . Really wish to replace the front desk person who is the in the first contact with customers. Might not be coming back if she stays in this working attitude\n\nMy wife and I came here for lunch. $29.9 premium + $3 peak surcharge. Total $78.17\n\nAbout 1135 am then we entered due to long queue. Our reservation was at 1130 am. Timer in tablet also start from 1130.\n1150 am. Pot with soup base served.\n1200 pm. Ingredients are not served yet. The manager came to every table to add time to the tablet, and told us that if still not enough time, to let him know. He said system got issues. The timer added about 20 mins.\n1210 pm then start serving us. But only got the prawn paste.\nWaited till 1227 pm then served us again with meat.\n3rd serving is 1255 pm. Prawn paste, crab sticks.\n1257 pm gave us prawn. Kelp.\n1.10 pm then final stuff.\n1.30 pm finished eating. Still left about 7 mins in the tablet (we asked the manager to add more time halfway through)\n\nNot much selections at the sauce station. Even shi li fang has more to choose from.\n\nSliced US beef is indicated as sold out in tablet. It was enabled only after we notified the manager.\n\nCheaper than Shi li fang if choosing the same premium food. But enjoyed better dining experience in Shi li fang. But perhaps this isn't an accurate review due to them having issues with their system.\n\nParadise Hotpot disappoints on multiple fronts. The poorly trained staff at the entrance add to the initial negative impression. The narrow interior feels cramped, especially around the self-service sauce area, which is invariably overcrowded. Continuous need for fuel replacements disrupts the dining experience. Moreover, the ingredients are very average . Overall, this hotpot restaurant is highly unrecommended due to its inadequate service, cramped space, and mediocre food quality.\n\nI love that you get an individual hotpot here which is perfect when eating alone. I love their pork bone soup, mala soup and the tomato soup. Ingredients here are always fresh and service is always helpful and polite. They have various discounts available and you can use Kris+ to earn miles here too.\n",

Especially loving the mango prawn fritters, love the taste and sweetness is just nice as well. Not forgetting the duck, \u7ea2\u6cb9\u6284\u624b, XO Carrot cake and char siew. Just everything was so great and my friends enjoyed the time we have spent there as well. Will definitely return for another round of gatherings!!\ud83e\udd24\ud83e\udd24\n\nPortion is much smaller compare with last time, look at the salted egg prawn. It\u2019s not cheap leh, but the portion is really too little. Ordered duck noodle and char Siew noodle also, noodle is a lot but meat is very little. Standard drop, not worth the price at all. Wont go back again.\nOnly good thing is staff attitude is good.\n\nHad a great time with family. Love the duck, roasted pork, carrot cake and cha shiu bun. Always order these dishes without fail.\n\nWe arrived at Canton Paradise Compass One at around 12:30pm on a Saturday and there was a modest queue waiting outside the restaurant. Took around 15 mins of waiting before we were seated.\n\nThere are two varieties of food to choose from here: Dim sum selections and also cooked dishes (noodles, rice and variety of stir-frys). Unfortunately a number of dim sum dishes were already sold out when we were seated. We still ordered a couple of available dim sums to share, but shout-out to the unique appetizer, cold braised mushrooms which was a great hit. I usually refuse appetizers, but this one is amazing. Definitely try it if you are a mushroom lover!\n\nEverything else is pretty much Canton standards. No surprises.\n\nI recently had the pleasure of dining at your establishment and felt compelled to share my exceptional experience.\n\nFrom the moment I entered Canton Paradise, I was greeted by a warm and welcoming atmosphere. The cleanliness and inviting ambiance immediately set the tone for a delightful dining experience.\n\nWhat truly stood out, however, was the remarkable service provided by your staff. I had the pleasure of interacting with two outstanding individuals who made my visit truly memorable.\n\nFirstly, I\u2019d like to extend my sincere appreciation to Ms. Tham Mei Ling. Her attentiveness and knowledge of the menu were impressive. She promptly answered all of my questions, provided recommendations that perfectly matched my preferences, and made sure my dining experience was nothing short of exceptional.\n\nSecondly, I would like to commend Mr. Kai Wen for his exceptional customer service. His patience and dedication in assisting me with my membership and ensuring that I could benefit from a discount code made my visit even more enjoyable. Mr. Kai Wen\u2019s commitment to ensuring customer satisfaction was evident throughout our interaction.\n\nThe combination of delicious food, a clean and welcoming environment, and the exemplary service provided by Ms. Tham Mei Ling and Mr. Kai Wen has left a lasting positive impression on me. It\u2019s not every day that one encounters such a remarkable dining experience.\n\nI believe that exceptional service should be acknowledged and celebrated. Ms. Tham Mei Ling and Mr. Kai Wen are true assets to your team, and their dedication to ensuring customer satisfaction deserves recognition.\n",

Best to book at least a day in advance before coming down to make sure you get indoor seating!\n\nThe food was pleasant, ordered the two different ribeye platter to share and we even received a complimentary cake to help us celebrate the occasion \u2764\ufe0f\n\nStaff also packaged the last drink included in our platter to bring home as we only had 2 out of the 3 drinks included in the platter we ordered. Uncle was dutifully going around taking orders as well :)\n\nFantastic service and I can\u2019t praise them enough \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb Do come down and give them a try!\n\nWe went for lunch, so there is only lunch set. Limited choice. Their lunch set come with fries, coleslaw and lemon tea, fix, can\u2019t change. Portion is quite small, my 8 years old son can finish the set by my own, so we adult don\u2019t even feel full when we walk out from the restaurant \ud83e\udd72 air con is not cooling, maybe too crowded so we felt warm while we were in the restaurant.\nMushroom soup is good, highly recommend for pulled pork burger! Ribeye was fine too.\n\nHad the Cajun Chicken Chop, it was very well done, though the skin was not as crispy as when I had it all that time ago but the chicken was juicy and the sauce rich. Unique to this place is the Potato Gratin side, it has this odd herby flavor I\u2019m not used to but is otherwise creamy.\n\nThey have an extensive list of meats from different places if you were feeling up for beef, but sadly I wasn\u2019t that day, but given the quality of beef they were serving, I doubt it could go wrong. They\u2019re cheaper than what you would get in restaurants too.\n\nThe potato came in chunks instead of slices, which I would have preferred. Be careful though as the dish is VERY hot. The coleslaw was alright. Overall, I\u2019d say it\u2019s worth the price, it\u2019s also located in a relatively quiet area in the Serangoon-Ang Mo Kio stretch. I would definitely visit again. If you\u2019re visiting with a group, making a reservation is highly recommended as their seating area is pretty small.\n\nA premium steak restaurant hidden among HDB flats. From the outside, its rather inconspicuous, yet it serves some premium cuts of steak from various countries. The steak we had was done just nice and taste good. Even the other type of meats were good too. Price wise they are definitely on the much pricier side, but at least you get some premium meat and taste. Put aside the location, come for the food.\n\nDelighted and Glad to find this place. Well hidden n i guess only those who stay here/or nearby will know about them.\nHeard good reviews from a friend previously but didnt come till now.\n\nIts a superb place for a steak and you will be seeing me very often for sure.\nWe had a great dinner, my kids loves the Mac n Cheese and Cheese Sticks.\nCajun Chicken was done nicely and tender.\nPork Quesadillas...oooo shiok la....so nice. If only u are so near my hse, i would actually dabao this item weekly as we r a fan of this item.\n\nFor the 2 Ribeyes we had - Argentina Pampas and Usa Holt Rib, juices leaked out the thick slabs and was also done nicely.\nSuperb piece of work and all at a very affordable attractive pricing.\n\nEven the chef (indian gentleman, didnt get his name) came to ask how was things, very good service indeed. Small action but speaks volume.\n\nNice cosy place and i will be back again for my next steak for sure.\nAlready looking forward to next trip so do keep up the good work guys \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\n",

So it is great for getting a group of people together to celebrate a special occasion.\n\nI recommend this place!!\n\nOrdered some of these delicious meats for a birthday event. Everything was so delicious, especially the Vacio and Entrana. And the sauces were amazing! Belen was very helpful in recommending the right combination and quantity of mains and sides. Great customer service and on time delivery! We would like to thank Belen and her team for helping to put together this amazing menu for a memorable birthday celebration. Muchas Gracias!\n\nMy friend celebrated her birthday there and it was an amazing night!!! Such an original and new way to go out here in JB! The food was sooooo delicious and the beef was of an incredible good quality!  Real Argentinian asado and experience! The place is a Durian plantation and we were eating surrounded by this beautiful trees, that was an extra plus! The entire place was only for us.... We ate, we danced and we had the best time!\n\nVery authentic Argentinian Asado BBQ experience. Kudos to the chef for the specially curated Argentinian flairs featuring different  cuts of meat. The Chimicurri sauce pairing with the BBQ meat is to die for. \ud83d\ude0b\n\nI had the best Argentinian asado experience at Chimichurri! Amazing food, vibe and companies.

Had the Fig Time pizza, rock melon with parma ham and angel hair pasta w/ king crab meat. Will come back and try other dishes on the menu (:\n\nAnother find in Serangoon gardens and Another Italian favourite of mine. Quite hidden. We had to park car and walk a while to get here. The ambience was cosy and the service was prompt. I loved their pizza! All dishes we ordered were lovely. The pastas were fresh. Truffle pasta was decadent.\n\nBaci Baci, nestled in a cozy corner of Serangoon, proved to be the ideal spot for our early celebrations of my son's birthday. When asked what he wanted for his special day, he excitedly exclaimed \"pasta,\" so we ventured to this charming restaurant.\n\nThe moment we stepped inside, the neat and inviting decor set the tone for a pleasant dining experience. The service staff were friendly, exhibiting warmth and genuine hospitality.\n\nWe embarked on a culinary journey, starting with the Crema di Porcini. Unlike other commercially-made versions, this soup had a distinct homemade taste that was truly delightful.\n\nThe Cacciucco, with its perfectly balanced acidity, whetted our appetites and prepared us for the feast ahead. The Soute do Cozze was heartwarming, and the choice of white wine in the soup was spot-on.\n\nThe Tagliatelle impressed us with its impeccable texture and rich truffle aroma, while the Capellini al Grancho, although tasty, could benefit from a touch of cream to enhance its flavors.\n\nA surprising hit among the children was the Frutti de Mare, their first encounter with squid ink. Initially skeptical due to its color, they couldn't resist requesting seconds after tasting its unique and delicious flavor.\n\nIn conclusion, Baci Baci surpassed our expectations for a memorable early birthday celebration. With its cozy ambiance, friendly service, and delectable pasta offerings, it proved to be a delightful culinary haven.\n\nHad expectations but after some cold plain bread then bland ordinary 'homely' pasta, things got incredibly boring and disappointing. One thing good was the pizza dough. Might be worth giving the pizza another shot... Maybe.\n\nBest service ever, waitress and owner went above and beyond to take care of us. authentic pizza was so good I ate it before taking the picture!\n",

The mashed potato and spinach is a good choice of sides to have a change of taste. On a tuesday night, its quite a good crowd. Place can be a bit noisy when crowded. Of the 3 desserts, loved the brownie most\n\nThis place exceeded my expectations. I had such a lovely, medium rare, buttery, peppery crusted ribeye! (Maybe could have been rested a tiny bit longer but I think most customers prefer warm rather than rested)\nThey also have some interesting premixed cocktails that aren\u2019t stiff but go very well with food.\nService was a casual, friendly style, yet prompt and efficient.\nI hope they keep it up, because their accessibility/value/quality as a steakhouse are rare in my opinion.\n\nMenu change with no sides need to purchase additional add on for sides. Friday night they do not have lobster bisque soup which is the only soup they carry in their menu.\nSides were good and not bad.\nOrder sirloin steak and i regretted as it was very tough despite it was cook medium rare. I will order ribeye next time. No staff ask how was the food even though it was my first time eating here.\n\nWe saw it had a good review, so we decided to try it. Ordered USDA Prime Ribeye, it comes w 2 sides, we chose fries and spinach and ordered a bottle of wine and dessert. Overall, we are satisfied. It's in a mid-range level.\n\nRecommended if you're looking for a quality yet not on a high-range or super expensive level.\n\nTotal bill paid $200++\n\nThe ambience and service was really nice and personal. Small restaurant hence the gaps between each table is rather narrow.\n\nShout out to the Starters - Crab cake, Octopus and Truffle fries.\n\nOrdered a ribeye and the cook was good. However, the sauce wasn't impressive. Just alright.\n\nSalmon was beautifully cooked.\n\nChicken thigh was strangely tough and hard and the crispy skin was a little over salted.\n\nAgain, the servers did the most amazing job.\n\nA table next to us ordered the mother's day special and we were almost done before their food arrived. They probably waited an hour - they arrived before us!\n",

Ordered mutton murtabak and tandoori chicken Briyani. Wait was about 15 minutes very normal. Place was clean and neat. Mutton murtabak was average. Tandoori chicken was flavorful. Size was slightly small. Rice serving was large.\n\nA restaurant just near the Bukit Batok MRT. The food is delicious and the service is quite good. We visit them regularly and they have never disappointed us so far. There is a big variety of food and the prices are reasonable. There is a story upstairs with Aircon and a larger seating area.. the downstairs story may seemed cramped up and noisy. So if you need to relax and have a better experience, always opt to dine at the upper floor. Afternoon hours are less busy and the staff attends to you quite soon. But we have been there during evenings and found the place busy and the food orders take time to come.\n\nThe lychee and milo dinosaur is lovely. And the thosai are really soft and nice. Chicken biriyani, Rice and Curry, Tom yum sea food rice and chicken fried rice are must try\u2019s in this restaurant. They are open passed 12 midnight as well. We will surely return again for a meal here.\n\nI love mee goreng yet I hardly came across a good one. Even when you occasionally had a good plate of mee goreng and came back again, the 2nd time may disappoint because it may not be cook by the same person, the simply fact that most Indian eatery are not manage by 1 person but by a team.\n\nThe mee goreng here was moist enough and flavourful but by no means fantastic, and probably because I hadn't had one for a long time where marginal utility play a part.\n\nUsed to be good  and a frequent at this stall but now\n1. Price increase\n2. Tastes drop tremendously\n3. Got an upset stomach and diaahrea\n4. Unhygienic environment\n",

We ordered Beef Claypot rice, Seafood Hong Kong Bee Hoon noodles, and the Tarik.\n\nWe would say the foods are flavourful and the portions are quite generous. The Teh Tarik is delicious.\n\nWe ordered Nasi Goreng Salted Fish for takeaway.\n\nOverall is satisfactory \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d... Will surely come back.\n\nThis restaurant is the 1st Halal establishment that I know that introduces the Beef Kut Teh to the muslim community in Singapore. Over the years the flavours have not changed a bit and the soup is so refreshing and not with a overpowering of herbal fragrant & taste. Not too salty either but just nice for me. Though, the soup is good and beef is tender, the amount of meat, to some maybe, too little and soup is too much. Serve with sambal, I think, belacan and white rice.\n\nWe also ordered Beef Claypot Rice and its is also 1 of my favourite here. The portion is a lot for the rice, sauce & beef but a bit too salty because it also have salted fish in the sauce and the burnt bits the bottom of the claypot is the best part and to not get too burnt you must scrap and mix the rice with sauce etc,  as soon as it is served.\n\nSambal Kangkong is a must as side dish and the portion for small is generous and delicious. Well balanced flavours.\n\nSituated at Bukit Gombak and jammed between a few other restaurants, Habib has made a name for themselves.\n\nWanted to makan dishes and so we decided on Habib. My sis loves this place for their butter naan and normally when I'm here, I would just almost always have individual dishes. However today was different decided to try individual dishes and boy it was a smart choice.\n\nSambal Petai, Black Pepper Beef, Sambal Sotong and Beancurds were all super sedap lah! Delicious!!!! Simple mouth watering. I can't gush enough on how good it was. And the portion size was absolutely fair. I don't care if I sound bias but it really was that good. And service timing was also on point. Maybe it was off peak but we had our drinks in less then 10 minutes and another 10 minutes all our orders were served.\n\nMy only grouse would be that a clearer instructions about the ordering process and the clearing if tables be put in place.\n\nAll in all, I would definately be here again and hopefully they keep up to their standards! Pls do not falter or regress cause that would be absolutely disappointing.\n\nFood : 4 / 5\nStaff : 3 / 5\nAmbience : 3 / 5\n\nMust try halal beef bak kut teh at this muslim family restaurant located at Bukit Gombak\n\nThe claypot style bak kut teh is very herbal and is better than most chinese versions.\n\nThey also give big chunks of beef\n\nYou can opt for bee hoon option\nAround $8 for a big portion\n\nAlso must order their sambal stingray. For $15 comes quite big and very meaty. Loved the spice as well!\n\nHabib Family Restaurant\n374 Bukit Batok Street 31, HDB, Singapore 650374\n\nTiktok: unconventionalpassionss\n\nIf you're looking for a delicious and filling meal, then Habib Family Restaurant is the place for you. This family-owned establishment is known for its delicious Bak Kut Teh made of beef and mutton, which every foodie in the area should try. The menu is full of tempting options, but the Bak Kut Teh is the real star of the show. The broth is rich and flavourful, with a perfect balance of spices and herbs. The beef is tender and juicy, while the mutton adds depth and complexity to the dish. All in all, Habib Family Restaurant is a must-visit if you're a fan of Bak Kut Teh or just want to enjoy a delicious meal.\n",

Noted that a couple of tables ordered western food.\n\nWe ordered red Tom yum - average, Pad Thai - beef is over cooked, but there is wok hei. Fried baby squid - got to eat while it\u2019s hot, otherwise wouldn\u2019t be crispy.\n\nQuite good place to go for supper since it opens until 2/3am.\n\nIt's our first time dining here. We came on Sunday lunch hrs, not much crowd. We were served approximately 15 mins after ordering.\nThere's a variety of dishes for Thai food lovers. All look super appetizing .\nLove  their initiative of customising the table to display all the menu with the prices stated clearly on it. So convenience for customers to choose from.\nWe ordered  fried kuey teow & Singapore fried Beehoon.\nBoth suit our taste bud..thou we felt that the portion could be more :)\nI love the teh o longan which definitely quench my thirst in this hot weather. A must try!\n\nWhat i like is the wide range of variety of food available.\nOrder chicken fried rice, it was fine, but just.\nCame out within minutes of ordering, chicken wasn\u2019t that fresh, hard.\n\nFinally the west side has decent food. I have to admit, their food is really nice. I tried their seafood tomyam spaghetti, it was spicy and delicious! I was a bit skeptical at first cause usually it is hard to get a perfect spicy sour taste for tomyam spaghetti but this one is simple and hits just nicely.\n\nTheir beehoon goreng was great too!! At first my hubby was upset cause the beehoon came not only super late.. it looked soggy and wet..He likes dry kind of fried beehoon... But the moment he tasted it..he was like wow... I tried it too...it was really delicious! It has the spicy chilli padi taste with a touch of tomato sauce as well ...\n\nTheir red spider drink remind you of childhood pink cough syrup! Maybe it the combination of strawberry ice cream and their red gassy drink..\n\nAmbience is nice too...if you come at night, it feels cosy...\nBut parking is weird as the nearest parking in front of the shop it is only meant for season parking holders only.. therefore need to have to drive all the way at the back of HDB and park inside.\n\nIt was our first time dining here. Service was quite fast. The only thing the runner who send the food is not sure of what he is sending us. It was nasi goreng kampung, but he told us it is nasi goreng seafood. So i rejected the food at first, another server came and say it is nasi grg kampong. Alhamdulilah it is delicious. Only that dissappoint us is the nuggets set that cost $6.50. The fries is dark, some is hard and some soggy and oily. It looks like it was being refried again. Hopefully they can do something about it.\n",

It\u2019s probably only a 70% pack on a sat evening.\n\nSo this time round every thing was on point.\nAlso they offer free flow of icecream though there was only 3 flavors.\n\nTried during lunch time, the area was pretty hot despite the kind gesture of the staff to bring cooler. Tried few food, they are nice but not leaving much impression. If you stranded there with no much choice, can try their Salted egg chicken, seafood bee hoon and Roasted pork. Not recommended: Fried Rice, stir fry vegie and yam Ring.\n\nThough the food is tasty, unfortunately it is alittle too oily for my liking. I really enjoyed the fried pork dish intially but after the 3 to 4 slices it was really sickening. We ordered the chill crab dish where the meat was already extracted (since we were lazy to deshell it ourselves) and while the crab meat portion was pretty generous, the sauce was too watery to my liking. It felt like an oily soup dish with crab meat in it. The four heavenly king dish was good since I didn't taste much of the raw veggie taste and the salted egg yolk chicken was good too just that it was pretty heavy towards the end.\nOverall I will still visit this place for it's other dishes such as the hokkien noodles or fried rice which seems promising\n\nFirst time eating here arrange by my sis for my mum birthday. None of the foods order taste nice. Hei zou are dry n hard...... Worse are the 2 small crabs price at $88. Totally not fresh the meat inside the crabs basically shrink until like no meat at all. Dont keep for how many days leow. Eat crabs dont even provide water to wash hands n the crabs cracker tools. Business do seem good..... Try leow let me know how the foods.\n\nAlways liked coming to this bustling joint that's fast gaining popularity. They even started engaging a magician to entertain patrons while waiting for our food to arrive. The Hokkien Mee and White Seafood Bee Hoon are must try items but portion is slightly small. We liked the prawn paste chicken and coffee ribs too. Kiddos welcomed the free ice cream for dessert. Will keep coming back!\n",

Staff are friendly and efficient!\n\nThe chicken rice is pretty good, to me the amount of chicken is slightly more than usual stalls \ud83d\ude05\n\nI always get the Ampang sauce for yong tau foo. The fried items are always nicely done and they will cook the veggies separately. Yet to try the other bases but there is also Hakka sauce, Tom Yum, laksa and soup!\n\nOverall, worth to stop by this place for a satisfying meal if you\u2019re nearby. It\u2019s just across the street from the MRT anyway. They sell kopi/teh, canned beverages and also accept various cashless payments too\n\nThe very first time I tried yong tau foo that was fried and filled with delicious meat sauce was from Dajie Bukit Gombak! I instantly fell in love with it! I got hooked onto their Hakka sauce! I loveeeee how oily, crispy and delicious the yong tau foo were when paired with this sauce!\nRemember to eat it there and then as it can get soggy! Y.u.m.m.y!\n\nThe only thing I think they can improve is on their soup though.\n\nThe food at Da Jie Niang Dou Fu (Dajie Makan Place) never disappoint! Used to frequent the Clementi outlet when I was a student at Ngee Ann. Nowadays, we venture out a little further to the Bukit Gombak outlet. We really like the food here! Spoilt for choices!\n\nFood is very good but service by the staff AWESOME. They are pleasant and freindly even during their busy period\n\nThis place is a monthly visit requirement even pre pandemic \ud83d\ude0a\n\nEnjoyed the chicken rice (good portions), the Yong Tau Foo was good (more variety would be nice) and price was reasonable for sure.\n\nBiggest issue with me since day 1 I visited here was the tiny tiny tables. 2 person to a tiny table is just super crowded and uncomfortable. 2 tables seating 2 people (as per the required regulations) would not breach the space and distance requirements. So hopefully they can look into this.\n\nThe food can be nice, the staff can be wonderful but when the set up is uncomfortable, the whole experienced is compromised. Again, hope they will look into this.\n\nFood : 4 / 5\nStaff : 4 / 5\nAmbience: 2 / 5\n",

I can find only 5 or 6 small chicken pieces. Not worth for 10.40$.

Food and drink might be prepared fast but it's pointless without people to serve to the customers.\nBeen coming here for years and food is still up to standard though, good job on that \ud83d\udc4d\n\nToday we celebrated Mother\u2019s Day at Jiak. I have been wanting to try this eastern after recommendations from my colleagues. As reservations were full, we went early to try our luck. Blessing that the timing we went was perfect and we are a seat on arrival. There were only 5 of us so we did not order too much. We ordered the Signature Seafood Black Beehoon; Prawn paste chicken; Sweet & Sour Seabass; Ladyfingers and a Seafood fried rice as the girls are too sceptical to try the black beehoon. I must say all the dishes are cooked to perfectly suit my palate\ud83d\ude0b I was initially worried if the black beehoon would come with an over empowering flavor but no, it didn\u2019t! In fact it contains the freshness of the seafood in the dish and overall a \ud83d\udc4d. The fish is another one worth recommending. Personally I love sweet & sour dishes and this one is done right on the spot. Fish is fried till it\u2019s crispy to every bite and the sauce nailed it all. Chicken comes covered with loose crumbs which my daughter finished to the last bit! The 2 desserts which they have, the chendol and mango ice were sweet and serve as the icing to the cake for the evening. Great place with tasty food. One minus point is, the food took a bit long to be served and there was one staff giving our free snacks to appease the diners but I am not sure why our table was left out when we are the second table to be seated\ud83e\udd28 Not a fair gesture on his part. I would have rated 5 stars if not for this.....\n\nthe ambience is nice! we ordered kopi o chicken, mee soto, and curry fish head.  looks exactly like in the menu. i would have ordered veggies too but my dad doesn\u2019t eat them. Will come here again to try more dishes!\n\nPrawn paste chicken was good! Decent dinner, had the set for two and added prawn paste chicken, also topped up $5 for dessert, total bill came out to ~$60.\n\nGenerous portions of food.\nFloor was still from mobbing when we went in at 11.30am\n",

The atmosphere feels a little dark, run down, and cramped but we managed to get a spot. The table staff are friendly and helpful. The food is pretty good, too. Definitely above average. However, I am compelled to give a low rating for a few reasons. First, they need to work on their kitchen hygiene. Second, it\u2019s quite pricey. The pita sandwiches are tasty but should be at least 25% cheaper. What really got me, however, is gouging $11 for a small bottle of lemonade. That\u2019s obscene. If they lowered their prices (and maybe the music volume while they\u2019re at it) and cleaned the place up, it would be an easy four stars. As things stand today, I can\u2019t really recommend it despite the food being good.\n\nthe pita is so delicious! the calamari is a must try. very worth it for its price :) the beef was a bit dry and the tiramisu is more of a cake than a tiramisu - was v creamy.\n\nSpent $50/person but we were stuffed. Couldn\u2019t finish our food\n\nThe bread is super duper soft!\nWe love what we ordered only the mushroom hummus is a little bit too salty.\nThe music is a little too loud. So is quite hard to make a conversation .\nThe service is good.\n\nI came here for the falafel the first time and absolutely love it. Back again to try something else. This time got the baby cauliflower and fish schnitzel. Love the refreshing slaw that comes with the fish. Baby cauliflower maybe a little too torched but its ok for me. Have really love the food here so definitely will be back just that parking around the area can be a little challenging.\n\nDelicious, with generous portions. Hearty flavors, casual atmosphere, pricing reasonable for the size, location and quality.\nCauliflower nice but a smidge expensive. Pitas are large and decent value, very tasty meat and combinations.\nHummus is good.\nThe bread itself is just awesome.\nIt\u2019s a casual-ish joint. Service is ok not great.\nSometimes there is smoking next door if you\u2019re outdoors.\nWill be back for the food.\n",

The Teochew Cai Poh fried Kueh Teow is tasty, the chicken is nice, the Hey Chor Is just ok-ok. Overall, food is generally nice.\n\nThe food are all overpriced even though I knew teochew cuisine is meant to be expensive. The crab was so small and 2 pcs for the price of $100, salted egg squid was $50, prawn was $60 and worst of all, a plate of tofu cost us $24. The waitress however at the 2nd floor did render good  service as she kept changing our plate but that don\u2019t justify for the total amount we had paid for ($475.90) for a simple dinner.  We would rather go to Jumbo restaurant or any zichar stall which serve better good quality food than them and cheaper in fact.  Last but not least, I do not understand why the review here is commenting on another food (Kway chap) and the sign board is different. Anyway the address is the same. For us, it will definitely be the 1st time and the last time to dine here. We would strongly don\u2019t recommend any patronage to the so called \u2018Teochew Restaurant\u2019\n\nComfort food near home. Would always come for their fish soup and kueh chap. Flavourful fish soup, usually I would add bitter gourd for the crunch and vegetable source. Flavourful tender braised innards (love that skin is included). Would usually add on braised duck meat in my kway chap for additional protein. Their nai bai vegetable dish was cooked with broth (\u4e0a\u6c64) and with whole fried garlic. Flavourful, vegetable not overcook; has a crunch. Also love that they processed the garlic beforehand hence the garlic was not spicy. Attention to details.\n\nStandards has improved, less salty and more flavourful than before, probably change of chef. Prices are reasonable. Love the convenience that they are open 24 hours.\n\nThe fish porridge is good, must try. The service is nice too. Some staff's service approach is not the polished polite style, and at times is very direct, so to some customer this may appear as rude, but it's just their down-to-earth direct approach.\n\nFish soup is fresh, and portions are just nice. Service is good but sometimes can't understand their mandarin. Accent bit too strong \ud83d\ude05\n\nThis place never sleeps. They open 24/7\n",

Service is very good and the staff are attentive and gave good recommendations. The hummus with prawns is one of the best thing on the menu. The octopus is also worth a try and the kebab is very decent too. The only thing we won\u2019t bother try again is the artichoke.\n\nThe food here was amazing. Very inventive menu and everything was delicious. Highly recommend the prawn hummus.\n\nThe place is nicely styled with a very high energy atmosphere created by the staff. The staff are attentive and helpful.\n\nPortions can be quite big. Would definitely come here again.\n\nPasta has changed since the last I had. Used to be spaghetti which I really enjoyed. The new pasta didn\u2019t excite me this time. Other than that, the buttered spinach and the grilled octopus, ZEE BEST!! Salivating just thinking about it :D Needless to say, the service well deserving of 5 stars!\n\nEnjoyed the food. Pasta was amazing. Lamb is average, can give it a miss. Overall slightly pricey though. And sound reverberation is horrible. Not a good place for a first date... you will be shouting at each other.\n\n4.8/5 (5/5 food; 4/5 service; 5/5 atmosphere). Great night out! I tried to objectively evaluate this restaurant. We came as a couple for a date night, but this restaurant is clearly best experienced as a group. The atmosphere is super lively, loud and charming. But if you're looking for an intimate night out, this probably isnt the place. Nonetheless, we could really appreciate the ambience in the room! The food was fantastic, we had a bit of everything and honestly each plate was better than the other. Great wine and drink list. The only drawback is slow/less attentive staff. The place is packed and bustling not sure if it's because there is a shortage of staff but they are clearly going at 150%, but not sustainable. The end of the night holds a nice little surprise! Will definitely be going back (with a group)\n",

LOVE IT! \ud83c\udf55\nPASTA was delicious not too overwhelming with all that cream sauce, the tanginess from the sourness of tom yum flavour balances the dish out. seafood were also cooked nicely. tender squid rings! \ud83e\udd90\ud83e\udd91\nSOUP & GARLIC BREAD much love! baguette of garlic bread were baked to a nice crisp yet not burnt and still remains soft in the center. \ud83e\udd56\ud83e\uddc4\n\nTHANK YOU STAFFS INVOLVED! surely i will come back again \ud83e\udd0d\n\nSimple neighbourhood place for a fairly quick meal of pasta and pizza. Staff was very friendly, food was nice. They have indoor and outdoor sitting. Would visit again.\n\nFriendly and respectful staff, great pasta all the time, my top choice to go for pasta cravings \ud83d\ude18\n\nWe were sitting in the restaurant for 30 minutes scrolling the menu and decided to place our order at 2132 hours (2 minutes after 'last order' 2130 hours)\n\nThey asked us to move to the outside seating area, which was fine.\n\nThe SG$3 garlic bread had to be the most underwhelming and overpriced item. Never, ever order it.\n\nPasta was so and so. Ordered three dishes, all different types, nothing out of the ordinary that would make me want to come back. Although, upsize portion was good.\n\nAround 2157 hours we had received all items for our order barring the baked rice. We decided to ask about the rice and were shocked to see that the baked rice was left in the microwave for the entire time, and was not served to us.\n\nThe baked rice was given in a plastic container (even though we were eating-in) with exceedingly low portion size for the price.\n\nWhen asked for water, the cup had a black particle in it. Nothing major.\n\nThe atmosphere was nonexistent, the music choice was straight out of hell.\n\nOnly positive was the extremely kind and helpful service.\n\nSimply put, extremely disappointed. Nothing close to what my friends and I paid for. Will think twice before ever coming back.\n\nPasta and Pizza ...\n\nCouldn't decide what we wanted for lunch as we were in Westmall. Walked around and saw Pasta Mania.\n\nQuick decisions and there we were. Approached one of the staff and swiftly, she explained to us accordingly the menu etc. Checked in and got our seats. Commendable that the seats were spaced nicely apart.\n\nOur food came rather quick. Heres the plus point. 2 staff came to help us on different times and both times they were super accomodating, polite and always smiley.\n\nThe food is above average. It was nicely seasoned and the portioning was rather generous. Just that the pizza was slightly underwhelming. Also, it's funny enough that I do enjoy the garlic bread. Look at the calamari, it's nice lah!  Price wise, it's OK I suppose with the portion.\n\nWhat makes the meal pleasant really was the attentive staff, period. An average food but served with a delightful atmosphere makes the whole experience really pleasant. So will surely visit them yet again and hopefully the standard remains.\n\nFood : 3 / 5\nStaff : 4 / 5\nAmbience : 3.5 / 5\n",

They accept American Express, which not all places do in Singapore.\n\nIt's very hard to find a Kosher place in this little country, so I'm glad that this place turned out to be a good option!\n\nThe hummus, pitas and falafel platter was simply delicious, serving 4-5 persons! The waiter made good recommendations on how much we order as the portions are big! Schnitzel (fried chicken)with fries/fried rice plus salad is good for 2 persons per plate! You can literally taste the potatoes in the Fries ~ very yummy! Reasonable prices too and good service!\n\nVery good kosher food, was lovely and soft, would go back anytime. Nice friendly staff.\n\nLevel of security is high before one could enter the premise. Kosher food is served here.

Context: I first tasted the Chai family\u2019s delicious food at Thunder Tree Lei Cha previously located in Raffles Hospital food court and Vivo City food court, now permanently closed due to closure of their organic farm.\n\nIn my opinion, they are serving the best vegetarian kolomee in Singapore. The noodles are cooked al dente/very springy. My usual order is the mushroom kolomee with a dollop of their spicy homemade chilli on the side. Portion runs small. I would order it with extra noodles and extra mushrooms! My husband\u2019s favourite is the chilli kolomee - if you can\u2019t handle spicy/chilli hot food, don\u2019t order this. Their carrot cake is also tasty, best if you arrive right when they just finish frying them, hehe.\n\nStall gets busy during lunch time and table/seats may be challenging to find. Suggest to arrive early.\n\nTo note: food from this stall are all vegetarian without allium (no onion, no garlic).\n\nHappen to past by this stall, order an dry noodle and yam cake . The kolo noodles are yummy and tasty. But not recomme the yam cake, the taste are average and cold. Good choice on \u521d\u4e00& \u5341\u4e94.\n\nWould have given 1 star if I hadn't actually enjoyed their Lei Cha.\n\nKind of like selling \"dog meat with a goat sign\", the sign was clearly indicating their Lei Cha uses brown rice and even if they do have the white rice option, they shd confirm it with us before proceeding serving us with white rice. The noodle menu was even ridiculous, the BIG SIGN above their stalls with their menu items numbered was no longer valid, replaced by an new & different menu in a A4 size sign right in front of their stall which you will only notice it when you are 1st in the queue. The staff didn't bother to inform abt the differences but I did realized the no.4 item I wanted to order was a different dish in the new menu and I specifically told him I wanted the no.4 from the Big Sign above and even pointed my finger to it, the staff acknowledge but proceed to cook the no.4 from the new menu after which he just told me the \"no.4\" I wanted was out of stock. I would have replace it with Lei Cha also if he had bothered to inform ahead. This is hawker etiquette at its worst.\n\nOrdered signature chili kolo mee the shop told me to be careful of the spiciness. Indeed it was very spicy but still torelable to me.\nSoup was good, sweet from radish and not oily.\n\nMaybe next time can try the lei cha if i\u2019m around\ud83d\ude00\n\nThis leicha is vegan, no egg. The soup has no oil and is smooth and rich. The kolo mee is vegan too as the noodle is egg-free.\nEverything was tasty and only two main dishes were available at 2pm and there was a queue the whole time we were there on Saturday.\nAbout a 10-min walk from Bukit Batok train station, cutting across the park.\nDefinitely will come often.\n",

Seafood wasn't very fresh, gong gong wasn't cleaned properly there were still algae on them.\nSauces we got was chilli crab, percik and creamy onion, it was good.\n\nP. S. This place will be a one time thing.\n\nOrdered Family Bucket, which comes with 3 servings of Seafood Tub, Free flow fruit punch, and rice. Each serving of Seafood Tub allows a choice of sauce. Went with Creamy Garlic Sauce, Chilli Crab Sauce, Percik Sauce. Seafood is not too fresh, crab meat is visibly flaky/crumbly, mussels look shrivelled up.\n\nWas a bit doubtful seeing the mixed reviews. Went there in a Saturday evening, place was ~70% full but service was still good. We got the 5 pax (3 seafood bucket w/ 3 sauces, lobster, fried fish, free flow rice +fruit punch) for $155. Flavours were not too intense and spicy, so everyone including kids enjoyed the food. No GST and service charge. Family enjoyed it, will def come again!\n\nSeafood not very fresh. Not cleaned properly and overcooked. Staff was not attentive and have attitude problem. Does not even tell you in advance for out of stock but simply give anything following their choice. Portion quite small only 3 crabs. Corn was overcooked and smells weird. Gong gong has greenish shells. Mussels have sand in it and overcooked. Sauces not that amazing. Shellout worth of 100 dollars came with clams, mussels, gong gong, 10 prawns, 3 crabs, 2 corn sliced in smaller knobs plus rice. Rice also not up to standard. No improvement in food standard.\n\nWasn't planning to dine here at first, but I'm glad we gave this place a try! Food was really good and affordable. The seafood aglio olio was delicious. My girl really loved the lamb chops too. It's somewhat like dining at Aston but tastes better.\n\nDefinitely our go to place for lunch/dinner after swimming at the csc pool the next time!\n",

Dishes are good and acceptable, with a big range of dishes available. Average price per person for ala carte and drink is about $10 per person. Fuss free meal! Parking available at the road or outdoor carpark nearby Beauty World Mrt station.\n\nThe food was delicious. Served quite fast. You don't need to wait long.\n\nTried the nasi campur. You need to try the curry chicken, which was fantastic. Tried the butter chicken with plain naan, which was great, too. We also had bryani prawn and Chinese style fried rice.\n\nStaff are very attentive, friendly, and helpful.\n\nEasy to travel here via bus 67 from CCK Bus Interchange or Downtown Line Beauty World.\n\nWill come down to try other food next time.\n\nBeen coming here for years. You get what you pay for, never had complaints about their food.\n\nLooks like they upgraded their curry bowls \ud83d\ude02\n\nLots of comfort food at its best here. They've range from Western food to indian dishes.\n\nThe dishes we ordered are served warm and taste acceptable.\n\nWith all the price rising, we are surprised that their price is still reasonable.\nYou'll find fried rice with a side dish from $5+ only.\nPortion is generous too\n\nIt was a weekday when we visited the restaurant, and it was busy with customers, but their staff were incredibly fast.\n\nReasonable rate + Great service.\nIt's definitely a great supper place to lepakz with friends\n\nAnd the cheese naan & butter chicken is a must try! Highly recommend!\n\nThe butter chicken was the best I've tasted all over singapore.  As I've tried alot of it elsewhere... nothing is compared to Ameen's butter chicken. And damn the cheese naan is solid I tell you. Crispy on the outside and soft and gooey from the cheese on the inside. Totally recommending this place to anyone who loves a good solid butter chicken and pair it with their naan. Will be coming back very soon and many more times over the years!!!!\n",

Especially outside the shopping malls!\n\nFind SAFRA Jurong, and find Rasa Istimewa.\nOverall seafood is nice and at affordable prices. A recommended place for family.\n\nSalted egg chicken is a must try. Hot plate bean curd with seafood is delicious, spinach with mushroom is soft and delectable, and the sliced fried fish with sweet and sour sauce is an awesome complement as well. Drinks are refreshing too, and the variety is amazing compared to your typical Chinese restaurant. Being halal, this place is welcoming to all rave and religion! A go-to choice for delicious homely Zhi char if you\u2019re in the Boon Lay heartlands. Comfortable ambience with soothing decor, lighting and music makes this an ideal location for a relaxing dinner over which to catch up with friends or family.\nWorth coming back again, value for money \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\n\nI would like to thank all the staff serving us as quickly as possible for our iftar.\n\nThe food was not delivered early before breaking of fast which is appreciated. I know that with this type of system will be bound to encounter delay on 1 or 2 dishes (which for us is the ala carte dish, Mee Hon Kong.) Nevertheless, rest of meal was nice except the Tom Yum Soup (tasted bland). Apart from it, we have a wonderful experience there.\n\nWould recommend others to iftar there. Slightly pricey but for the service and ambience, it is well deserve.\n\nGot the family combo. Yu Sheng was different yet felt premium. Food is generally excellent and well prepared. Only complaint is the fried noodles were too salty during our visit. Developed sore throat the next day. But flavor and texture is still there.\n\nStaff are generally friendly, and ambience is good, only because it wasn't too crowded a little before peak dinner time. Will recommend to my friends around my area.\n\nFood was great. My mother in law wife and daughter enjoyed the food. No complaints!\n\nThe food came fast and was piping hot for the hot plates. Taste was great for the beef and tofu and was cleared very quickly.\n\nStingray taste was good and non rubbery. The youtiao was very crispy and there was sufficient fish paste inside!\nKai lan was tasty with wok hei\n\nThanks for a sumptuous lunch!\nPs the usual waiters are quite ok. The tall, young man wearing the green polo was very friendly:)\n",

Ample garlic and chilli for self add on.\nWhampoa Soya Bean gave a generous serving of gingko nuts with the bean curd. But be alert to inform them to have less sugar as mine was too sweet for me.\n\nWide array of selections to choose from prawn noodle, chicken rice, fritters, Nasi lemak, fish soup, soya drinks, duck rice, and more recently newly opened pork trotter rice. Day 1 launched at Boon Lay Place Market. Some of the hawker stalls open as early as 6am, and the Kuay Chap stall even open 24hours. Evening stalls included satay, fried chicken wings, Zi Char and even grilled string ray etc. Always crowded with throngs of patrons visiting different stall throughout the day. Attached is pork trotter rice from Bai Nian!\n\nVariety of food choices.. lor mee is not bad :)\n\nI wanted to have something light and ate carrot cake. It's very tasty and not oily like the rest. The only set back at Boon lay are the sitting arrangements. Time for a TOTAL REVAMP... \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\n\nThere\u2019s a famous Nasi Lemak stall at a corner and another chinese version which is equally nice. My favourite Chong Pang satay stall that sells nice satay and bbq chicken wings. If you like Hokkein mee, there\u2019s a stall diagonal opposite to the satay stall, which is very nice. And there\u2019s a stall selling nice Ngoh Hiang, aka deep fried stuff seasoned with five spices, facing Boon Lay place.\n\nAs for dessert, other than the typical bamboo cane drinks and the many different hawker drinks, there\u2019s an auntie selling assorted soya bean drinks and dessert.\n\nIn short, it\u2019s a hawker flair paradise!\n\nIG: sgfood13\nTiktok: gohht13\n",

                  "reviews": "\n\nmy first time to prata wala, i ordered a new menu item - wrap salad series butter chicken. there is also wrap briyani series. took quite a long while waiting for it to be ready. i could see the staff figuring out how to wrap it behind the clear glass counter. maybe cause it's a new item, i'll give them the benefit of doubt. i thought it would be subway's wrap's size but it's significantly smaller. butter chicken and its accompanying gravy/sauce is definitely sufficient. taste is on the spot, matches the wrap, not too spicy, not too strong. however, the salad (veggies) is meager. i only remember seeing one piece of lettuce and several countable strips of onion and carrot (i presume carrot? cause something orange). surely lose out to subway and/or stuff'd since the price range is about the same. hope they can improve on that, otherwise this wrap idea is a good menu add on. i also ordered hot teh tarik which is on point \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffd. restaurant is set up for fast food setting, i don't remember seeing any high chairs for kids though. their tray return is also all the way inside with minimum shelvings, they were already fully stacked with returns when i put my tray there. i thought it kind of discourages people to return their trays, especially when it gets crazy busy and crowded. on a good note, i spotted a really petite albeit thoughtful/useful hand wash basin at another corner of the restaurant.\n\nI tried the deepavali special Dahi puri and chilli chicken briyani. I could say this is so far the best briyani I had. Chilli sauce is not too overpowering, and the curry goes well together with it. Pair it with a crispy pappadum, and acar, the taste is heavenly. I would also like to say thank you to the friendly staff, Naveed, for the service and  recommendation of Mango Lassi. It helps to lower the heat from the food and is very delicious too. First time trying out Dahi puri, quite an interesting taste experience for me. Sweet, salty, and a mixture of spicy makes it a well snack for anytime.\n\nPrice: $6.30\n\nMasala Thosai: 5/5\nThosai had extremely crispy edges, the potato of the curry was more like a mash, there were carrot, peas and lentils which added a nice crunch.\n\nSambar: 4.5/5\nA hearty and moreish sambar containing lentils with some heat from the chillies.\n\nChutney: 4.5/5\nRed chutney is flavourful, tangy and tasted tomatoey. White chutney has A LOT of coconut with tiny bits of ginger. Very refreshing.\n\nTotal score: 14/15\n\nButter chicken biryani, add egg ($1) and masala chai came up to $15.40 which is very reasonable given the portion. See how small the fork and spoon is in comparison to the plate lol. Sauce is addictive, chicken is tender, egg is delicious. I like everything about this \u263a\ufe0f The service was also very good and friendly. One small thing is that the place is very cold, so the food gets cold fast. Other than that, everything is awesome. I like that they have a small sink so you can wash your hands and they have napkins as well.\n\nWe ordered the butter chicken briyani (pictured; $11.90) and curry chicken briyani ($10.90) and the portion size was so huge that each dish could be shared by 2 persons. The curries were pretty good, though the curry chicken was slightly tough. It was busy on a Sun afternoon but there were still a few seats available. Service was friendly.\n",

I enjoyed the satays (70c each) and liked that the peanut sauce was a bit chunky with the bits of crushed peanut clearly visible.\n\nAlso tried some of their bbq chicken wings ($1.40, minimum 2pc) which looked a bit small but they were packing flavour. The wings went nicely with the chilli sauce which seemed to contain a bit of tanginess.\n\nI also appreciated the food being served on reusable crockery.\n\nStill as good Satay, popular with locals. Taste as good even when pack back to consume. Gravy not spicy, strong hint of peanut.\n\nThe best satay that we have eaten so far. The pork satay is juicy and flavour full. The ketutput is wrapped in coconut leaves unlike of others in plastic paper. The lady who attended to us is pleasant and courteous  despite the hot environment & many orders. The digital queue system gives you an informed waiting, no worrying if your order had been missed. This make the waiting easy. Overall eating experience 5 stars. Will definitely return for more. Highly recommended.\n\nThis satay stall is my favourite. Meat well grilled; add 50 or 80 cts more for cucumbers /onions rounding up to nearest dollar.\n\nBest satay I have tasted so far. Always call to order before reaching the hawker centre to reduce waiting time of 30 minutes or more. Now they offer chicken wings too.\n",

The waiter just ignore our feedback, and the qrcode for feedback keep requesting for personal info only, but not allow to upload any photo.\n\nOrdered the trio meat set meal with a mac and cheese. It\u2019s what\u2019s you expect from pepper lunch meal, exciting to stir fry everything in front of you. Queue was slightly long due to SDM but the server was friendly and prompt in explaining how to order and the SDM in place. Made the whole dining experience quite enjoyable and smooth.\n\nOrdered 2 salmon pepper rice (one without corn) and a seafood aglio olio for takeout. The aglio olio and normal salmon pepper rice arrived in 15 minutes. Counter staff kept saying it takes time and that it was a special order, but more than 20 orders including multiple salmon rices were served in the meantime. Kitchen staff kept forgetting (or refused to make) the order even after being reminded by senior staff three times. It took an additional 30 minutes for the remaining salmon pepper rice to arrive.\n\nStandard remains consistently good even after many years. Clean and excellent customer svc. The cashiers, be it part timers or regular staffs are very helpful. Was checking if they recently changed their menu. She explained to us what are some of changes.\n\nMaybe this is the only time I\u2019ll finish all the rice! \ud83d\ude06 be it beef, salmon, or chicken, scallops, it\u2019s always good. Be sure to quickly \u201ccook\u201d it with their special butter once the food arrived!\n\nBut if u re seated inside the restaurant area, where the cashier is located, rmb to spray the fabric mist on your way out. Cos you may smell alittle oily if you don\u2019t.\n",

Waiting time could be long, would not go for it if q is too long.\n\nPOWER! The nasi lemak is fresh and tasty. Good selection and choices. Nice flavorful rice and sambal. Friendly and quick service. POWER!\n\nOrdered the Chicken Set ($4) for takeaway and only managed to eat it almost half a day later. The rice and chilli is amazing, I finally understand why this place is so popular! Chicken is alright, and the egg yolk was cooked to a nice jammy consistency. 10/10 will come back!\n\nPower Nasi Lemak.. powerful punch of sambal and powerful crunchiness chicken wing that is flavoursome too. Despite the current unpredictable weather, customers who are craving for this powerful nasi lemak remain undeterred and patiently queue for their turn. Wide selection for customers to mix it, try it & love it!\n",

The taste is a delightful blend of savory and umami flavors, complemented by a rich demi-glace sauce. Overall, a visually appealing and delicious culinary experience.\n\nWalk in on a Sunday early evening at around 5.45pm and there was only one group ahead of us so waiting time is around 2-3 minutes.\n\nOrdered the truffle omelette set at $18.80++ and avocado pork hamburg set at $16.80++.\n\nEach set come with a side dish, a salad, a tamago soup and a rice.\n\nService staff are very attentive and excellent customer service.\n\nWill definately return to dine in again.\n\nWalked in on Sunday 530pm for early dinner and could get seats readily. What attracted us into the restaurant was the smell, likely from the sizzling hot plates that the steaks are presented on. Had Bacon & Kinoko Hamburg Steak Teishoku. The food is good but not excellent probably due to my personal preference of not so greasy food to begin with.\n\nI was quite hungry, but unfortunately, the food here left me with a sense of normalcy, which in itself speaks volumes.\n\nHere's what I ordered:\n\n1. Tsukimi Pork Hamburg Don - The hamburg was rather tasteless, but fortunately, they provided soy sauce on the side. I must say the egg yolk was a highlight. In fact, I ordered an extra egg to mix with the remaining rice, elevating the dish.\n\n2. Tamago Egg Soup - Surprisingly, this simple soup stood out amongst all the dishes.\n\n3. Thick-Cut Bacon - A decent choice if you're hankering for bacon.\n\nThis was my first experience tasting hamburg steak in Singapore! We conveniently placed our order through a QR code, and the food arrived promptly after we ordered. We opted for the Bacon Hamburg Steak Set Meal and Tsukimi Hamburg Don, and both dishes were incredibly delicious! The Japanese ingredients were impressively fresh, leaving a delightful taste in our mouths. We're already looking forward to returning to try other items on the menu!\n",

The tenderloin soup was also tasty. It is worth a try. The location is far from the center of town, but it is worth the trip.\n\nThe meat was fall-off-the-bone tender. Soup was not overwhelmingly garlicky or peppery and there's a taste of sweetness of the pork in it. Pig trotters was fabulous too.\n\nA Bak Kut Teh stall that is the main anchor stall in a coffee shop. Order at the counter, and food will be served to the table. Soup refill is self-service.\n\nReasonable price and above average taste. One of the better BKT in Singapore thou there was no wow feel.\n\nFood not as good as before. Prices increased but quality of food gone down alot. Soup is over salty now, side dishes too oily, mei cai contains too much hard unchewable parts which I need to spit out constantly.\nIt took away my pleasure of enjoying this popular bak koot teh. We're quite the regulars here by the way. Disappointed.\n\nLove the BKT.  The meat is tender and soup, which is pepperish and flavourful.   The pork trotter is very well done,  soft and juicy, which just melts in your mouth.\n",

Must say I am happy they have survived all these years.\n\nBack then, I would have rated this as one of the top BKT places in Singapore. Today, with the rise of Ng Ah Sio, Song Fa and others, Hwa Xing is still good but not as spectacular as before.\n\nSame peppery taste that I remembered. Same slightly bloody kidney. Same salty vegetables. Same long wait for your food to be served. If you like steamed fish, go for the steamed garouper.\n\nOne of the best Bak Kut Teh experience I ever had. Ordered pork rib (there is option to select how many piece you want), mix veg, fermented veg, pig trotter, and steam fish (half) was pleasantly surprised the prices were so reasonable. Strongly recommend anyone in the area to give it a try. You won\u2019t regret it yummy.\n\nThe bak kuh teh is decent but not WOW.  The queue is rather long with a 45min wait at peak hours.  The service attitude is good and they bring the order to the table.  Their steam fish seems popular too.\n\nWhile the meat was soft and tender, the soup was insanely peppery that you can't really taste any other flavours from the soup. We much prefer the pig trotters as compared to the bak kut teh.\n\nThe pork trotter was mainly the lean parts. Having said that, it was surprisingly tender. The sauce was of a good balance.\n\nAccompanying soup was peppery but lacked depth. Mainly flavored with soy sauce.\n",

The Japanese bento stall at #01-47 was open though.  Good value servings. Glad to have tried that stall.  They have a wide menu to choose from.  Chicken teriyaki and fish cutlet Bento for $5.50. The rojak stall nearby was still open. A big plate of rojak starts from $4.\n\nRecommend to try out this stall which is famed with its Crispy Yong Tau Foo coated with the right blend of chilli and sweet sauce, alternatively you can try the soup type ( add on: noodle etc) or even with Laksa gravy spreading over the Chee Cheong Fun. Excellent combo of crispy & crunchy stuffed Yong Tau Foo with moist & smooth Chee Cheong Fun, a must try for those who love Yong Tau Foo, as breakfast!\n\nDon\u2019t get mixed up with another Yuhua market, this one is Yuhua Village. There are variety of eatery especially morning, Xiang Ji Porridge is a 2nd generation - - try them when here will never regret. There r two wanton noodle facing the road - very good. There roast meat & duck, chicken rice, Mee Pok, Malay food - very good. And a whole lot of eatery, the famous Zai Shun is here next to the market. Tiong Bahru boa is also here. Plus after breakfast walk around medical hall, barber, spa, hardware shop, bread shop & many.\n\nCould not find a parking space in the morning on the weekend, luckily we stay nearby, so even if its take away food, the \u7092\u7cbf\u6761is still good, should have added 3 dollars cockles to make it substantial. Chwee kueh is also good! Fried carrot cake is not as good as yu hua place hawker center nearby but they offer black+white mixed, so it is a +point. If u can't park, then forget about those long queue Michelin stuff...\nHdb should add a multi storey car park here, then it will be much better.\n\nDelicious local food at reasonable prices.    My favourites : chicken rice, peanut pan cakes, fried carrot cake black flavour, roti prata, mee rebus, mee siam, nasi lemak, soya bean drinks, fried black colour kl hokkien mee, economy bee hoon, mixed rice, pork porridge, zhi char at night,  economy rice,  vegetarian wan tan mee, laksa,  fried you tiao,  fish soup noodles......  \ud83d\ude00\ud83d\ude00\n",

Bak Kut Teh,  Teochew Kueh,  Pancake, Laksa and Chicken Rice are some of the popular ones.  There are usually a queue at these stalls but they move fast.\n\nVariety of food at affordable price.\n\n-Prawn mee was oily and expensive, with few prawns.\n-Fried hokkien mee from \u6676\u6676 and kway chup from Good Duck were good.\n-The gu chye kueh super good!\n-Coffee was average.\n-Thunder tea was good.\n\nHad Fried Carrot Cake ($3.00), Chicken Rice ($4.00), Lor Mee ($3.50) & Gu Cai Kueh + Soon Kueh ($1.10 x3), were good.\n\nCarrot cake 5 \ud83c\udf1f - Really good carrot cake that is proven with a long queue each time , well worth the wait for the plate of goodness!\nNote: The white and black version comes at $5!\n\nDimsum 3.5 \u2b50\ufe0f - Dimsum is also decent, though they tend to leave it to cool if you are late on your collection, quite a wet blanket on that part - pun intended.\n\nWanton noodle 4 \u2b50\ufe0f- springy noodles, decent portion and comforting bowl of noodles\n",

Fried ones are the best in my opinion with the skin at the right thickness, not too thin or thick. Turnip ones were okay. I usually buy 20-30 pieces in one go, waited 5-10 mins for the order to be done.\n\nRecommend to try this if you\u2019re in the area!\n\nIf you wonder how good can Teochew kueh be, you have to suspend any judgement and head here. This has been on my to-revisit place for a while and the last time I came (from the eastern part of Singapore) was probably before Covid. Given how good it is, a 30 minutes wait is worth it. What is amazing is that the kueh here is made, steamed and fried right before your eyes. Personally I like fried version which is my choice always. The skin is so perfect - thin and delicate and slightly chewy. It\u2019s definitely Michelin Bib Gourmand worthy.\n\nVisited 16 July 2023 Sunny Sunday morning. The following sharing are based on our unbiased personal opinion and experience\n\nThis stall need no further introduction if your stay in the neighborhood. And there were a few interviews about this authentic teochew Kueh stall on some social media platform.\n\nThe owner are a pair of middle aged couple with 4 - 5 stall helper to handmade the Kueh daily. The male stall owner is very friendly and we will greet each other morning everytime I visit his stall.\n\nHandmade Kueh truly hits a spot on me. There have a option of steam or pan fry Kueh. I will order for 2 days portion for take away and leave some for next day to pan fried.\n\nOverall a 4 \u2b50 for me. Come on down and give it a try I'm sure you will love it as well\n\nOne of the few places where teochew kuehs can be pan fried upon request (add 10 cents each). Both soon kueh and png kueh were good. Everything served in disposables even for dine-in. E-payment available.\n\nMichelin-rated local food. Price is reasonable. Had two kuehs and it was warm as it was heated over a big pan.\n",

That's why minus  stars.\n\nOverall, can eat and will come back again if around the area.\n\nLong queue. But can\u2019t say it was worth the wait. Maybe the chicken quality went down after the shortage\u2026. Skin felt really oily, and the breast meat a bit dry. Rice was nice. Chili nice. Ginger sauce nice. Maybe come back after the chicken supply comes back to normal.\n\nGreat and deliciously good Chicken Rice The prices are reasonable. For half a Chicken with 4 plate of rice, it costs you less than $15. They friendly family business. Worth to eat! Very fragrant rice too\n\nThis boneless chicken rice stall attracts a crowd. They are usually sold out around lunch time. So it is advisable to come slightly earlier, before noon if possible. Taste is great and the chilli is fantastic. Price is reasonable and the hawkers are friendly.\n\nBy 1pm you are probably stretching your luck, as most days they could be sold out by then or favourite parts of the chicken are no longer available.\n\nChicken is awesome. Price is good.\nHalf chicken is $15. Love their skin. The sauce pairing is good. Traditional taste.\nRice on the other hand a bit hard but the taste is moderate. Can be stronger tho.\nSoup was clear and savoury. It so damn worth it lah.\n",

The variety of stalls caters to every craving, from traditional local favorites like Hainanese chicken rice to international delights. The affordable prices and efficient service make it a top choice for a quick and satisfying meal. It's a bustling hub where the rich flavors of Singaporean cuisine come to life, and the perfect place to experience the city's diverse culinary heritage.\n\nWas here to have lunch with my mum, and she mentioned that the Mala was not bad located at the Kopitiam Food Hall (old Jurong Point building Level 3). After renovation, the new Food Hall has comes alive with many interesting new stalls. However, the prices are a bit higher. Therefore, it is recommend to use the Fairprice/Kopitiam App to get 10% discount.\n\nThe stall was seated at the far end inside, there are a good wide spread of ingredients to choose from. I picked quite a few items and my plate weighed heavy. Noodle cost $1 each, compared to other Mala selling at $2 each.\n\nRequested for medium spicy, less salt and less oil, waited for a while for our order. It smell so good, the pork belly was so tender and fresh. I love the fried beancurd skin and all types of mushrooms. Personally feel that medium spicy is not that spicy after all, just a bit mild and not that oily after all after requested. But still a little bit salty at the bottom.\n\nTotal cost me less than $20 for 2 pax after 10% discount. And I think it is really worth it!\n\nWeekend crowd as always  you will see long queues formed in most of the food stall. Luckily we managed to secure the dining seat easily. Ambience was overall similar to food hall. Food was reasonably priced though some maybe pricey. I ordered the chicken bimbimpap, it was ok in general.\n\nGood selection of food here.. use kopitiam app can get 10% discount.. clean environment. Most of the food was delicious.  Korean cuisine was below expectation.  Not nice\n\nI like dinning this foodcourt cause it has a wide range of asian food. And one of my new favorite is the newly opened Lechon Pinoy. They have the tastiest lechon I had tried by far here in Sg.\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4dI highly recommend!\n",

Went there for lunch with wifey as we wanted to grab some fresh meat at butchery. Ordered 2 soup to go along with our main. She ordered potato soup and onion soup for me. Before the soup arrived, we were served with their in house baguette and butter. It was so so good especially the butter. Main were served hot from kitchen, portions were good for the price and we left the bistro with our happy stomach. Wish they can offer ribeye in time to come. They were having Oktoberfest menu too. Do drop by! Will definitely return. Thank you\n\nHad an outdoor seating which was sooo hot. They gave a time limit of 1 hour but was happy to let us hang around if there wasn\u2019t too busy. Food wise was ok but nothing spectacular. Has a children\u2019s playground at the side so lots of family groups were there. would recommend the onion soup and creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e but sirloin was underwhelming. Great that it had lots of vegetables at the side.\n\nHad fresh onion soup that warmed us up . Thereafter we shared the mains of short rib and pork cordon blue .\n\nThe short rib served tender w mixed flavour between savoury meat and sweet caramelised onion, and tinge of horseradish . And pork cordon blue toughen up texture in breaded form and broaden the palate w some greens .\n\nEnjoy the meals as much as the shopping later .\n\nThis place have very good beer and western foods. I highly recommend as service are good and foods are excellent. Only downside are the outdoor seating only got small wall fans and the downlight are too strong and sharp make me felt warmer on a sunny day dinner. Last to mention that the portion are quite big.\n\nNice food!\nRevisited, food n service are great \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\nPlants in the garden were healthy, nice to have plant labels.\nAlso playground for kids while waiting for seats.\nSupermarket offers wide selection of meat, snacks, fresh vegetables etc!\n",

If you like lean meat, this is it.\n\nThe sauce of the braised meat is darker than usual, and it's perfect with rice! It was served in a metal bowl. And the empty bowl says it all...\n\nArrived at 1140 at Golden Mile Food Centre and decided to try this stall. I was quite lucky I was the 2nd customer it seems and there was no queue and didn't even need to take a number. The moment I sat down and started eating and queues started forming and there were like at least 10 people waiting.\nA little confused initially not sure what to order, wanted to order the pork cheek but was already sold out, not sure if it was really sold out or not prepared for the day.\nWas confused about the set and ala carte. Didn't really knew how it works but was told if I were to order the set it would have the rice and pork and a piece of everything of the sides. The ala carte is the additional sides that you want to add on to the meal.\nI had the pork shank set and was so surprised it was only 4.50! And the portion was quite generous that they gave quite a lot of rice which I couldn't finish. It was also a good tasting bowl to try the different sides. What I loved most about the dish was the thick gluey sauce which was so tasty.\nAll in all it was cheap and good and I seriously have no complaints except for a slight disappointment. I expected the Ajitsuke egg to have slightly runny yolk but this yolk was almost completely cooked.\n\nI was a little hesitant to join the long line, but I'm glad I did. The store was only staffed by two people, but the line moved fast. I tried the braised pork belly bowl and it was great. The meat was tender and flavorful. With fungus, egg, and mushroom, it's a delicious combination.\n\nI had the braised pork cheek bowl (S$8.50) which was really good. The meat was tender, the portion generous and the greens were fresh and crunchy.\n\nHidden gem serving Taiwanese style braised pork rice. Personal favorite being the braised pork cheek rice set with tender melt-in-your-mouth pork accompanied by soft boiled egg, braised toufu and vegetables. The sweet /sour not too spicy chili sauce balances the thick braise gravy accentuating the tender pork. Go early as the popular pork cheek set may sell out.\n",

This hawker centre is almost 50 years old in 2 years time and the ventilation in most of the older hawker centres is pretty bad as the ceilings are low, only those built in the last 10 years are much cooler with higher ceilings so that gigantic, power fans can be fixed to cool down the place in hot and humid Singapore.

It was inscribed on UNESCO representative list of The Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2020 that serves as a testament to Singapore's hawker culture. Singapore is as cosmopolitan as it can be like New York, the Big Apple \ud83c\udf4e of Asia and the Switzerland of Asia in the financial arena !!! Singapore has to be the cosmopolitan metropolis that it is because of its small size, a red dot on the world map reference by the many and with no natural resources for its survival !!!\n\nMy first visit yesterday and I\u2019m in love with the middle eastern food there especially the Turkish Food Stall. I ordered Chicken Kebab Roll ($6) and Chicken Kebab with Butter Rice ($8) and their homemade Baklava (8pcs for $20). My hubby ordered Biryani with Lamb Shank ($10) from Nasi Arab. My youngest girl ordered Fried Kway Teow with Chye Sim ($4.50) from stall #01-91.\n\nWe ordered some vadai and Nyonya kueh to share after lunch. We also ordered Iced Lemon Tea and Iced Milo.\n\nRating for food and drinks: 5/5\n\nWe will definitely return to eat other food like the fried Hokkien prawn noodles, Braised pork rice, boneless chicken rice, steamed pork dumplings, western food and Muslim food.\n\nI am currently enjoying my 10th visit to Singapore and this place may be my favourite Hawker Centre.  I discovered it on my 3rd visit and have been coming here since.  I have a double lunch when I\u2019m here; a $5 bowl of beef noodles and a $3.50 Hainanese Chicken Rice set - $3.50!!!  Plus I always grab myself 2 pineapple & orange juices, 1 when I arrive and 1 when I leave.  $15.50 for all of that.\n\nVery popular local food center with a wide variety of Asian and Western cuisine. The queues can be long, but definitely worth it. The top level is a bunch of reasonably priced military surplus and sew shops. Try the Lor Mee at 02-86!\n",

Clean restaurant with ample of seats.\n\nWe got the cereal fried rice and kway teow goreng (spicy). Price range is about $6.60 for the usual goreng dishes whereas anything abit special would be $1 extra. Honestly, a fair deal for a place with aircon and in a mall establishment. Generous portions\n\nWould come and get more dishes next time!\n\nI'm not for wet mee goreng and what I ordered came wet.  Unpeeled cooked prawns are a no no for an al carte restaurant. Not taking the extra effort.\n\nExtreme disappointment with the quality of the food. Unsatisfied by the tasteless dishes and overly salty omelette that I received.\n\nWe ordered seven dishes from your restaurant, which came to a total cost of $96.12. However, upon receiving my food, I was immediately struck by how bland and unappetising everything looked. Each one was seriously lacking in flavour, and I found myself struggling to finish even a single serving.\n\nTo make matters worse, the omelette that I ordered was incredibly salty, to the point where it was almost inedible. The fried fritters turns out to be frozen fish and tempura with fried chicken instead calamari. The fried rice is dry, bland and has zero fragrance. The tanghoon is awfully bland as though there isn\u2019t pinch of salt in it. Furthermore, we ordered this as a form of  Hari Raya celebration but the food turns out to be terrible.\n\nAs a paying customer, I expect a certain level of quality and care when it comes to the food that I receive. Unfortunately, this was not the case. I was deeply disappointed by the lack of attention to detail and the overall poor quality of the dishes I received.\n\nI hope that you take this feedback seriously and work to improve the quality of your food and the overall dining experience that you offer.\n\nTerrible. Came afew times and service is really bad. Came early all the time, but with sufficient staffs and no other customers at that timing, their food still take forever to serve because they do not check their orders, we had to remind them every single time. The food was not bad the first few times. However, it just got worst time over time. Today the chicken chop turn out to be  breast meat, really dry and tough to bite. They add alot of garlic butter in the mushroom soup and its very disgusting as there are so much oil in every scoop and when it turn cold the amount of oil harden at the top. Took afew pictures from today's meal at Yassin Kampung, to share in some review.\n",

Do get ready for a huge crowd when you are there during lunch or dinner time, but it\u2019s just how a hawker Center is after all.\n\nEnjoy the food here!\n\nThere are plenty of food options in Admiralty kampung. When I went there today to purchase dim sum, the queue was extremely long and the staff were using mental calculations instead of a calculator. As a result, they ended up miscounting the money, resulting in me paying extra to the stall. The service was unsatisfactory.\n\nThe food wasn\u2019t fully cooked too.\n\nLove \u2764\ufe0f the food variety and the vibrancy here!\nNon stop traffic and the price of food here is \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\n\nToo bad I was in a rush to grab my coffee, else I m going to try all the food from here!\n\nMany stalls having long queues, drinks stall especially!\n\nHeard that the stallholders here have not been changed much since it\u2019s opening.

Just next to Admiralty MRT.\n\nVariety of foods and drinks. From Chinese, Malay, Indian, Thai and many more. There are Bakery , fruit stalls, fried banana, vegetarian and etc.\n\nThe yong tofu we ordered are made to order. Fried or soup. We ordered fried with mixed of Vegi and tofu.\n\nOrdered the mala and green pepper grilled fish from \u4e09\u4e49\u8ed2\n\nPayment could be cashless too, convenient\n\nNearby here have wet and dry market and also Prime supermarket\n\nWORST HAWKER CENTRE IN SINGAPORE! Auntie cleaner is crazy and rude!!!!! She pushed her cleaning cart into a narrow space between my son's chair and another chair. She didn't even politely asked if he could move his chair in. She just pushed her cart till it touched my son's chair and expected him to move his chair in! Which he did! But unfortunately her cart was too near his chair which in turn made her cups on her cart fall down. But the design of the chair was terrible! It can even be moved properly and the legs of the chair bents out! And why must she stack her cups so high! In the end the crazy auntie cleaner scolded him in Chinese she said: Can't you move your chair inner!!!!!! She was so rude and dared to scold him when she was the one at fault for pushing her cart so near my son's chair! Can't she just ask politely! She deserves to be fired! How can NTUC Foodfare, a government organisation be so lousy at hiring staff!!! Insane! NTUC CAN'T YOU DO YOUR JOB PROPERLY! Auntie, doesn't mean you're a senior you can treat others badly! Treat others with respect! Don't think you're the top of the world!\n",

The portion is the smaller side.\n\nThis stall been there since the hawker centre started. At first the CTK still decent but standard drop not long and it become one of the worst CTK I ever eaten, give it a try recently but it still sucks.  Highly not recommend.\n\n$3 fried kuay tiao portion so less. Few mouth and gone. Might as well sell $4 and remove $3. Requested no cockles but still put. Not buying here again. Not recommended.\n\nOrdering is pretty fuss-free here and there are multiple options by paying through digital wallet. The receipt has your queue number and you wait for the number to be shown on their display. I had a mix of both white and black carrot cake ($4). I thought that their black carrot cake had a lot more taste and flavour of the wok. The white carrot cake on the other hand was average, and the only good thing about it was that it was crispy.\n\nGet the yuan yang. The white one is eggy and the black one is sweet and savoury.

Not too crowd in the morning to have Mee sua as breakfast.\n\nHearty portion of mee sua at 5$\nLight and clean soup so suitable for piping hot soup for breakfast or lunch\nSoup flows in my blood so this bowl speaks to my soul\n\nMee Sua comes with pig liver but I slways change it to lean pork slices but its great taste is not altered. Its taste reminds me of Mee Sua in soup cooked for me by my mum, her mum or her sister as a comfort food when I had had measles or fever or they cooked it on weekends to take a break from the rice staple. To me, a taste that reminds me if my loved ones and their love each time i patronised the stall. Thumbs up!\n\nTotally worth the price. $5 for soup mee sua and the soup is power much! Love the handmade meatballs and the lean meat is marinated too! I believe they added huadiaojiu to the soup and the fried ginger level up the soup.\n\nWill be back to try more of their other noodles.\n\nHERE: 3x\n\n\u518d\u6765\u963f\u5af2\u9762\u7ebf. Chye Lye Ah Ma Mee sua, S$4. Wanted to eat the famous J99 ban mian in this coffeeshop after my swim. It is opposite Toa Payoh swimming complex. Unfortunately my favorite ban mian stall is not open on Sunday. Hence I tried this Chye Lye Ah Ma Mee Sua it is pretty good, especially when I feel hungry and cold after swimming. I think food tastes extra good after having a swim. \ud83d\ude0b\n,.\nThe ah ma meesua is yummy, they drizzle hua tiao wine into it, with fried ginger and chives this makes a hearty warm meal. \ud83d\ude0b\ud83d\udc4d I asked for extra fried ginger. The minced Pork ball is tastily marinated. The stew mushroom is also flavorful and quite soft.

                  "reviews": "\n\nFood was quite alright - I ordered the Nasi Lemak Set B and it tasted just fine, but coffee was a little lacklustre.\n\nThe staff was quite friendly but it's mostly the decor and atmosphere that hooked me up.\n\nNestled in a shophouse opposite SINDA, the view of the trees and street brings me back to my childhood in the 80s, something which vintage decor alone cannot provide.\n\nI'd also appreciate the ample parking spaces available and quiet neighborhood. It wouldn't be the same if they weren't nestled here.\n\nA charming nasi padang place in an equally charming neighborhood, complete with a handsome silkie chook freely roaming the premises. I chanced upon this place while exploring the area seeking breakfast and it felt like i was transported back to old kampung days.\n\nA good thing about coming early is that the curries and padang dishes are all piping hot. The food was all right, not very spicy (might not appease hardcore sambal lovers) - was happy to find sayur manis lemak here.\n\nWhat i loved best was the laid back vibe, and the friendly staff who served up the warm nosh with warm smiles. Refreshingly un-Singaporeanesque.\n\nServers are really friendly and food is amazing. Love the choice of 3 types of chilli sauces. Price is reasonable as well. Premise is well ventilated and clean.\n\nThe coffee shop, decor, location, car park and even a resident chicken makes this place a great idea.. but it's more than a great idea now that I've tried it (maybe I was hungry and enjoyed the food a tad more).\n\nI think their dishes are not very spicy which is a nice change (from all the mala).. they were nicely executed, taste, texture and all. And by today's standard, $12.50 for this is not exorbitant (compared to some nasi padang at Geylang Serai).\n\nGreat place for Nasi Padang , easy to find parking. Came after lunch so I guess most of the items were sold out. Would definitely come again\n",

We had the egg, plain, Ondeh-Ondeh and Kaya with a side dip of Ikan bilis sambal. Very nice!\n\nThey have other food too: thosai, bryani, etc. Worth a try if you are in the area!\n\nWent there because of the good review. But I really don't know what's so special about this stall.\n1. Dirty utensils, have to dig and find those slightly better ones.\n2. Dirty dining area. Prolly school holiday, u have to tahan sitting on dusty seats. Wet tables due to rain.\n3. Because the whole place is empty and this stall is the only one that's open. U could clearly hear what's going on in the kitchen. All I'm hearing is the microwave sound every other min.\n4. I thought only if u take away, it would not be crispy. But I was wrong. Even if u eat there, it's the same.\n5. Had the ondeh ondeh, the palm sugar tasted sour.\n6. Worst of all, the price shown on the signboard is student rate. And when I told the lady that I'm a student. The reply that I get is. Sorry, key in already, cannot change. Win liao loh. $4.50 for a so-so appam only.\n\nI ordered the nasi lemak appam and ondeh ondeh appam. To be honest, u should just go have the real nasi lemak instead.\n\nMy overall review. Not deserving a second visit.\n\nAppam is quite ok. To be fair, we didn\u2019t try the special ones. Just did the plain. The appam is lacking in flavour but the texture is good (nice springy taste). Price is on the high side ($2.50 for one plain).\nThe foodcourt is clean and airy.\n\nNeed to be patient once order, because each and every appam is made upon order (including those in food delivery order). But it\u2019s worth the wait. Had the egg appam & plain appam. It\u2019s so fluffy in the center and it\u2019s amazingly well cook in the center. It\u2019s not oily nor greasy. Next time can try other modern combinations.\nTake note: They only have takeaway after 6:30pm to close 7:30pm.\n\nIs really nice if you eat at the shop.  They should improvise their packaging. This is definitely a good packaging but is doesn't help to maintain the crispiness. Should try using paper container. That would help slightly.  Just like those waffle shop.\n",

Soup is yummy as it has the prawn sweetness, prawns consider fresh & fish meat is soft. You may need to wait quite awhile if it\u2019s during lunch or dinner time.\n\nThis place has variety of food. Prices are reasonable $4-5. Tried the dry chilli pan mian and was good. Uncle would knead the dough and Aunty roll the dough on d spot to make individual bowl of ban mian. The dry ban mian cost $4 was good. The mkt  has soya bean stall selling refreshing soya bean. A bit stuffy if seated inside but the good food comprises the environment, charge for use of toilet. Toilet could be improved-wet floor.\n\nLots of good food but also lots of stalls closed by afternoon. I frequently go Kitchen carrot cake and Lai Hua Fishball noodles.\n\nSunday is a good day see the buzz of the lively food centre and stores.  It's a good place to buy fresh fruits among the stores and makeshift stalls selling durians. I bought $50 worth of fruits, excluding durains. Queues were long among several popular hawker stalls.  There's also the well known bah kuteh stall at the coffeeshop.\n\nSome of the hawkers like to put their stuff on the table near their stall especially under the fans and chope place there. This makes it difficult for customers patronizing other stalls to find seats or to be sitted under cooler table as the place is deem stuffy especially in the day time.\n\nCan still get $3 per plate of nice \ud83d\ude0b chicken rice at Yong Seng chicken & duck rice stall. Uncle (though he isn't the stall owner) despite having to pay rent, said that there's alot of elderlies in this area hence he was selling at $2 per plate of chicken rice. Price went up to $3 about just a year ago, probably due to high rental bah. Other places you may probably get $3.50 per plate or higher amount.\n\nCoffee at Jing Loong \u91d1\u9f99 is great , so used to drinking their Kopi  O Gao which is $1 per glass, \ud83d\udc4d but have to be make by the boss ie atthe stall facing the shops.\n",

The soup is simply prawny soup. Trying first time but dun think will be a repeat customer\n\nTried other seafood soup but i must say Yan Ji Seafood soup is the best.\n\nOrdered the $9.50 seafood soup and it was filling enough for me. But if you\u2019re a big eater you should definitely go for the $11.50 one.\n\nWould come back to try the crayfish and red grouper the next time.\n\nThe quality and portion has dropped tremendously. Look at the portion size, especially the soup given for the $9.50 basic portion! Soup is also just salty now. Best to boycott such black shops who constantly raise prices, shrink portions and compromise on quality.\n\nConfronted the stall owner about portion size and he mumbled some nonsense about his soup being about \"taste\" which is total nonsense! He reluctantly gave a few more spoonfuls of soup - never ever again.\n\nA honest and personal review on this.\n\nOrdered Clayfish Seafood Soup, $13.50, because of the price (I think), the portion is generous, it got clayfish, minced meats, dory fish, prawn and some sliced tomatoes.\n\nMaybe because of the minced meats given, a huge portion, almost filled whole the bowl, there is not much of the \u201cseafood\u201d taste in the soup. The food tastes more than mixed pork soup, \u732a\u6742\u6c64. The sweetness came from the pork instead of seafood.\n\nIf you are looking for a food portion that worth for the price, this is the right place.\n\nPaying $9.50 for a pathetic medium size if seafood soup, charging me additional 50 cents for a takesway bowl that pack almost nothing in that bowl! Feedback on the spot but worker say that more soup will ruin the taste, what a \u201csplendid\u201d excuse. Not patronising it ever again!\n",

However, we were a bit disappointed when the service person provided us with a menu that seemed incomplete. Drinks like coconut and canned drinks were not listed on the menu, which left us wondering about the full range of beverage options available.\n\nDespite the initial confusion with the menu, we were pleased to discover that the restaurant accepted both e-payment and cash payment methods, making it convenient for all of us to settle the bill.\n\nAs for the food, we ordered a selection of dishes from different cuisines. To our delight, the taste of the dishes was quite decent, and we found the overall spiciness level to be manageable, as it was not overly spicy. The variety of flavors from the different cuisines added an exciting twist to our dining experience, and we appreciated the diverse range of dishes available.\n\nOverall, while the incomplete menu and missing drink options were a minor setback, the positive dining experience, delicious dishes, and the option for various cuisines made the dinner gathering enjoyable. We would consider visiting again in the future to explore more of the restaurant's offerings and perhaps inquire about their full drink menu.\n\nChance upon this eating house on the way back from JB. Amazing food! Nothing is not nice about this place! Opens till 2am, best place for indian muslim supper. Their mee goreng mamak is one of the best eaten so far, hard to get a place that serve mee goreng merah the correct way and taste. Beef soup was flavourful too and peppery, chicken rice is nice too. Will come again to try their kambing soup!\n\nQuite amazed on their cooking speed too, the place was rather full yet all the food came within 15mins. Staff are also friendly, only downside is the parking.\n\nLots of varieties here, choices of food will make u drool \ud83e\udd24, servers and waiters all are good and prompt, price wise is ok but not your regular typical coffee shop. Place is big and can cater combined tables to supply for a larger quantity of customers for dinner gatherings.

Absolutely blown away by the hearty and delicious food. Not to mdntion the realllly affordable prices! Would definitely come here again because oh my god beats al amaan and other places by a MILE!\n\nButter chicken is ridiculously creamy and buttery for just $7! Thick chunks of chicken coated in gooey curry. SSo yummy! The garlic naan wasn't as garlicky as I liked but still a good complement!\n\nWe also got their palak paneer which is more... unconventional. Thick green spinach curry which is less creamy and has cottage cheese curds! Interesting taste, though I prefer their classic butter chicken.\n\nTheir roti prata is on the softer side, not crunchy you you won't get sick of chewing. It was soft and fluffy, a little floury. Tasty!\n\nOne of the best Mamak food in the North.\n\nTom Yam very tasty and spicy\nChz naan very soft\nBeef Kwey Teow also very tasty.\n",

There are some stalls here that deserve a look at if you\u2019re in the area but I wouldn\u2019t go out of my way just to eat here.\n\nThe wanton mee stall always has a long queue. People mainly order the wanton mee or the lor mee but it also sells fried chicken noodles. Got the wanton mee at $4.50. The portion of noodles is not a lot , good amount of char siew (not fatty or chewy) and a small piece of fried wanton. It also comes with a bowl of soup with 2 small dumplings.\nThe coffee stall sells not too bad coffee and soft boiled eggs which are nicely cracked into a bowl for you. The Kaya toast could have been crispier (in comparison with Ya Kun).\nNot easy to find a cool table on a Sunday morning. Quite a crowd here. There are quite a variety of foods here.

I liked how they used the traditional brown bread though number of butter slices was inconsistent.\n\nEggs: Yolks were soft and creamy \ud83c\udf73\n\nOverall, my dad preferred this to Ya Kun due to its affordability and decent quality!! There\u2019s always a queue at this stall despite a few other stalls selling kaya toasts in the same hawker centre, and I can now see why after trying \ud83d\ude0b\n\nFollow @iloafbready Instagram for more food reviews! :)\n\nGood variety of food choices, I like the 'Bukit Panjang Dessert's ching teng and bobochacha.\n\nGood Lao huo tang as well.\n\nSome of the hawkers like to put their stuff on the table near their stall especially under the fans and chope place there. This makes it difficult for customers patronizing other stalls to find seats or to be sitted under cooler table as the place is deem stuffy especially in the day time.\n\nThe pig organ soup, pig liver, pig stomach soup are fresh and taste sourish nice \ud83d\ude0b at Fu Qiang pig organ soup stall. Coffee O is strong enough at Yinle hot & cold beverages. The hot & cold desserts \ud83d\ude0b at the stall operate by an old uncle & auntie near to the escalator nearer to woodlands stadium.\n\nAttach photo shows the hawker stall owner's stuff on the table under 2 wall fans ):  Seemingly people think that someone has choped the seat, but it's the stall owner 's stuff when we inquired about it being there for more than an hour. We went to Sheng Siong supermarket after our meal and back in about an hour's time yet the stuff are still there ): this no good especially that these are the 2 walls fans in that row of stalls and there's no other cooler place for customers to sit and have their meals.\n",

They originated from old woodlands interchange which has been demolished. Looked for them for years and found him at Marsiling Mall. You should try this chappatti and kheema before you die. I never give 5 star rating unless as nobody's perfect. The chappatti bread is also soft and has the powdery floor which makes its taste unique. Not oily and healthy. Kheema is quite oily but you don't eat it everyday!! Lol.\n\nVisited this place multiple times. One of the best chapati and kheema in the north! Don\u2019t need to travel down to CENTRAL just to have Azmi (Norris Rd) cause this place have awesome chapati as well.\n\nTried more than 7 and this is by far the best mutton briyani in woodlands.\nRice is well cooked and fragrant, mutton so falls off the bone tender, curry just the right consistency and spiciness.\n\nBhai's rice has singular grains that is both fragrant and well spiced. The keema w/ chapati is second only to Norris road's. Full piece of chicken thigh and drumstick for a flat fee. This guy is the Briyani king \ud83d\udc51 of woodlands.\n",

Definitely recommend the the crispy taupok and rojak as well.\n\nI learnt that they are a third generation hawker in Singapore from the owner too! Definitely check them out - and support local hawker talents while enjoying a great satay experience in the north.\n\nObserved the satay meat shrished this time as we ordered regularly when we are there.

Everything was flavourful, juicy, and with just the right texture. We had the Lamb Mandi, Chicken Quesadillas, and Kunafe - all were amazing. Portion sizes were HUGE too. Highly recommended.\n\nThis is an amazing kebab place. Everything is delicious and real deal. They just opened Arabica Grill just behind this outlet and it's equally amazing. If you are in mood of good Arabic food, no better place in Woodlands than this.\n\nOrdered via grab food and its so goood. My lamb mandi was still warm when it arrived.  The lamb shank was super tender and juicyyyy!!! First time to try knafeh and its was so yummy too, crispy outside but soft cheese inside \ud83d\udcaf Will try the quesadillas next time as I\u2019ve been reading a lot of positive reviews on it. \ud83e\udd24\n\nOrdered the Kofta Mutton. Very juicy and tender. Even better than well know restaurants. They might be located in a coffee shop but the food is great.\n\nAte the mixed kebab and i must say that it is the best kebab i have ever eaten in my life. Had this quite a while back (~3 months ago), and i think about eating this every now and then! The meats are so juicy and tender, moisture is locked into the meats unlike some other kebabs sold by other stalls that have dry, stringy meat. Seasoning is so good as well. Will definitely come back here again to try their other dishes\n",

Roast pork\u2019s got the coveted crispy brittle skin (wish there was more!) but char siew is just average. Food wise 3/5. Extra star for friendly service.\n\nVisited this popular roast meat joint in the west, they are in a hawker centre inside Marsiling mall. They occupied 2 stalls inside the hawker centre. Each stall is selling rice and noodles respectively, therefore need to join the correct queue. If you are facing the stall, the left stall is for noodle.\n\nNoodle starts from SGD$3.50 onwards. Other than the wanton noodle, they also serve chicken feet, braised mushroom noodles. First impression, portion was quite small. Noodle was nicely cooked, but the sauce tasted a little too salty for my liking. The star of the dish must be their charsiew, which was really good in my opinion.\n\nDo expect some waiting as the queue was pretty long when I was there.\n\nHighly recommended Hong Kong styled roast meat. They have the usual char siew, roast pork, roast duck. You can either order it with noodles or nice. Note that there is two different queues for noodles and rice. I would recommend to order the wonton noodles ($3.50) and you can add additional types of meat to it. The char siew is a juicy and has a nice BBQ smokiness mixwd with sweetness  to it. Note have a fixed days of the week for closing.\n\nMaybe that day my luck is down. Got only little portion of Char Siew. Well they only have White rice and No oil rice. Taste is AVERAGE.\n\nUpdate 2021 January\nStars increase to 4 Stars :-)\nWell i order 1 Char Siew Noodle and by the time i reach home it was still delicious...\n\nThe crispy pork is very good. Every time I came must order. The char siew is ok for me. A little bit too sweet for me. Still quite ok. Duck drum stick is also delicious. However my preference is still crispy pork in fu shi. This plate duck and 2 kind of pork should be 14 SGD around. The other 2 pictures for crispy pork , each plate is 10SGD\n",

It\u2019s no wonder that we queue for close to half an hour for it\u2019s wonderful prawn noodles!\n\nWas recommended to try this prawn noodles stall.\nNoodles are well cooked. Soup definitely tasty and aromatic. Generous amount of ingredients at a reasonable price. They give pork belly meat instead of the usual lean meat. They also provide red chilli powder and pork lard too.\nBe prepared to queue for it. I waited at least 20 plus minutes. Try go early, heard they can sold out in 3hrs.\nHighly recommended.\n\nThe stall opens at 7:30am., but the line begins earlier and always sold out around 10:30am. Don't expect the same flavor as Malaysia's Penang Prawn Noodle, but it's still tasty. The small packet costs S$3.50, while the large one costs S$4.00.\n\n10 years ago this stall offers dried prawn noodle version. Can\u2019t describe to you how delicious the dried version was. The scallion oil and the abalone sauce such great combination and freshness of the prawn. The soup version is good but definitely can\u2019t beat the dried version. The stall doesn\u2019t offer the dried version anymore which is such a shame. The taste is just going to disappear like that. Maybe abalone sauce cost is too pricey to make a profit? The quene is still long for the die hard followers who loves the soup version. The soup I bet has a lot of MSG because it taste good and sweet too. They do use pork in their soup base. The noodle usually sell out fast on weekends and usually by noon they will close up. The other amazing thing about this stall is they will place a box of tissue and I notice customers who don\u2019t have the habit of bringing their tissue or handky will usually help themselves to it after their meal. Marsiling court is located near the elderly estate and more elderly people frequent there. There is a multi carpark which is only 5 mins walk to the hawker center and wet market the other open carpark is usually full most of the time.\n\nWonder why there's a long queue.  Wait 30mins for a MSG soup prawn noodles. The prawns served are not fresh at all. Anyone keen on MSG this is the place to be.\n",

Many of the stalls that were from the Woodlands Checkpoint area moved here after that place closed down. Tried the Yan Ji Seafood Stall seafood soup and the sesame chicken + yam rice from the bak kut teh stall beside.\n\nSeafood soup was decent but had higher expectations because of the hype. It's also available on grabfood. The sesame chicken was so-so and the yam rice was unfortunately not as fragrant as I hoped it would be. Also had the bubble milk tea from Long Hua Cafe (first row of stalls, nearer to the mrt tracks). The white pearl was good.\n\nOverall, good experience. Nice place to try local food. While the place was hot, there were many huge fans around and the heat was bearable even on a hot day.\n\nPS: Return your tray for a 50 cents refund. Remember not to mix halal and non-halal food and take out the glass/porcelain items from your tray before you drop it off at the tray return stations situated around the hawker centre.\n\nit has good food served here! recommended chee cheong fun! cheng tng! lei cha! and the seafood soup!\n\nHawker shifted from old Woodlands Interchange.1st day of business 15/12/17. Soup is nice. Waiting for my favourite herbal soup stall (front row), which I came all e way from South, to start business in a week's time.\n\nIt is also known as Marsiling Mall Hawker Centre. Unexpectedly crowded during lunch & dinner hours. With patrons of all walks of lives, may it be working personnel, families or students, who flock there for their favourite ethnic dishes. Pretty good variety of food of affordable prices. Also a breezy, cool & relaxing environment to dine. Even just having a cup of afternoon tea with friends can make you feel great!\n\nNewly opened food centre. Huge with high ceiling.  Plenty of delicious food options here.  Must try!\n",

Food is served fast and portion is big. Overall worth the visit\n\nCitrus by the Pool made my girlfriend's birthday celebration truly unforgettable! The staff was friendly and attentive, creating a warm and cozy ambiance. The food was delicious, bursting with flavors that delighted our taste buds. Their drinks were also fantastic! The exceptional service ensured we had a fantastic night. A big thank you to Citrus by the Pool for a wonderful experience!

Optional sauce both are great but not needed imo. Chili is definitely spicy.\n\nSoup. Sweet gaming and I think full of msg. Is nice lah but makes u thirsty.\n\nMeh\nTripe. While expected to be chewy, the cut is too thick causing it to be rubbery. Taste is still go but could have been better if slice is slimmer.\n\nOrder beef ball and beef soup, the beefball and the beef taste good but the soup taste was bellow expectation. Overall it\u2019s an ok experience.\n\nI ordered the beef, tendon with thick bee hoon soup. The noodles was smooth, beef very tender and the soup was delicious, not too saltish. See my photo, you will know what I mean.\n\nMala beef noodle 5 stars for u!Nvr scrimp on ingredients and super flavourful.Recommended\n\nHad both the soup and dried version of beef noodles.The beef and tendon is on the tough and chewy side.The chilli sauce is just like chicken rice I prefer the other sauce that is sour and spicy.The beef soup is rich but dk why taste abit like kambing\n",

I am very disappointing at the customer service.\n\nQuite disappointed with the food this round at causeway point. I'm a person with strong taste buds hence I find the garlic bread was too salty to my liking. And the pasta seems to be overcooked with wok hei taste. Please review the food and I hope u can improve the quality of the food.\n\nThis is halal restaurant. Not recommended to a heavy taste person. The price is cheap compared to nearby restaurants.\n\nTableware is very dirty. Verrrrrrry dirty. Verrrrrrrrrrry dirty. Important thing need to say three times. Need to improve your tableware.\n\nCheddar cheese sticks and Mushrooms soup so so only.\n\nYou can try Cheesy crumble chicken bacon spaghetti. It's very Cheesy.\n\nSpicy chicken spaghetti tastes like water spaghetti. I do not recommend you order this.\n\nNo service charge because almost all is self-service. The price is below average compared to others. Paid after you order from the website.\n\nWe\u2019re a frequent diner here with my husband, always feel disappointed with the service if not the service it\u2019s the food quality, today early  afternoon we ordered the bacon cheesy crumble the crumble was very chao ta it tasted burn and dark color the sauce was very little it alrdy requested to add more sauce but upon serving still the same very dry, the bacon was not really crisp cook, I ordered a calzone pizza but when the staff served is the same like normal pizza not calzone and the crust is burn also the taste was very bland\n\nAre you kidding me on the portion?\nWas ordered this on GRAB, left is the regular size and the right is the upsize. I am a regular customer for about 5 years and so I know that this is not the right portion it should be.\n\nYears ago the regular size was the upsize now, and the upsize can even filled up the container. This is not the first time that the portion is being lesser, but it\u2019s still acceptable. This time round, it\u2019s really so less until clearly not enough for my stomach\u2026\n\nI paid more than years ago, and got lesser. What a disappointment.\n",

And you get the mega sugarcane 700ml not including ice for just $2.20 at Lim Chun Heng Hot & Cold Drink!\n\nInside market very narrow.. making walking difficult with things in hand. Fish reasonable priced. Mutton very expensive. Limited halal meat stalls. Beef reasonable. many vegetables stalls so can pick variety of veggies. Cautious, wear non slippery foot wear. Floor very slippery and wet, especially around fish stalls\n\nNot as crowded as before. Typically HDB heartland environment. Nice food though. Can buy almost any ingredients for cooking back at home.\nNo need to wear masks now. But most people still wearing. This is probably the most comprehensive wet market in the north of Singapore. You have to wake up early and go there to get fresh foods before they got sold out by the never ending morning crowds.\n\nNo change so far.\n\nMy go to place every week for buying chicken, fish, shrimps and fruits as they come at quite a good rate compared to other markets like Sheng Siong. It also has all sorts of veggies and fruit stalls alongside the whole market place for your all needs.\nIt also has various stalls serving cooked food items, but have not tried any yet as the place is usually crowded.\n\nWet Market wonders! Go native and break out the slippers or rain boots. Nothing like a bargain hunt in this place. And when you get hungry, load up on some local delights.\n",

The only thing might expect waiting time as they deliver fresh one.\n\nWonderful place. Went to the new Superpets store on 2nd floor for some pet food. Visited shengsiong supermarket to get some groceries. The prices of many essential items have gone up. For example the price of two broccoli used to be $1.88, but now is going for $2.68. Similarly, the price of a pack of nuts containing a mix of cashew nuts and almonds nuts is now going for $5.45 when it used to be only $4.50. Inflation is real.

Always first choice to go for drinks with friends and Best part is Momos. In singapore no other restaurent serve this tasty momos.\n\nThe food was hearty and delicious, service was very good as well!\nOrdered masala tea, mango lassi, mutton briyani, steamed veg momo, fried chilli chicken momo, butter chicken, fish korma, gurkhali mutton (spelling might be wrong), garlic naan, cheese naan. Very filling for 4 pax. Every dish was good. Special mention to the fish korma and chilli momo.\n\nLovely little place in Little India away from the bustling street. The food is good especially love their grill lamb special. I would skip the butter chicken as it\u2019s a little on the sweet side. The dumplings are good although it do taste like Chinese dumplings. The lamb biryani is so flavourful! Will definitely come back\n\nIt was lunch time and today we decided to check out Gurkha Palace.\nOrdered Lassi, Chili momo,  Naan, Chicken tikka masala ,  mutton and chicken Biriyani.\nGood Service, Ambience is great.\nStaff is helpful, attentive and kind to offer suggestions.\nFood was served in reasonable time. First came the Mango Lassi. taste and flavour was a bit different. Not the flavour and smoothness as I would expect.\nChili Momo came the next and it was just super delicious. Well cooked, rich in flavour and slightly spicy. The texture was perfect. We loved this dish the most.\nNext the Naan and Chicken Tikka masala, Naan was thin and soft. It had good flavour. Chicken Tikka masala gravy was nice but a bit salty.\nLastly, the much awaited Biryani..  the rice had a good flavour but rice in  both mutton and chicken Biriyani tasted the same. The meat was well cooked but lacked the freshness. Seemed like the meat was cooked separate and added to Biryani Rice. Overall It's a different taste. Something different from the  usual Indian style Biryani.\nPortions were generous. Overall  it was not bad experience.\n\nFood was very good!\nI am surprised!\n\nIt is not pricey, very well cooked and clean.\n\nToilets should improve in cleaning but the people from the restaurant were very kind.\n\nI recommend to try out\n",

End up i throw away my mee soto as how the hell i gonna eat my mee soto w/o the gravy. Really messed up this guyss at harum manis\u2026\n\nOrdered via foodpanda. 4.6 rating on the app, but reality is as per google review. 2 stars or less.\nNasi lemak was almost like porridge texture, so soft, no taste of nasi lemak.\nSambal goreng is just like fried tahu with long beans, no tempe in sight. Its rendang, no meat. Food used to be nice. Not sure what's going on.\n\nAlways bought this from Harummanis. Food was delivered super fast and their Mee soto is nice and good.\n\nMeeSoto: Soup was good with also generous about of shredded chicken. It was light and nice!\n\nLontong: Lontong was good as well!\n\nNasi Lemak Chicken Wing: it was good! The chicken is slight marinated if I\u2019m not wrong\n\nWill definitely purchase again!\n\nI bought lontong in my order from foodpanda and other food too but funny part, no lontong gravy... Expect me to cook my own lontong gravy is it? Expensive nevermind, charge more for extras or separate chilli nevermind, then forgot my gravy.. Then for what i pay so expensive if my order incomplete? All foodpanda can do is to refund. Im not blaming foodpanda or the rider, they only take order and deliver.. The one to blame is the one preparing... And this is not first time simple mistake happen... Omg.. People want to eat good food also become no appetite to eat..\n\nThe foods gravies are diluted..its either too sweet or no taste at all..the lontong rice are hard..not to the standard (tasteless)as i expected ..\n",

Ordered via the counter, payment was by cash as debit/credit cards aren't accepted (other cashless payment methods are accepted though). Order came quickly after. Pratas were served piping hot and crispy. Sauce trays for the prata gravy could be a bit cleaner though. Overall a pleasant experience.\n\nFinally back here after a long while for a feast! \ud83c\udf7d\ufe0f Used to order their crispy masala thosai & red bean prata regularly when I was still in school~\n\n\ud83c\udf73 ThosaiMiyaki (*for meat-eaters only; $7.90)\n\nLaunched on 5 Aug, this creation continues Springleaf\u2019s tradition of launching one super innovative new dish every year \u2014 as part of their Ultimate Series\ud83d\udca1\n\nInspired by the Japanese okonomiyaki, this crispy thosai base was topped with shredded cabbage, sliced turkey ham & bonito flakes. The omni dad & mom enjoyed this!\n\n\ud83c\udf4b Yuzu Gula Soda\n\nTop up $2 to get this as a set with the ThosaiMiyaki. A nice balance of sweet, tangy & fizzy \u2014 feels like multiple worlds colliding into one \ud83d\udca5\n\n\ud83e\ude84 Magic Meatless Murtabak ($7.90)\n\nIncludes a medley of lentils, mushrooms, curry leaves, vegan mayo and mildly spicy korean sauce. Didn\u2019t really taste the curry leaves but appreciated the protein-rich pulses, juicy and umami mushrooms and creamy sauces! \ud83d\ude0b\n\n\ud83c\udf54 Vegan Impossible Murtaburger ($11.20)\n\nVery hearty burger-like creation, with two thick & chewy pieces of prata sandwiching lots of stretchy vegan cheese, impossible burger patties & sauce \ud83e\uddc0\ud83e\uded5\n\n\ud83e\udd5e Hi-Fibre Plain Prata ($1.70)\n\nInterestingly doesn\u2019t taste like it\u2019s high-fibre.

The Prata sugar is crispy, my girl loves it. I like the masala chicken and nasi biryani. The staff there is very friendly too.\n\nWe found a cockroach in our food!\n\nWe raised the complaint to the service crew and they offered to give us a replacement. But we're already grossed out about this as we are unable to eat anything here. The service crew suggested that it might have fallen from the ceiling. But it is dead already and one of its legs is chopped off as well. I cannot imagine it being from the ceiling as the leg would fall far away or it would be alive and walk off normally.\n\nI don't think I can eat outside for a while now\n\nOne of their smallest outlet with limited seats.\nSo there\u2019s a rule that you have to order first and they will assign table for you at the counter. However some idiots will just chop seat and then q to order. Previously they do have a sign saying the above rule. But now they took it down. Thus there\u2019s this constant confusion. I am happy for this rule but I hope that the staff can be consistent to tell the people off.\n\nToday they are kind of lack of staff as the plates were short and the orders took longer than usual.\n\nmaggie goreng which is overly salty.\n\nMy fav here is mozzarella cheese prata. 10/10\nPlain Prata is crunchy and nice.\n\nMilo dinasaur is in a small cup which I think they do not have enough cup. Kind of sad when it cost more than other drinks.\n",

                  "reviews": "\n\nHad dinner at the restaurant a couple weeks ago.  Ordered Roganjosh, chicken biryani, chicken tikka masala and garlic naan.\n\nThe taste of all the dishes was truly authentic and flavourful with all the aroma from the spices, but not overwhelming.  Love that the gravy was thick and the portions of chicken and lamb is also pretty good.  My favourite was the garlic naan, crispy and garlicky, it really went well with all that gravy.\n\nThe servers were polite,  helpful and prompt. The restaurant itself was also nice and cosy. Thoroughly enjoyed the dinner.  Only thing is that there is very limited (parallel) parking along the road. There is a small public carpark nearby, a short walk from the restaurant but it is pretty difficult to get a parking lot too during dinner hours. Parking aside, the food and ambience is really good, give it a try if in the vicinity.\n\nThe garlic naan was great. The paneer butter masala could be less sweet and have more Indian spices. The noodles could be cooked in a bigger fire. The mutton set was very nice.\n\nThe portion is reasonable for sharing. I enjoyed the Basmati rice which is perfectly steamed to bring out the nice fragrance and texture. The sauces are great to go with the rice and naan.\n\nMy friend takes me here to taste Nepalese foods. Wow ! It\u2019s super delicious and very tasty. Tea is the best ever I have tried in Singapore . Pretty similar to Burmese Tea . Will go back again definitely.\n\nWill nvr be coming this restaurant again. Had to remind them to provide the mint chutney which is typically served with the papad, $14.50 for chicken thali and you will only get 3 tiny pieces of meat which wasn't worth it. Bad incident of one waitress serving the thali in an abrupt way, can't even place the plate straight it was served slammed on the table slanted sideways. Gave feedback to the male manager, he asked me if I am from the industry also which I assumed he meant if I'm a waitress too? I think its rude to ask customers that type of question. Very unpleasant experience overall.\n",

This place has lots of bad ones but it was packed during my Sunday evening visit.\n\nAnyway, here's mine.\nStaff were friendly enough. Prices MUCH better than the two places nearby that are popular with expats. Especially for beer. And the Sunday specials are hard to beat for price. $9+for Thali. And the portion was very hefty. I think this place is popular for prices more than food.\n\nMy mutton tasted very familiarly western Chinese. I've lived in China for the past 4 years and there was definitely a Chinese spice going on. It wasn't bad at all. Just didn't taste northern Indian to me.\n\nOne of the thali side dishes was black beans and they were hardish like briefly boiled peanuts. Maybe that's the way they should be?\n\nVisited this place randomly for dinner and drinks. Happened to see as Nepal Cuisine, so wanted to give a try. Beer offers are good, food prices are fine, however, the taste of the food is below average. Staff is very friendly and courteous, Manager Jessie is taking care of the place very well. Food lags taste in terms of spice, chili and freshness.\n\nFood was delicious! The meat platter was a great choice, allowing us to try all the different flavors in one platter, though the green meat looked a little too \"radioactive\"! \ud83d\ude02 The ambience was just so-so.\n\nWhen we first entered, the waiter attended to us mentioned that waiting time for the food is about 30 minutes to 45 minutes.\n\nThe food came within 15 minutes, and is really delicious. They provided papadum and room temperature water. The service is alright and the food is amazing. Per person, average damage about $25+.\n\nI enjoyed their naan and one of the chicken dishes. Tasty, will return!\n\nAbsolutely wonderful Northern Indian and Nepal cuisine. Having spent many months in Northern India, I can say that this food is about as authentic as it gets. Service was great! The atmosphere is very generic. But the food is wonderful. I will be going back\n",

The claypot rice fragrant is released after mixing well with black sauce and oil. Portion wise not enough for 3 pax hence we have to order another small claypot rice.\n\n2) Pig organ soup ingredients portion not enough to justify the price of $7. The soup is not well cooked with the pig organ, resulting very artificial taste. Recommended to order the fish soup in the same coffee shop instead.\n\n3) vegetables overcooked.\n\n4) friendly onsite staff who helped us to look for a empty table outside coffee shop dining area\n\n5) able to accept CDC vouchers for payment\n\nThe taste of this Bak Kut Teh is far from some of the mediocre ones I've ever tasted. I won't try again.\n\nserves hokkien/ klang style bak kut teh, which is dark and herbally. pork ribs were tender. soup was flavourful. with options to add enoki mushrooms and meatball.\n\nhad the claypot chicken rice. loaded with lupchong/ wax sausages, salted fish and chicken.\n\nchilli is good. provides a nice umami kick, but not spicy.\n\nstaff is very friendly and welcoming.\n\nvery pleased. will return.\n\nNot recommending to visit this place any more. Seems to have a change in owner after the renovation. Firstly the portion of bkt has dropped to pathetic level and price has went up. Secondly, the soup is very bland and taste more like soya sauce/salty water, no longer taste as the previously proclaimed herbal soup bkt. Thirdly the service is also very bad, with the server just rushing for you to make order. Lastly the cutlery were also quite dirty. Sad to see this place has dropped its standard.\n\nAlways the best Bak Kut Teh (Herbal) option in Choa Chu Kang! Recently the coffee shop got renovated so ambience is slightly better than last time!\n\nReally thick and herbally soup, that is very flavourful. Standard has not dropped since my days in PJC (2013-2014). Food still as tasty!\n\nOptions to add enoki mushroom or meat balls available as well. For people who only eat pork ribs for their bak kut teh, do let the stall owners know. For organ lovers, their intestines are cleaned relatively qell and liver is nice as well!\n",

It's a great place to eat, and the area around it - 'Albert Court' is very interesting.\n\nCame here for a late night snack and some beer. While they were kind enough to accommodate my order despite the kitchen being closed, the cheese balls were still cold at the core. Beers are fresh and cheap tho. Would come again for that.\n\nWas given complimentary papadam which was really nice! The chicken briyani was fragrant and flavourful and was nice to have together with the palak paneer and garlic naan!\n\nThe staff was also very friendly and helpful!\n\nGood place to  eat indian and nepali food.\nPrice is reasonable .Staff are receptive on your request.

Tried the Thupka, the Jimbu butter chicken and the green tea. The owners take a lot of pride in the quality of their ingredients (I was told the Jimbu and green tea were imported from Nepal, and that the chef does not use any MSG, preservatives or artificial flavourings) and the care put into making the food fresh, and you can really taste the difference. They hence recommend eating in the restaurant vs takeaway.\n\nGreat experience to try out a different cuisine. Very friendly owner(?) who explained each dish to us when they knew we were first timers trying out mew things. Both variations of momo was delicious, so was the panner. Sad that bitter chicken was sold out by the time we got there for dinner. Definitely will come back again to try the butter chicken and thupka.\n\nWe came right as they opened to be able to get a seat but the place filled up fast. The owners tell you it takes up to 20 minutes for food to be prepared so take note. Momos are definitely what to go for, as well as the mushroom fry. The butter chicken is good but nothing too unique!\n\nSooo good! Small restaurant serving authentic Nepalese food. Highly recommend booking (or even ordering online) to avoid any disappointment, as it is an absolute gem. The crew is really nice and the food is delicious and perfectly priced.\nWe had both the veggie steamed momos and fried chicken momo with chili (SO good) and the mushroom set. Everything is cooked fresh and to perfection. Really enjoyed the massala tea too. Overall, amazing experience, only wished they had more space cause this is definitely a spot I\u2019d like to show to my friends.\n",

They even have a promotion but actually not really a promotion price. They just added their current meal bundle price just to look like a ($58) promotion. I walk out the restaurant not satisfied with what I paid. We ordered Ultra and Mega burger. The Ultra burger looks small in actual compared to their posters and in this photo. Don't be fooled by it.\n\nVisited swensens on a Saturday night in a group of 3. Went around 6+pm, managed to get a seat after waiting about 5min.\n\nOur waiter was patient and professional, took time to explain the perks of the swensens memberships and the vouchers we could use (nowadays the swensens memberships is quite rewarding but also quite complicated - requires the use of telegram). There was another waiter subsequently who was a bit rude when we asked for our banana split - literally didn't acknowledge us and just waved his hand at the kitchen and walked away.\n\nOrdered one pizza, one battered fish and chips and one meatballs to share. Came with 3 free drinks (topped up 1 dollar each to get special drinks), and a free banana split because of all our membership perks.\n\nTotal bill of 60 for quite a filling and value for money dinner. Thank you\n\nI remembered my first visit to this Swensen\u2019s outlet. As a kid, it was nothing short of an excellent experience. Staff was nice, my fish and chips classic was delicious, and my ice cream was nicely presented. That was in 1998.\n\n25 years on I still walk out from this branch a happy diner but no longer a kid. And I would absolutely change nothing about this restaurant.\n\nOverall, the food is ok. I have ordered a combo \"steak & chicken\", the steak somehow well prepared as per my order \"midium rare\", as some restaurant could still see bloody in the middle.\nFish & chip is ok, too. No special vs. others.\nSwensen's should be famous in their ice cream, but I'm not able to find the special of it. The milky cream is not as strong and a bit watery. Just hope could improve further.\n\nThe fish and chip is not up to standard. Batter too thick for my liking. Fish too bland.\n\nWorst of the worst is chicken in basket. The chicken is not fully cook. Is cold inside. Apparently the waitress just took it back to the kitchen, fry it and bring it back to me without any explanation or any apology.\n\nThats about it for my experience.\n",

There were intense wok-hey taste too! Besides the food, ordering process was easy too!\n\nDecent Hokkien Noodle. Feels like the noodles are freshly cooked upon order instead of warming up from precooked one like many stalls do.\n\nthis place won't survive for long, I've eaten better standards in coffee shops and hawker places. staff was not attentive at all, stood for a good 5mins before someone came to take our order. pig organ soup too much pepper and pork slices were paper thin ($15++), hokkien mee tasted so so only and the pork lard not crispy, don't think the prawn were fresh. sadly this place does not meet the standards, hawker centre cheaper and taste better, everything just overpriced here. ain't coming back.\n\nNot bad, but quite salty. Price is quite ok for the promo\u2026. Otherwise it\u2019s quite expensive for full price. Noodles are not piping hot despite being served on the spot, not sure why? Or wok fire not big enough\n",

Ordering was via scanning the QR code found on the table. Food and drinks came shortly after e-payment. Service was also quick and efficient, with staff members quick to clear empty plates. Only gripe was the tomato ketchup packets, which were quite oily and thus hard to peel open.\n\nAlways pack during dinner time, food serving is abit slow, would recommend their fiery chicken it\u2019s my fav order every time I dine in. Would not recommend to go for the all day breakfast which I did, scramble egg tasted sad. However their fiery chicken always make up for it, fries and wedges are given decent portion and crispy. Would recommend to dine in instead of takeaway.\n\nKind of slow in cooking the food. They do QR Code order n payment. No service charge\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\nFood is decent, not expensive. Double chicken can be share between Two.\n\nDo not eat here if you are used to a western quality steakhouse.\n\nBurger had absolutely zero seasoning or flavor.\n\nSalmon ad bland as can be.\n\nThey brought out my burger and almost 12 minutes later the salmon came out.\n\nI would avoid if here again and eat ramen next door.\n\nUsually a queue outside but for good reason... this place has killer steaks!\n\nOrdered a black pepper chicken and the Prime Ribeye (tip: Ask for black pepper sauce, really awesome flavour). Nice and chewy, juicy steak with the tender chicken. 2 sides per meal, with good variety so customize as you like. They have takeaways too.\n\nCosy ambience too, feels homely and warm\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb\n",

Ever since they had done the renovation and started using the machine to make their drinks, the quality of their drinks have dropped. I have ordered ice kopi and ice teh in the past week, and both drinks tasted more like sugary milk. I really do hope they improve their standards, before customers start heading over to Yakun.\n\nThe aunty at the cashier super rude. Show attitude. Bang the atm device and slam the receipt on the counter. Not the first time we encountered with her. Previous aunty was so much better, patience and helpful. Food and drinks are still good.. Have to face her first though.. \ud83d\ude44\n\nAverage place.\nFood is ok, served quickly. Eggs are not warm. They provide a plastic bowl for the eggs, instead of a traditional ceramic bowl. It's kind of weird for the eggs.\nPlace is slightly messy, a lot of boxes and cartons on the benches and chairs. Then you get these old folks blasting music or videos from their phones.\n",

The food is still on the salty (flavourful) side but I do enjoy the Claypot Rice Porridge with Seafood and Minced Chicken Ball.\n\nThe soup dishes which my friends order also taste overly flavourful, to me. I hope they don\u2019t have to drink lots of water after the meal. \ud83d\ude06 Oh, but I like the HK Carrot Cake with XO sauce. That scores another thumbs up from me. \ud83d\udc4d\n#tiramisooojiaks #jiakjiakjiak #sgfoodie #streatscafe #friedcarrotcake #claypotriceporridge #kimchisoup #halalfood #halalsg\n\nIt's a nice place but the food is not nice.\nFood is dry and tasteless. Even the sauces didn't add much taste.\nThe place is nice with high ceilings and nice decor. Service is average.\n\nThis \"hybrid\" cafe serves HK style dishes as well as local fare. They have a small selection of dim sum (I like their siew mai), small selection of \"Nasi Lemak\", small selection of local tze char dishes...you get the drift. When put together, however, it becomes quite a smorgasbord of choices.\nThe Nissin Soup Noodle is one of their more popular choices. It's like a more glamorous Maggie Mee, with 'liao' inside. The soup is tasty and overall it's yummy. And who doesn't love the oversized soup spoon that it's served in?\nThe Nasi Lemak - hmm. The Nasi is not Lemak, and the Acar serving is quite pitiful (nowhere near as shown in the menu picture). However, the fried chicken was great, and the prawns were fresh. And the sambal, while not the best I've had, was good enough.\nThe star of this cafe, to me, is it's ambience. Tucked away at the corner of the mall, it's 2 storey ceiling with glass windows one one side makes for a cosy and warm casual dining experience. Worth a visit. Or two.\n\nConsider A Moderate Halal Restaurant For Fusions I Would Say, Not Very Fantastic, But Can Be Consider Above Average Comparing w Some Few Other Fusion Cuisine Restaurants Out There... \ud83d\ude0a\n\norder the food on 1930, food delivery takes 30 mins. Message from Streats set to aim to deliver the food by 8pm yet it is 8.23pm now and the food is not delivered yet.\n\nVery slow service, not going to order again.\nWill advise my friends and relatives not to order from this outlet in Bukit Panjang Plaza\n",

The chilli padi adds the extra heat and drizzled with lime to give the spicy tangy taste (maybe that\u2019s the thai part) and fried chicken is a good side that makes the meal more hearty. The place is quite messy, service is normal. Eat and go place.\n\nTried this dish (Aroi Royale) as its different from their zhi char dishes.\n\nNot bad. Tom Yum soup based with seafood varieties and noodles. Serving was huge for 4 pax.\n\nOrdered via online from the table QR code. Hassle free.\n\nThe staffs were polite and courteous.\n\nOverall, nice experience. Thank you.\n\nSet meal was really worth it. About 28++ for assam fish, veggie, sichuan soup, 2 rice. It was marketed to be for 2 pax but would think 3 pax is good for it too (maybe order 1 additional side). Would revisit to try their fish head / other seafood options.\n\nGood old Halal Zhi Char . We tried some normal or usual selections. I must say , I love the mee goreng and prawn paste chicken wing . Overall food tastes qreat but as the place have no sound proof,  it get noisy at time especially when it crowded.\n\nWeekend and it's time for lunch and buddy picked West Coz. I'm up for it for sure.\n\nWe arrived around 2pm thereabouts and the place was not that crowded. We were seated and given our menu by a lady. She seem rather uptight, not rude just the tone I guess. Nothing to be bothered much by. In fact she was nice enough to inform us to call when we were ready to order.\n\nThe choices! Oh my, that was the biggest issue albeit a good issue to have really. So we decided on Assam Fish, Sambal Kangkong, Oyster Omelette, Black Pepper Beef and rice of cause. The male server came and took our orders and in about 15mins all our items arrived. That's a nice thing. Probably because it wasn't that crowded.\n\nThe pictures speaks for itself. The portions were generous, the veggies seems fresh however I would assume the assam fish to be different, you know the red soupy type rather than what I believe to be coconut based gravy. And half a fish head? Hhmmmm ... Nevertheless it was still delish. For the price point, was it worth it, definately. Would I be back here again, sure.\n\nOh, and after we ate and went out to catch a breather, saw the lady leaving on her bicycle. Thank her and she smiled and went on her merry way.\n\nAll in all, enjoyed it.\n\nFood : 4 / 5\nStaff : 4 / 5\nAmbience : 3 / 5\n",

They are super generous with fried shallots which is amazing.\n\nOverall a good bowl of noodles if you live in the area. However, nothing in particular that stood out or made me want to go down specially for it.\n\nOtherwise known as Uncle KKM. We got the standard bowl and being greedy, we opted for large size. Hahaha shouldn\u2019t have done so since the noodles were too much oops. I think the normal size is just nice.\n\nA nice bowl of noodles, shallot was v fragrant, they charge extra if you want more and I can see why \ud83c\udf5c\n\nHad also tried their spicy version before, it\u2019s good but really packs a punch. The queue is shorter when nearer to its closing time.\n\nUsed to frequent this store in the past, if uncle cook the bowl would be more flavorful, aunty cook tends to be less tasty.\nA simple bowl of comfort koka noodle, price has increase and ingredient portion getting lesser, seldom visit the store nowadays due to mostly aunty cooking and pricer with less ingredient.\n\nUsed to frequent this store during the weekend. Quite disappointed with the taste and the amount of indgredient in a bowl of KKM. I think there is a significant differences between the KKM prepared by Uncle KKM and the Auntie.The one cook by Auntie is less flavorful and the ingredient(meat) is much lesser. Hope Auntie can make improvement and serve us the best KKM in bukit panjang.\n\nTravelled across SG to explore no-mans-land known as Bukit Panjang.\n\nStumbled across this by pure chance and saw extremely long queue, in typical Singaporean fashion see queue just follow.\n\nSpicy Ke Kou mian was quite excellent, with healthy portions and a savoury broth,  5/5 for food. Paid $11.2 for a large Spicy + large Seafood bowl, so value price wise is middling. Self service, self clearing. Would eat again, but only if queue doesn't take 30 mins\n",

It make the worker keep & repeated explained to lot of senior customers who doesn\u2019t have union membership.\n\nIf Kopitiam willing to offer 50 cents breakfast set, why can\u2019t they just make $3 breakfast offer from morning to 7am~ 11 am?!\n\nPromotion at special price for co-operative is to help lower the price, for the benefit to customer, No for the aim to increase of revenue..\n\nVisited on 20 July 2023 mid afternoon. Place was relatively quiet. Ordered the Bubur Cha Cha at the dessert stall. Tasted exactly the same as what you will find at other Kopitiam outlets.\n\nThe tea c made by staff \ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffb, tea is too diluted. My experience with kopitiam for tea/coffee taste is inconsistent \ud83d\ude0f\n\nIt is getting pricey yet you are not assure of consistent taste, unlike some branded brand like Toast Box; pricey too but you are assured of the taste.\n\nI wanted to rate 1 star but staff at coffee n fruits counter are friendly, so I rate 2 stars for my experience here today.\n\nThe cai png is good and economical. Kopi taste OK and hot desserts were reasonable.\n\nTeriyaki chicken and saba bento was below average as the teriyaki sauce was more like sugary syrup. The rice was also not well cooked.\n",

Was super excited as has their meals from the other outlets & it was definitely tasty & fulfilling.\nSeafood Fried Rice has undercooked seafood, bland, no spring onions or anything else just undercooked rice with eggs & seafood.\n\nThe establishment might want to standardize the standard & food taste.\n\nSingapore style Chilli Crab was decent and saucy to go with rice. Stir Fried Kailan was done well too. Apparently this restaurant is halal friendly. EDIT: returned for Mookata - they offer a platter of mixed meat for 4-6pax (Ultimate Meat Bomb Platter) which was pretty fresh and value for dollar! Some weaknesses: The smell of Lamb meat easily overwhelms everything else, the soup refill is *very* salty may want to consider refill with plain water instead.\n\nWell ventilated mookata area. Food was good especially the meat platter. Not too good for larger groups as they only have smaller tables (up to 4). The online ordering system kept hanging and staff was q grumpy when clearing and setting up the grill but overall decent experience.\n\nThe food are delicious, affordable price ,come back for Mother's Day celebration , friendly staff ,very recommended.Thank you \ud83c\udf39\u2665\ufe0f\ud83d\ude4f\n",

There\u2019s crab meat in it which makes the soup authentically \u2018seafood\u2019 in flavour. Everything tasted v good. A surprise find this one!\n\nAlways a quiet and chill place where you\u2019ll almost be guaranteed a seat even on Friday nights. Food options are decent but some dishes are a hit or miss. The fried chicken had lots of batter and the flavour didn\u2019t feel like Korean fried chicken (somehow it reminds me for sweetened dark soy sauce). Will return mainly because it\u2019s quiet.\n\nThe hotplate beef is served on a cold plate. The banchan is not worth a repeat. You get better fried chicken at a fast food place. The tofu kimchi soup is ok. The chive pajeon is thick and uncook at the center and doesn't taste Korean.\n\nNot much of ambience but a good place for some quiet moments and good , reasonable price k food. Although I am not a fan of k stuff, the pancake is really good and the various fried chicken. Do go for the sets as they are more worth it.\n\nHomely and very customizable which is a plus for vegans/vegetarians! Naengmyeon is a must at Gayageum whenever I finish trekking nearby especially during hot weather. The jeons are tasty and in good servings - there's banchan too but not all side dishes are vegan.\n",

There were 3 staff managing  the outlet.\nThere are several authentic Indonesia food & tasted very good. I love the Ox tail soup, very meaty & the broth was power & beefy! Wife had Gado with Noodle, love the peanut sauce.\nOverall very good...Well done\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\n\nA few months ago, I would have rated 4 stars for the review of this place. I love indomie and I think the Satay Gado Mie was the best thing ever, it used to have this chonky satay chicken with the indomie (You can see it from a review from 6 months ago). This year the meat was reduced severely by half to 2 sticks of regular satay \ud83e\udd72 was there a change in ownership? Is this from the GST increase? I have no idea but I don't think I can patronize this store as regularly as I once did. Major downer.\n\nUsed to always buy chunky satay here, was nice and came with some veg on the side.  Now there is nothing chunky about it, just processed chicken.  And hardly any veg on the side.\n\nAyam penyet on the slight pricey side ($6-$7 on average). Limited seating. Enjoyed the gadomie the most, flavourful noodles and tender boneless chicken with satay sauce. And keropok! Chilli packs a punch. Fried chicken has very subtle tumeric taste, overall abit bland. Also they can have more gravy on the white rice.\n\nDO NOT EAT HERE!!!!! UNCLEAN FOOD!!!\n\nI ordered their NasiGo on 10 Oct 2022 through deliveroo and had such a nasty food poisoning afterwards. Vomiting for 2 days, stomach unwell for 3 days. Even had high fever on the first day of food poisoning lol. Spent $100+ on visiting the doctor. Terrible experience. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re serving food from previous days or your kitchen is unhygienic. But something is definitely wrong. Please check because you\u2019re playing with people\u2019s lives. This is unethical. Will NEVER eat here ever again and strongly suggest people DO NOT EAT FROM THIS PLACE!!\n\nUNCLEAN FOOD DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!!!!!!\n",

I'll be back.\n\nLove that you order online from the table. Food comes pretty quickly and service is slightly above avg I'd say.\n\nFood was good and decent price for value. The items with a chili spice have a bit of spiciness. Not too spicy for most and not too mild.\n\nSuper fast service and good food! Food came 5 minutes after order. My friends and I selected the set menu for 4. We chose fish head curry, long beans, mapo tofu, claypot chicken, salted egg sotong. All for the price of $98.35 (inclusive of GST & service charge). Food was pretty good! Their fish head curry is very good. Will come again :)\n\nOne of the better curry fish head I\u2019ve tried. For the amount we ordered it\u2019s about 35 dollars per pax. Ate with another friend on a weekday night, packed as hell, barely found a human friendly seat for two person situated at the the causeway of the cashier and the kitchen. The atmosphere was definitely impacted. Table was small as hell and we had to cramp all our plates in one table. They lighted the curry fish head infront of us and it had an amazing smell. To be honest if u r gonna order curry fish head. Just Match it with white rice and not Thai seafood rice which btw was terrible and salty. A vegetable drink was discounted for us at 2.50 dollar per cup where the usual price was 3.50. Once again, the vegetable drink felt like an unhealthy sweetened drink that was green in colour filled with a lot of ice. These days restaurants charge you premium price for drinks where at least 70% of the drink is filled with ice so u expect me to sit at your restaurant and wait for your ice to melt while my drink is kept cool. Atmosphere was trash and loud market, u had to literally shout to talk to your friend across the table. Not ur usual candle light express dinner. Good thing they didn\u2019t chase us away from this inhumane table and we left anyway cos it was getting really hot. Yes the temperature in that area is kinda like open air as the aircon is central air cooling of the overall mall. People who love curry fish head should come but just order white rice and bring your own bottle of water to save money\n\nCurry fish head is great! We ordered the set meal for 6 people $82.80. Plus Gst near to $98.\nService was fast and place was clean. The oyster egg was delicious,  and oysters given was fresh and generous. We will come back again.\n\nOrdered the asam fish head, egg, kangkong, salted egg sotong and chicken.\n\nOverall a very delicious meal, especially the fish and sotong.\n\nComfortable dinning with aircon.\n\nWould recommend for a comfortable meal with family or friends.\n",

The price is reasonable, the food is great and it is definitely worth the price.\n\nIt is quite hot here so I recommend you to sit somewhere exposed to the outside air so that there would be an occasional cooling breeze that would circulate the air so that you wouldn't feel that hot.\n\nIt's best to eat here in groups so that you would be able to enjoy the different varieties of food together. Recommend this to your friends too!\n\nGoogle reviews is pretty accurate, very very average Korean food here.\nServed up by very authentic Korean ladies but the food(I tried) were not close to authentic tasting at all. The kimchi stew and ginseng chicken soup tasted like premix or just stock, with lots of msg and not made with fresh ingredients. I was super thirsty after eating. The soup was watery and not tasty.\n\nPrice I feel is ok, not too expensive for the portion which is rather generous, 1 stew and rice will be very very full.\n\nHowever with the number of other Korean options in this building, I won\u2019t be back for this Korean food.\n\nI have to blame myself for not reading other reviews before ordering.\n\nSeafood stew with rice $13.90 at a hawker centre. Taste bland and the ingredients (prawns and mussels) are not fresh.\n\nThe only thing authentic about this place is probably the store owner who is a Korean.\n\nOverall about 3.5 stars for this popular Korean food stall.\n\nThe ginseng porridge $10 was pretty good. Tasty, comforting food and the portion was a huge ball. The ginseng was cut into thin stripes so it doesn\u2019t come across as super bitter when I bit into it.\n\nHowever, the seafood soup was lacklustre. The main complaint would be that the prawns and mussels were not fresh at all. I was struggling to peel the prawns so much it simply disintegrated. I just gave up eating it.\n\nPeak hour wait could be from 30 mins onwards so be prepared to wait during dinner time!\n\nRooftop dining and great place to chill at night. Serves Korean food and beer. Love the oiginal fried chicken wings, crispy on the outside, tender inside. Located in the hawker centre decorated with assortment of plants which adds a botanic side yo the place.\n",

There\u2019s crab meat in it which makes the soup authentically \u2018seafood\u2019 in flavour. Everything tasted v good. A surprise find this one!\n\nAlways a quiet and chill place where you\u2019ll almost be guaranteed a seat even on Friday nights. Food options are decent but some dishes are a hit or miss. The fried chicken had lots of batter and the flavour didn\u2019t feel like Korean fried chicken (somehow it reminds me for sweetened dark soy sauce). Will return mainly because it\u2019s quiet.\n\nThe hotplate beef is served on a cold plate. The banchan is not worth a repeat. You get better fried chicken at a fast food place. The tofu kimchi soup is ok. The chive pajeon is thick and uncook at the center and doesn't taste Korean.\n\nNot much of ambience but a good place for some quiet moments and good , reasonable price k food. Although I am not a fan of k stuff, the pancake is really good and the various fried chicken. Do go for the sets as they are more worth it.\n\nHomely and very customizable which is a plus for vegans/vegetarians! Naengmyeon is a must at Gayageum whenever I finish trekking nearby especially during hot weather. The jeons are tasty and in good servings - there's banchan too but not all side dishes are vegan.\n",

The kimchi stew is average, not too spicy nor flavourful. However it is a good meal to wind down after a long day! The cold noodle texture is great and refreshing. We enjoyed it.\nTheir fried dumpling is a great snack to go along with the main dish.\nThey serve complimentary side dishes and barley tea.  I\u2019m unsure if the side dishes are refillable as I did not request for refill.\nThe ambience of the restaurant is acceptable!\n\nI\u2019m neither Korean nor have I been to Korea, but I definitely believe this is what Korean food is supposed to be.\n\nI loved every minute in the restaurant. Its ambiance is very warming- almost like you\u2019re hosted by a warm lady.\n\nHearty and rustic dishes that really hits the spot.\n\nVisited for dinner a couple of times. The food is delicious, and the portions are big.\n\nIt is a small restaurant with a low ceiling, and isn't acoustically treated, so it feels too noisy to have a conversation without raising your voice (which then makes the problem worse).\n\nAnother odd thing we felt was that either the tables  are shorter than usual, or the chairs taller than usual. We could be wrong, but our backs felt a little sore halfway through the meal.\n\nOwner is extremely Cheerful and is full of smiles. The food is absolutely stunning, making me crave for more everytime. Will definitely recommend this restaurant to all Korean food lovers! Food is also authentic and fresh \ud83d\ude0b\n\nAwesomely good Korean food worth a try!! The spicy chewy noodle (jjolmyeon) was excellent with the right noodle chewiness and taste. We love the spicy Braised chicken and grilled mackerel as well. The grilled mackerel was crispy on the outside and so tender within \ud83d\ude0b.  Will definitely be back!!

Came here because my regular Korean BBQ place next door was too packed.\nRemembered that the marinated meats were good. Overall a good experience although you have to do the meat grilling yourself unlike at....\n\nIt\u2019s a long time since we had Korean bbq & decided to give it a try since the ratings are good. The side dishes are really good \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f, better than most Korean restaurants. We ordered beef & pork set. It came with the soybean soup that was quite tasty \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f and the steam egg which we didn\u2019t really like it as much \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f since it is harder than the usual steam egg. The meats : iberico pork collar, pork belly & beef striploin were good \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f except the beef ribs as it was quite chewy \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f. We were given free beer due to our spending amount. Overall it was a great experience.\n\nHave always wanted to try the wood fired meats ever since I heard about them and today I got a chance. We ordered a set meal for pork with three different types of pork, steamed egg and also kimchi beef soup. The set is pork omma set meant for 2-3 pax.\n\nMeat were generous and really more than enough for two pax. They recommended 2-3 pax but it should be more like 4 pax as both of us were not big meat eaters.\n\nWe ordered a wood flavour charcoal that is suitable for pork - hickory wood which tbh we both cannot smell it and cannot even taste the difference!! The steam egg could be better as it was chao tar at the sides:) the marinating of meats were left to us and the variety of salt and pepper to me were one of the more unique features of restaurant:)\n\nThe set comes with ban chan and they were delicious. There were free flow of ban chan until they ran out!\n\nI like the kimchi and the ikan bilis banchan:) my friend like the ikan bilis banchan and ordered 2nds for both. By the end of the meal both kimchi and ikan bilis have ran out!!!\n\nThere were drinks on special offer but since I drove we did not get the offer.\n\nWas surprised they don't do the cooking for us and also the young girl who first approached us seem new. There was also a housefly landing on the wood panels after we finished eating!!\n\nThe meat set was still a little frozen when served. The fried chicken was pretty average while the beef soup lacked ingredients and it doesn't come with rice. The seafood pancake was floury and non crispy. Food was alright, nothing surprising.\n\nOne of the staff doesn't know the differences between a receipt and a ticket and was augmentative about it. He said because we add on orders and not order at the start (which we totaled over $300 for the bill) doesn't count for the free flow beer for the table. While it was written on the poster outside the restaurant that \"with minimum spend of $250 in a single receipt per table\" he feels he had the need to go outside take a photo and show us to prove us wrong. At that point it just made us feel that the restaurant was kinda scammy. In the end he said only for this time he let us have the free beer. But kudos to the rest of the staff that were friendly, attentive and filled our drink fast.\n\nOverall the food was mediocre and the service should be quite good but there's always a bad apple that spoiled the experience. Or maybe it was the management policy, who knows. I won't recommend this place instead just try the next door O.bba Jjajang for better Korean food.\n\nIts my second time coming back here and they notice me directly!! Excellent service friendly &  accommodating staff !They welcomed me with their best smiles, assist me well especially in ordering \u2764\ufe0f Hemah, Venissa and Sylvester \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffb were the best as they always check up on me for top-ups ! with my beer & etc.\ud83e\udd29\n\nExcellent Customer Service! Ill keep on coming back here! thats for sure !\n\nBest Regards as well to Kitchen Staffs who prepared all the food ! It is very well prepared the meat and my favorite seafood soup\ud83d\ude0d!\u2764\ufe0f  thumbs up  and keep up the Good Work Everyone\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\n",

                  "reviews": "\n\nExcellent curry rice. Piping hot and crispy pork cutlet matched with silky smooth Japanese curry and steaming rice.\n\nOne of the best curry rice I have had.\n\nThe curry packs some spice is not the all-sweet curry sauce. Cutlet is flavourful; the crunch and temperature of the meat is excellent!\n\nOne of the star outlets of this hawker centre. Atmosphere is what you would expect of a hawker centre. The pigeons are a problem for this hawker centre but shouldn't distract you from the good food.\n\nLook at what you can get for $10. Definitely 5 stars for someone who value quantity over quality yet quality is decent for a hawker fare Japanese curry rice. Pork katsu was the best out of the 3 meats on the plate while the other 2 were forgettable. Very extensive menu for such a small stall which makes ordering decision quite a headache.\n\nUpdate Jul 2023:\nHad their Char Siew Don which is definitely value for money at $5.50 though it's quite lacking in the taste department. Their char siew was succulent and the rice has the right texture but the sauce just doesn't felt right. I guessed the lack of mayonnaise was the difference, there's a reason why most Japanese outlets would add them in their CSD, something that the owner shd consider including.\n\nUpdate Aug 2023:\nHad their Poached Rice which is so far my favourite dish at this stall though it's recipe essentially derived from their ramen by changing the noodle to rice.\n\nUpdate Aug 2023:\nFinally got to try their ramen again which I had it long ago but didn't left an impression. Totally enjoyed it this time eventhough the tonkotsu broth lacked some depth(as expected for a hawker fare) but this can be gloss over by avoiding the original flavour and order either the spicy or black garlic flavour. A 80% restaurant's quality at less than half their price.\n\nUpdate Aug 2023:\nThe Miso Rice w Mentaiko Pork Cutlet is my least favorite by far. The miso rice was too mushy and tasted like kimchi rice which I happened not to like. Pork cutlet was ok but the Mentaiko doesn't seems to compliment the meat as well as it did to salmon.\n\nI purposedly went to Beauty World Food Centre just to try this ramen stall. I read that this stall is one of the 'must try' in the list. I went through the menu and saw that the ramen called BLACK KING (GARLIC) has 3 thumbs up sign. I ordered a bowl costing $9.90. It did not disappoint me. The broth is tasty with rich umami flavor while the noodles are al dente. The thing that I liked most is the barbecue slices of pork with nice  charred flavor while maintaining the tenderness of the meat. It also comes with cabbage, japanese style soft boiled egg, and generous topping of bonito flakes. I would definitely recommend this stall. An affordable ramen that is only a fraction of cost than a normal ramen would be.\n\nMy favourite ramen place of all time!!!! Even better than typical ramen restaurants who claim to be \u201cmichelin star\u2019. I always order their signature ramen bowl ($8.00), comes with the ingredients as shown. The pork slices are SO THICK and crispy on one side! Absolutely savoury! Also gives a generous amount of black fungus & the noodles are not overdone with texture in-place. Broth was flavourful yet not too overwhelming.\n\nEven when their food is excellent, their service is impeccable as well. Due to the layout of the food centre, rain splashes quite heavily beside the stall (causing some flooding water as well). The owner came to deliver the ramen to me personally & even wrapped the ramen bowl with a layer of cling wrap + put seaweed in a plastic bag to prevent water from going in, even though I was dining in. Was blown by the effort & it showed how much pride they put in ensuring their ramen quality tasted the best! Kudos! Recommend anyone to go try!!!!!\n\nAtmosphere is not that great - sg weather hahaha & area is not clean, but I\u2019m not going to shortchange this stall of 5 stars as it\u2019s the foodcourt\u2019s issue xD\n\nButa Kin must be a favourite at Beauty World Food Centre. There is a waiting time of 15 minutes for the Ramen.\n\nTo me, good ramen is one with great-tasting broth, and the noodles must be cooked to my liking (a tad on the hard side). This ramen store ticked all the right boxes (almost). The broth was lovely, but it bordered on the lighter side on the taste. The noodles were perfect. The Char Siew or Charred Pork Slices were delicious and with a little charred flavour. The umami was perfect.\n\nFor extra ingredients, like one boiled egg and extra Char Siew, the cost turned out to be $11. Cheap for the food court? Not exactly, but compared with the ramen restaurants, it is very reasonable.\n\nVerdict, I would certainly come again. I like it.\n",

The whole experience was brought to another level by extremely warm service by genuinely friendly staff. We would be back again.\n\nCame to celebrate Father\u2019s Day lunch on a lazy Sunday.  Place is not crowded and quite a nice homely atmosphere.  Ordered pizza, lamb chop, burrata cheese plater and bruschetta bread. All tasted delicious and pizza is really good.  Finished with nice coffee and tiramisu dessert.  Service is fast and prompt.  Overall a pleasant experience and the bill came up to $126 which is reasonable for the quality of food served.  Will certainly be back.\n\nA nice cosy Italian restaurant nestled inside a private apartment. You will be spoilt for choices as they have a great authentic Italian menu and everything is tasty. Interior decor is also nicely done with a homey touch. Very friendly staff and chef as well.\n\nI used to order often from them 4-5 years back as I was living next door and I returned for a dinner (last visit was probably 2019). The atmosphere is still great (old school italian place), the food is still amazing. Had the burrata, the 4 cheese pizza (I always order this wherever I go and Al Borgo is top 3 in Singapore for me) and pasta (angel hair with prawns). Nice Super Tuscan red wine at 90$ a bottle. Had deserts too (tiramisu and affogato with whisky instead of coffee). Total damage approx 230$. I left happy in spirit and tummy\n\nIt's definitely a great restaurant for who wanna taste real Italian food!! Thanks so much for giving us a lovely and unforgettable evening :)\n",

Their chili is fire if you put a lot.\n\nThen the wanton noodle stall that is along the mutton soup stall side, the noodles always cooked perfectly al dente, their chili sauce is quite unique.\n\nThen chendol at the corner is a hidden gem, the sweetness is just right that won\u2019t make you feel getting diabetes after that.\n\nTotal damage as seen in picture is only $10. Yes i am very hungry so i ate a bit more. This was on a Sunday evening period.\n\nWe had a feast here today after our hike at Bukit Timah and rifle range nature parks. All the food was so good! There also was beer and a nice beer garden outdoor seating area (too bad it was raining and we couldn\u2019t sit outdoors). Fried chicken was yummy, and the economical\nBee Hoon was pretty good too! It was very crowded and it took awhile to get seating. Lots of people were waiting around too. The beef noodles and carrot cake were decent too. Will be back to try more food next time\n\nEDIT: went back for the 3rd time! The stall is called Mom\u2019s food!\n*however the kimchi soup I ordered this time was alil too spicy.. I guess the spice level is not very consistent, but I\u2019ll forgive auntie maybe she accidentally poured too many chilli.. the previous 2 time was great!\nIt\u2019s NOT pink candy ok\u2026 it\u2019s located at the opposite end of pink candy!! Pls check it out~ it\u2019s manned by a Korean auntie and I\u2019ve only tried their kimchi soup~ trust me~~ it\u2019s super flavourful and delicious very heartful\ud83d\ude0b loads of kimchi but the meat inside is meh, abit tough and dry.. but the soup compensates all!!! It\u2019s $7.90 with a bowl of rice whereas pink candy is charging twice the amt.. \ud83d\ude05 pls give it a try~\n\nfood was really mediocre at best. i cant speak for all the stores but the xiao long bao tasted like plastic. just little balls of \u201cfreezer\u201d taste\n\nthe western had a lot of good reviews but for its price and taste, it wasn\u2019t good at all.\n\nbak chor mee was really watery and bland.\n\nthere isn\u2019t any upkeep of this place and it was super dirty. what happened to the beauty world food center i knew and loved \ud83d\ude1e\n\nThere are so many good hawker fare at this location, you'll be spoilt for choice.\n\nOn this visit, I had the Chicken & Cream Mushroom Pasta. The noodle is cooked just right with a flavorful creamy sauce at the right consistency; not too watery or too thick. The grilled chicken is savory with the right amount of crunchy skin; a wonderful pairing. This item is from BIG BOYS Western at #04-25.\n\nAnd of course, don't forget to end your meal with YE TANG Chendol, which is door to Big Boys. If you are fan of the famous thorny fruit, order the one with a scoop of durian ice cream. The pairing is heavenly.\n",

Do try the tasting menu, everything from appetizers to dessert was unique and sumptuous. A great place to celebrate birthday , instead of the usual cake/desserts, they served something special :) ( Not going to spoil the fun by saying)\n\nIt\u2019s a fairy tale experience for me!\n\nThe food is fabulous. Their specialty flower-like bread is one of the best bread I have ever tried. Many of their dishes have incorporated authentic Columbia\u2019s cuisine elements and also included some Asian ingredients. For example, one dish has salted egg in the source. All the international ingredients are harmoniously combined in this taste menu experience!\n\nThe chef and staff are very friendly and they will passionately tell you stories behind the food instead of just listing all the ingredients and the source countries. One of my favorite is that they show me how Columbian local people open a passion fruit (just by hitting their heads! \ud83e\udd23)\n\nThe interior design is mysterious and exotic for me, because I\u2019ve never been to Latin America.  The staff showed me how the beautiful vases are handmade by local Colombian people.\n\nI will definitely recommend this restaurant to people:\n\n1) who want to celebrate an important anniversary with some memorable experiences and delightful dishes.\n\nOr\n2) who want to have some interesting cultural exposure and travel to Columbia mentally without being physically there.\n\nOr simply\n3) who love food!\n\nIf you are interested in their cuisine/culture, don\u2019t be shy to ask! The staff will give you a trip to Latin America with their kind words, for all the customers from the world.\n\nWent there end of August and I just say that everything was just perfect !\nFood was amazing and when you know Colombian cuisine you can definitely find the influences in every single dish !\nCocktails were also all very good.\nService was great and the chef is lovely !\n\nDeserving of a lot more attention and love. I had the BEST BREAD EVER here. This restaurant, recommended by a friend, was a great find for me. The menu, food and decor of the place have all been meticulously thought-out. I didn\u2019t get a good photo of the interior but the restaurant has a clean, sleek and modern look while retaining some vibes to remind you of its Colombian roots. I was here for lunch and had its Arborio rice cooked with Sea Urchin and Smoked Eel and Iberico Pork Chop. To be honest, I don\u2019t think their dishes are essentially what I would think to be columbian cuisine but I love good food regardless. Each dish was light, flavourful, well-seasoned and the ingredients all complemented each other very well. Love the plantains with the pork chop. I would love to be back soon again. It\u2019s a shame that they\u2019re located in an office tower which I think is the reason behind the slow traffic. Support them if you can, you will get nothing but a great meal and experience out from it.\n\nHad our anniversary dinner there and we had a wonderful time. The dishes were delicious and cocktails yummy. We never had columbian food and we are so glad we did. Chef does seafood especially well, cuttlefish and Boston lobster were cooked to perfection. We had iberico pork for mains and it was so tender and tasty.\n\nShout out to the service staff too. I like that the service was warm and friendly and not stuffy and overly formal like other high end restaurants.\n\nAlready made another two business lunch bookings.\n",

Portion would be small for a guy.\n\nI have no idea what authentic Colombian food is but this stuff was delicious, inexpensive, and reminded me of my mom\u2019s cooking. Owners were super friendly too! I ordered a second plate immediately after finishing the first. Also the chili is among the hottest I\u2019ve had in SG! Which is a good thing.\n\nSucculent chicken meat coupled together with aromatic rice and perfectly seasoned chopped tomatoes \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\nBe sure to add on more vegetables for a nutritious meal\nI tried coming a few times specifically for this shop, but they were closed.\nToday I finally get to try their delicious food \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude00\n\nGobbled up all the rice before taking a photo because I was too hungry.\nBut hey, at least I've tried and tested it \ud83d\ude01\n\nOrdered Colombian chicken rice.

Can tell long hours of simmering had gone into this slow-cooked chicken stew - the meat was relatively fork-tender and absorbed the flavours from the moreish gravy. BB pretty much polished off their entire plate with their fragrant olive oil rice & tangy salsa! BB was wondering why they gave such a small dollop of chilli but understood why after taking a small mouthful - it packs a super spicy punch! \ud83e\udd75\ud83d\udd25 For an additional dollar, you can get a bowl of vegetables (broccoli, carrots, cauliflower) to complete your meal.

                  "reviews": "\n\nCame here for lunch and there was already a long queue. Tried their sliced fish mee sua and added fish maw. Apparently all their noodles are handmade. Really tastes similar to home cooked food. There is a good balance of ingredients, just the right amount of everything - greens, fish slices, meat, mushroom etc. They were quite generous with the fish maw. The chilli and black sauce complemented really well with my dry mee sua. Comes with a bowl of soup as well. Would pop to eat again next time. Definitely recommended, especially when queue is short!\n\nWorthy of the name Top 1, the noodles are decently priced and delicious.\n\nWe had the Tom Yum You Mia , Abalone Clam Mee Sua and Ban Mian. All 3 were distinct in their own flavors.\nThe Tom Yum soup was more of a thick gravy with a nice kick. The default soup was flavorful.\nLots of ingredients in all made us pretty full.\n\nThe 30 cents chilli is skippable if you are a chilli fiend, otherwise it is acceptable to normies.\n\nWe paid $16.80 for 3 bowls of soupy goodness. The only downside is the 30 mins plus queue time but I would say it's worth it.\n\nLong Queue, ordered $5 dry ban mian. Although a small table spoon of chilli paste, it's very potent. Enjoyable experience when eating.\n\nMeats and condiments are comforting.\n\nNext time I will order a larger portion the next time.\n\nWaited about 15 mins in line and another 10 mins after ordering for a dry ban mian. Very tasty ban mian and soup. Portion is a bit small compared to other ban mian places but I think this is very good quality. If you don\u2019t mind waiting time then this is nice.\n\nTop 1 Home Made Noodle holds a special place in my heart as my ultimate go-to stall for exquisite noodle delights. Despite the inevitable queue, the wait is undoubtedly worthwhile. Offering selection up to 8 distinct noodle varieties, from thin strands to thicker cuts, this multi-generational establishment has consistently delivered impeccable quality.\n\nOne of their standout dishes, Dry Noodle aka (Gan Lao Mian) stands as my personal favorite. Its chewy noodles bathed in a tantalizing combination of rich dark sauce and spicy chili create an explosion of flavors on the palate. The addition of premium toppings prawns, fish, and abalone elevates the experience to an unparalleled level of indulgence.\n\nWhile the queue might seem daunting, the freshness of the soup speaks volumes about their commitment to quality. For anyone yet to savor the delights of this noodle haven, it's a must-visit destination. Top 1 Home Made Noodle is not just a stall, it's an experience that seamlessly blends tradition with culinary excellence. Prepare to be captivated by the harmonious marriage of chewy noodles, exquisite flavors, and premium toppings\n\nAnyone have not tried it go for it you will love it for sure!\n",

Brings back memories of how grandma would cook prawns noodles traditional way when I was young.\n\nIf the prawn noodles was already so good, must come back soon to try their specialties.\n\nmy parents & i visit this place pretty often & their standard is very consistent! all their dishes taste good. howeverrrr, i think you can give the drinks a pass \ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab.\n\nthe owner is a very friendly guy who greets everyone by \u2018sister\u2019 & \u2018brother\u2019. the place & the dishes are very homely. their kueh\u2019s and traditional nonya desserts are also v tasty!! i\u2019d say give it a try if you\u2019re in the area as it is also very value for money. portions are also filling enough!\n\nThe cakes are soooo delicious, especially the chocolate tart and the coconut. The coffee/tea and food prices are cheap and everything is good quality! Less sugar used in cakes and kueh too but tastes immense!\n\nFood here is great, I had the Nasi Kunyit, Teh Peng and the Nonya Chendol. My friend ordered the Laksa Lemak, and made me regret not buying that even though the Nasi Kunyit was good. The Laksa just had a very thick and gao soup / sauce.\n\nThe Teh peng is different from most shops in that it's not too sweet, rather a thinner feel to it, and the flavour is more subtle. Something different that I enjoyed!\n\nOh, the seats aren't too comfortable for longer meals, and the payment is a little confusing, I don't know exactly when to pay (especially if you're ordering desserts or having a friend join a little later. But otherwise, I'll definitely recommend this place, especially the Laksa.\n",

Every component was fresh and tasty, with the satay sauce bringing everything together. The satay sauce for satay beehoon is slightly on the savoury side while still having some of the sweetness that we are familiar with. The satay sauce is very tasty, boasting a depth of flavour.\n\nThere will almost always be a queue as the stall is very popular but the line moves very quickly and service is fast.\n\nNot a commonly seen dish found in hawker centres so definitely give this dish a try if you are around the area.\n\nThere was always a long queue, and I am curious if it was worth queuing 15 minutes for the satay bee hoon. The queue moved fast because there was a well executed process in the stall to minimise waiting time. And the service was friendly.\n\nAs for the satay bee hoon, the satay sauce was not thick and lacked that wow feel on first taste. Good but not exceptional.\n\nOpens only 4 days a week. They serve satay bee hoon as well. You can also choose to add bee hoon in the cuttlefish kang kong. This dish is no longer as easily available as before. The serving came with generous portion of cuttlefish, jellyfish, kang kong, bean sprouts and achar (!). The blend of sweet and sour sauce and chilli, crunchy cuttlefish, spicy and sweet achar made their version so unique. Their satay bee hoon was also good but not as spectacular.\n\n5\u2b50\ufe0fstar for great taste and best satay gravy sauce ever. Very old school and now looks like the second generation youngster are taking over. Sister S and bro team whips out plate of super savoury satay bee hoon quickly and very efficient . Only downside is hawker center is really hot and the que always long\ud83d\ude05\n\nBeen patronising this stall since I was a kid.\nTaste been consistent all these years even after the 2nd Gen took over \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\nHas to be one of the better Satay bee hoon around!\n\nHighly recommend If you have not tried it!\n",

They forgot to include the toy and book in the bag, the nugget was not even warm. The fries were not fresh either. My kids were super disappointed. Will never come to this branch anymore.\n\nThis is most definitely the best restaurant in the entire country. People who disagree are tweaking out of their mind. It was my friends birthday and a staff member gave him a free ice-cream. Excellent service and customer service is phenomenal. Very nice to go with friends. Food is warm and excellent. 10 out of 10 would recommend.\n\nScrew hidden in my egg McMuffin.\n\nEdit: customer care have reached out to me. Editing this review to neutral as the response I received from the team shows that they are committed to food safety.\n\nI have spent at least 200 dollars here. I have celebrated 4 birthdays here. I have cried here. I have laughed here. I have felt every emotion I can feel in the world here. I would say this place is my second home but it is not. It is my first home. Staff treat me better than my parents. The food here has brought me from suicidal to the happiest man alive. I love this place.\n\nHad to try the limited time coconut soft serve cone, this is a location near me and with drive-thru, quick and easy .\n",

Definitely one of the best chicken rice stall in the hawker center and around this area.\nThe rice has an unique and subtle flavour to it. Chicken is tender and chilli is nice. Very consistent taste as well. Always a queue during lunch. Highly recommended ! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\n\nPossibly the best chicken rice in town . Affordable and absolutely delicious . They stop operating when Malaysia stopped exporting chicken but the good news is that they are now back !!! Store usually sell out by 1/2pm and there\u2019s always a long line during lunch time . Chicken is succulent, fragrant and the rice is superbly cooked, separated grains .. you can\u2019t go wrong with this\n\nI really, really hate queuing for food, but every time this stall is open I just can't help it! Waiting time always exceeds 25 minutes, but there's a reason why everyone likes this stall.\n\nOwner and his son are friendly, and portions are good. Rice here is very special, as it's fragrant and 'liap' (\u4e00\u7c92\u4e00\u7c92), yet not oily at all. No idea how they do it, but it's very unique.\n\nSo glad that they\u2019ve reopened after taking a break due to the Malaysia chicken export ban. I\u2019m happy to report that the standards have not dropped.\n\nThe chicken remains succulent; the rice fragrant, tasty but not too oily; the chilli punchy as ever. I\u2019ve been eating this chicken rice for years and they have upheld the quality consistently. To me, this is the best chicken rice in Singapore.\n\nLots of reviews griping about the long waiting times due to phone orders. Give them a call in advance if you\u2019d like to takeaway a bulk order. If not, please be prepared to wait in line for longer than expected.\n\nWho doesn\u2019t love chicken rice? There\u2019re a few stalls in this Hawker Center, very much depend on guys taste buds. Ordered 2 drums, gizzards and hearts. Have to request for free soup. Rice is very fragrant. Chickens are very tender and sauce that drizzled over is tasty. The chillis are spicy and garlicky, not very well blended to my liking. The black sauce is very salty. $11.20 for the serving is consider average.\n",

                  "reviews": "\n\nFood quality was top notch and every dish was amazingly yummy and delicious! Definitely one of the top Spanish restaurants in Singapore!\n\nOnly 3 areas of improvement:\n- to have more cocktail options, they had way too many wine options.\n- it was relatively noisy at the courtyard, might be the infrastructure or design of the restaurant where the noise keeps bouncing back.\n- should have cleared the plates on the table before serving the new dish, and not get customers to help hold the plates while they are serving.\n\nIt's a 4.5 stars for me personally.\n\nMy 7 y/o daughter and I enjoyed our dinner with TINTO. The service was impeccable - our server was attentive and patient with us, explaining the dishes as they were served.\n\nThe Gambas (prawn) starter was excellent and our favorite! The Grilled Asparagus was great, and we appreciated that it wasn't too salty. The Grilled Squid and Chorizo Paella didn't disappoint, albeit the serving was smaller than I expected.\n\nAll in all, a lovely experience and a small notch above Tapas Club.\n\nReally liked this place: Elegant, but still relaxed atmosphere, attentive service. The person who seems to be the restaurant manager is indeed checking that everything is taken care of. I also appreciate that, at the beginning, they ask what type of water you like, including warm and ice water. This is a lovely attention to detail.\nThey have a full vegetarian menu with creative and interesting dishes - I want to come back to try more of these. Also very good Spanish wine options.\nThis would be a definite 5 stars if not for the below:\n1) At our table, we had one starter and two mains. One of the mains was paella, which takes time to prepare (it's called out in the menu). They brought the other main so early, that one person at the table was pretty much done with the food when the paella arrived.\n2) the vegetarian dish of the grilled gem lettuce was really nice, especially the chimichurri. Great use of herbs and flavours. Unfortunately, it was quite oily, which made it very heavy. A less oily preparation would have been great.\n\nPS: The restaurant was full when we were there. For privacy reasons, I edited the other diners - but it certainly wasn't empty.\n\nParty of 4...we came here for a birthday celebration. First impressions upon entering the restaurant exuded positive vibes - ambience, decor, welcoming crew. We were led to the inner section which was very cosy and inviting... I knew a great night was in store. Great menu and price points. We were attended to by the inimitable Ara who made the evening very enjoyable. The recommendations were on point. Food was fabulous. Overall a lovely lovely place for authentic Spanish fare. Highly recommended. Well done guys!!\n\nTapas were very unique and tasty. I believe we had the grilled octopus and some anchovy + burrata cracker. Paella was nothing exceptional. Desserts (rice pudding and orange cake) were alright. If I were to go again, I would order just the tapas.\n",

One of the few places that serves really nice frog porridge. Prices were rather reasonable and food was served pretty fast.\n\nThe ginger onion frog leg claypot is the star dish. Topping it off with the fried intestine, cereal prawn, fried chicken wing, egg and dongpo meat, you will be feasting like a king.\n\nShiok ah!\n\nNice and many food choices. Just that the space for 2nd floor is a bit small and can be quite noisy if everyone is talking..overall very good.\n\nThere\u2019s a dearth of good frog porridge out west, so the family is happy that NO.5 is alive and thriving. The claypot frogs are tasty enough (probably top 5 island-wide for us), with the standout dish here their signature fried tofu (a must-try).\n\nI only wish that their servings were more consistent - depending on chance, you may end up with little or no sauce, resulting in strict rationing.

They don\u2019t qualify as a halal place  as they serve alcohol. But good for Muslim friends. It was my first time here and it\u2019s been a while since I had Greek food. I love the dips option from spicy to mild tasting dips. The fried calamari was great too followed by the medium rare lamb which was tender. Ensure you make a reservation to avoid disappointment. Good place to bring friends.\n\nAlways crowded on weekends such that even booking a table on same day is sometimes not possible.\nI really enjoyed the medium meat platter. grilling was on point  meat was juicy and not dry.\nmoussaka went down way too easily. Greek dip platter was on point flavour wise and the taramasalata was flavourful without tasting too fishy.\nsadly the pita bread is pretty small portioned, I'm not sure how you're expected to finish the dip given with the portions served\nGrilled octopus was also delicious.\n\nService was friendly and efficient.\nDecor isn't very Greek but honestly ambience is great (albeit a bit noisy)\n\nIt's harder to get a table here than the at its closest competitor, and for  good reason.\n\nGood food. Although the beef can be on the dry side, everything else was delicious.\n\nHighly recommend the grilled octopus. It is not chewy at all. For those who don\u2019t like squid or octopus, try to have a bite.\n\nRestaurant is packed on a Friday night and the food arrives pretty quick. Staff are quite alright. Some could use a little refining in politeness.\n\nThere\u2019s complimentary licorice candy. Absolutely love it.\n\nWill visit this place again. But recommend to come here in a bigger group to order a larger variety of dishes.\n\nFirst visit. Reservation was smooth via seven rooms. We chose an outdoor table as the weather was pleasant. The food was delicious. We had the whole oven chicken and chicken yiro wrap with fries. Pesto pasta was good as well. Desserts were amazing too. Overall highly satisfied.\n",

The meat was well cooked and juicy, the mashed potato on top was also good.\n\nThe mango sago was yummy too with lots of sago but looks like they put quite a bit of colouring too as it was staining the plastic container it came in.\n\nService is prompt and quite friendly..\nTheir chicken curry rice, Mee siam, laksa and curry Mee all tasted really decent. Especially their ondeh cake ($8.90) not very cheap, it\u2019s special as there is sauce to top on the cake. But it\u2019s nice.\nWill recommend if you are nearby and if the queue is reasonable.\n\nAround for 40 years and now spearing the nonya spread by 02nd & 03rd generation.\n\nLaksa was out of the world! Bringing back of my grandma taste\u2026. Humble stall but big favours!\n\nA must to try for lunch or if u r around here, do consider packing their laksa or chendol.\n\nIs it over rated?\n\nIt was as as early as 11am when I stumble upon  this eateries. Usually, it was crowded and I have never patronize it. But today it was empty so I thought they weren't open but out curiosity i probe and they said they will open at 11:30 so I decided to wait. Which gave me some time to read some of the reviews on the wall and I am really impressed. Not before long, I saw a few customers come to collect orders they had placed, seems really popular and I'm glad.\n\nSince the review on Mee Rubus and Laksa sounds good, so, I ordered both... hehehe.\n\nWhile I'm queuing to wait to pay for my food, a lady budge and she explained, she ordered before me... I was really puzzled, how can that be? And she add on, \"don't worry, I'm a Singaporean and I don't cut queue...\" that statement make by her seems offensives. Then she threw $50, to the lady that was serving me and she took her money. She begins to justified herself by saying seems I am still taking out my cash, she is oblige to take the other customer's... and she said it was company policy?!\n\nI couldn't believe what I hear and I ask, \"policy?\" Then she make the most offensive remarks by saying, \"I don't have time for such people...\" I was stunt and then in the kitchen, a man told me to \"chill\"\n\nI was furious with that remark and I believe I was by far being composed but for the sake of trying out the food, I walked back to my seat and then to find my seat taken by another person. What a day!\n\nAnyway, my food came, and it looks good. By the way, I also ordered Chendol and water to rinse out my mouth so I can have an objective opinion.\n\nI go for the Mee Rubus first and I like the thickness of the gravy as I stir and mixed it well. The noodles was well cooked and when I got very noodles mixed and soaked up with the very nutty gravy, I took the first bite. Slurping some more to firm up my decision. Unfortunately, it did not meet up with my expectation. Maybe it's a little too sourish to my liking but in fairness, I like the thickness of the gravy. But, it did not won my 5 star ratings and the comment on the wall seems incredulous. Anyway,  it is really a difference in opinion and I have my Laksa to taste.\n\nAfter rinsing my mouth,  I begin to devour one of my favourite dishes, Laksa. I do not claim to be a food connoisseur but I believe I have enough Laksa in my lifetime to determine what is good, better or best.\n\nThe first impression was good. The looks of the Laksa was acceptable but when I eat it I felt that something was missing. To me, the true essence of a great Laksa is in its broth. Besides, the spices and ingredients, the slight pungent sense of dried shrimp must be prominent and of course the Lemak should be thick. Plus, the chilli offered could be much better.\n\nDespite of this, I ate more of the Laksa than the Mee Rubus and again, in my opinion, the food can be better but not to the extend of warranting a long queue. Plus, I never waste food.\n\nBut I am not convince with my own assessment as I read other good reviews and awards on the wall therefore I investigated further and these were some of the comments from other patrons and neighbours. Most of the remarks were: it was better when his mom is selling it.\n\nThat was a revelation to me, and hopefully, this long review can challenge the owner of Nonya Delicatessen to continue the legacy build by the mother.\n\nCame here on weekend later afternoon. No crowds. Ordered mee siam and laksa. Saw food being microwaved, it is a no go for this reputable outlet. The mee siam is sour enough and laksa is flavourful. But after one hour, drink plenty of water...yuks msg laden food. Did not expect msg from a famed nonya food outlet.\n",

The presentation of food is beautiful & there\u2019s a wonderful selection of desserts to end with! I would wlike to come back here again and again.\n\nCame here for a birthday celebration and we were served by the pleasant and friendly Kai, who gave us excellent recommendations and advised us on the portions. Service was great and our food came super fast to the point that we got full a bit early. Kai noticed this and helped slow down the subsequent dishes. We had the octopus and truffle egg mash for starters. The dishes were all superb and up to standard but the portions were pretty big too so be warned not to overorder. The highlight for us was the seafood paella and the iberico pork, each spoonful of the paella was bursting with flavour and fresh seafood, we felt like we were one with the ocean itself. Our table for two was also very spacious. They served a light Basque baked cheesecake on the house for our birthday celebration. Will definitely be back again!\n\nThis restaurant really has it all! The service, the food and atmosphere. We were also served by an amazing waiter, Kai. One of the best genuine services! His recommendations for food and drinks were top notch =) He even insisted to take away the leftovers. And he was right, still so good the next day! Don\u2019t miss taking photos outside the mansion. It\u2019s too pretty to miss!\n\nWe celebrated my wife birthday at Una on a Friday. Only set lunch option available unless we pre ordered tapas. Service crew is very friendly here, keep checking our water is filled. The food is delicious! The server also surprised my wife with a slice of cake for her birthday! What a great place to celebrate birthdays.\n\nOverall it was a great dining experience. The staffs are friendly.\nThe foods are delicious. The Ib\u00e9rico pork was great however it could\u2019ve been better if it was cooked medium rare. As in the picture the right side was alright while the left side was kinda dry, about medium well to well done.\n",

The soup was flavourful and great.\n\nQuite hard to find this coffeeshop/food court as it is on the 2nd floor and only easily accessible by staircase that leads to the main road.\n\nHighly recommended!\n\n\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\n\nOrdered mixed beef noodle with gravy. Food is so so only. Gravy is thick enough but too salty. Not much ingredients. Stall owner is very unfriendly and unhelpful. Shouted at me for \u2018not able to understand and order\u2019 in a way he understood. Also almost knocked off the tray with the food in front of me and never apologized. Will never order anymore.\n\nHad no 2 which is w tendon.\nExcellent bowl of beef kway tiao soup, tendon is nice & gelatinous which takes time to do.\nExtra points for having 3 types of chilli\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb.\nWill try the dry version next time.\nOnly downside is the coffeeshop is pretty warm despite so many fans.\nTry to sit near this stall as it\u2019s cooler on this side then the side w the economical rice.\n\nStill one of e better dried beef horfun I have eaten.\n$5 for a sliced beef bowl. Add $2 extra meat. Omg.... love it.\nSoup s beefy n umami. \ud83d\ude0b\nWorth it. Must try.\n\nWas attracted by their variety of beef noodle options, beef balls, mixed entrails and many more. Decided to go for my all time favourite dry beef sliced rice noodle.\n\nImpressed by their choice to use porcelain bowls and it is the rooster printed type, gave me a traditional olden days feel especially with the piping hot soup and noodles. Many vendors have abandoned forsaken such practice to save cost and for ease of handling. This bagged their first star!\n\nGenerous portion of noodles and beef slices, the portion of meat is definitely enough to last with the noodles which is so rare to find nowadays. Many foodcourts\u2019 renowned beef noodle stalls in only give 4-5 tiny thinly sliced beef with few mouthful portion of noodles.\n\nThe gravy is thick & tasty towards sweet but still acceptable for me who usually prefers more savoury food. The sliced beef is tender and chewable. The soup is flavourful but can be improved as it lacks the wow factor of simmered soup base. The effort to top the soup & noodle with generous amounts of garnish is applaudable.\n\nNot the best that I have tasted but it beats many foodcourt ones. It is value for money at $5 with good presentation and taste. Thumb up, will be back to try the other variety.\n\nSide note: Help yourself to the type of chilli sauce and cincalok.\n",

The sugee cake has a little nutty feel but overall not to my liking. But the ambience is quite good, with choice to sit in aircon inside, a little cramp though. You can sit outside, sufficient fans and air cooler fan around. Tables and chairs looking clean.\n\nThe food is nice and serving is good for 2 people.

Your Bee Hoon will be super Drench\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 (like eating zichar Hor Fun kind)\n\nClose on - MON/THUR/SUN\n\nPortion - 3.50/4.50. Take away add 20c for box\n\nOne of the BEST VEG Bee Hoon I ever had. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\n#\u7d20\u7f18 Vegetarian\n\nEnjoyed the vegetarian bee hoon ($3) - the mock char siew had a barbecued flavour, the bee hoon was warm and wet and not fried. The lunchtime queue was 30 mins long even though it wasn\u2019t a very long line.\n\nTried their vegetarian bee hoon and liked it. Please come with patience (not if you are in a hurry) if you plan to try this stall. Uncle serves slowly but calmly and politely with a smile and thanking customers for their purchase. One of the vegetarian stall I will patronise again in future. Keep up the standard of food and sincere service :-)\n\nThe bee hoon is good, that's all I can say about this stall, most times on the weekend, it takes about 25mins to 30 mins to get to your turn, mainly because. The service is slow, if that is just the sole reason, I would still queue for it, but the auntie manning the fort have been consistantly rude and has zero service attitude. The attitude alone is not worth anyone time.\n\nExtremely S. L. O. W. seller. The queue is forming not due to it being nice or popular but the serving is really really slow. Average 4 mins to serve a person. The uncle will use his tongs to slowly take ingredients, then come the cutting part.... was sitting there and watching it could not help shaking my head. Best part is the lady assistant can still play with a distracting baby from another stall. Really hope another vegetarian stall will spring up! There's actually another 2 stalls here selling same stuff but most of the times closed, people are queuing here thinking it's good not knowing how slow the uncle is.. Still shaking my head cos still serving same lady by time I finished this review.\n",

Gives me the feeling of a Taiwanese restaurant that is outside of the city, when I travel to Taiwan.\nThe restaurant spreads the table giving good space to enhance the dining experience.\nFood is generally good, although I find some dishes a little saltier than what I would prefer. But \u771f\u7684\u4e0d\u9519\u5403\uff01\ud83d\ude0a\nIf you have got been here before, give it a try! Quite a unique place.\n\nAwesome food. Was so good and ate a lot. Portion is reasonable. Ordered approximately 11 dish of varying sizes for $250++. No regrets.\n\nA classic Chinese Tze char eatery for the nostalgia. Food was decent and not too salty. I really liked the pumpkin tofu as the tofu was very silky. Coffee ribs were a bit of a misrepresentation as it was pork slices (easy to eat coz it\u2019s boneless I guess?) Am still on the search for a good Yam ring which wasn\u2019t fulfilled here although still ok but  unfortunately the Yam felt like it was cooked in overused oil. Fried mee sua was underwhelming.\n\nAunt picked this place for her 84th birthday treat & was disappointed. The place kind of messy maintained outside & ordered dishes are not the best. The chilli crab doesn't look & taste as said. Management proposed to wash the sauce off to re-cooked into pepper crab, which still tastes average. The sauce for the fish head had so much starch that turned into paste when cold. The black pepper beef is overcooked, rough & tough like John Wayne. Although the desserts are thrown in by Management & I'd the yam paste which many highlighted... my verdict ... disappointed.\n\nWe'll 04 agreed that this'll be our 1st & last.\n\nWe had a team lunch at Sum Kee, was pretty disappointed with the taste and the price being charged especially the crab meat tofu, which is very little crab meat and the tofu portion is very small and bland, medium for $33.\nThe only great dish was salted egg chicken.\n",

But this is real light in taste but with strong herbs.\n\nSimply one of best mutton briyani you can find. Rem to ask for extra curry which fused with fragrant mutton flavor.\n\nThe usual stall that we have always patronised was not open on the day and thus we were given a good reason to try out the other popular stall in Telok Blangah Food Center. We remembered many of the diners enjoying their plate of Briyani from one of the Muslim stalls and guess it's our time to try it out now.\n\nAt one glance at the stall signboard, they are offering biryani and roti prata only. For Briyani, there is a choice of chicken or Mutton.\n\nWho needs a good presentation of the food when it tasted good? For both Chicken & Mutton Briyani, do expect the eye-pleasing serving that has a delicious drum or meat topping up the plate of Basmati Rice, papadum and colourful pickles to entice you. Instead, I would say what they prepared was a bare minimum, cut cucumbers, meat and rice with a plate of curry.\n\nThe first mouthful of the rice had landed me an understanding of why people are patronising them. No doubt that the food was simple and straightforward, I must say that their rice is very fluffy and non-greasy at all. There is no gamey taste from the mutton. The meat was tender and the meat literally fell off the bone with the slightest effort. I drenched my plate of Briyani with the curry gravy given and had enjoyed every grain of it.\n\nMutton Briyani - $6.50\n\nThe chicken Briyani too, was tender and delicious with meat falling apart easily. Curry was thick and satisfying.\n\nChicken Briyani - $6\n\nOverall, food is of the right amount of spice and not overpowering in any aspect of taste. I will be back again!\n\nI would have given them 5 stars if the biryani comes with papadum.\n\nVery thick and flavorful curry (both chicken and mutton). Both meat was cooked to almost perfection.\n\nVery fluffy basmati bryani rice. Not oily and delicious. Mutton was soft and tender.. curry have just the right touch of spices. Popular stall\n",

Everywhere else is selling at $4.50 or at most, $5.  $7!  It's really expensive!  I was really unpleasantly and uncomfortably surprised!\n\nBack to the mee goreng.  It doesn't taste the familiar mee goreng taste.  The sauce, was it chilli or tomato sauce? It taste a bit stale so I didn't want to take it.\n\nNoticed there were a lot more Mutton than the usual, so that's why it's $7.  BUT who pays $7 for a plate of fried mee goreng at the coffeeshop or food center?\n\nI wouldn't want to try anything else again, for I'll likely get another shock I'm not prepared for.\n\nGood luck guys. I wonder if the business can last.\n\nA nice coffee shop w a variety of food and all were pretty good!\n\nWe tried the stall selling ipoh food and their curry mee was really nice, especially the soup version. Beef noodles from Horiginal was really nice and not too gamey. The portion is really huge! Oyster omelette was not bad too.\n\n1 star for the drink stall. Ordered teh c and it tasted horribly diluted. Just a sip and I am done with it.\n\n3 stars as there are really quite a number of interesting food stalls here including the famous char kway teow supposedly with generous serving of cockles with a super long queue.

Have not been back since I shift out to Yishun 20 years ago. If not wrong they have been there since 1997-ish or earlier . Glad still found this stall around. Dad and son team dished out yummy dishes. Best chicken wing ever. They de-boned the chicken wing before frying. Eat with their fried bee hoon damn shiok! \u767d\u6682\u9e21also can eat.\n\nSurprise find in an old neighbourhood when we are looking for places that sell porridge near Vivocity area. Took away 1 bee hoon, 2 porridges (fish and chicken), 4 fried chicken wings & 1 cuttlefish cabbage. Taste super \u53e4\u65e9\u5473 and even my children who are 7 & 10 years old enjoyed the food. Very affordable comfort food. Will be back again though we live quite far away.\n\nGreat tasting congee and bee hoon. Easily the top ten in sg. Nostalgia old school taste that I misses a lot. The wings are Boneless and made upon order. A little oily though. Ps: I think one of the two uncles has some listening issues... Some customer may think he is being rude.\n\nAffordable and tasty food. Love their porridge that is silky smooth and their boneless chicken wings. Only available in the PM. Operated by a father and son who work on the orders separately and do not do small chats. Just make your orders and wait patiently because they are definitely introverts hahhaah\n",

                  "reviews": "\n\nFirst off, this uncle is such a pleasant, polite and friendly man! Not an ounce of arrogance despite being so popular. Truly admirable!\nAs for his char kway teow, it\u2019s one of the classic renditions still available.\nMore on the moist side, slightly sweet, a good amount of tasty crispy pork lard but not too much of the lard oil, which is good because it doesn\u2019t feel so sinful.\nReally good for cockle fans!\nBest eaten there.\n\nUncle is so sweet! He opened the stall a little early at around 4pm because there was already a \"sitting\" queue on a Saturday. Usually, he says it's around 5pm.\n\nIt's totally worth the craze- wok hey Kway Teow with crispy lard and delicious cockles. Only 1 size portion - $5 and max 10 per order.\n\nIf you are done, you can return the empty plate to the grey bin and the chopsticks to the smaller green bin.\n\nUncle also does his stall preparation is secret with the binds down. \ud83d\ude02\n\nPrepare for 1.5h queue. Uncle cooks plate by plate so each person about 10mins on average. One of the best CKTs I ever had in sg and is on the wet side. Pork lard very crispy and fragrant, stock used is sufficient. 1 size only at $5. The queue is too long for me to eat this again tho\n\nHand down one if not the best Char Kway Teow in Singapore! Came in $5 portion only. Plenty of fresh cockles and crispy pork lard in the noodle. Sometime you have to wait a hour or more if people in front order a lot of packets but it is definitely worth the wait! Uncle is soft spoken and friendly too!\n\nLong wait time as he fries each plate at a time. But puts in a lot of effort for each plate. No lap cheong but loaded with lots of cockles and bean sprouts. Five dollars per plate no more no less and so filling.\n",

                  "reviews": "\n\nRecommended by friend to this ckt. First time in this food centre. Very quiet and not many stalls open. Longest queue is here at this stall.\n\nWaited about 20mins with 8pax infront of me. Uncle fries 1 plate at a time but he is quite fast in my opinion.\n\nOrdered a $4 medium portion ckt and added an egg for 70cents.\n\nI was lucky to get an order with 2 egg yolks in my fried egg. Loved how strong the wok hei is in the noodles and the bits of pork lard mixed in it. Everyone ahead of me ordered with the extra fried egg and I can understand why. The gooey egg yolk mixed with noodles was heaven. Not to be missed.\n\nWill definitely be back to eat again.\n\nQueued close to one hour for this fire Char Kway Teow stall ran by two elderly folks. I saw this stall on Youtube which is recommended by a popular local food eater.\n\nThis kway teow noodle suits my taste bud perfectly because it is not too dry, the black soy sauce is not overpowering sweet. I suggest order $4 for a slightly bigger portion as $3 portion is really small serving. Sunny side up egg add on another 70 cents, but is runny egg yolk and also added with some soy sauce on top (see video). Too bad I didn\u2019t got the double egg yolk! Take note this stall doesn\u2019t include cockles which is perfect for me.\n\nThe food centre here is relatively spacious and airy. Queuing here is certainly not the most humid experience for sure. Plenty of seatings so no need chop table with tissue packet. Am surprise the people here are friendly for a chit chat about the food. They mentioned usually got no long queue for this stall.\n\nTaste is subjective!!! Hope your enjoy it. Do take note of their operation days.\n\nWent on a Sun morning at 11.30am and there was no queue - just one customer in front. The queue started forming from 11.50am ;-)\n\nThe CKT doesn\u2019t have much wok hey but, thankfully, was not oily. The $4 portion was a little small too for my liking. To me, not the best CKT for sure in SG. What\u2019s nice though is listening to the loud tunes of the song birds at the nearby pet bird shop while having the CKT!\n\nAbove average plate of CKT, it\u2019s definitely less sweet than usual but still flavorful especially with crispy pork lard and lap cheong! Just need to note that the sunny side up is an add-on to the price of the CKT (70cents) - honestly I feel the CKT could do without the additional egg!\n\nThere is no cockles in the dish but it is packed with decent amount of lup cheong and fried pork lard. Super shiok if you like them. I would feel it's well compensated for the absense of cockles and the taste isn't compromised. But if cockles is a must have for you in CKT then this place is probably not for you!\nAdd 70cents to have a sunny side up egg on your CKT. Super lucky to have double yolk for my first visit! Uncle cooks the dish plate by plate so do expect a small wait but the waiting time is ok for me.\n",

Place can get crowded during meal times.\n\nStanding itself at the wild west of jurong. A rare find if you are alone.\n\nLonely looking for some vibes before going home.\n\nTry this place. Still people from all walks are here. So you won't feel lonely. Drinking talking,\n\nTrying the bbq pork neck and of course goes with Chang beer.\n\nPeace.\n\nOverall dishes are tasty. Their pad Thai, Tom yam and deep fried garlic pork is a must try!\n\nPS: Just take note that there will be queue during dinner time. So do make your way there earlier to avoid the crowd.\n\nA place to go to when I have Thai Food craving. We always get a table as we visit on weekdays. Service staff are pleasant and friendly. Tasty Thai food which are reasonably priced with huge portion. Will be good for 4 pax or more if you would like to try more dishes.\n\nOur all time favorite is their fried pork cheeks which is only $12.\n\nTheir pricing on the menu is nett price, so i personally it cheap for such authentic Thai food adapted to local taste buds.\n\nThe crispy  pork cheek very nice. Go with Tom yum clear soup and mango salad. The yellow curry seafood smell fragrance and tasteful. Price affordable rate. Highly recommended as it really authentic Thai food.\n",

The waitress also took initiative to refill our Pu er tea and soup. Food was served promptly after ordering. Clean and spacious environment. A hidden gem in Taman Jurong!\n\nPretty nice BKT with 2 types of base soup for your preference. Impressed that they also have some tze char dishes for those who are not into BKT. Recommend that you get premium ribs since its easier to eat with tender meat. Soup are refillable - hurray! Prices quite reasonable but rice at $1. Finally being your own tissues because they charge for wet wipes.\nParking available since its at Taman Jurong Bowl. Will return for BKT craves.\n\nOne of my favourite place to host client, family and friend!\n\nNice food, environment and friendly staff!\n\nLove their herbal and white pepper bah ku teh, with unlimited (I guess?) soup refill!\n\nHave tried their other dishes, mostly ok for me, and their price are reasonable, for me is restaurant standard, coffee shop price, worth to try \ud83d\ude01\n\nYummy soup with free refill of soup only. We had nice peanuts and hard boiled eggs, fried chicken, bitter gourds with salted eggs\u2026 staffs are friendly and crowds are moderate at peak hours\u2026\n\nComfortable and spacious interior, suitable for families with kids.

For years they are having this problem and they can\u2019t seem to sort it out.\n\nService is a hit or miss. But for me it\u2019s generally good.\n\nHealthy and tasty food. Nice and clean environment, though now the seats are a bit too close to each other. Free top up of the soup once. Flavourful! Tried different dishes and so far very tasty.\n\nIG: sgfood13\nTiktok: gohht13\n\nService could be better. Food taste average. Used to have dimsum menu but sadly they removed it. You get a refill of the soup though( once ), which isn't allowed at other branch.\n\nUpdate Nov \u201822: Soup isn\u2019t as flavourful anymore, and a lot of the dishes were undercooked - chicken was red, pork rib was red, bitter gourd too tough.. dropping to 2 stars \u2b50\ufe0f\n\nCan\u2019t find any fault with the quality and taste of the food here, it\u2019s all wonderfully done.\n\nThere is also a 1 x free refill on all soups, which pretty much fills 60-70% of the bowl. Also, it\u2019s a good idea to takeaway the refill portion of the soup if you can\u2019t finish both bowls in one setting \ud83d\ude09\n\nHowever, the service level and price is a little off imo. (Or maybe we just weren\u2019t used to the GST and service charge after 4 months at home - $116 for 4 pax, you be the judge)\n\nDelicious and nurturing Chinese home dishes. Preferred the lotus root soup with more herbal taste than the chicken herbal soup which is too sweet. The homemade tofu is very good. Just soup and tofu with rice for 2 is very filling. Ordered 1 soup and 1 dish and get another soup free. Great bargain for a satisfying meal! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\n",

For sure you will go back again next.time.\n\nDelicious plate of chicken rice !  Delicious toufu too\n\nI am shocked that simple observation of this stall did not suggest how fantastic or tasty this chicken rice stall is. At 11.30, only 2 whole roasted chicken and 1 steamed whole chicken is seen. The workers at the stall look sleepy and unmotivated. I dare NOT buy cos I don't trust the reviews here.\n\nSo I first tried their chicken rice back in 2011 when a friend recommended it to me. I have been going back to this stall regularly to eat their chicken rice, the chilli is really good which compliments the chicken and the stall owner is really friendly as well, do give them a try you will not regret it.\n",

Food was good but the service was slightly slow as it was peak hour.\nWe spend a total of SGD 414 for 13pax which we thought was ok for the place.\n\nLeft with full stomachs and smiles on our faces!\n\nAlthough there are several outlets of Sanook Kitchen in Singapore, we feel that this outlet is better compared to the others in terms of the taste of the food and the attitude of the service staff. Complimentary popcorn was served before our meal. The food was served within minutes of ordering and every item was worth the price we paid. Great place to go for a casual lunch or dinner!\n\nNot the best Thai food I have tried, chicken pad Thai kinda tasteless but the texture of the noodle is still fine. Lemon tea less sugar taste better. Free pop corn is provided which is surprised for me. Staffs are friendly and helpful.\n\nThere are good selections of vegetarian options here! Price is pocket friendly and we love their stir-fries!! Spicy food here are super shiok too, great for people who love spicy food. And kids will be delighted with the free popcorns!\n\nIs my first time here after seeing the overall positive review. I am so sorry to say it doesn\u2019t taste anything like Thai food. We order the big fish but is too dry. Price range is affordable, but the fish is not cheap plus poor culinary skill, not worth ordering it. I don\u2019t need the popcorn honestly but kind gesture. Tried and done with it. Never going back.\n",

It's pretty popular and has a queue from time to time.\n\nDecided to do a takeaway for their fried hokkien mee. The noodles are the wet type, personally I prefer it this way as the noodles are coated with the gravy evenly. The noodles doesn't have a strong prawn taste, perhaps due to the lack of prawn stock. That said, the dish is well cooked with hints of wok hey charring some bits of the noodles. The dish is also generously topped with fried garlic bits that not only gives a great crunch but also accentuates the wok hey notes too. Interestingly, my order came with chilli sauce that has the real bits instead of sambal that's common elsewhere. But mind you, they pack a serious punch and complement the noodles well without flattening the noodles into a one dimensional dish.\n\nThe portion for the noodles are satisfying, but don't expect generous servings of prawns. My order came with just 2.\n\nOwner seems like a nice chap and do stop to chat when it isn't too busy.\n\nFood seems to hold up well as a takeaway!\n\nVisited in March 2021.\n",
