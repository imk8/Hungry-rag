The service was hospitable and genuine, no pretense despite being a Michelin-starred restaurant. Alex and Kim were friendly and was impeccable in their service. Food was amazing with unique combinations of fresh ingredients. Chef also came over to each table to interact which we felt was an awesome touch. Strongly recommended!\n\nWell deserved Michelin Restaurants.\nThe bread is so crispy on the outside and so so so soft on the inside. Pairing with the bordier butter, it is really exceptional.\nEvery dish of the food is amazing.\n\nThe service is so good. When the table is full of crumbs, the waiter will clean it up to sweep away the crumbs. The waiter are also friendly and knowledgeable about the dishes.\nWhen we found a bone in the fish and the chef came out to apologize. Felt the service was so good.\n\nThe atmosphere in the round room felt great too.\n\nOne of the best fine dining places I\u2019ve ever been to! I can\u2019t keep track of what was being served because there was just so many different courses, but each course was really tasty \ud83e\udd70 I don\u2019t think I\u2019m a small eater but I was so full by the last few courses, I don\u2019t think I ate any at all. Remember to pace yourself. I\u2019m most impressed by their bakes; their toasty black sesame bread was literally the best bread I\u2019ve ever had in my life.\n\nWhite Grass is a hidden gem, providing a distinctive dining venture with its fusion of Japanese and European flavors.\n\nEach dish is delectable, especially the bread, pastries, and desserts rank the finest that I ever tasted.\n\nThe real flower centerpiece adds a pleasant fragrance, and the stylish decor contributes to the overall charm, making it an excellent option for couples and hosting friends.\n\nOn my second visit, I can confidently say they consistently exceed my expectations.\n\nVery good ambience and attentive service. The bread is crispy outside and moist inside. Sesame bread is delicious too. Abalone is well done combined with the sauce and texture. The lobster meat is too soft for our liking. Everything is fine but no distinctive wow factor.\n\n\nOption: 2:\nName: Odette\nAddress: 1 St Andrew's Rd, #01-04 National Gallery, Singapore 178957\nPhone: 6385 0498\nDelivery Available: No\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: Closed\nTuesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20091:15\u202fPM, 6:30\u2009\u2013\u20098:15\u202fPM\nWednesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20091:15\u202fPM, 6:30\u2009\u2013\u20098:15\u202fPM\nThursday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20091:15\u202fPM, 6:30\u2009\u2013\u20098:15\u202fPM\nFriday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20091:15\u202fPM, 6:30\u2009\u2013\u20098:15\u202fPM\nSaturday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20091:15\u202fPM, 6:30\u2009\u2013\u20098:15\u202fPM\nSunday: Closed\n\nPrice Level: 4 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.7\nReviews: \n\nTried the 7 course meal for a celebratory lunch.\n\nThe food was great - loved the Maryuko Uni, smoked organic egg and the desserts. \u2018Blanc\u2019 the dessert was phenomenal.\n\nHowever, service was quite average. The waiters rushed through explanations of their dishes. And while they tried to entertain our questions about the dishes, the way that they did it was quite cursory and generally seemed quite reluctant to hold a conversation.\n\nMy first 3 star Michelin experience. I found the service a little stiff, as the evening progressed the staff loosened up a bit which was nice, everything was so extra, the presentation of the food was so interesting and exciting. The food was good but I can probably tick off this experience. Make sure you like seafood! A once and a lifetime experience!\nIt was pretty cool we got to meet the chefs after.\n\nI certainly had very high expectations of Odette, it having 3 Michelin stars and being #14 in The World's 50 Best Restaurants list at the time of the visit (november 2023).\n\nWell, fame is definitely not everything! From start to finish, what lacked was soul and personality, and the whole experience made me think reputation by terms of media and rankings might be increasingly decadent.\n\nTo start off, we were offered a small and uncomfortable-looking table right by the entrance door, even though I had reserved a table in the Private Dining Room over a month prior. We had to insist on being placed in the intended room.\n\nThe whole time, it felt like we were doing the restaurant a favor being there and I could sense so much pretentiousness in service, food and ambiance. The flavor and even the high quality ingredients were shadowed by this and the gimmicky presentations of the food.\n\nAt a USD 500/SGD 700 price point per person (without wine pairing), I most definitely cannot recommend\u00a0Odette to anyone.\n\nWhat a lovely and delicious evening out in Singapore. Service was what you would expect from a 3* establishments. All the dishes, from the butter to the pigeon, were out of this world. The staff was well orchestrated and did a great job of providing information on each dish and engaging us in conversation throughout the evening. Having been fortunate enough to dine at other 2 & 3* restaurants around the globe I would put this in my top 3 in a very close race with Mudec in Milan for number 1 and edging out French Laundry in terms of the menu. I will definitely try to secure another reservation next time I'm in Singapore.\n\nOdette has always been on my to-try list and this year I was treated to a birthday dinner here!\n\nAn amazing French experience savoring the 7-course meal. We were totally impressed by the presentation as well as the flavour of each dish. Not to mention the excellent and attentive service by the crew! It was also nice of them to gift a bottle of strawberry jam for every guest.\n\nAn unforgettable meal, or rather gourmet journey at this 3-starred michelin.\n\n\nOption: 3:\nName: Braci\nAddress: 52 Boat Quay, #05-01/ #06-01, Singapore 049841\nPhone: 6866 1933\nDelivery Available: No\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20091:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20091:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20091:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20091:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20091:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20091:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20091:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.5\nReviews: \n\nOur experience at Braci was probably one of our most memorable meals and the food served was truly deserving of its Michelin star. Would highly recommend getting the seven course menu as there were so many more elements in our dinner incorporated that made it all the more special. Flavours were all very well balanced and overall we left feeling very satisfied.\n\nVisited in Sep 2023\n\nBraci was on my list of restaurants to visit for over 4 years and I must say that it was worth the wait. It is no surprise that Braci has retained its Michelin 1 star for 6 consecutive years. The menu was a progressive one which is definitely inspired by Chef Mattie\u2019s Italian roots. There are 2 choices for people (5 course and 7 course). I would suggest people to go for the 7 course as the additional dishes in the 7 course meal are worth it. One of my favourite parts of the experience was trying out the 100 yr old balsamic vinegar.\n\nIf you\u2019re not taking the wine pairing, I would strongly recommend folks to try out a few of their cocktails, esp. their Negroni (one of the most unique ones I\u2019ve had)\n\nService was good. The restaurant is able to cater to some food allergies (like my shellfish allergy).\n\nA definite recommendation for fine dining lovers.\n\nAmazing time at Braci for a birthday celebration for my husband. The Italian food was superb with beautiful floral aesthetic to each dishes. Staff is polite and friendly too! Special thanks to Chef Matteo who is very engaging and make the day extra special! Love the black truffle \"hide and seek\" dish which is one of the highlights of all dishes! It so savoury and unforgettable\u2026.\n\nnice food nice atmosphere. i tot the service could be more positive. but i still enjoy the experience especially on a chill night in the rooftop. overall quite an expensive experience but they were very nice to add an additional anniversary dessert for us:)\n\nOther than the desserts and A5 miyazaki wagyu the rest is just average. Burnt A5 miyazaki wagyu comes with bitter taste. Would still recommend diners to top up and try the wagyu beef. If not you might get the duck which is just average.\nWaiter was coughing while serving so not sure if that is a good service.\nThe desserts is awesome and the balsamic vinegar is nice too.\n\n\nOption: 4:\nName: Nouri\nAddress: 72 Amoy St, Singapore 069891\nPhone: 9230 2477\nDelivery Available: Information Not Available\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: Closed\nTuesday: Closed\nWednesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nThursday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nFriday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nSaturday: 6:00\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nSunday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.6\nReviews: \n\nAn exceptional experience, very fortunate to have visited this unique restaurant last night. These folks have real flair, making the visit enjoyable from the moment we arrived. I think that I can relate to the chefs \u201ccross roads\u201d concept, an amazing set menu with elements from across the globe. Great wine pairing, loved hearing the story lines.  Loved the casual, relaxed atmosphere. Everything presented with confidence and fun.  Well deserving of its Michelin status.  Each course was remarkable, but I was particularly taken with the chocolate fish ball!\n\nI recently visited Nouri and I must say, the experience was outstanding. The food was absolutely delicious, with a unique blend of cross-cultural flavors that truly impressed my taste buds. From start to finish, every dish was beautifully presented and expertly prepared.\n\nThe renovated space is also fantastic, with a modern yet elegant atmosphere that adds to the overall dining experience. There is also a renewed chef table.\n\nThe service was top-notch and the staff was incredibly attentive. I highly recommend Nouri to anyone looking for an exceptional dining experience in Singapore.\n\nThank you, Nouri, for an unforgettable evening!\n\nThe owner did a wonderful service. We went in for lunch before our flight and the service was prompt and the food came out in a nice pace for lunch. The food was ok and this is my second time here. It has been consistent during the years. This is a nice spot to bring business guest for lunch as it is usually quiet during lunch in the area where most of the comparable restaurants may only open for dinner.  Yes, it is quite pricey.\n\nFood was great, service was great, atmosphere was great. It was relaxed and we had a good time over good food. All the options were presented to us so well; tea, opening drinks, etc. I was just slightly shocked that the selection of tea to end the meal costed $30ish per pot. But other than that, I enjoyed dinner.\n\nUnique flavors, warm, friendly service, beautiful plates, reasonably priced. Staff generously explained every dish and ingredients and an energetic open kitchen made for a memorable dining experience.\n\n\nOption: 5:\nName: Labyrinth Restaurant\nAddress: Raffles Ave., #02 - 23, Singapore 039802\nPhone: 6223 4098\nDelivery Available: No\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: Closed\nTuesday: Closed\nWednesday: 6:30\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 6:30\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:30\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:30\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:30\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.6\nReviews: \n\nVery mixed thoughts in Labyrinth. The restaurant is exactly as advertised - chefs take on Singapore food - however I didn\u2019t think it was necessary better than hawker stalls (especially if you consider the price). The other thing with the menu is it switched between hot and cold dishes too often (cold as in frozen). For example, the salad was cold, then the frog pie was hot, then the chili crab was partially cold, then switched to hot prawn mee, then the fish was even cold (I think the sauce not the fish itself)\u2026. And so forth.\n\nIt\u2019s so apt that this 1 Michelin starred restaurant is located within the Esplanade \u2014 Singapore\u2019s National performing art centre.\n\nHaving dinner here is like being treated to the whole Singaporean experience\u2026 not only showcasing the cuisine, but our culture and way of life. Will not spoil the surprise for u, but they go all out with the props here!\n\nIf u are visiting Singapore, I highly recommend this dining experience, which is not only delicious but highly-entertaining! We left the restaurant with our bellies full and very happy.\n\nLocals may balk at the high price we are paying for local favourites, but I think the creativity and presentation is worth a visit.\n\nCreative spin to local dishes, knowledgeable staff. Definitely an experience not to be missed!\n\nAlthough I\u2019d have preferred lesser influence from Japan, got confusing for a bit when dishes tasted like it\u2019s from Japan instead of Singapore.\n\nOverall a great experience and highly recommend!\n\nCrazy off the hook amazing experience at Labyrinth Restaurant. Singapore is blessed with so many incredible places to eat and Labyrinth is right at the top. The food is impeccable in terms of flavour and presentation, the service is on point and close to perfection, but it is the story and creativity that is infused through the entire dinning experience that transcends the gastronomic journey. I loved every minute and can\u2019t wait to go back for more. I now know why Labyrinth is #11 on the best Asian restaurant list for 2023, was awarded the highest climber award in 2023, and have 1 Michelin star.\n\n[Late review]\n\nVisited in May 2023\n\nA truly fantastic dining experience which beats some of the \u2018higher star\u2019 restaurants in Singapore (from a flavour and cuisine creativity perspective) quite comfortably in my view. Labyrinth\u2019s rise in recent Asia Best 50 rankings is well justified.\n\nThe dishes are a tribute to some of the classic Singaporean flavours and the menu does justice to the various inspirations (hawker food, old SG restaurants). The starting course (Roti Jon, Otah, Satay) set the tone and it just kept getting better. Every main course item from Chili crab to Prawn Noodle Soup to the Sizzling Plate Steak was exquisite. Among the dessert dishes, the Orh Nee preparation was fantastic.\n\nFor drinks, I did not go with the wine pairing and just ordered a few cocktails. Average cocktails and nothing exemplary.\n\nA 200% recommendation for all SG residents and visitors\n\n\nOption: 6:\nName: Lolla\nAddress: 22 Ann Siang Rd, Singapore 069702\nPhone: 6423 1228\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nSunday: Closed\n\nPrice Level: 3 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.4\nReviews: \n\nAbsolutely loved the food here. The sea urchin is terrific - we had the 1/2 portion with the pudding and it's more than enough as it's quite rich. The quail is a must order, so tender & juicy. Service is top notch. Although I will say that the cheesecake was just so so. Will definitely return soon. Easy to make reservations online\n\nall the chef standing there when preparing food are very friendly willing to talk to customers probably is close to all the chef at the counter seat , feeling very close and cozy, when enjoying food there.  floor staff are also friendly, since self pampering with friends there every tue , is like a canteen for us.  Expensive for a quick lunch, we always go back there for uni pudding & salad, is a place that food won\u2019t goes wrong have a stable quality.  All chef there not much break 3-5pm still need to prep for dinner.  Maybe not the food attract us but are the chef n waiter waitress we enjoy chitchat with them during our lunch very warm.\n\nThis restaurant is hands down one of the best, if not the best restaurant we have eaten at. The food was exquisite, the quality of the food was just incredible. The staff were lovely, chef Jo even come out to check on how the food was. Cannot recommend this place enough. My 9 year old even had her own 3 course menu just for her. Will definitely return when we are back in Singapore! Thank you to the team at Lolla \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude0d\n\nFood - good but for the price I\u2019d expect better quality. It\u2019s way too salty. That being said, nobody comes here for a healthy meal, perhaps\nService - five stars, attentive but not overdoing\nAtmosphere - need improvement on music choice, too loud and cannot hear conversation well\n\nThe course was very good. I particularly love the prawns and the potato bread. The mushroom with the broth was executed perfectly!  The chairs at the basement was uncomfortable and the room was a bit warm. Service was better when another senior staff took over the table.\n\n\nOption: 7:\nName: Rhubarb\nAddress: 3 Duxton Hill, Singapore 089589\nPhone: 8127 5001\nDelivery Available: No\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:15\u202fPM, 6:30\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:15\u202fPM, 6:30\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: Closed\nThursday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:15\u202fPM, 6:30\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:15\u202fPM, 6:30\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:15\u202fPM, 6:30\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nSunday: Closed\n\nPrice Level: 4 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.6\nReviews: \n\nVisited in Jul 2023\n\nThe last time I had visited Rhubarb was 4-5 years ago. So a revisit was a long time coming. Good food and great service as always. There are 3 options/dining experiences you can choose from. I went for the most comprehensive one - 3 starters, 1 main with chef\u2019s premium ingredient and 1 dessert.\n\nWhile I can see how Rhubarb has been able to maintain its 1 star for so many years, I struggled a bit to find some key differentiating factor versus other French contemporary Michelin places. Good food nonetheless.\n\nService was really good. The dishes kept coming fast and I was done with my entire dinner in an hour.\n\nAll in all a very good dining place. If you haven\u2019t been there, it is definitely worth going.\n\nThe 4-course lunch Omakase was very very satisfying, with interesting notes and flavours that I\u2019m pleasantly surprised by. I also really enjoyed my chat with Joseph as a solo diner, so that my lunch was a little livelier. I had an absolutely lovely time and would return again.\n\nDecided to go last min as I suddenly met a long time friend. She said she didn\u2019t want to eat something too heavy. The starters were mainly seafood and fruits, which opened up her appetite after a full day of hard stress work. The main was a tender slowed cooked beef. Dessert was a coconut sorbet I think (?). Accompanied the meal with a Riesling. We quite enjoyed the night.\nFunny note, one of the appetisers is a mix of fruits and seafood, I confused the apple with an olive. The taste was good though. Please don\u2019t change the dish because of my comment.\n\nFood are all tastefully plated and delicious. They were kind to ask me if I have dietary restrictions and I told them I would like to have all cooked food. So they made changes for me to replace the lightly torched scallops to cooked crab stick for appetiser. Really appreciate it:) every dishes were all well explained and executed.\n\nOutstanding food, worth its Michelin star. Service is friendly. The atmosphere is a little bit let down by the lighting and impersonal musical background. Overall a very nice place to have an amazing meal.

Everything was really original and tasty. Special mention for the main courses which were amazing, espacially the Mussels one. I was also quite surprised, in a good way, by the wines. The only thing I can say is that it was a little too cold in the room for me. Thank you very much for the experience.\n\nThe dining experience was very enjoyable. I thought the overall ambience and plating / presentation were 10/10. What stood out most was the hospitality. The staff noted it was my husband\u2019s birthday and gave a little something which was thoughtful and useful - a little goodie bag comprising samplers of Irish cream, the very same bacon butter that came with the soda bread in the menu, and a useful fridge magnet with the recipe of the said bread. Such a nice way to remember the meal by!\n\nVisited in Oct 2023 as part of the SG Restaurant Week\n\nGood starters where my favourite was the treacle bread. The foie gras br\u00fbl\u00e9e was also decent. Among the mains I really liked the beef preparation and also the fish & squid laksa. The meal rounded off with a couple of very nice dessert items. The \u201cIrish Cloud\u201d dessert was particularly good.\n\nAll in all, Cure is a very solid restaurant and should be on your F&B places to visit in SG.\n\nWe had the Restaurant Week lunch set. The meal was a 6 course meal with add on for an extra mains and cheese platter. You can also add on extra for wine pairing.\n\nThe appetiser consisted of 3 small snacks. The Soda Stout Treacle bread with butter was soft and served hot and the fkavours was a delicate balance of savoury and sweet.\n\nThe 2nd appetiser consisted of their rendition of Tayto, which had a potato skin with soft cheese, and captured the flavour of potato crisps.\n\nThe next appetiser was pig head cheese wrapped with cabbage. Light texture and flavour.\n\nThe main course of wagyu  beef was nicely plated, and we really like the flavours of the sauce. Beef was also perfectly cooked rare/med rare, but the portion size was a bit small.\n\nThe dessert Irish Cloud was one of the star dishes, it had a white chocolate outer shell with vanilla cream and basil sherbert. The flavours  are light and allows the ingredient flavors to blend with each bite.\n\nService and ambience was also good overall, small restaurant, with enough space between each table, and acoustic panels also helped dampend any noise.\n\nThe service staff was attentive and introduced each item on the menu\n\nExcellent and innovative creations from beginning to end.\n\nWe started with the Soda, Stout and Treacle Bread.  Oh what and experience it was as it came with butter that had bacon bits and black onion powder infused in it.  The bread, served nicely warm, looked like a muffin and had great texture.\n\nThe Tayto Cheese & Onion was a tad too small, so could not taste the potato, nor cheese nor onion.\n\nThe Lovage & Jameson Soft Serve Asparagus Morel was like a tiny ice cream cone, delightful and playful.  Morels were made into a Ragu mousse and hidden deep in the cone.\n\nA family favorite was the Salmon, Juniper & Seaweed which had Japanese influence, as salmon was cured for 3 days, then wrapped with seaweed and covered with crusty bread crumbs deep fried.  This was really a winner and we could eat 10 each, if given a choice.\n\nQueen Scallop, Cider, Horseradish was a refreshing dish with icy yuzu taste, like a palate cleanser.\n\nThe Porridge of Sea Urchin was lovely, with generous amount of sea urchin and barley porridge covered with a beef tartare, another crowd pleaser.\n\nThe 7 Tales of the Fox & Silver Duck was a good mains.  With duck in 4 renditions, foie gras custard and green apple, chewy ball, crispy tart and duck meat with mulberries.\n\nChildhood Memories of Peat was interesting.  Like eating charcoal.\n\nShanty\u2019s Whip Citrus Custard is a fruity sweet custard.\n\nWe topped up with Tipperary Brie Cheese, Onion Eccles.  Brie was nice and Eccles was amazing!\n\n\nOption: 9:\nName: Shinji by Kanesaka\nAddress: 29 Tanglin Rd, Singapore 247911\nPhone: 6884 8239\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSunday: Closed\n\nPrice Level: 4 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.6\nReviews: \n\nI have been in shinji two times but my previous visit was excellent! we had long omakase. the sequence were balance, materials are fresh and excellent quality of freshness. two kind of uni were also still firm (not watery). I think that would be better if some \u201caburi\u201d are added, that would give some equisite medley on the whole omakase. special sake for shinji was well presented with balance, elegant body and fruity. well served by the chef that can speak little indonesian that made us even relax, the waiter is very attentive. thank you for an excellent gourmet and services.\n\nHad the 15 course sushi and enjoyed it very much. Highlights for me were the Chutoro, Aji, Shiro ebi and Uni. The Chef and staff were very hospitable and I look forward to my next visit!\n\nAmazing omakase experience with fresh ingredients. It's one of the best i have in singapore so far (and I've had a lot!). The uni is to die for.\n\nThat's the Japan standard you should be talking about in Singapore. The price tag matches with the quality they delivered. I have never tasted such refined Japanese foods in Singapore before. Shinji may be able to go up against some of the best sushi restaurants in Japan. Chefs are well trained and able to converse in English fluently.\n\nThey even surprised me with the desserts in the Omakase menu which usually people don't pay attention to. I would definitely visit again soon.\n\nInadequate service staff. Turned amazing gourmet experience into a very bad experience! I suggest everyone who goes there CHECK YOUR BILL!\n\nI went for lunch Omakase chef special. The waitress only mentioned to me, it will be $350 and plus. I said it is ok. But she never mentioned where this plus comes from. Automatically everyone in SG would understand it as service charge.\n\nIn the end I received a bill of $400++, which got me very confused. And first waitress explained to me the price is decided by chef. Second one came to me, said, I told you, it is going to be more than $350.\n\nWell I only said ok to $350 but not $400. On the menu it says \u201cplease specify a cap if you wish.\u201d Instead apologies for her miss communication, she started pointing finger at me arguing it was my mistake not mentioning the cap. She told me \u201cI SAID, it will be more than $350, everywhere in singapore it is PLUS PLUS so \u201cA PLUS\u201d means chef decides how much you pay.\u201d\n\nWhoever would go to a $350 and more lunch would never care about $50 more, however her attitude of justifying her mistake and miscommunication, push the responsibility to customer is definitely revolting.\n\nThe argument waitress had with me was ugly, not only an embarrassment to me but also an embarrassment to the chef, and to other customers who were still eating!\n\nI left the counter to the reception with my dignity not to continue the embarrassment.\n\nIn the end the accountant charge me $350, which wasn\u2019t the best solution. She should have removed the service charge of the waitress.\n\nNo one who goes to this kind of restaurant care about paying more, $350 or $400 aren\u2019t much different. But it has to be properly explained, not by how much restaurant wishing to charge!\n\nFood was great, in the end I left without chef\u2019s gratitude. It wasn\u2019t a complete meal, and service doesn\u2019t qualify as Omakase.\n\nSuggestion to the restaurant:\n1. Notify customer how much more it will be, be clear in advance!\n2. When the miscommunication happens, it\u2019s definitely the waiting staff\u2019s responsibility! Don\u2019t blame the customer! Especially not at Sushi counter!\n\n\nOption: 10:\nName: Iggy's\nAddress: 581 Orchard Rd, Level 3 voco Orchard Singapore, an IHG Hotel, Singapore 238883\nPhone: 6732 2234\nDelivery Available: No\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: Closed\nTuesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20091:30\u202fPM, 6:30\u2009\u2013\u20098:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20091:30\u202fPM, 6:30\u2009\u2013\u20098:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20091:30\u202fPM, 6:30\u2009\u2013\u20098:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20091:30\u202fPM, 6:30\u2009\u2013\u20098:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20091:30\u202fPM, 6:30\u2009\u2013\u20098:30\u202fPM\nSunday: Closed\n\nPrice Level: 4 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.3\nReviews: \n\nOne - starred Michelin restaurant located within Voco Hotel (previously known as Hilton Orchard), serving Modern-Contemporary cuisine,established by Restaurateur-Sommelier Ignatius Chan in 2004. There is heavy influence of japanese ingredients used in the menu and served in the European way. Opt for the menu with two main courses for a wholesome dining experience. Food presentation is beautiful and tastefully presented, and what's good to look at is also good to eat.\n\nLovely experience.  Good service and attentive staff. Well deserved Michelin star with the food. Has fantastic courses paired with champagne. Air- conditioning is way too cold and freezes everyone. Any warm dish turns cold too quickly. Dessert was also a star and did not let down the entire course of dinner. Felt the staff could have been more confident in introducing each course.\n\nCame here to celebrate our anniversary, a surprise dinner planned by my husband for us. The restaurant is intimate with only a few tables available, so you get undivided attention from the staff. It is also an open kitchen concept which I love so you can see the chefs hard at working preparing their masterpieces for us. I enjoyed pretty much every single dish, the abalone wellington was definitely unique and one of a kind. Overall had a really good experience here.\n\nHad our belated anniversary lunch at Iggy\u2019s as we were having a staycation at Hilton. A lovely resturant with friendly and helpful crew. Love the fact that we are able to view how the chef and his team prepared our meals to the kitchen.\n\nAs the husband and I do not take raw fish, the chef was able to customize to our taste by searing the fish, love how the raw yolk enhances the overall taste of the dish. They did an interesting take on the sponge gourd which brought the vegetable to another level. The linguine was average. The roast beef has charred edges which was a nice touch. Overall we enjoyed the 5 course meal at $150++ per pax.\n\nCame here for lunch with 2 overseas guests who would like to taste a Michelin restaurant.  Decided to bring them to Iggy's as the restaurant has been one that has been keeping their reputation for years. Food was great as you can see in pictures.. perhaps ..some touch up to the interior may make the place feel warm and friendly.\nDamage : $200 (lunch)/pax\n",

What an exceptional feast! Our guests were very impressed by the size and freshness of the crabs. They also enjoyed the prawns.\n\nI personally loved the herbal soup that the prawns came in. I also ladled the yummy gravy from the chilli crab dish into my fried rice and polished off 2 bowls in that fashion.\n\nThere was also a particularly yummy toufu & vegetable dish that I enjoyed. I would certainly order that again.\n\nWhilst we were there I ran into other friends who were also hosting their overseas visitors so I guess this is the place to be in these situations. A really big draw is the wonderful view right outside the restaurant and opportunity to walk along One Fullerton after the heavy meal!\n\nTo  Ms  May\nThe taste was good, but the male staff was the worst. Don't talk about JCB behind your back among floor staff. They will serve you beer without permission, and if you ask for extra towels, it will cost you $1.60, but is that okay? Please feel free to make fun of me.\n\nActually it was my third or fourth time visit . Perfect location, fresh seafood and great service . We visited for company dinner we took one of our colleagues from Japan during their short business trip. They were all happy and we enjoyed a lot . Since the place is big, I noticed some service (like beverage service) were little slow however they tried and gave us great services from bottom of their heart . Especially one of the service staff Ms. WanYi helped us a lot. She tried her best whenever  we needed their assistance and I liked her sincere warm service .

For cajun flavoured crab combo, never expect the spicy version to be so spicy. I personally feel less spicy will be good enough. Brought my own cake, thanks for the decoration, very cute.\n\nThis was highly recommended by a local as they offer a good variety of shellfish dishes. We ordered black pepper crab, crab cakes, chili crab with rice cakes, fried mushroom, and my personal favourite the rice with lobster bisque. It was a lovely take on Chinese congee but westernized. We ordered way too much food in advance and it will be better for the restaurant to advice if the food is too much for 7 pax proactively vs us over ordering. Overall the team had fun indulging the food.\n\nDine for 3 pax for dinner. Ordered the mixed w crab, prawns, oyster, etc. in cajun sauce, too spicy.  We also add the crispy octopus (not crispy at all). Bill close to $150 w UOB card we got $20 discount. Overall, it's a good place if your craving for crab & seafood.\n\nWe went here after getting the 50% off from Chope. The prices here are expensive so worth trying if got discount 'coz they serve really nice bag of seafood. The bag is good for 2-3 pax and have a lot of ingredients. The sauce or seasoning was right on spicy and very flavorful. Really enjoyed eating with the hand to licking the sauce off you fingers. It was so good.\n\nThe staff are also very friendly and attentive. They give you utensils if you need them while eating.\n\nThis is an interesting concept of an American seafood joint but with a Singaporean twist. The flavours are unique to Singapore with local favourites like chilli crab blended into traditionally American dishes. A great place for sharing and the food is quite good as well.\n\n\nOption: 3:\nName: Greenwood Fish Market @Bukit Timah\nAddress: 34 & 38 Greenwood Ave, Singapore 289236\nPhone: 6467 4950\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 3 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.5\nReviews: \n\nThe chargrilled fish dishes are quite nice.\nThe calamari was great as well.

It\u2019s our first time here and we were unsure what to order, but Robin was very helpful and informed us of a few items for us to consider. We ordered the Madai fillet with a pepper sauce and Beef. Fish had a delicious, flaky tender flesh and came in a good portion size. Beef had an uneven cook throughout but still rather enjoyable, retaining the juicy and succulent meat.\n\nWe were given a cozy booth table and spend a lovely evening chatting. The service staff was very courteous. The place does feel a little smoky and could do with some better ventilation but still would recommend.\n\nReally long queue so expect a waiting time, loved that you can pick almost any fish available and style to cook it in, lots of choices for the fish and oyster. I went for fish and chips, calamari and fresh oyster, all ingredients was crazy fresh, however wished the fish and chip was a little more crispy. My favourite dish was the calamari\n\n\nOption: 4:\nName: Chin Huat Live Seafood\nAddress: 105 Clementi Street 12, Sunset Way, #01-30, 120105\nPhone: 6775 7348\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: Closed\nWednesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.3\nReviews: \n\nThe food and service are excellent with every visit.

The pork ribs was very tender and it's a recommended dish. We had the dungeness crab and the meat was firm. Drunken prawns is always a must to order when we are there. Definitely no regrets to the food that we ordered. Not to mention, service was good and thank you!\n\nEnjoyable dining experience. Food is fresh and seasoned well. We loved the Salted egg Eggplant, especially the salted egg sauce (thick and flavourful, felt like you\u2019re slapped with salted egg in all directions). Prawns were very fresh and juicy. Crabs were well-seasoned. We loved both the black pepper and golden sauce seasonings. The Eefu noodles was just average. Coconut pudding dessert was the best way to end the meal \ud83d\ude0b\n\nMy mum told me this stall have been here for many years. The foods are good, seafood taste nice and fresh too. The menu show a lot of variety and mostly in text, so to prepare to read through the menu as the prices are a bit on high side. However the portion are big and service are excellent. The waiter Mr Bon from Philippines can speak many dialects and madarine. The waiter and waitress serve us very well. The crabs is the star so prepare to pay for it. The drinks are expensive too.\n\nBest place for live seafood. Live tanks is always full and many choices. Reasonable price and friendly services. Remember to book on weekends and festive periods. Especially Remember to order gaint crabs in advance. The big sizes always sold out fast.\n\n\nOption: 5:\nName: The Boiler @ Esplanade Mall\nAddress: 8 Raffles Ave., #01-13A, Singapore 039802\nPhone: 6909 3435\nDelivery Available: Information Not Available\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.9\nReviews: \n\nDecided to come here based on the location to the hotel so we were pleasantly surprised. The Boiler is definitely worth its salt and deserving of its accolades. Served by the friendly Gabrielle, she offered great advice on the menu without being pushy. She was thoughtful, opportunistically entertaining our little one whilst we devoured our meal. We went for the duo combo with the raging hot sauce and good old fish and chips for the little one. The aroma in the restaurant is the first tell tale that the food is going to be good and it definitely delivered! Was cooked perfectly and delicious! Will definitely be back before the holiday is over\ud83d\udc4c\n\nAmazing service by Lee for my husband\u2019s birthday, we even got a free Boston lobster which is a great addition! Love the bottomless ice lemon tea too which Lee very nicely refilled promptly for us. Lee made our dinner so much more enjoyable, he also offered to help us take photos when he saw us struggling to take one. Thanks for the amazing time!\n\nThere is a reason this place is so highly rated. The seafood was so fresh and flavourful, I just wish I could have tried more. Loved the clams especially but I should have gone for the spicy sauce!\n\nSimply a must try but I would add that they should add potatoes to the boil too!\n\nWe just had our family birthday dinner at The Boiler Esplanade Restaurant, and I can't say enough good things about it. Their crab seafood is mouthwatering - fresh, flavorful, and cooked to perfection. What's more, during your birthday month, they offer a complimentary lobster, which was an unexpected and delightful surprise.\n\nThe icing on the cake was the friendly service. The staff made us feel right at home, and their recommendations were spot on.\n\nOverall, The Boiler Restaurant is a gem. If you're a seafood lover and want a fantastic dining experience with a bonus lobster during your birthday month, this place is a must-visit. I'll definitely be back!\n\nCelebrated my friend\u2019s birthday at The Boiler @ Esplanade Mall, and they gave us an amazing experience as first time customers.\n\nWe were welcomed by friendly staff and assisted us immediately to our table. Shout out to KJ Lee for providing an excellent service from start to finish. And to David too for surprising our friend with a birthday Oreo Cheesecake.\n\nThe highlight of our visit was of course their Bombdiggity Bag which had prawns, mussels, clams, smoked sausages, sweet pearl corns and buns. We also added Boston Lobster for an extra boost. I also wanted to emphasize how crazily good their sauce was.\n\nWho wouldn\u2019t come back in this place with good staff and people?

Worth the price! 2 crabs for $38. Huge portion, just nice for 2 people. We also ordered the fried squid, $14 for small size. Be careful not to enter the wrong one, there's a seafood restaurant with the same advertising as this place!\n\nReasonable tze char prices at comfortable setting. Also have appropriate posters on wall, very suitable for birthday dinners with family. More options for crabs if you are in bigger group. Crab meat is fresh and sweet, liked all the dishes that we ordered, even forgotten to take 2 more photos for another 2 dishes cos busy eating \ud83e\udd2dThanks the patient staff for help clearing tables and making space for birthday \ud83c\udf82\n\nThe crabs were quite value for money but the meat could have been better. The salted egg gravy was too sweet. Chilli sauce was too spicy. Guinness pork ribs were too small in portion, too sweet and fatty. Salad ice plant was rather pricey. Service was good though.\n\nReally really well-priced crabs and yummy tze char dishes!\n\nThe chilli crab wasn't too sweet which I liked and the vermicelli version soaked up the crab juices well though it may come off slightly bland to some, but nothing a little chilli can't rectify\n\nSpecial mention for the guinness pork which I had zero expectations for as I usually don't like proteins tossed in sauce but their pork has a 1:1 ratio of meat and fat which was right up my alley\n\nRecommend making a reservation before heading down as the space is small!\n\nCrabs are fresh and delicious! We ordered all flavours except chilli and everything was equally delicious! Plus the best fried aubergine ive ever had!

The food overall was good and it came out fast with the exception of the last main dish- Irish roast duck- After waiting a long time we asked about it and it was discovered our duck was served to another table. It was reordered again for us.\nThe black pepper flavour was too much black pepper and spicy for my taste. It was like too much black pepper on your food. Perhaps it would be more balanced if the crab was served with the fried rice instead of after.\nPortions are fairly small.\nIt should be noted that at the restaurant, you are charged for the peanuts (tidbits on the bill) given to you upon seating and also for cold tap water.\nIt seems to be a common occurrence to be charged for tap after at restaurants in Singapore\n\nhave been coming here since i was a kid. the service is great. recommend the white\npepper crab and the dong bo pork ribs. (you must specifically ask for the ribs as it\u2019s not on the menu).\nit can smell quite fishy sitting near the live seafood but it\u2019s all part of the experience, seeing alaskan crabs try to climb their way out \ud83e\udd23\nthe garlic broccoli dish was $30 for one floret, please have your fill of veg before coming..\n\nnot great for wheelchair users. so many steps and sharp corners. service to serve food is quick. ordered pepper and curry crab. they are okay. no depth in the sauce. the rest are nice.\n\nExpatriates hotspot. Atmospheric location. Food is very tasty but also only for people with deep pockets. Multiple options for crab types and flavours. The chili crabs that I ordered come with huge arms. Their mango dessert is great too. Reservations strongly recommended, touristy restaurant too.

But I am glad the service and service recovery were pretty commendable.\n\nWe booked a private room today for a small event.\nOrdered 4 crabs with 3 ways of cooking styles.\nThe chili crab was great as usual.\nSalted egg crabs were less tasty and underwhelming\nThe steamed crab was not fresh and smelled bit stale. Told the service staff and he brought it back to the chef and was told it\u2019s the wine used. I eaten this before and I am sure the stale smell is definitely not because of the wine. It\u2019s just not fresh. I don\u2019t pay $100+ for a crab with a funny taste and risk food poisoning my guests.

Always consistent quality of the crab. They took extra time to ensure that the fish was presented fully. Innovative yam scallop rings. Overall nice dinner with birthday celebration. Walked in.\n\nExcellent service and food. Must order chilli and black pepper crabs. This outlet never fail to impress, the quality has been consistently top tier. Wang Li Xin has been really attentive - my mum requested for quieter corner table instead of at the entrance, and she immediately change it for us.\n\nThe seafood here is really fresh and juicy.

The relaxed ambiance with soft lighting and comfortable seating added to the inviting atmosphere.\nIn conclusion, Joie offers an exceptional dining experience with attentive service and delicious food. I highly recommend it to anyone seeking a memorable culinary adventure. I can't wait to visit again.\n\nMy first time trying vegetarian fine dining, the foods were surprisingly good! The waitress , Kelly, was very professional, she explained the dishes to us and also show us the right way to enjoy the dishes. The main dishes , mushroom steak and risotto were very impressed too. I will definitely come back again.\n\n\nOption: 2:\nName: Lotus Vegetarian Restaurant\nAddress: 103 Irrawaddy Rd, #02-07 Royal Square@Novena, Singapore 329566\nPhone: 8668 0090\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.3\nReviews: \n\nWe are not vegetarian but what is not to like? This place makes eating too enjoyable. The food is very very delicious and the service staff are very very attentive. Super recommendation coming from a pure meat and seafood lover.\n\nPetai - great sambal chili fried with a whole plate of goodness\n\nOlive fried rice - we had two plates, one after the other, enough to justify the deliciousness of the dish\n\nCurry 'mutton' - good curry but something seems to be lacking in the flavour\n\nSalted egg yolk - we had two plates of this too\n\nGlutinous yam (suan pan zi) - delicious? We had four plates of this.\n\nIt is in my personal humble opinion that you are missing out on very good food if you have not tried this as a vegetarian.\n\nFood is OK. The grilled mala fish is good! Impressive imitation of the texture very close to the real fish version.\nSatay is also nice.\nThe rest are so so. Kids says favourite truffle fried rice that is usually fragrant at other places has no truffle taste. Frankly, I prefer the high tea at their other outlet.\n\nVery delicious meal here! Portion is big price is reasonable. The fish is a must have! Very tasty \ud83d\ude0b I\u2019m a meat lover and I thoroughly enjoyed myself at this vegetarian restaurant. Good job to the chef! Staff was attentive.\n\nCelebrated our friend's birthday dinner at Lotus. It was indeed a great choice we've made and no regrets too. Food was well prepared and delicious. Atmosphere was chill and clean. Will come back again.\n\nWe came just to try the Grilled \"Fish\" and we were not disappointed albeit the flavour we chose does not resemble much of the original \u70e4\u9c7c. It was still tasty and we would want to return to try the other flavours. The other dishes were also pretty good. The tofu box was really interesting with some diced mushrooms that provide an unusual taste and texture. The spinach in superior broth was done really nicely it tasted so premium. Tau Kwa Goreng was perfectly fried but a little spicy for me.\n\nWe were seated near a cabinet and discard trolley where staff kept walking to & fro, sometimes talking over our heads as they reach for stuff. Pretty unpleasant and lack of service etiquette.\n\n\nOption: 3:\nName: Gokul - Raas Vegetarian Restaurant\nAddress: 19 Upper Dickson Rd, Singapore 207478\nPhone: 6396 7769\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 10:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 10:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 10:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 10:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 10:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 10:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 10:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.2\nReviews: \n\nPrice: $6.54 (Plain Thosai)\n\nPlain Thosai: 5/5\nThosai was very crispy, savoury and slightly sour.\n\nSambar: 5/5\nSambar was flavourful, savoury, hearty and had a good lentil taste.\n\nChutney: 5/5\nOrange chutney was tangy, sweet and spicy. White chutney was coconuty and spicy.\n\nTotal score: 15/15\n\nAdd-ons: Masala Tea ($4.16) was fragrant from the spices used and warm and comforting to drink.\n\nThere was a little waiting time but it was definitely worth the wait as the plain thosai was very delicious. From the thosai to the sambar and the two different chutney. Service team were really responsive to requests and new orders.\n\nThe place was brightly lit and a cozy place to have your Indian vegetarian classic as well as your familiar Singaporean dishes with a vegetarian twist.\n\nPerfect if you visit with friends/family as you can order various things from the menu and share them together. Our favorites are the biryani and butter naan. Read many reviews saying that the carrot cake is a must try but it didn\u2019t really suit our palettes. The samosas are tasty but not very special. The lychee drink is refreshing, really helps after a long walk exploring the city. Would definitely visit again on our next trip to SG.\n\nThe first time I went there, I had the vegetable briyani, Gobi 65, Aloo Gobi and mango lassi. The food was good and the lassi was awesome, don\u2019t fade the lassi.\n\nThe second time that I went there, I had the fried carrot cake, murtabak and Gobi Manchurian and I\u2019ll say to skip the Gobi Manchurian as the cauliflower was almost non-existent and I was just eating a lot of batter. The fried carrot cake is decent for an vegan take as it is not commonly available and the murtabak is alright but can be skipped.\n\nFood was really nice. Enjoyed the dishes! The service can be improved, we were more or less asked to leave the moment we finished our food. We understand that they have limited seating and a queue but just felt rushed.\n\nGood variety on the menu but I do find it moderately highly priced. Service was typical yet they really do have interesting things on the menu with Chinese and muslim influence. It has its own character but I do very much prefer pure Indian cuisine. It\u2019s nice for the occasional change. Location was good, walking distance to the Little India train station and restaurant is clean and cool with air conditioning.\n\n\nOption: 4:\nName: Ananda Bhavan Restaurant (Vegetarian)\nAddress: 95 Syed Alwi Rd, Singapore 207671\nPhone: 6398 0837\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 7:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 7:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 7:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 7:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 7:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 7:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 7:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 3.8\nReviews: \n\nFood is good, Service is good too. A little improvement can be done in the seating area and hygienic. They could have much better crowd comming in with that.\n\nVisited Anand Bhavan, opposite to Mustaffa after a long time few years later. I always recommend to visit and try their menu. This is Indian Vegetarian Resturant, better to try their tiffins items rather than rice items. Service will be quick, though there was a huge rush, served within 10 mins. Tired their Masala Rava Dosa, Mini Sambar Idly, Sambar Vada, Onion Uttappam and Poori set, and all\nOf them tasted good. Sambar have lot of Brinjals only instead they can add lot of other vegetables also.\n\nWrong decision to visit this place and worst was to ask for take away. Just wanted to get idly set take away and thought that it would be fast. But unfortunately, waited for about 30 minutes after payment was made. The place has kitchen next to the washroom entrance and it was smelly and very unpleasant to stand there to wait for my order to be delivered to me. Overall, not very clean place to visit. Observed many foreigners there who might be looking for only vegetarian food and had limited choice rather to be there. I am sure it could be managed better in terms of cleanliness, service, order management for simple stuff. However, I was there after many years and may take me another few years to step in again.\n\nPrice: $3.60 (Plain Thosai)\n\nPlain Thosai: 5/5\nThosai was savoury, crispy, soft and had a good sour flavour.\n\nSambar: 4.5/5\nSambar was savoury, flavourful, a little sweet from the vegetables and familiar tasting.\n\nChutney: 5/5\nThe orange chutney was flavourful, tomatoey and a little spicy. The white chutney was quite gingery and sweet from the coconut. The brown chutney tasted peanuty, savoury and was rather spicy.\n\nTotal score: 14.5/15\n\nAdd-ons: Masala Tea ($2.60) was fragrant, warm and comforting but could use more spices.\n\nService was fast and I received my thosai within 5 minutes. It will be quicker to get your drinks directly from Counter 1 at the restaurant as they seem slightly short-handed in the drinks area. The lady managing counter 1 is really nice and makes your drinks after seeing your receipt. I saw this as a good thing since I could decide when I wanted to have my masala tea instead of having it served while I was having my thosai.\n\nThe place was air conditioned and the place can get crowded and is a really bustling place near lunch time.\n\nAll in all, I enjoyed my brunch of thosai and masala tea at Ananda Bhavan Restaurant (Vegetarian). :)\n\nOne of the popular South Indian breakfast places of Singapore. The food preparation is Tamil style and quantity is apt.\n\nOverall the taste, quality and hygiene was good and rates were genuine.\n\n\nOption: 5:\nName: LingZhi Vegetarian @ Liat Towers\nAddress: 541 Orchard Rd, #05-01 Liat Towers, Singapore 238881\nPhone: 6734 3788\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 3 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.3\nReviews: \n\nThe presentation of the set meal is particularly exquisite and delicious.

Make advance reservations to avoid waiting for a table.\n\nFrequent goer of this place and food has always been up to standard. though not as affordable as in the past, but worth it for the taste.

They have a good variety of different dishes to choose from, either as individual portion or meant to share. The dishes that we ordered tasted good. Also they have some selection of interesting beverages. There are also a variety of tea to choose from. Overall, a good place for a meal if you are vegetarian or want to eat vegetarian food.\n\nFriendly services provided by the staff.The staff were accomodating to our seat and food request. They also offered to help us take a group photo. There are a wide range of food available on the menu. When we were undecidable on the pizza flavours, the staff recommended two of their most popular flavours - BBQ pizza and pesto pizza. We thoroughly enjoyed both pizzas. Overall, the food was delicious even for some of us who are non-vegetarians. Highly recommend iVegan!\n\nI had few different mains here from asian to western.\n\nI would recommend their black bean burger. The house made patty goes very well with the rest of the ingredients. See picture. The sauce pairs well too. The sweet potato fries are seasoned  just right, not too heavy. Salad refreshes the palette. I also tried their bbq mushroom sandwich with the same sides and different sauce (mayo). It was decent.\n\nFor the guacamole sushi, it is unique and worth a try.\n\nFor the Asian mains, I have tried rice and noodles for the set lunch. I feel they are on the bland side. However, you can request to add more salt and pepper on your order. The peach gum dessert is also very less sweet and taste very healthy.\n\nThe staff is very friendly. Sometimes, complimentary appetizer would be served. Expect to spend close to 20 dollars for a meal here.\n\nGreat flavours, great aesthetics and vibes, great service! Staff kindly gave us a heads up that their food is towards the lighter side but all the dishes we ordered turned out so flavourful and satisfying hmm so didn\u2019t face the issue of food being bland at all. Service was great too!\n\nWe tried the salad, mushroom soup, sushi and grilled broccoli/mushrooms. All were served promptly and were delicious.

Whether you\u2019re a vegetarian or simply looking to explore plant-based alternatives, this restaurant is an absolute gem. We highly recommend it to anyone seeking a memorable dining experience with top-notch vegetarian cuisine.\n\nThe delicate strands of noodles were expertly stir-fried with an assortment of fresh vegetables, creating a harmonious medley of taste and aroma.\n\nThe Rendang was a true masterpiece. The rich and aromatic coconut-based curry was impeccably spiced, resulting in a tantalizing symphony of flavors.\n\nOne of the highlights of our meal was the Vegetarian Shark\u2019s Fin Soup. It was a delightful surprise to find a cruelty-free alternative that retained the essence and texture of the traditional dish.\n\nThe Sweet & Sour dish was a perfect balance of tanginess and sweetness, complemented by succulent mushroom and an assortment of colorful bell peppers and pineapples.\n\nTo end our meal on a sweet note, we indulged in the Yam Paste with Gingko Nuts. The smooth and velvety yam paste was flawlessly cooked and paired beautifully with the tender gingko nuts\n\nOld school vegetarian restaurants good not too salty good service. Friendly staff.

Fantastic and thank you for opening an outlet in Little India.\n\n\nOption: 9:\nName: Eight Treasures Vegetarian Restaurant\nAddress: 282A South Bridge Road, Sago Ln, 058831\nPhone: 6534 7727\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: Closed\nTuesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.5\nReviews: \n\nVegetarian is a good place for vegetarians for an experience. The variety of food is very good, portion is decent and price is awesome. The sucklings pig is crispy and soft on the inside. The pineapple fried rice is fluffy and flavourful. There is 3 level in the building and plenty of food available. The toilet is clean. The staff is professional and good. The restaurant is also well decorative\n\nA great selection of delicious vegan foods \ud83d\ude0b. Everything is plant based, with the exception of entries clearly marked as containing dairy and / or honey, most of which can be made vegan per request. Massive menu of delightful dishes.\nEasy to find - right next to the Budda Tooth Relic Temple.\nReservations are recommended\n\nThis is a pure vegetarian Chinese restaurant close to Buddha temple in Chinatown. For Indians, this is 'Jain vegetarian' - no onion, no garlic. The food was very tasty. Ben (pr\u00e9sume he is the owner) was very friendly. The warmth of the service added to the great experience. Though the menu doesn't look like a vegetarian one, these are all mock-meat..made from tofu. A nice place for vegetarians to get an authentic taste of Chinese food.\n\nFound this restaurant through Google map/reviews & decided have our dinner here. For 6 of us (1 kid), this consider reasonable price and food taste not bad to try. It is within walking distance to/from Chinatown station. Parking wise also very convenient.\n\nA great survivor of the pandemic unlike it's contemporary Miao Yi at nearby People's Park Centre \ud83d\ude22. We are grateful that we still have a place for restaurant standard Chinese vegetarian cuisine. The Ee Fu noodles has a good balance of noodles and vegetables.\n\nSurprisingly, some dishes aren't that expensive, with the mock meat and tofu dishes going for $12 for the small version. You might find some neighborhood vegetarian stalls at coffeeshop to be slightly more expensive! \ud83d\ude31 My only complaint is that a bowl of plain rice is $1.20 \ud83e\udee8 Also note that the resto is on the 2nd floor and might be challenging for elderly or mobility impaired to climb.\n\nA nice place for a quiet, even slightly above budget meal. And the place to bring your friends and family for a good old vegetarian splurge. Either way, bon appetit!\n\n\nOption: 10:\nName: The Boneless Kitchen\nAddress: 1 Irving Pl, #01-31 Commerze @ Irving, Singapore 369546\nPhone: 8457 6464\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: Closed\nTuesday: 11:45\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:45\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:45\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:45\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:45\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:45\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.4\nReviews: \n\nComforting and delightful korean cuisine that is vegan and vegetarian friendly. Love most of the dishes I tried in my multiple visits here. Highly recommended. There were alot of insects in the restaurant on the day of my visit but it could be because of the rain.\n\nOrdered via grab food. The kimchi jiggae healed my flu. The bulgogi fries were addictive.  The tteokbokki had the perfect chew.  Can't wait to actually eat at the restaurant to have a full experience.\n\nI enjoyed my dish Army Stew which as you can see from the photo was bubbling away for minutes. My wife was rather underwhelmed by her dish though unfortunately.\nThe Kimchi Jeon (pancakes) were nice enough though not better than Indian flavoured breads/uttapam in that the flavour was not as storied/flavourful as we expected.\nStaff were very nice and I'm sure if we had visited it when busier then we would have probably enjoyed it more. Their sister branch we happened to pass one evening and had a completely different feel, more intimate and cosy so we may try that another time. Very nice man on the reception.\n\nThe rare place that my daughter who is a vegan to enjoy Korean food. Surprisingly it's quite good even for a non-vegetarian like me.\n\nExceptional Korean food at a decent price.\n\nFood is excellent & service is prompt. Tofu soup is delicious and flavourful, with the ingredients generously portioned. Omelette & Kimbap are also great.\n\nThis is also one of the few Korean places I've encountered where the Kimchi pancake can be shared between 2 people, which is great if you aren't dining in a large group.\n\nDefinitely give this place a try if you get the chance! Be warned you may have to queue during lunchtime.\n",

An entire birthday cake, not merely a slice, was given to us. Most dishes were great. The highlight of the meal was the seafood stew. All the breads were also exceptionally delicious. However, the sea bass tasted very ordinary and the sky high price tag went to the showy \u2018performance\u2019 by the chef. Restaurant was too dim and had a funky smell.\n\nThe staff are very friendly and the food is also tasty. The portion is surprisingly big and we ate till our hearts content.\n\nStaff very helpful and polite. Atmosphere is chill with soft music. Food serve just in the right timing.  Of cause the price is not cheap. But it worth the price overall.\n\nLastly thanks for the birthday cake. Love it but we were too full to finish it.\n\nBooked Sunday afternoon to have their set lunch, only to find out they only serve buffet that day at $78++ per person. Opted in anyway and didn't regret it, given the fresh ingredients, great taste of Italian and friendly staffs! Personally I love the dessert section especially Panna Cotta! If I had to pick on something, it'd be the dim lighting. No discount on the bill even with Shangri-la Circle membership, but you do get extra points.\n\nRemember, when you get into the lobby, you are on 3F. You need to take an elevator to get down to 1F where the restaurant is.\n\nThe restaurant has decent ambience for a semi chic and comfortable dinning experience. The salt crusted fish is delicious and if you want to see some fire show. The winner for me is the crab pasta. Yum!\n\nEverything about this place is 5 stars!\nThe ambience is so perfect that you are at ease the moment you are inside the restaurant. Menu is designed in such a way that you can have the best vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes without feeling less about your dish. Staff is courteous and even after attending so many guests, they always find time to attend to you/your requests. The serving is very clean and within time. They have good sitting arrangements both inside and outside.

Restaurant has kids menu option - one of the pasta choice didnt taste great. Serving portion is good.\n\nIt was a work dinner where we pre ordered the items of the set menus. I had the Wagyu rump steak which was really good, no gamey taste and very juicy. Dessert was Valrhona chocolate tart which was so sinfully good, very chocolatey. The Halia also served complimentary matcha and banana chocolate macaroons.\n\nThe place was very nice, covered with greenery.\nService was great, staffs were attentive and food was served timely spaced out.\nNot a place that\u2019s very accessible unless you drive or take a hired ride.

The highlight was the service we received, cordial and attentive! The food was simple but well done, but the cocktail mixes \ud83c\udf79 and beer options \ud83c\udf7a weren\u2019t very impressive. Being said that, Dusk offered us such brilliant views, beautifully appointed and had an astonishing view of the city. Normally views like that carry a serious price tag, but to our surprise it\u2019s surprisingly affordable here, and both food and drinks were well priced. Thumbs up!\n\nVisited this place with 4 other friends last evening, and we managed to catch the sunset there! The view was amazing and beautiful!\n\nThe restaurant atmosphere was quite zen and chill when the sun is still up, and becomes romantic when the sun goes down. Haha! Quite a good environment for dates and/or hanging out with friends.\n\nMost of the food is deliciously yummy, especially their meat items. We ordered the following:\n- 3 sharing platters (1 beef, 1 lamb, 1 pork)\n- 2 mains (prawn pasta and fish&chips)\n- 1 sides (tomato meatballs)\n\nI feel that everything's tasted good but some of my friends felt that the pasta wasn't up to their standards. Oh well~ to each of its own... I highly recommend the beef and lamb sharing platters and the meatballs!\n\nAs for the drinks, most of them are quite common like anywhere else but at affordable prices! There are a few unique drinks but weren't available last evening. \ud83d\ude14\n\nLove the atmosphere and vibe. Will definitely visit this place again when there's occassions to celebrate. \ud83d\ude04\n\nFYI, the restaurant is an outdoor one and there's only fans around.\n\nBy chance we booked this place for 50th birthday. Stunning views with fantastic service by Zhan Xian and David. The food was excellent. We had wings, calamari, truffle fries and lamb rack portion for 4 pax was big.

My boys enjoyed the lunch service today.\n\nService team has been attentive and especially in the case for my wife whom is expecting, we made request if other menu or ingredients can be accommodated.

Good vibes, nice view, decent food. The lady that served us was also very enthusiastic when she brought us the birthday cake! However, we did not get the risotto table service as mentioned by others, was still looking forward to that. But overall, a really nice place!\n\nHad a relaxing Sunday brunch. Menu was well thought out that catered to diverse taste and needs. Braised cheek and duck confit were the standout for me. Eggs benedict was nicely presented too. Pasta portions were slightly bigger so best to order to share. I gave the dessert a miss as I was already full but family members loved the tiramisu and choc lava cake. The Chinese gentleman in spectacles who took our orders was very attentive, warm and smiley though I can't say the same for some of the other staff. Food was of pretty good standard. Priced at $88 per pax without drinks, its very reasonable value.\n\nGreat location on Marina Bay. We sat outside for a great view of the Bay at night. Inside, the air conditioning was a tad too cold.\n\nThe food was badly let down by the fact that the meat dishes were nearly cold. Everything else was fine, but timing is so important with food, the more so when you're paying a lot of money.\n\nI had the lamb rack and my partner had a ribeye \ud83e\udd69, as I mentioned, both were cold. The vegetable sides (asparagus and   creamy potato) were great, as were the desserts.\n\nWine is expensive and the measures are miserly (150cl? Please!)

Didn\u2019t have expectations and was pleasantly surprised.\n\nWe had booked a table outside but the Singapore heat was too much to handle and decided to sit inside, which the staff were very kind in accommodating. Salmon was good and cooked well. The penne vodka sauce pasta was tasty and the caesar salad good as well.\n\nHaving lunch here is a great way to get views from the top of Marina Bay Sands without paying the admission fee for the deck.\n\nWe had a beautiful birthday dinner here, made better thanks to professional and friendly service, delicious Italian food, and a chill, cozy ambience.\n\nThe music can be quite upbeat that is similar to a club but softer, adding to the relaxed yet personal dining experience. Thank you to the team for a wonderful experience in the sky.\n\nWonderful view\nSo great for sunset\nWe were also able to catch the Super Tree Grove light show at 7:45 and then run to other side to watch the Spectra Water & Light show at 8:00\n\nWe only ate the truffle gnocchi & giant 1 pound meatball, be forewarned it is a meal all by itself.\nThe meat ball was great quality meat, my hubby said it was dry for his taste and the sauce saved it but I felt it was pretty juicy, so to each their own\nThe truffle gnocchi was absolute PERFECTION. The gnocchi was a good size and not to soft or mushy like it can get sometimes. The truffle flavor was very pronounced just the way I like itS and I particularly love that they shredded the truffle like a garnish on top rather than just one huge chunk of truffle. That way I could get a bite truffle and every single mouthful.\n\nAnd at the end they surprised us with a happy anniversary cake and I have to say that cake was surprisingly good. I really enjoyed it.\n\nOverall very good service by our waiter. We really got the pasta as we asked for. Great. Our table wasn't ready as it just started raining and everyone needed to be moved inside.\nView inside not really great but of course outside. Wine was quite pricey and not really good. But if you want to be once up.. best option!\n\nCame here for birthday celebration, and overall had a great experience! The staff and service were all great, and we got a small cake with a birthday message on it.\n\nFor food, we had the burrata, truffle fries, ravioli, big meatball, and eggplant parm. I thought the big meatball was quite yummy, but the truffle fries did not have a strong enough truffle aroma. The food we ordered was quite heavy, something to keep in mind while ordering! The 20 layer chocolate cake was enormous and can easily be shared by a few people or more. We also had some cocktails that were nice as well. I found the food quite tasty but this is a place you come to mainly for the views and atmosphere, especially if you are seated outdoors.\n\n\nOption: 6:\nName: The Summerhouse\nAddress: 3 Park Ln, Singapore 798387\nPhone: 8809 5840\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 8:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 8:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 8:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 8:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 8:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nSaturday: 8:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nSunday: 8:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 3 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.3\nReviews: \n\nFound a hidden gem of a night-time hangout place to watch the English Premier League \ud83e\udd70\ud83d\ude0e\ud83e\udd19. Go Liverpool!!! You'll Never Walk Alone! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\ude01. They serve nice finger food like curly fries, chicken wings etc. There are both alcoholic and not alcoholic drinks to choose from. Definitely a chill place to hangout with family and friends while catching soccer action! \ud83e\udd70\n\nSaw this place and the reviews was pretty good hence we decided to come here. Honestly, the food was pretty bad and very expensive! We had the curly fries, taste good but it was COLD and the potion was too small for $16. The pasta was not cold, but it didn\u2019t taste good, we only had a few bites. The bangers and mash was nothing fancy. Drinks were fine. Then the baked potato which cost $5 before gst and service charge was so bad. It was so dry, hard and cold. The worst baked potato I ever had. I feedback to the waitress and she was stunned and just said ok. Honestly do not recommend this place at all.\n\nBread and Butter\nArtisanal Cold Cuts\nSeared Alantic Scallop\nEscargot de Bourgogne\nPluma Iberico\nGrilled Baby Lamb Rack\nVichyssoise\nPotato Pur\u00e9e\nYoghurt Sorbet\n\nThe Summerhouse\n\ud83d\udccd3 Park Ln, Singapore 798387\n\n\ud83c\udf5c Food wise: Overall it was a splendid experience. With the staff\u2019s recommendation, all of the food presented was superb! My favourite was the Escargot de Bourgogne, dished on a hot Escargot plate, this wasn\u2019t your ordinary Escargo where you eat the meat off the shell, they have made an edible shell where you can simply pop one into your mouth! With a crispy and biscuit like texture, this \u201cshell\u201d delivered the perfectly prepared and cooked escargo, served with Parsley butter, into the mouth. Unbelievely juicy Escargo! This might be the best one have ever eaten!\n\nNext, for the main dish, the recommended Pluma Iberico was incredibly soft and tender, the flavour of the pork burst into the mouth! This Iberico is definitely a strong competition against the Wagyu. This goodie is also served with crunchy Brussels Sprouts, perfectly seasoned, not too salty and there wasn\u2019t bitterness, they also presented the natural sweetness of this vegetable. And finally, the apple pur\u00e9e just balances the meatiness with the refreshing fruity taste!\n\nIf you would like a soup, then the Vichyssoise is definitely a die for! This is no ordinary potato soup here, this soup was fragrant, thick, and not too heavy for one person to down the bowl! Yet, this soup is also good for two to share! Try eating the bread dipped in this soup too! Having this while having the cold cuts tasted really good too!\n\nNow, the scallops were fresh, firm, and sweet, seared perfectly, a great starter. The Baby Lamb Rack was tender, it had a nice gentle gamey taste, worth a go too!\n\nFinally, to end off the meal, the Yoghurt Sorbet will be the best! It had a wide range of tastes in one bowl, sweet, sour, minty, and flowery. The mint jelly was fun, it wobbled, it was quite minty and it was not overly sweet. The Elderflower Sorbet melts fast, so do eat it first, try it bit by bit with the rest of the ingredients to have the best of all worlds, and finally let some melt and mix with the rest of the dessert, so good!\n\n\u2728 Ambience wise: Very romantic restaurant, good for dates, anniversary dinners, and weddings!\n\n\ud83e\udd35\ud83c\udffb Service wise: Service was prompt, warm and welcoming. With such a spread of choices of food, the staff pointed out all the best that they offered and explained each dish with such detail, the service was definitely a 5 star.\n\n\ud83d\udcb5 Price wise:\nArtisanal Cold Cuts $35\nSeared Atlantic Scallop $24\nEscargot de Bourgogne $28\nPluma Iberico $48\nGrilled Baby Lamb Rack $65\nVichyssoise $16\nPotato Pur\u00e9e $16\nYoghurt Sorbet $16\n\nI came here for dinner.  Food is good, but very pricy.  Definitely good for private and more intimate meals if you book the garden dome. There are three garden domes.\n\nThe taste of the 65\u2019 Florentine egg and truffle was masked by the spinach, but the taste of the spinach was great.\n\nThe French onion soup was sweet and thicker which was surprising.\n\nThe wagyu striplion was done as a roast and delightful to have with some charring on the sides.\n\nThe duck confit was good and not too salty.\n\nThe sorbet was refreshing and the jelly lovely to chew on.\n\nCreme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was good as well.\n\nGood place for more intimate moments.\n\nWe absolutely love Summerhouse for its ambience and amazing staff! We come here often as we always leave with a great experience. Special shout out to Serena, Mayer and Isaac who have been excellent in their service and always going out of the way to assist us. Highly recommended place!\n\n\nOption: 7:\nName: Le Jardin Restaurant\nAddress: 5 Cox Terrace, Level 2 Fort Canning Arts Centre, Singapore 179620\nPhone: 8870 9977\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 9:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20098:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 9:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20098:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 9:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20098:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 9:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20098:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 8:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 8:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 8:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20098:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.1\nReviews: \n\nHad a dinner here and the foods were great. The staffs were attentive and friendly. Ordered pork collar and black Angus rib and they were good, rib had a nice crisp outside but very tender and juicy inside. Even my very fussy daughter finished all her foods and asked for more! Will definitely come back.\n\nHighly decorated place especially for indoor dining. Staff kindly arranged a prime spot for my reservation. Everything is prepared with thoughtfulness and fine consideration. You can ask anything u need they will be patient. Like handbag baskets and your preferences of order of food services. Everything come w perfectly timed manner, however you should not be in a rush also to enjoy a pleasantly paced brunch. Food is fantastic.\n\nLove the atmosphere \n\nWhat an amazing place! Beautiful interiors and exterior too! Very peaceful and comfortable place to chill-out at! What a hidden gem! We were shooting portraits in the park and chanced upon this space. The staff were friendly and helpful. They gave us coupons to entice us in for a drink. We ended up having a delicious meal! Tried the laksa pasta and arrabiatta fettucine today. Will be back to try the other food next time!\n\nUpdate: tried the hamburger and salmon today! Was great! Soup too!\n\nVery nice ambience and its pet friendly.  I will like express my compliment to the supervisor Leon who have been very friendly and super attentive. As my wife dress was stained by my dog paws, he have offered wet and dry serviette to us which really amazed me on his good customer service.

Especially the Padaiappa rice, which was so authentic Tamil.. had a wonderful chat with the owner and he even changed the music to meet our request. Great service and thanks for making our Friday a truly enchanting experience.. will bring friends here next time!\n\nNice Indian bistro with good live Indian music. Even better food. Their padayapa rice is damn shiok. Their fried chicken wings too.\n\nVisiting Singapore for a holiday and staying with my sister's family who lives there. We came here on a Saturday evening to celebrate her birthday. Her family is a regular at this place.\n\nWe certainly had a great time celebrating her birthday. The live band belting out the tamil songs were in their element and they were so gracious to take in all of the song requests coming from the patrons.\n\nThis was like an experience never before for me coming in from Chennai to have a tamil songs playing at a resto bar. We had Guinness on tap which was fine. The food orders took quite some time though and all of them were tasting good. I would definitely come back here in my next visit to Singapore as well.\n\nSeafood platter was fine.\nWorst Tiramisu I ever ate!\nAmbience and music was fine\n\nIt was truly a disappointing experience... came in at 930pm, ordered 3 drinks, 1 side 2 mains. Was informed the wait is 1hr...we did agree. Drinks came with french fries. But even after 1 and half hrs, the food order has not even gone into kitchen to start prep bec there were only 2 chefs. Guests who came later got their orders? So does that mean we should come here for songs and drinks only and no food on time for hungry customers? Then customers should be notified early if this is so.

Food is great. Slow cooked Lamb Ragu pasta and eggplant parmigiana are amazing. Their firewood pizza is not to be missed too. A perfect environment to stay and chill with a glass or wine or beer after a nice dinner.\n\nI visited this place for a dinner date. We had already made a reservation in advance, as we knew very well that this place would be packed on the weekends.\n\nThe staff were very nice to greet us as we made our way into the restaurant and even walked us over to our tables. The waiter at the time was very observant, and would constantly check up on how we were  doing.\n\nMore on the food:\n\n(Appetizer)\nBurrata Bruschetta - 8/10 \ud83c\udf1f\n- The Burrata was really lovely!\n- The sweet and juicy tomatoes compliments the creamy and milky cheese\n\nHowever, the bread was a little tougher than expected that our knives struggle to cut through. Nevertheless, it was pretty delicious \ud83e\udd24\ud83d\ude0b\n\n(Appetizer)\nEggplant Parmigiana -  10/10 \ud83c\udf1f\ud83e\udd0c\n- Absolutely bussin!\n- It tastes better than a regular lasagne, the eggplant is barely noticeable. Which is good in a way as my partner is not too much of a fan of veggies.\n- The sauce topped with the cheese just makes this dish one of the best in my opinion\n\n(Main)\nDiavola pizza - 9/10 \ud83c\udf1f\n- Spicy, greasy and meaty pizza\n- The spicy and salty sorpressata balances the thick and absorbent pizza dough\n- Low-key better than pepperoni pizzas \ud83e\udd2d\n\n*Unfortunately I forgot to take a picture*\n\n(Dessert)\nFlamb\u00e9ed Chocolate Ecstasy - 6/10\ud83c\udf1f\n- Presentation was really good \ud83d\udc4d\n- Interesting concept of both Hot and Cold dessert\n\nHowever, our brownies were a little too frozen \ud83d\ude15. We knew it was a hot and cold dessert as there was ice cream served with the hot-plated brownies. But when we tried to scoop booth goodies, the brownie was frozen hahaha. Interesting concept but would recommend other stuff like the tiramisu maybe.\n\nOverall, excellent experience. Prompt service, a little pricey but worth the occasional visits. Came in hungry, left full  \ud83d\ude35\n\nMy first time dining here and the staffs here are really sweet and customer oriented. They made the dining here with my girlfriend beyond pleasant. They made small talks with you and check on you regarding the quality of the food. The food was amazing but my friend and I couldn\u2019t finished it because we are 2 girls that over ordered. If you are going for a date, this place is extremely ideal. Will definitely be back.\n\nWas here for a birthday celebration. Staff was very nice and provided complimentary tiramisu cake (slightly alcoholic), which tasted phenomenal. Pizza is very well balanced and does not get gelat from a few bites, while the pastas and risottos pack a good flavourful punch. In total, it was slightly pricey but overall nice place to wine and dine.\n\nRegarding indoors seating, music is kinda loud to have a clear conversation. Place is pet friendly and there are many dogs around\n\nService was underwhelming for the price paid.  Not the worst. But one would expect better.\n\nFood. so long is pizza or pasta or Italian is nice. The pork chop was soso only.  Pizza came before the starters.\n\nDessert is a must have!! The tiramsu and flaming chocolate extasy. Don't touch the hot pan!!!\n\nWine selection is good and recommendation by the wine guy was great!!!\n\nGood for celebrations... or hangout.\nBut bring a big wallet.\n\nFree parking (4hrs) too if u need to know  1 ticket per bill.\n\n\nOption: 10:\nName: Canopy Bishan\nAddress: 1382 Ang Mo Kio Ave 1 Bishan Park 2, 569931\nPhone: 6556 1533\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 8:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 8:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.1\nReviews: \n\nOne of the best places so far. Price is a little steep but still one of the best. Alfresco was cooling and chill vibes.\nTruffle mushroom pizza is one of the best I have ever eaten. Not too creamy, just nice. Truffle has a complex taste, nothing monotonous like the cheap gas smell.\n\nSeafood pasta was also great, strong umami taste with a touch of spicy\n\nAmazing food, one of the best dinners I've eaten, ever.\n\nBoth crabmeat pasta and truffle pizza were delicious and exceeded our expectations. Thin crust pizza paired with mushrooms and truffle oil, mmmm.\n\nOur lava cake took a while as the first had an incident. That was fine. However, the second one came and it wasn't lava'ish. No chocolate flow and it was just warm which is disappointing.\n\nAnother issue is no free tap water which I had an issue with. It's $2 for water which is non-refillable.\n\nStaff service and the other two food were impeccable. Will definitely return to try other dishes, probably skip the lava cake.\n\nFood is above average. Atmosphere is great and not overpowering. Dog friendly. Staff are generally attentive, younger staff tends to be more casual and overlooking details. Indoor is ac, outdoor is open and dog friendly.\n\nWent for a drink with colleagues during happy hour 7+ pm. Love the atmosphere here as it is in Bishan Park surrounded by greenery. The restaurant is also fitted with dim light and a cozy environment.\n\nWe ordered calamari, truffles fries, and sausages. The finger food was delicious and great together with a glass of beer. The service was very fast too. Will definitely recommend this place for office workers who want time out from their busy work life, wanted to have a short drinking session, and immersed in the greenery to relax oneself.\n\nA quiet dining place within the bishan park. Easy to park your car and short walk to the restaurant. Food were nice and a variety of wine and beer with happy hours will 8pm. A good place to chill, happy and drink.\n",

I LOVED this restaurant. The most delicious dim sum ever!! We sat in the open area and it was really nice. We didn\u2019t have data in our phones so we couldn\u2019t order with the QR code but the staff gave us a sheet of paper and a pencil to order. Everything was absolutely DELICIOUS.  For fellow tourists: make sure you have cash since they don\u2019t accept card payments (there is an ATM nearby)\n\nThe best authentic Dim Sum and Chinese food! Amazing quality, great service\u2026 yes you sit on a plastic chair and the place is not fancy\u2026 but guaranteed yummy! A must do once in Singapore \ud83d\ude0b\n\nStill one of my favorite dim sum joints, offering food served very quickly.\nSwee Choon seems to have figured out their winning formula. Offering simple fares at reasonable pricing served very quickly. This dim sum eatery has blossomed from one small shop space to taking over the neighboring spaces for their never ending queue of customers.\nWe ordered quite a few dishes. Cucumber with black fungus was a surprise crowd winner, even winning over someone who does not usually enjoy cold dishes with its simple and light garlicky taste. The porridge was so so, a rather small bowl though but I wasn\u2019t watery so you do get it chock full of ingredients. The chilli wanton was abit of a let down, as the spice level was abit meh. I loved the Kang kong stir fried with garlic. With the simple way of cooking, it brought out the freshness of the vegetables. I like the fried pork too, it was marinated just right and very tender and not over fried. The tentacles was abit over fried and was kind of like chewing on rubber.\nI would definitely hands down visit Swee Choon anytime.\n*good to note: I ordered a takeaway of egg tarts, char Siew puff at the outside takeaway kiosk. Waiting time was very short too, and staff ensured items were tied up properly for ease transportation back home. Egg tarts still tasted amazing when they were cold.\n\nCame to Swee Choon's main branch twice on my most recent trip to Singapore and am very impressed.\n\nFirst visit came right after I landed on a Wednesday night at around 11:30PM with no queue and easily got a table inside as they have both outdoor and indoor seatings and ordered the Sichuan Chilli Oil Wanton, Har Cheong (Rice Roll with Prawn) and Chive Pork Dumplings and service was super fast in the dishes coming immediately after my order was placed! I was very satisfied with all 3 dishes after a 7 hour plane journey.\n\nSecond visit came on a Saturday night again at around 11PM and this time had to wait a while as I had wanted to dine indoors. The staff was kind enough to give the WiFi password in order to join the queue as I had no internet access and was also able to order via. QR code which would be handy on subsequent visits. This time I tried the Har Gao, Siew Mai, Plain Chee Cheong Fun and Peking Dumplings and again was very impressed by the service, especially by the pink haired aunty who served me and of course from the food itself.\n\nDo note that the restaurant is cash only and prices are exceptionally reasonable, regardless of the items I ordered being served as either 2 or 4 pieces.\n\nOverall I really enjoyed both my experiences and is easily a late night restaurant that I will certainly come to when I come back to Singapore.\n\nSending some love from Melbourne, Australia!!\n\n\nOption: 2:\nName: Char-Grill Bar Holland Village\nAddress: 25a Lor Liput, Singapore 277735\nPhone: 6463 4908\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fAM\nTuesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fAM\nWednesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fAM\nThursday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fAM\nFriday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fAM\nSaturday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fAM\nSunday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fAM\n\nPrice Level: 1 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.2\nReviews: \n\nTried the lunch set. It\u2019s definitely good for value.\nThe chicken burger is single burger bun at the bottom. The bun is lightly toasted and crispy. The chicken chop is tender and the skin is removed.\nThe cheese on top is good. Added more flavours to the chicken chop.\nThe Mexican cheese pasta as side dish is decent, the boiled vegetables don\u2019t have much taste but it\u2019s okay.\n\nValue for money. I like the Mexican grilled chicken that comes with cheese sauce and sliced white onions. It\u2019s hard to find this in typical western stalls but I like this style the best.\n\nWas here on 4th Aug 2023, around 1am after midnight.\n\nHad the smoked duck carbonara and chargrilled chicken chop with ice lemon tea!\n\nIce lemon tea was sweet but more on the slightly sour side so not my thing but it may be for others.\n\nCarbonara was creamy as well as savoury with a lot of smoked duck bits mixed in aside from the smoke duck slices seen in the picture. Chicken chop was tender and the fried rice had flavour. Both dishes had generous portions and although the food tastes generally like your average western food, giving it higher rating for the price point in par with the quality and quantity of food.\n\nAtmosphere was chill and the customer service was warm and attentive.\n\nGenerous portion of collar pork was nicely grilled. Mashed potato tasted similar to KFC \ud83d\ude05. Onion served under the pork could be more cooked.

We had an amazing host - Bernard who shared his life story. He had an amazing voice, sounded like a radio DJ. Randy was really friendly too in guiding us to our seats. The customer service at the lounge was really warm and friendly too!\n\nVery very unique experience and 10/10 will recommend to come to this place. The picture was taken before the dinner and the dinner was served incomplete darkness. The service is very heartwarming and very friendly.  Dining in pitch dark really gives us the perspective on how a vision disabled person experience their day to day life (just the eating part alone). I think I should not reveal too much details but rather let you experience yourself. This unique experience start from the time u step in the restaurant. Really must try!!!\n\nAbsolutely great experience. Booking with credit card is necessary. When arrived we waited at this fancy bar area where an appetiser is served. We can order bar drinks too. Lockers were provided to keep your bags, phones, watches that illuminate. Then we were taken to a second floor where the room was in complete darkness. When you can see, the sense of touch smell and taste elevates and became more sensitive. Food and wine were great just have to be careful when consuming since we can\u2019t see. Servers are all very passionate, friendly and professional. They told us they can\u2019t see and we are impressed by how swift and accurate they serve. They were also very engaged in conversations with us. Menu changes every two months we were told. Highly recommended!\n\nGo on a culinary adventure, bring out your inner child, enhance and explore with your others senses. Travel a journey to 12 different exciting yummy dishes.\n\nTldr: Very interesting experiential concept; Recommended for the novel experience. 3 course menu for $88++ (4 dishes per course, features seafood & red meat); 2 flight wine pairing for $30, 3 flight wine pairing for $40.\n\nNox is an experiential dining concept where you dine in total darkness while being guided and served by visually impaired waiters. I started off at the bar area (lit up) and got the \u2018Kwai Feh\u2019 cocktail ($22) - the gin and grapefruit pairing was pleasant and refreshing. They also served a small canape of celery root puree mousse & uni in a crispy cone (included in the set course), which was light with the sea flavor of uni.\n\nFor dinner proper, we had to remove and deposit any luminescent personal items (including phones) into a locker before we were brought to the pitch dark dining hall.\n\nNox serves a standard 3-course meal (appetiser / main / dessert) for $88. Each course is split into 4 separate dishes, making it effectively 12 different dishes over the 3-course dinner. Wont spoil the menu by sharing the exact dishes, but there was a good mix of seafood and red meat. The food was generally tasty and of good quality, although nothing spectacular. I also topped up $40 for the 3 flight wine pairing. After the meal, the dishes were revealed back at the bar area.\n\nIt was also interesting to experience how the visually impaired waiters used tongue clicks and whistles to navigate through the dining area with trays of food and drink without running into each other or dropping things. Overall a very interesting experience; highly recommended to try.\n\n\nOption: 4:\nName: 49 SEATS\nAddress: 176 Orchard Rd, #01 - 49, Singapore 238843\nPhone: None\nDelivery Available: Information Not Available\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:00\u202fAM\nTuesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:00\u202fAM\nWednesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:00\u202fAM\nThursday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:00\u202fAM\nFriday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:00\u202fAM\nSaturday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:00\u202fAM\nSunday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 1 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.2\nReviews: \n\nThe environment during lunch was quiet, not many tables were occupied, which surprises me because the food was great in taste and portion, and the set meal was price reasonably.\n\n$17.90 for a set that comes with a main or pasta, and a drink and soup of the day.\n\nThe soup was superb with slices of fresh mushrooms and onions.

Lamb chops are great too, super tender and well cooked.\n\nOverall definitely returning to try other dishes in their extensive menu, highly recommended!\n\nwe stumbled upon this place and decided to try out their all-day breakfast! we ordered it with scrambled eggs, english muffin and bratwurst chicken sausage. the scrambled eggs were cooked to perfection, and english muffin (which was just toast?) was toasted to a crispy exterior and a soft interior, and the sausage had a nice snap. the pasta was also cooked nicely and had a nice mushroom flavour. the whole place was very clean and the atmosphere was great. the staff were very friendly as well! make sure to check out this place if you're in the area!\n\nNice cosy place to have a evening drink with few friends or family. Super service. Waitress was extremely helpful in selecting menu items suitable for our pallet.\n\nA nice place for small gathering on weekdays. Food was so so \u2026 escargot chewy , lamb rack 2 pcs for $24 dun worth and slightly over cook. Lamb shank was a better choice tender and nicely braised. Salmon ordinary abit dry.

Service is really quick and you order through a QR code so it\u2019s convenient. There\u2019s parallel parking along the road and parking at the malls opposite. The food was good, there\u2019s choice between dum briyani and just briyani and this was the plain briyani, rice was flavourful and the chicken was good. Can even choose what piece of chicken you want. Overall quite nice, i would return and would want to try the other stuff on the menu.\n\nIt\u2019s been a while since I came here and the increase in price is really steep; I no longer find it value for money. We got Plain Prata x1, Egg Prata x1, Butter Chicken x1, Garlic Naan x1, Dum Briyani x1 and Iced Teh Tarik x2 which added up to $38.80 for 2.\n\nPrata is average but their fish curry is really diluted. Butter chicken is not bad. Garlic naan is what you would expect it to taste. The only thing worth the price is probably the Dum Briyani. Although it looked like a small portion, there was a lot of mutton buried in the rice and was really filling. The mutton was also tender with really nice gravy. Personally will not be back again.\n\nGood place to have your Indian breakfast. Service is good during the morning.\n\nLast I had supper here at night on weekend, they clean your table as soon as you finish your food to make way for the next diner which is understandable. So, decide if you want a place for good food or a place to hang out.\n\nI've been using this restaurant as a JC peeps meeting base for years. Glad to see that it, together with its competition down the road, has survived the building of the MRT line. When I last went, they didn't have date milkshake. Not sure if its temporary or for good.

Drinks were alright. Overall really nice supper place near the Serangoon area.\n\nPrata's crispy and good. Service is ok though it can be slow. But the prawn masala's a real letdown with the small size, you can see the photos of the size of the prawn, which is really the size of a shrimp. Also ordered the butter chicken, which is ok.\n\nCame here for Lunch with my family and Kids. Not only their Prata are crispy, their other dishes are delicious. Recommend their Spinach which my kids also love. Services are good but dont expect restaurant type at this coffee house. Kids love to have their prata with condensed milk which they didnt charge me. Recommended Prata place for family.\n\nCame back to edit my review in the past to downgrade the ratings. They are becoming too complacent and now everything is served not freshly made. Parata or fried rice, both were served cold even though requested to serve the freshly made hot one. Requested and got a reheated parata. Done with the place and will never return to eat cold fried rice or cold parata again. This place is super popular for their Roti Prata Plain and Egg Prata. ( things go down when business becomes too complacent and forgot to serve the product what it meant to be). Good staff with great attitude to serve the customer. This WAS the best place rated by me for variety of prata. Should you need to have a sizzling hot prata to be served, then just let the staff know and they will serve you accordingly. But now they do not do it anymore. You must try this place at your own risk, look around a newly opened parata place around your home which might be better in taste and served freshly made hot ones.\nFeel bad to downgrade their ratings but in this business one have to keep it with the pace. Hope they will improve soon but for me I am done.\n\nMeant to catchup with friends over Prata but this place was extremely noisy (and packed), and the staff kept chasing us away even when we were not done with our meals. They kept coming to ask if they could clear our plates when most of them were only half eaten.\n\nWe were a big group and had ordered a lot. So it would definitely take more time for us to finish our food. But the experience was extremely poor because of the service attitude.\n\n\nOption: 8:\nName: LUMO Bar & Restaurant\nAddress: 50 South Bridge Rd, #01-00, Singapore 058682\nPhone: 8921 3818\nDelivery Available: No\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: Closed\nTuesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 4:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 4:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 4:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 4:00\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u20091:00\u202fAM\nSaturday: 6:00\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u20091:00\u202fAM\nSunday: 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.6\nReviews: \n\nWas just there for dinner last night with my partner and the overall experience for my first visit there was great!\n\nThe taste of the dishes was surprising delicious and the freshness of the seafood was sublime!

Lumo exceed expectation in every way down to the desserts. The cheesecake with lime yoghurt is a great pairing and I simply had to takeaway a slice for my husband. The sirloin was done perfectly well in medium rare and my favorite is likely the scallops with pumpkin puree. Service was impeccable and overall I had a great night celebrating my friend\u2019s birthday. Thank you to the Lumo\u2019s service crew and chefs!\n\nMade a spontaneous booking on saturday night. Wanted to commend the service, we were served by who i presume was the manager and a super smiley young lady. Very pleasantly surprised by the food. The octopus!!! was definitely star of the night and we thoroughly enjoyed the rose pork rack too. Slightly pricey but very justifiable and we left happy and full. Also, got free dessert after they found out it was my birthday, which was a very sweet gesture.

Lunch time sets and dinner sets and even happy hour. Super worth the price for the food and the drinks were really good too.

We had a ball of an evening at the restaurant, heard they are closing their doors end of the year, it\u2019s quite sad to learn about it because I would really hope to be able to have such amazing Italian food in Singapore. Thank You Chef Valentino\n\nA family favourite restaurant that\u2019s been around for a long time and unfortunately they are going to cease operations soon! Food is great as usual, their garlic bread is good, and it\u2019s white truffle season now, best time to enjoy their truffle tagliolini. Their aglio Olio is unique as it comes with whole cloves of garlic, the seafood or lobster versions taste best. Portions are on the small side making it less value for money but taste is always on point.\n\nWhat more can I say except that I wished I had dined here earlier! It is one of the pricer restaurants I\u2019ve been to AND it was worth every dollar \ud83d\udcb5 spent! Every food and drink ordered hit the spot for us - deliziosa!  Prompt and warm service crew and the chef-owner, Valentino, and his family were present, and personally supervising the service crew and attending to guests. What lovely hospitality! You should be there to soak it all up\u2026 food, drinks, great service and lovely ambience (check out the photos!) I will surely miss them when they move out. You can still catch them before their last day on 24 Dec 2023. Dining reservations strongly recommended.\n\nI love this italian restaurant & it has been my top favourite. Food is heavenly, ambience is nice & hosts are really so warm & friendly.  Never fail!\n\nHad my birthday celebration here and loved it. The portion were huge, staff were super attentive by clearing and changing plates frequently. I was pleasantly caught by surprise when the staff sang happy birthday. Highly recommended the lamb shank, pizza, salad, tiramisu and lava cake.\n\n\nOption: 2:\nName: Garibaldi\nAddress: 36 Purvis St, #01-02, Singapore 188613\nPhone: 6837 1468\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 4 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.5\nReviews: \n\nTOP notch Italian food, prices are also on the higher side (pasta $40-50, beef $70-100+). In return you get quality for what you pay for. Definitely not a daily dining Italian shop. I came with my friend for a celebration.\n\nShop opens up with a bar, and then leads you into a dining area where there were ample space and ambience was on point. Good vibes.\n\nWarm bread was fluffy and tasted perfect when dipped with a their top grade olive oil and a touch of balsamic vinegar. Starter was ok. Mushroom soup done right, service was prompt, pastas were all round tasty (one of the best), beef steak was done exactly the way I wanted it, not over cooked and not under cooked, tiramisu was a good old recipe that is worth it.\n\nI must also comment that the restaurant made an effort to portion the food for 2 for every ordered item, when they noted we were sharing everything, this I\u2019m very appreciative of.\n\nThe only thing I thought could be better were the bread sticks offered on the table, they were lacklustre as a tidbit or small bite. Maybe it\u2019s just me but I saw most tables did not bother to eat or touch.\n\nOverall, this restaurant definitely deserves a 5 stars.\n\nAlways a super experience at Garibaldi\u2019s. What a treat with the amazing starter bread that comes out steamy hot, the salad delectable and the mains delicate and delicious.\n\nFun to order different dishes so you can have a taste of all the starters, mains and desserts.\n\nWe were here for SG restaurant week and had the set lunch menu.\nNice ambience, crowded even on a weekday afternoon. Staff was nice and friendly, took care of our table and topped up the water.\nChoice of appetizer: salmon trout or wild mushroom soup\nMains: Mediterranean royal sea bream or Braised beef cheek with fettuccine\nDessert: cheese platter or blueberry yoghurt cake.\n\nVerdict: I loved the seafood dishes as it was quite fresh. Good choice of salmon and sea bream. As for the beef fettuccine, it wasn\u2019t as nice as expected. Perhaps the braised beef did not have much taste. Lastly, the dessert was alright, it was a mix of fresh blueberry, yoghurt and also blueberry jam. They could keep it simple by having a classic tiramisu instead.\n\nWent for SG Restaurant Week. Weakest point for me has to be the service. Feels like eating at a neighbourhood cafe with the lack of attention and care from staff.\n\nFood is very hit or miss. We love the scallops starter, but my burrata dish was very bland. The lobster pasta main was amazing, while the beef was disappointingly dry. We both had the blueberry yogurt dessert and it was alright.\n\nOverall wouldn\u2019t come again.\n\nJoined my friend for the SG restaurant week lunch offer this afternoon.\nTo be honest, the foods were just not to our liking and nothing impressive. The worst part was the fruits cheese dessert that was so hard and extremely salty like eating a salt cube.\n\n\nOption: 3:\nName: Pietrasanta The Italian Restaurant\nAddress: 1 Fusionopolis Way, #01-08 Connexis, Singapore 138632\nPhone: 9863 9253\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.5\nReviews: \n\nMy all tiem favourite Italian spot in Singapore! Super chill place that feels great for a Sunday afternoon lunch. Food is excellent and service is impeccable. Always start with the buratta and end your meal with the itramisu, it's just lovely. Would come more often if I didn't stay so far away!\n\nGood & friendly service staff.\nReasonably good food. The calamari and cold cuts were good. So were the pasta, focaccia, pizza of the day, fettuccine of the day, linguine of the day. Nice deserts too.\nHowever, the beef of the day was over cooked vs the medium rare that was asked for.\n\nThe star of this place are the waiters. They are so attentive and kind. They are patient and not pushy. We ordered 2 pastas to share and they platted it nicely. It was so delicious. Al dente and with lots of flavour. The cappuccino and the pistachio ice cream is also \u201cto-die-for\u201d. Make booking for indoor seats. Else, the outdoor seats were shady, not too hot and breezy too!\n\nCame here for dinner on a Friday. Ordered the fried calamari, crab gnocchi, and the sea bass. Food was okay but nothing to shout about. Service was okay, not overly warm. Tried to ask for recommendation from a person that seems to be Italian but didn\u2019t get any. I usually appreciate when they are willing to recommend or give some suggestions.\n\nI wish they would print the dishes of the day with prices rather than reciting it out to you really quickly on the spot. I\u2019m not the kind that want to be shocked when I received the bill or have to ask how much each dish cost.\n\nSaw lots of reviews that the burrata is good and is not on the menu. It seems popular enough, how about adding it in rather than it being a daily special. Someone mentioned it was $43 which is more than some of the mains!\n\nThe tiramisu seems very popular as well as I kept seeing waiters bringing it out. Unfortunately we were too full to be able to fit it in.\n\nI may have to give it another shot another time. perhaps by ordering other dishes\n\nThe restaurant is a 2 mins walk from my office but I have never tried it on a normal weekday. So on a Saturday, I brought the whole family to the restaurant and I was really impressed by it.\n\nWe ordered a few off-menu items like the burrata, guanciale pizza and the cod fish on summer vegetables. Added another mushroom risotto as well. Food is really very good and the service staff is also caring. It's one of the best Italian restaurant I visited in Singapore.\n\n\nOption: 4:\nName: iO Italian Osteria\nAddress: 4 Hillview Rise, #02 - 01, Singapore 667979\nPhone: 6710 7150\nDelivery Available: Information Not Available\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.5\nReviews: \n\nThe food and wine was excellent and exactly as we expected. Really enjoyed everything but especially the chef\u2019s special seaweed pasta and the grilled bacon wraps. Unfortunately the restaurant was busy and because it\u2019s quite open it\u2019s very loud and has a cafeteria feeling to it. The service was quite disappointing, and we had to ask multiple times where the rest of our food was (even servers came a few times to ask if we were done with the table or waiting for more items). The whole thing felt very chaotic and like no one was really on top of things; which is as disappointing. Food was good enough that we  will try again in a less busy night and hope service is better.\n\nFinally got to have a meal here, and real glad we did. Everything looked so good! I think the meatballs, which we had for starters, were simply amazing, quite possibly the best I've ever had - so tender and moist and tasty! \ud83d\ude0b  The pasta and the lasagna were wonderful also, deliciously creamy and so rich in flavours (on hindsight I really shouldn't have tried to eat the entire lasagna on my own.. way too rich \ud83d\ude05). And the pistachio tiramisu was a surprisingly delightful treat, though personally I still prefer the traditional version. Definitely coming back for more and to savour the many more other items on their menu. \ud83d\ude0a\n\nFood was average.\n\nCrispy golden seafood: under season and over fried. The squid was rubbery, fish was fishy.\n\nPasta: Too watery. With the bacon added, the taste was alright, but nothing fascinating.\n\nMeatball small bite: tender and flavourful.\n\nService was prompt, but I do not like how they tried to clear your plates as you are having a meal. Space between tables is also small, making it rather uncomfortable.\n\nLoved the service by the staff. They are friendly and accommodating. They would check about the food too.\n\nFood was great; tasty and generous. It\u2019s nice to now that the class of dish can be found in the area. Love it.\n\nThe space is pretty crowded, especially on weekend. Walking areas between the tables and payment area are tight. Worth to mention too, the ventilation can be improved. The air was towards the warmer side (probably because of the crowd during dinner time?) and made clothes smell.\n\nThe baked pork belly deserves special mention. The succulent and perfectly seasoned pork is roasted to a crispy, golden perfection, while the meat inside remains tender and flavorful. Every bite is a harmonious combination of savory, salty, and wild fennel flavors that dance on your palate.\n\nOf course, I couldn't leave without indulging in their delectable pistachio tiramisu, which was the perfect sweet ending to my Italian gastronomic adventure.\n\n\nOption: 5:\nName: La Braceria Pizza & Grill\nAddress: 5 Greendale Ave, Singapore 289501\nPhone: 6465 5918\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: Closed\nTuesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.4\nReviews: \n\nGreat Italian restaurant for a date. The food was authentically Italian and the vibe was so casual and cool. I am all about the wood fired pizza. We ordered pizza with mushroom and meat it was so hearty and delicious. The gnocchi was creamy and hit the spot. The surprise was the dessert. I never had the citrus cake before and it was a revelation. Absolutely loved it. Can\u2019t recommend it enough. Overall the food and service makes this restaurant worthy of a visit again.\n\ndefinitely enjoyed our dinner here, staff were attentive and friendly. The seafood platter was fresh, the steak was definitely a 10/10. The fresh crab meat pasta was good too. Will come back again.\n\nNice place but would I go back again? Maybe not. Review below\n\nFood 4 pts\n- Quality of the ingredients was good.\n- pork collar steak was nicely done with steam veg and the roasted potatoes slay\n- wagyu tenderloin was done correctly, however the Angus turned more rare than medium rare which makes me think it was cold when cooked\n- beef dishes were a bit overpriced\n- pizza was nice though floppy. If you are looking for crispy crust or sourdough base, this isn\u2019t the place.\n- food was served fast\n- portion are mostly single served and not really meant for sharing or communal dining\n\nAmbience 4 pts\n- nice place to chill and meet friends for meals and generally talk\n\nService. 3.5 pts\n- severs were attentive but there was a slight miscommunication between them and my wife who just wanted normal cold water and they open a bottle of cold mineral water for us.\n\nThe pasta was the best!! We had Mediterranean salad which was good, it\u2019s like Italian mix with Greece. We ordered spaghetti vongole and spaghetti seafood with Bisque sauce, both are delicious and I almost lick the plate, I\u2019m sad that I\u2019m full already if not will order cheese cake for sure. It\u2019s my new favourite Italian restaurant for now, love the service and vibe so much, it\u2019s casual and classy, parking is complimentary valet is a plus! Will be back 100%\n\nGreat Italian dishes.  Especially the starter fish dish.  Superb and nicely executed\n\nDeep fried calamari is so good!\n\nPork collar was nicely seared and presented\n\nPizza with anchovies are interesting\n\nRisotto was also good\nSeafood pasta was not as exciting though\n\nOverall a good dining experience\n\nHowever,  I hope the servers can be more attentive in filing the wine glasses of customers when it goes empty.\n\n\nOption: 6:\nName: Buona Terra\nAddress: 29 Scotts Rd, Singapore 228224\nPhone: 6733 0209\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 6:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSunday: Closed\n\nPrice Level: 4 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.5\nReviews: \n\nVisited in Sep 2023\n\nA fantastic dining experience. The dry-aged duck main course was absolutely fantastic and so was the fish/turbot main course dish. The beef carpaccio course was also brilliant. The restaurant doesn\u2019t have a non-alcoholic pairing and that\u2019s probably a small area where they can improve their \u2018value proposition\u2019.\n\nService was top notch.\n\nA definite recommendation for a classy dinner experience\n\nWonderful culinary experience from the start till the end. The location and ambiance is welcoming and cosy, the staff is friendly and took great care of us, the food is delicious, high attention to details and wonderful ingredients from all over the globe. The chef is very talented and creative. The sommelier chose some amazing wines and champagne to pair the dishes with. Amazing experience.\n\nModern Italian restaurant serving interestingly innovative dishes especially the amuse bouches. Wine pairing was generous and well thought out - always a nice way to find new wines if a restaurant gets it right! Service was good. Small but well spaced and clean relaxed ambience.\n\nA sensational lunch which well exceeds its price point of $178++ per pax. The only criticism would be that the bread course was uninspiring, but who cares? It\u2019s free anyway. Canap\u00e9s started with their signature playful tomato soup. Using trompe l\u2019oeil to make it look like tomatoes it\u2019s actually a soft shell with tomato gazpacho encased within. The scallop tartare with avocado and tomato jelly was wonderfully light with all the elements working in harmony. The cod mousse taco was nice but overshadowed by its two counterparts. The first course started with a bang, yellowtail finished table side with a horseradish snow. Light, refreshing and full of flavour with an added air of theatricality for good measure. The second course was Mozambique langoustine which was the highlight of the menu. Sitting on top of a creamy anchovy sauce. The sweetness of the langoustine was a perfect complement to the (not-too) salty sauce. While the gem lettuce added some crunch to contrast with the soft and plump shellfish. This course was pure delight from start to finish! The pasta course was an elevated carbonara which utilised cured egg yolk. It was not too heavy which was a pleasant surprise. The main was veal with white asparagus coated in sabayon in a moscato sauce. The veal was cooked to perfection and the kitchen, once again, demonstrate their attention to detail by ensuring that each dish consists of an equal balance of flavours and textures. The palate cleanser was finished table side with a prickly pear granita, highly refreshing after two somewhat heavier courses. The dessert was the chef\u2019s take on semifreddo using Marsala grapes, dessert wine sauce and clotted cream. Wonderful and I loved the bitterness of the grapes and wine sauce. Overall a spectacular meal, one of the best michelin-starred lunches one can grab in Singapore that showcases high quality ingredients, inventiveness while also not ripping a gigantic hole in one\u2019s pocket. The setting of the restaurant is intimate and perfect for a date or a more private business meeting. Staff are warm, attentive and knowledgeable (and also take good photos).

Didn\u2019t really ate too much of the pasta though its very good cos need to save space for cheese and desserts!\n\nAll the food was excellent, the service was courteous and friendly, and we had a great time. (Honestly, the quality of the Asian food wasn't that great.) The chefs came around during the meal to give us tastings, and it felt like we were at a friend's party. It was a great time. Thank you:)\n\nDelicious brunch with an extensive selection of Italian cheese. The Lasagna was also extremely delicious! The service was perfect as well. Money well spent and a very fun afternoon thanks to wine/prosecco free flow as well.\n\nWent for Sunday brunch. Cheese room is lovely with a wide selection of cheeses. Loved the unique chocolate cheeses and burratas. Mains selection is ok, could be larger. Lamb stew was nice. Desserts are good as well.\n\nThe restaurant offers an array of \ud83e\uddc0 cheese.\nIf you are a cheese lover, this will be the restaurant for you!\nWe had buffet but the selection is limited unlike the conventional buffet.  However, food is delicious.\nThe service is good.

Would highly recommend getting the seven course menu as there were so many more elements in our dinner incorporated that made it all the more special. Flavours were all very well balanced and overall we left feeling very satisfied.\n\nVisited in Sep 2023\n\nBraci was on my list of restaurants to visit for over 4 years and I must say that it was worth the wait. It is no surprise that Braci has retained its Michelin 1 star for 6 consecutive years. The menu was a progressive one which is definitely inspired by Chef Mattie\u2019s Italian roots. There are 2 choices for people (5 course and 7 course). I would suggest people to go for the 7 course as the additional dishes in the 7 course meal are worth it. One of my favourite parts of the experience was trying out the 100 yr old balsamic vinegar.\n\nIf you\u2019re not taking the wine pairing, I would strongly recommend folks to try out a few of their cocktails, esp. their Negroni (one of the most unique ones I\u2019ve had)\n\nService was good. The restaurant is able to cater to some food allergies (like my shellfish allergy).\n\nA definite recommendation for fine dining lovers.\n\nAmazing time at Braci for a birthday celebration for my husband. The Italian food was superb with beautiful floral aesthetic to each dishes. Staff is polite and friendly too! Special thanks to Chef Matteo who is very engaging and make the day extra special! Love the black truffle \"hide and seek\" dish which is one of the highlights of all dishes! It so savoury and unforgettable\u2026.\n\nnice food nice atmosphere. i tot the service could be more positive. but i still enjoy the experience especially on a chill night in the rooftop. overall quite an expensive experience but they were very nice to add an additional anniversary dessert for us:)\n\nOther than the desserts and A5 miyazaki wagyu the rest is just average. Burnt A5 miyazaki wagyu comes with bitter taste. Would still recommend diners to top up and try the wagyu beef. If not you might get the duck which is just average.\nWaiter was coughing while serving so not sure if that is a good service.\nThe desserts is awesome and the balsamic vinegar is nice too.\n\n\nOption: 9:\nName: Publico Ristorante\nAddress: 1 Nanson Rd, Singapore 238909\nPhone: 6826 5040\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.3\nReviews: \n\nThis is a very vibrant Italian restaurant with solid sound coming from Bose speakers. Food is great. Slow cooked Lamb Ragu pasta and eggplant parmigiana are amazing. Their firewood pizza is not to be missed too. A perfect environment to stay and chill with a glass or wine or beer after a nice dinner.\n\nI visited this place for a dinner date. We had already made a reservation in advance, as we knew very well that this place would be packed on the weekends.\n\nThe staff were very nice to greet us as we made our way into the restaurant and even walked us over to our tables. The waiter at the time was very observant, and would constantly check up on how we were  doing.\n\nMore on the food:\n\n(Appetizer)\nBurrata Bruschetta - 8/10 \ud83c\udf1f\n- The Burrata was really lovely!\n- The sweet and juicy tomatoes compliments the creamy and milky cheese\n\nHowever, the bread was a little tougher than expected that our knives struggle to cut through. Nevertheless, it was pretty delicious \ud83e\udd24\ud83d\ude0b\n\n(Appetizer)\nEggplant Parmigiana -  10/10 \ud83c\udf1f\ud83e\udd0c\n- Absolutely bussin!\n- It tastes better than a regular lasagne, the eggplant is barely noticeable. Which is good in a way as my partner is not too much of a fan of veggies.\n- The sauce topped with the cheese just makes this dish one of the best in my opinion\n\n(Main)\nDiavola pizza - 9/10 \ud83c\udf1f\n- Spicy, greasy and meaty pizza\n- The spicy and salty sorpressata balances the thick and absorbent pizza dough\n- Low-key better than pepperoni pizzas \ud83e\udd2d\n\n*Unfortunately I forgot to take a picture*\n\n(Dessert)\nFlamb\u00e9ed Chocolate Ecstasy - 6/10\ud83c\udf1f\n- Presentation was really good \ud83d\udc4d\n- Interesting concept of both Hot and Cold dessert\n\nHowever, our brownies were a little too frozen \ud83d\ude15. We knew it was a hot and cold dessert as there was ice cream served with the hot-plated brownies. But when we tried to scoop booth goodies, the brownie was frozen hahaha. Interesting concept but would recommend other stuff like the tiramisu maybe.\n\nOverall, excellent experience. Prompt service, a little pricey but worth the occasional visits. Came in hungry, left full  \ud83d\ude35\n\nMy first time dining here and the staffs here are really sweet and customer oriented. They made the dining here with my girlfriend beyond pleasant. They made small talks with you and check on you regarding the quality of the food. The food was amazing but my friend and I couldn\u2019t finished it because we are 2 girls that over ordered. If you are going for a date, this place is extremely ideal. Will definitely be back.\n\nWas here for a birthday celebration. Staff was very nice and provided complimentary tiramisu cake (slightly alcoholic), which tasted phenomenal. Pizza is very well balanced and does not get gelat from a few bites, while the pastas and risottos pack a good flavourful punch. In total, it was slightly pricey but overall nice place to wine and dine.\n\nRegarding indoors seating, music is kinda loud to have a clear conversation. Place is pet friendly and there are many dogs around\n\nService was underwhelming for the price paid.  Not the worst. But one would expect better.\n\nFood. so long is pizza or pasta or Italian is nice. The pork chop was soso only.  Pizza came before the starters.\n\nDessert is a must have!! The tiramsu and flaming chocolate extasy. Don't touch the hot pan!!!\n\nWine selection is good and recommendation by the wine guy was great!!!\n\nGood for celebrations... or hangout.\nBut bring a big wallet.\n\nFree parking (4hrs) too if u need to know  1 ticket per bill.\n\n\nOption: 10:\nName: Waterfall Ristorante Italiano\nAddress: 22 Orange Grove Rd, Level One, Garden Wing, Singapore 258350\nPhone: 6213 4398\nDelivery Available: Information Not Available\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 3 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.5\nReviews: \n\nProfessional service was provided by the thoughtful and attentive staff. An entire birthday cake, not merely a slice, was given to us. Most dishes were great. The highlight of the meal was the seafood stew. All the breads were also exceptionally delicious. However, the sea bass tasted very ordinary and the sky high price tag went to the showy \u2018performance\u2019 by the chef. Restaurant was too dim and had a funky smell.\n\nThe staff are very friendly and the food is also tasty. The portion is surprisingly big and we ate till our hearts content.\n\nStaff very helpful and polite. Atmosphere is chill with soft music. Food serve just in the right timing.  Of cause the price is not cheap. But it worth the price overall.\n\nLastly thanks for the birthday cake. Love it but we were too full to finish it.\n\nBooked Sunday afternoon to have their set lunch, only to find out they only serve buffet that day at $78++ per person. Opted in anyway and didn't regret it, given the fresh ingredients, great taste of Italian and friendly staffs! Personally I love the dessert section especially Panna Cotta! If I had to pick on something, it'd be the dim lighting. No discount on the bill even with Shangri-la Circle membership, but you do get extra points.\n\nRemember, when you get into the lobby, you are on 3F. You need to take an elevator to get down to 1F where the restaurant is.\n\nThe restaurant has decent ambience for a semi chic and comfortable dinning experience. The salt crusted fish is delicious and if you want to see some fire show. The winner for me is the crab pasta. Yum!\n\nEverything about this place is 5 stars!\nThe ambience is so perfect that you are at ease the moment you are inside the restaurant. Menu is designed in such a way that you can have the best vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes without feeling less about your dish. Staff is courteous and even after attending so many guests, they always find time to attend to you/your requests. The serving is very clean and within time. They have good sitting arrangements both inside and outside. Billing is fast and accurate.\n",

In return you get quality for what you pay for. Definitely not a daily dining Italian shop. I came with my friend for a celebration.\n\nShop opens up with a bar, and then leads you into a dining area where there were ample space and ambience was on point. Good vibes.\n\nWarm bread was fluffy and tasted perfect when dipped with a their top grade olive oil and a touch of balsamic vinegar. Starter was ok. Mushroom soup done right, service was prompt, pastas were all round tasty (one of the best), beef steak was done exactly the way I wanted it, not over cooked and not under cooked, tiramisu was a good old recipe that is worth it.\n\nI must also comment that the restaurant made an effort to portion the food for 2 for every ordered item, when they noted we were sharing everything, this I\u2019m very appreciative of.\n\nThe only thing I thought could be better were the bread sticks offered on the table, they were lacklustre as a tidbit or small bite. Maybe it\u2019s just me but I saw most tables did not bother to eat or touch.\n\nOverall, this restaurant definitely deserves a 5 stars.\n\nAlways a super experience at Garibaldi\u2019s. What a treat with the amazing starter bread that comes out steamy hot, the salad delectable and the mains delicate and delicious.\n\nFun to order different dishes so you can have a taste of all the starters, mains and desserts.\n\nWe were here for SG restaurant week and had the set lunch menu.\nNice ambience, crowded even on a weekday afternoon. Staff was nice and friendly, took care of our table and topped up the water.\nChoice of appetizer: salmon trout or wild mushroom soup\nMains: Mediterranean royal sea bream or Braised beef cheek with fettuccine\nDessert: cheese platter or blueberry yoghurt cake.\n\nVerdict: I loved the seafood dishes as it was quite fresh. Good choice of salmon and sea bream. As for the beef fettuccine, it wasn\u2019t as nice as expected. Perhaps the braised beef did not have much taste. Lastly, the dessert was alright, it was a mix of fresh blueberry, yoghurt and also blueberry jam. They could keep it simple by having a classic tiramisu instead.\n\nWent for SG Restaurant Week. Weakest point for me has to be the service. Feels like eating at a neighbourhood cafe with the lack of attention and care from staff.\n\nFood is very hit or miss. We love the scallops starter, but my burrata dish was very bland. The lobster pasta main was amazing, while the beef was disappointingly dry. We both had the blueberry yogurt dessert and it was alright.\n\nOverall wouldn\u2019t come again.\n\nJoined my friend for the SG restaurant week lunch offer this afternoon.\nTo be honest, the foods were just not to our liking and nothing impressive. The worst part was the fruits cheese dessert that was so hard and extremely salty like eating a salt cube.\n\n\nOption: 2:\nName: Pietrasanta The Italian Restaurant\nAddress: 1 Fusionopolis Way, #01-08 Connexis, Singapore 138632\nPhone: 9863 9253\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.5\nReviews: \n\nMy all tiem favourite Italian spot in Singapore! Super chill place that feels great for a Sunday afternoon lunch. Food is excellent and service is impeccable. Always start with the buratta and end your meal with the itramisu, it's just lovely. Would come more often if I didn't stay so far away!\n\nGood & friendly service staff.\nReasonably good food. The calamari and cold cuts were good. So were the pasta, focaccia, pizza of the day, fettuccine of the day, linguine of the day. Nice deserts too.\nHowever, the beef of the day was over cooked vs the medium rare that was asked for.\n\nThe star of this place are the waiters. They are so attentive and kind. They are patient and not pushy. We ordered 2 pastas to share and they platted it nicely. It was so delicious. Al dente and with lots of flavour. The cappuccino and the pistachio ice cream is also \u201cto-die-for\u201d. Make booking for indoor seats. Else, the outdoor seats were shady, not too hot and breezy too!\n\nCame here for dinner on a Friday. Ordered the fried calamari, crab gnocchi, and the sea bass. Food was okay but nothing to shout about. Service was okay, not overly warm. Tried to ask for recommendation from a person that seems to be Italian but didn\u2019t get any. I usually appreciate when they are willing to recommend or give some suggestions.\n\nI wish they would print the dishes of the day with prices rather than reciting it out to you really quickly on the spot. I\u2019m not the kind that want to be shocked when I received the bill or have to ask how much each dish cost.\n\nSaw lots of reviews that the burrata is good and is not on the menu. It seems popular enough, how about adding it in rather than it being a daily special. Someone mentioned it was $43 which is more than some of the mains!\n\nThe tiramisu seems very popular as well as I kept seeing waiters bringing it out. Unfortunately we were too full to be able to fit it in.\n\nI may have to give it another shot another time. perhaps by ordering other dishes\n\nThe restaurant is a 2 mins walk from my office but I have never tried it on a normal weekday. So on a Saturday, I brought the whole family to the restaurant and I was really impressed by it.\n\nWe ordered a few off-menu items like the burrata, guanciale pizza and the cod fish on summer vegetables. Added another mushroom risotto as well. Food is really very good and the service staff is also caring.

Thank You Chef Valentino\n\nA family favourite restaurant that\u2019s been around for a long time and unfortunately they are going to cease operations soon! Food is great as usual, their garlic bread is good, and it\u2019s white truffle season now, best time to enjoy their truffle tagliolini. Their aglio Olio is unique as it comes with whole cloves of garlic, the seafood or lobster versions taste best. Portions are on the small side making it less value for money but taste is always on point.\n\nWhat more can I say except that I wished I had dined here earlier! It is one of the pricer restaurants I\u2019ve been to AND it was worth every dollar \ud83d\udcb5 spent! Every food and drink ordered hit the spot for us - deliziosa!  Prompt and warm service crew and the chef-owner, Valentino, and his family were present, and personally supervising the service crew and attending to guests. What lovely hospitality! You should be there to soak it all up\u2026 food, drinks, great service and lovely ambience (check out the photos!) I will surely miss them when they move out. You can still catch them before their last day on 24 Dec 2023. Dining reservations strongly recommended.\n\nI love this italian restaurant & it has been my top favourite. Food is heavenly, ambience is nice & hosts are really so warm & friendly.  Never fail!\n\nHad my birthday celebration here and loved it. The portion were huge, staff were super attentive by clearing and changing plates frequently. I was pleasantly caught by surprise when the staff sang happy birthday. Highly recommended the lamb shank, pizza, salad, tiramisu and lava cake.\n\n\nOption: 4:\nName: Buona Terra\nAddress: 29 Scotts Rd, Singapore 228224\nPhone: 6733 0209\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 6:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSunday: Closed\n\nPrice Level: 4 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.5\nReviews: \n\nVisited in Sep 2023\n\nA fantastic dining experience. The dry-aged duck main course was absolutely fantastic and so was the fish/turbot main course dish. The beef carpaccio course was also brilliant. The restaurant doesn\u2019t have a non-alcoholic pairing and that\u2019s probably a small area where they can improve their \u2018value proposition\u2019.\n\nService was top notch.\n\nA definite recommendation for a classy dinner experience\n\nWonderful culinary experience from the start till the end. The location and ambiance is welcoming and cosy, the staff is friendly and took great care of us, the food is delicious, high attention to details and wonderful ingredients from all over the globe. The chef is very talented and creative. The sommelier chose some amazing wines and champagne to pair the dishes with. Amazing experience.\n\nModern Italian restaurant serving interestingly innovative dishes especially the amuse bouches. Wine pairing was generous and well thought out - always a nice way to find new wines if a restaurant gets it right! Service was good. Small but well spaced and clean relaxed ambience.\n\nA sensational lunch which well exceeds its price point of $178++ per pax. The only criticism would be that the bread course was uninspiring, but who cares? It\u2019s free anyway. Canap\u00e9s started with their signature playful tomato soup. Using trompe l\u2019oeil to make it look like tomatoes it\u2019s actually a soft shell with tomato gazpacho encased within. The scallop tartare with avocado and tomato jelly was wonderfully light with all the elements working in harmony. The cod mousse taco was nice but overshadowed by its two counterparts. The first course started with a bang, yellowtail finished table side with a horseradish snow. Light, refreshing and full of flavour with an added air of theatricality for good measure. The second course was Mozambique langoustine which was the highlight of the menu. Sitting on top of a creamy anchovy sauce. The sweetness of the langoustine was a perfect complement to the (not-too) salty sauce. While the gem lettuce added some crunch to contrast with the soft and plump shellfish. This course was pure delight from start to finish! The pasta course was an elevated carbonara which utilised cured egg yolk. It was not too heavy which was a pleasant surprise. The main was veal with white asparagus coated in sabayon in a moscato sauce. The veal was cooked to perfection and the kitchen, once again, demonstrate their attention to detail by ensuring that each dish consists of an equal balance of flavours and textures. The palate cleanser was finished table side with a prickly pear granita, highly refreshing after two somewhat heavier courses. The dessert was the chef\u2019s take on semifreddo using Marsala grapes, dessert wine sauce and clotted cream. Wonderful and I loved the bitterness of the grapes and wine sauce. Overall a spectacular meal, one of the best michelin-starred lunches one can grab in Singapore that showcases high quality ingredients, inventiveness while also not ripping a gigantic hole in one\u2019s pocket. The setting of the restaurant is intimate and perfect for a date or a more private business meeting. Staff are warm, attentive and knowledgeable (and also take good photos). Definitely worth a visit.\n\nfood was clean and unique. the presentation was beautiful. staffs were very friendly and attentive. overall, i\u2019ve enjoyed my meal very much\n\n\nOption: 5:\nName: Basilico\nAddress: 1 Cuscaden Rd, Level 2, Singapore 249715\nPhone: 6725 3232\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 3 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.4\nReviews: \n\nHave not been here for quite awhile, so went for their Thursday steak buffet. Still as good with all the appetizers and pizzas. The steak is soft and juicy but pity the tomahawk is a bit dry. Roast lamb is great as well. Didn\u2019t really ate too much of the pasta though its very good cos need to save space for cheese and desserts!\n\nAll the food was excellent, the service was courteous and friendly, and we had a great time. (Honestly, the quality of the Asian food wasn't that great.) The chefs came around during the meal to give us tastings, and it felt like we were at a friend's party. It was a great time. Thank you:)\n\nDelicious brunch with an extensive selection of Italian cheese. The Lasagna was also extremely delicious! The service was perfect as well. Money well spent and a very fun afternoon thanks to wine/prosecco free flow as well.\n\nWent for Sunday brunch. Cheese room is lovely with a wide selection of cheeses. Loved the unique chocolate cheeses and burratas. Mains selection is ok, could be larger. Lamb stew was nice. Desserts are good as well.\n\nThe restaurant offers an array of \ud83e\uddc0 cheese.\nIf you are a cheese lover, this will be the restaurant for you!\nWe had buffet but the selection is limited unlike the conventional buffet.  However, food is delicious.\nThe service is good.

Food is great. Slow cooked Lamb Ragu pasta and eggplant parmigiana are amazing. Their firewood pizza is not to be missed too. A perfect environment to stay and chill with a glass or wine or beer after a nice dinner.\n\nI visited this place for a dinner date. We had already made a reservation in advance, as we knew very well that this place would be packed on the weekends.\n\nThe staff were very nice to greet us as we made our way into the restaurant and even walked us over to our tables. The waiter at the time was very observant, and would constantly check up on how we were  doing.\n\nMore on the food:\n\n(Appetizer)\nBurrata Bruschetta - 8/10 \ud83c\udf1f\n- The Burrata was really lovely!\n- The sweet and juicy tomatoes compliments the creamy and milky cheese\n\nHowever, the bread was a little tougher than expected that our knives struggle to cut through. Nevertheless, it was pretty delicious \ud83e\udd24\ud83d\ude0b\n\n(Appetizer)\nEggplant Parmigiana -  10/10 \ud83c\udf1f\ud83e\udd0c\n- Absolutely bussin!\n- It tastes better than a regular lasagne, the eggplant is barely noticeable. Which is good in a way as my partner is not too much of a fan of veggies.\n- The sauce topped with the cheese just makes this dish one of the best in my opinion\n\n(Main)\nDiavola pizza - 9/10 \ud83c\udf1f\n- Spicy, greasy and meaty pizza\n- The spicy and salty sorpressata balances the thick and absorbent pizza dough\n- Low-key better than pepperoni pizzas \ud83e\udd2d\n\n*Unfortunately I forgot to take a picture*\n\n(Dessert)\nFlamb\u00e9ed Chocolate Ecstasy - 6/10\ud83c\udf1f\n- Presentation was really good \ud83d\udc4d\n- Interesting concept of both Hot and Cold dessert\n\nHowever, our brownies were a little too frozen \ud83d\ude15. We knew it was a hot and cold dessert as there was ice cream served with the hot-plated brownies. But when we tried to scoop booth goodies, the brownie was frozen hahaha. Interesting concept but would recommend other stuff like the tiramisu maybe.\n\nOverall, excellent experience. Prompt service, a little pricey but worth the occasional visits. Came in hungry, left full  \ud83d\ude35\n\nMy first time dining here and the staffs here are really sweet and customer oriented. They made the dining here with my girlfriend beyond pleasant. They made small talks with you and check on you regarding the quality of the food. The food was amazing but my friend and I couldn\u2019t finished it because we are 2 girls that over ordered. If you are going for a date, this place is extremely ideal. Will definitely be back.\n\nWas here for a birthday celebration. Staff was very nice and provided complimentary tiramisu cake (slightly alcoholic), which tasted phenomenal. Pizza is very well balanced and does not get gelat from a few bites, while the pastas and risottos pack a good flavourful punch. In total, it was slightly pricey but overall nice place to wine and dine.\n\nRegarding indoors seating, music is kinda loud to have a clear conversation. Place is pet friendly and there are many dogs around\n\nService was underwhelming for the price paid.  Not the worst. But one would expect better.\n\nFood. so long is pizza or pasta or Italian is nice. The pork chop was soso only.  Pizza came before the starters.\n\nDessert is a must have!! The tiramsu and flaming chocolate extasy. Don't touch the hot pan!!!\n\nWine selection is good and recommendation by the wine guy was great!!!\n\nGood for celebrations... or hangout.\nBut bring a big wallet.\n\nFree parking (4hrs) too if u need to know  1 ticket per bill.\n\n\nOption: 7:\nName: La Braceria Pizza & Grill\nAddress: 5 Greendale Ave, Singapore 289501\nPhone: 6465 5918\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: Closed\nTuesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.4\nReviews: \n\nGreat Italian restaurant for a date. The food was authentically Italian and the vibe was so casual and cool. I am all about the wood fired pizza. We ordered pizza with mushroom and meat it was so hearty and delicious. The gnocchi was creamy and hit the spot. The surprise was the dessert. I never had the citrus cake before and it was a revelation. Absolutely loved it. Can\u2019t recommend it enough. Overall the food and service makes this restaurant worthy of a visit again.\n\ndefinitely enjoyed our dinner here, staff were attentive and friendly. The seafood platter was fresh, the steak was definitely a 10/10. The fresh crab meat pasta was good too. Will come back again.\n\nNice place but would I go back again? Maybe not. Review below\n\nFood 4 pts\n- Quality of the ingredients was good.\n- pork collar steak was nicely done with steam veg and the roasted potatoes slay\n- wagyu tenderloin was done correctly, however the Angus turned more rare than medium rare which makes me think it was cold when cooked\n- beef dishes were a bit overpriced\n- pizza was nice though floppy. If you are looking for crispy crust or sourdough base, this isn\u2019t the place.\n- food was served fast\n- portion are mostly single served and not really meant for sharing or communal dining\n\nAmbience 4 pts\n- nice place to chill and meet friends for meals and generally talk\n\nService. 3.5 pts\n- severs were attentive but there was a slight miscommunication between them and my wife who just wanted normal cold water and they open a bottle of cold mineral water for us.\n\nThe pasta was the best!! We had Mediterranean salad which was good, it\u2019s like Italian mix with Greece. We ordered spaghetti vongole and spaghetti seafood with Bisque sauce, both are delicious and I almost lick the plate, I\u2019m sad that I\u2019m full already if not will order cheese cake for sure. It\u2019s my new favourite Italian restaurant for now, love the service and vibe so much, it\u2019s casual and classy, parking is complimentary valet is a plus! Will be back 100%\n\nGreat Italian dishes.  Especially the starter fish dish.  Superb and nicely executed\n\nDeep fried calamari is so good!\n\nPork collar was nicely seared and presented\n\nPizza with anchovies are interesting\n\nRisotto was also good\nSeafood pasta was not as exciting though\n\nOverall a good dining experience\n\nHowever,  I hope the servers can be more attentive in filing the wine glasses of customers when it goes empty.\n\n\nOption: 8:\nName: Altro Zafferano\nAddress: 10 Collyer Quay, Level 43, Singapore 049315\nPhone: 6509 1488\nDelivery Available: No\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nSunday: Closed\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.3\nReviews: \n\nThey serve some of the most delectable Italian dishes we've ever had, each dish was prepared with exquisite flavours. We highly recommend trying the White Truffle Tagliolini while it is still in season. The ambiance of the restaurant is brilliant, perfect place for a romantic dinner, or just a night out with friends/family. We wholeheartedly recommend this restaurant to anyone who appreciates fine Italian cuisine and exceptional service.\n\nOur server, Cheryl/Cherry, went above and beyond to make our dining experience truly exceptional, we want to express our sincere gratitude for making our dining experience memorable.

We enjoyed our starters which were the lobster and the carpaccio more than we did the mains! But overall food was delicately plated and delicious.\n\nThe service here was nothing short of amazing as well, the waiters were very attentive and explained each dish to us, checked on how we\u2019d like the food every now and then which we appreciate.\n\nEspecially enjoyed the part where we got the option to have our desserts alfresco with the amazing view of the city lights and MBS area.\n\nPricey but overall would recommend for a special occasion!\n\nFrom the food itself to the service offered all we could say is it\u2019s stunningly perfect.

We took a set 3/4 course menu, and the chef was kind enough to bake in dietary preferences (eg. Vegetarian for me). All the items were amazing. But (weirdly) a special callout for the warmest and loveliest bread that I have eaten in a long time. And yes, if you do manage to get a seat outside, the view of Marina bay is just spectacular.\n\nStaff were absolutely friendly and attentive. I brought my mom who rarely enjoys fine dining but she thoroughly enjoyed her experience and were overjoyed with the dessert recommended by the manager. The ambience is cosy. Decor and interior looks ok but not too exciting. Desserts were truly the highlight. We had the espresso mascarpone and amalfi lemon desserts and it was perfect for both our taste buds.\n\n\nOption: 9:\nName: iO Italian Osteria\nAddress: 4 Hillview Rise, #02 - 01, Singapore 667979\nPhone: 6710 7150\nDelivery Available: Information Not Available\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.5\nReviews: \n\nThe food and wine was excellent and exactly as we expected. Really enjoyed everything but especially the chef\u2019s special seaweed pasta and the grilled bacon wraps. Unfortunately the restaurant was busy and because it\u2019s quite open it\u2019s very loud and has a cafeteria feeling to it. The service was quite disappointing, and we had to ask multiple times where the rest of our food was (even servers came a few times to ask if we were done with the table or waiting for more items). The whole thing felt very chaotic and like no one was really on top of things; which is as disappointing. Food was good enough that we  will try again in a less busy night and hope service is better.\n\nFinally got to have a meal here, and real glad we did. Everything looked so good! I think the meatballs, which we had for starters, were simply amazing, quite possibly the best I've ever had - so tender and moist and tasty! \ud83d\ude0b  The pasta and the lasagna were wonderful also, deliciously creamy and so rich in flavours (on hindsight I really shouldn't have tried to eat the entire lasagna on my own.. way too rich \ud83d\ude05). And the pistachio tiramisu was a surprisingly delightful treat, though personally I still prefer the traditional version. Definitely coming back for more and to savour the many more other items on their menu. \ud83d\ude0a\n\nFood was average.\n\nCrispy golden seafood: under season and over fried. The squid was rubbery, fish was fishy.\n\nPasta: Too watery. With the bacon added, the taste was alright, but nothing fascinating.\n\nMeatball small bite: tender and flavourful.\n\nService was prompt, but I do not like how they tried to clear your plates as you are having a meal. Space between tables is also small, making it rather uncomfortable.\n\nLoved the service by the staff. They are friendly and accommodating. They would check about the food too.\n\nFood was great; tasty and generous. It\u2019s nice to now that the class of dish can be found in the area. Love it.\n\nThe space is pretty crowded, especially on weekend. Walking areas between the tables and payment area are tight. Worth to mention too, the ventilation can be improved. The air was towards the warmer side (probably because of the crowd during dinner time?) and made clothes smell.\n\nThe baked pork belly deserves special mention. The succulent and perfectly seasoned pork is roasted to a crispy, golden perfection, while the meat inside remains tender and flavorful. Every bite is a harmonious combination of savory, salty, and wild fennel flavors that dance on your palate.\n\nOf course, I couldn't leave without indulging in their delectable pistachio tiramisu, which was the perfect sweet ending to my Italian gastronomic adventure.\n\n\nOption: 10:\nName: Braci\nAddress: 52 Boat Quay, #05-01/ #06-01, Singapore 049841\nPhone: 6866 1933\nDelivery Available: No\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20091:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20091:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20091:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20091:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20091:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20091:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20091:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.5\nReviews: \n\nOur experience at Braci was probably one of our most memorable meals and the food served was truly deserving of its Michelin star. Would highly recommend getting the seven course menu as there were so many more elements in our dinner incorporated that made it all the more special. Flavours were all very well balanced and overall we left feeling very satisfied.\n\nVisited in Sep 2023\n\nBraci was on my list of restaurants to visit for over 4 years and I must say that it was worth the wait. It is no surprise that Braci has retained its Michelin 1 star for 6 consecutive years. The menu was a progressive one which is definitely inspired by Chef Mattie\u2019s Italian roots. There are 2 choices for people (5 course and 7 course). I would suggest people to go for the 7 course as the additional dishes in the 7 course meal are worth it. One of my favourite parts of the experience was trying out the 100 yr old balsamic vinegar.\n\nIf you\u2019re not taking the wine pairing, I would strongly recommend folks to try out a few of their cocktails, esp. their Negroni (one of the most unique ones I\u2019ve had)\n\nService was good. The restaurant is able to cater to some food allergies (like my shellfish allergy).\n\nA definite recommendation for fine dining lovers.\n\nAmazing time at Braci for a birthday celebration for my husband. The Italian food was superb with beautiful floral aesthetic to each dishes. Staff is polite and friendly too! Special thanks to Chef Matteo who is very engaging and make the day extra special! Love the black truffle \"hide and seek\" dish which is one of the highlights of all dishes! It so savoury and unforgettable\u2026.\n\nnice food nice atmosphere. i tot the service could be more positive. but i still enjoy the experience especially on a chill night in the rooftop. overall quite an expensive experience but they were very nice to add an additional anniversary dessert for us:)\n\nOther than the desserts and A5 miyazaki wagyu the rest is just average. Burnt A5 miyazaki wagyu comes with bitter taste. Would still recommend diners to top up and try the wagyu beef. If not you might get the duck which is just average.\nWaiter was coughing while serving so not sure if that is a good service.\nThe desserts is awesome and the balsamic vinegar is nice too.\n",

We decided on a mexican fiesta and as such, popped in for a quick fix and to our delightful surprise, we were not at all disappointed.\n\nMy dish was about $19 before GST. It was fried chicken with loads of tomato sauce on it, with cilantro rice and nachos on the side. My friends had nachos and enchiladas. The flavours were good and the cilantro rice was so yummy. They didn\u2019t skimp on the cilantro and the rice was cooked to perfection, every rice with that intense cilantro flavour. My chicken was fried to perfection, and it was juicy and moist. The serving size is generous for what you\u2019re paying.\n\nThe restaurant service was attentive, and I loved that they provided free iced water to patrons. Such should be the standard of more restaurants in Singapore.\n\nThe decor was quaint and cute.\n\nAbsolutely love the Mexican food here especially the Soup with the fresh seafood in it had the nachos with pulled pork which was amazing the enchiladas filled with beef and the set with taco and enchilada with beans on the side I added guacamole as well which was great! Definitely would recommend this! Though service is sometimes quite slow it\u2019s still quite worth while\n\nI don't eat much mexican, but I really enjoyed my dinner here. Was difficult to choose from the menu but thankfully the staff were very helpful with their recommendations.\n\nThe spring roll thingy was amazing, way better than it looks.\nI didn't know nachos can be served like that, the pulled pork one was good but wish there was more meat.\nBeef quesadilla was really good too, altho it looked really flat and sad, but it was actually very flavourful and filling.\nFish tacos tasted quite interesting, I actually couldn't taste the fish at all which is a good thing.\n\nOh and I love the guacamole and tomatoes and salsa ~\n\nThe downside is all the quesadilla/taco/XXX all looked and tasted very similar.\n\nBut yea would come visit again! It tastes quite wholesome!\n\nI am a frequent customer and have been ordering from them for a couple of years. No longer in the future as there was a cockroach wrapped in my burrito. I have reported them to the food agency.\n\nIt\u2019s been many years since I\u2019ve last been here. It\u2019s a long standing establishment and the food did not fail me.\nOrdered the pi\u00f1atas, chimichanga and calamari. Food was served fast and the server was very friendly.\nAll the food ordered were tasty, filling and authentic. I\u2019ll be back to explore the menu more.\n\n\nOption: 2:\nName: El Mero Mero | Mexican Taqueria\nAddress: 30 Victoria St, #01-19 Chijmes, Singapore 187996\nPhone: 8289 7860\nDelivery Available: Information Not Available\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 3.8\nReviews: \n\nThe staff , Anthony was so accommodating and very informative.

Guacamole was served with thin crispy nachos, it was prepared at your table which was a nice surprise.  Quesadillas were delicious but the dips were too small. Beer selection is limited though.  The fried chicken wings were crunchy and went well with beers.\nGood crowd even on weekdays.  Both indoor and outdoor dining areas are available.\n\nQuite a famous place in Arab street with a long stretch outlet. Food is pretty good, drinks are good, price is pretty alright. Probably recommended for family during noon and early evening. Place has the vibes for friends and couple during dinner time and late evening. Their tacos is really good. Plenty of tables to sit and they have indoor and outdoor seats. Worth the try in a famous place as such.\n\nGreat ambient, the decorations and music.\nWe were 7 of us there on national day for dinner, ordered quite a lot of different kind of tapas and main course.\n\nThe portions were all quite large, the mozzarella cheese stick was so tasty, the pepper was too spicy somehow. The tacos with hard shell was crispy and I love the full loaded vegetables and meat perfectly with the sauces. Grilled chicken chop was well prepared, juicy and tender.\n\nFlan is different then what we have in kopitiam, this texture of flan was not smooth or silk.  Not recommend to order ice cream as it taste so cheap..\n\nFantastic hard shell tacos, freshly smashed guacamole right at your table. Burger is juicy and my kid says, flavourful.\n\nThey even helped light a candle on the dessert for my kid's birthday.\n\nOne of my all time fav Mexican bar. The great vibe hasn't change.

Mexican Cuisine never tasted this good with each item presented beautifully and tasting just right.\nA must visit place in Singapore\n\nCocktails a must in Margarita\u2019s! All good ordered was yums! The beef for fajitas was done just right. Definitely a must come back.\n\nMargarita's seems to have been at Dempsey Hill forever.\n\nThis is a restaurant that survived covid and has continued to thrive. Obviously, there are reasons for this.\n\n1. The food has never let me down each time I have come here either with family or friends. The food is freshly made and always tastes great. The sauces are also made freshly. All this effort is clearly reflected in the taste. Portions are large and generous as well.\n\n2. The service is attentive. There are always enough staff around so you can get their attention when you want it.\n\n3. There is a comforting ambience about this place. The restaurant is large, so there is a good feeling of being in a nice, large, well-decorated and well-maintained restaurant.\n\nAlthough they charge $1 for packing the leftovers to go, they do a meticulous job with it. All the sauces are put into separate containers, different components like the meat is packed separately from the tortilla wraps.\n\nThis restaurant meets you at the right level at every point where you need them. Definitely one to revisit again and again.\n\nCompared to what you find in Singapore, the Margarita\u2019s restaurant at Dempsey Hills is a great place for great cocktails and good Mexican food! You can find a a variety for all tastes and desires, tasty and rich!\n\nWhat is a disaster there is the service! From the second you enter, order, get asked to make your last order by 21h30 and bringing the check without asking for it by 22h20\u2026 and the horrible part when they close the toilets (for cleaning) by 22h20 and turning off the fans (outside) by exactly 22:30!!!! Shame guys, a place like this closing by 22h30 and pushing your clients out that early, shows how careless you are to entertain, make your customers enjoy and have another drink!

The table we were shown to had these weird pipes at the sides, so because we were a party of 5 people, the 5th person (me) had to either sit awkwardly at the end with the pipes blocking my legs, or squeeze together with 2 other people on one side. I chose the latter.\n\nWe ordered a few variety of tacos, wings, and drinks to go along with them. All were decent and they came out relatively quickly too. It was however, really noisy as there were large groups of friends and office workers (10+ people in a group) so it could be hard to speak above the noise. The staff was attentive and professional so that was good. All in all, this is a decent place to head to after work, but if you are looking for a nice quiet place to chill, this might not be the most ideal spot.\n\nGood ambience, with attentive & polite staffs. We had a reservation at a Friday night, yet it\u2019s isn\u2019t too crowded. They offered complimentary nachos which tasted great.\n\nThe kimchi fries tasted good too as it\u2019s filled with generous toppings. However, the tacos were bland and doesn\u2019t tasted too cohesive together, which is such a shame. Frozen lime margarita is enough for 2, which is a huge plus point!\n\nOverall it\u2019s food it\u2019s mediocre for its price-point.\n\nThe flavor of the Mexican Korean fusion dishes are delicious, although the service and ambiance leave much to be desired.\nThe seating is uncomfortable, and the small table struggled to hold all the food we ordered. Unfortunately, when we voiced our concerns to the owner, it seemed like they didn't really care. This might be my first and last visit there.\n\nReally like the baja fish burrito, it tasted so fresh and very big portion too. Completely satisfied! Service staff was prompt and friendly. Love the cozy atmosphere and it's perfect for dinner gathering with friends/family.\n\nReally chill place to hangout and have a meal.

We loved the Angus cheeseburger and quesidilla especially..Nice place to chill and hang out.. =)\n\nAbove average food. We tried the beef taco, fish taco and the chicken quesadilla. Of the three, fish taco is perhaps the best choice. Drinks were generally better than the food, had both the margarita and the frozen one. Will I be back? Probably, not that many fantastic Mexican places in Singapore\n\nThis place didn\u2019t disappoint! The fish tacos were bomb!!! Super crispy and fresh. Each taco set me back by $10, but I guess I\u2019m gradually resigning myself to the fact that tacos are exorbitant in Singapore\u2026) looking forward to trying the carne asada bowl and tacos next time, plus more servings of fish tacos for sure, and maybe some cocktails to spice up a future evening \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc\n\nDiscovered this gem whilst searching for dinner spots in Little India. Their warmth and hospitality were amazing from the moment we were seated. Khal, our server, did us good by recommending the fish tacos and chicken quesadillas\u2026these were bomb and so were the cocktails mixed by Razi.

The food was amazing and the service here is superb!\n\nI had the most incredible experience at Super Loco, and it's all thanks to the exceptional service provided by Jenny.

Great menu with lots of meat and veg options as well as a decent kids menu. Favourite was the cauliflower dish as well as pumpkin tostadas.

On a Sunday it was quiet and we had booked a table outside overlooking the Marina.\nIt is recommended to visit during sunset, there is a refreshing breeze and slowly the marina lights up all happy and colourful - a perfect way to gear up for the new week.\nWe were served by Danial. He gave some unbiased suggestions highlighting what he likes and why and some other items why his colleagues like\n\nBased on that we ordered\nA Bottle of Pineapple and Calamani Margarita - It was light & refreshing\nTrotilla chips with salsa roja\n\nFor the main course we had\nWagyu Steak - juicy bite sized on a taco\nBeef Quesadilla - quite tasty\n\nThis should have been enough for dinner but for us it was not complete without a dessert so we indulged in\nChocolate Lava - as mentioned by Danial, the Mint ice cream and choco-lava cake made a super combo.\nPanna Cotta - personally I liked this the best. The tang of lemon sorbet balanced the sweet Oaxaca cheese topped with the crunch of pistachio crumble. This is an item to return for.\nThanks Super Loco\n\nDon\u2019t be surprised by my 5 STAR ratings\ud83e\udd23 I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s not because of my birthday\ud83c\udf1d\n\nSo I celebrated my birthday at this restaurant and it was on a Saturday\ud83d\ude0a I love went to other restaurant before but not this location. The VIEW is superb even at 6pm(before sunset)\n\nI ordered Chefs Recommendation $48/6 dishes.. I would say the portion is not too much and just nice for my appetite\u2026 So, as I put in the reservation remark column, they gave me a hat that night with a complimentary citrusy shots\ud83e\udd23 Ok, it\u2019s a bonus drink, what do you expect? A glass of beer or wine? \ud83e\udd23\n\nSo.. If you like to enjoy beautiful view with nice Mexican food, you should consider here and make your reservation early at least a week before your selected date\ud83d\ude09\n\nAbsolutely delicious and satisfying Mexican fare in a chill, laid-back setting by the Bay. No complaints and would definitely return! The chips and dips are a must-order!!\n\nDropped in just before last call for orders at 9pm on a weekend, but the staff were friendly and helpful even though we were latecomers. We ordered a selection of tacos, tostados, the nacho chips and a salad - everything was served very quickly, tasted fresh, balanced, overall just really delicious.\n\nThe nacho chips with the range of dips was probably the star of the night. It\u2019s usually a starter that I take for granted but the sauces here pack a punch - so so good and deceivingly simple-looking. I may not be a regular diner at Mexican restaurants but I\u2019d imagine that it would be hard to top this off. Can\u2019t wait to go back!\n\nWe got an outdoor seat beside the Bay Area with the backdrop Marina Bay Sands.\nThe view was awesome, there were a lot of people gathering around the area just to take photos in the evening.\n\nEverything we ordered tasted fantastic, and the plating was colourful. The service was warm, friendly and attentive. It rained halfway and Solihin quickly relocated us indoor, and offered to leave the door open so we can enjoy the view, until the rain got heavier.\n\nOverall, it was a unique and warm five star experience!\n",

Be prepared to wait, especially on the weekend. Join their membership if you frequent them. Food quality is maintained and they've a large variety of freshly prepared food. On occasions, they've special dishes served.\n\nITS JUST AMAZING GOOD AND ALL GOOD!!\nTo me one of the best Japanese restaurant which is debatable but my own opinion.\nLunch time was a lot of people and its just crowded\nBut the food amend everything\nFor those who haven eat must eat\nDefinitely must come and try it once!!\nPrice : $$/$$$$$\nprice wise not too bad, quite reasonable for a family meal which is more worth it.\n\nSushi Tei at Thomson Plaza offers a delightful Japanese dining experience. The restaurant has a warm ambiance with traditional Japanese decoration. Their sushi is fresh and skillfully made, and they have a variety of other tasty Japanese dishes. The service is attentive, but it can get busy during peak hours. Overall, it's a must-visit place for those who enjoy Japanese cuisine in Thomson Plaza.\n\nServers very kind kept trying to fill my cup with green tea. \ud83d\ude02\n\nThe freshness and the taste was acceptable. Pricey a little 113 for two adults one child.\n\nHowever what makes it nice is the speed of the food. Like machine gun service. \ud83d\ude02 the dishes were flying out fast.\n\nThe rest of the dishes were acceptable nothing to complain about. Quite standard Japanese flavour and fare here. If you\u2019re looking at omasake level this is m barely half the fineness. \ud83d\ude02\n\nThe desserts were a little too normal for the price. The red bean wasn\u2019t very tasty and the beans were a little hard. Soup was quite plain and sugared. The rest are standard quite similar to ichiban boshi.\n\nA little disappointed for the price but can\u2019t fault the speed and the overall quality which is palatable. See the pics. You\u2019re paying for the decor as well. \ud83d\ude02\n\nI find their consistency over so many outlets and so many years, quite impressive. They very seldom disappoint.\nOnly sad thing is the portions have shrunk and the prices have risen.\n\nThere was a time when Sushi Tei went downhill, but then it picked up again, came back even stronger. At the recent trip to this place, it felt like the food was going downhill again. While quality remains decent, there seem to be a reduction in the portion / quantity, and yet price had increased. This is evident the salmon belly and hotate sushi. Nonetheless, for a quick fix japanese craving, this is still a decent place to head to.\n\n\nOption: 2:\nName: Omot\u00e9 @ Thomson Plaza\nAddress: 301 Upper Thomson Rd, #03-24A, Singapore 574408\nPhone: 9450 1020\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: Closed\nWednesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:00\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:00\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:00\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:00\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:00\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.3\nReviews: \n\nThe food was amazing but a little salty!\n\nMaria did a very good job recommending the dishes.\n\nThe restaurant was very busy, we can see that they're short of manpower.

Even though, food was taking longer to serve than we expected. But, we thought because the place was packed with people and it was dinner time if I remember correctly, so I guess I can tolerate that.

The food is nice and enjoyable. Ambience is cosy and relax. A break from the congested city restaurant as it is tuck in a shophouse in the middle of residential and industrial  area.

Fresh sashimi & tasty cooked dishes. Throw in good service making this a no-brainer for Japanese cuisine at reasonable price.\n\nUPDATE - Feb 2023\nCome again for dinner. The thick cut toro is ok but I have had better. The Saury fish (not in season, so frozen) is perfectly acceptable. Smoked duck with mushroom tastes really good.

I didn\u2019t expect much since it is a lesser known tonkatsu place. But after eating here, I would gladly recommend it to anyone who loves pork tonkatsu and ramen. Food portions are sufficient.

I appreciate the free flow tea and water --  they're one of the few places that still offer free tea and water \ud83d\ude42.\n\nCame here for lunch today. Ordered the Tonkatsu Pork fillet set which comes with rice, soup, appetizer and fruits. This Tonkatsu set comes with free-flow rice and cabbage.

There is 5 pieces of chashu and all of it was so tender and good. The chashu ramen broth was very light but packed a nice subtle flavour to complement. Waiters were also very friendly.

The Salmon Don took sometime to be served, though fish meat was fresh. My wife thoroughly enjoyed the pork slices which were tender and well marinated. The beef was nice as well. The outlet has limited seatings, tables are small and there is only few tables for group > 3.\n\nGood quality not bad, quantity more for Primary School kids, can't tell the size from menu picture. Cooking staff seems very unfriendly, there's a customer who spilled the soup over himself and when he requested for serviette, the table staff asked cooking staff to past customer and heard him saying \"then no need cook liao arh\". \ud83d\ude05\n\nThe lobster don  and salmon aburi don is delicious. Can choose add on of $3 - cones with drinks, choice of salad or miso soup  while the $6 add on cones with drinks and either chawan mushi, kareage or hokkaido cream croquette.\n\nA far cry from the standard and quality of their sister restaurant. Granted it is the budget friendly version but for the nominal price difference, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth the while. A big step down in authenticity of taste.\n\n$10.90 - Aburi Salmon Mentai Don\n$11.90 - Ebi Fried White Curry Rice\n\nThis place is opened by sushi tei which is next door. Both our dishes were pretty tasty and the rice was actually really good, though you can tell the salmon wasn't really the high grade sort. However at these prices, you can't really complain.\n\nI'd recommend this place for a quick tasty non traditional Japanese meal, like aburi/truffle/mentaiko stuff.\n\n\nOption: 6:\nName: IKURA Japanese - Thomson Plaza\nAddress: 301 Upper Thomson Rd, #01-43 Thomson Plaza, Singapore 574408\nPhone: 6253 2792\nDelivery Available: Information Not Available\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 3.9\nReviews: \n\nUsed to dine in there and I love the Chirashi. Decided to do take away today. For $16 hotate sashimi and $19 maguro , you can do better in terms of serving and quality. Hotate was thinly sliced and maguro was really fishy. I don\u2019t mind paying for the food but your price and quality must be at least in line with what you are charging.\n\nEverything was amazing, from the chef's friendliness to the waiter's/waitresses' attending. Very satisfied with Ken's cooking and amazing vibes all around. Friendly atmosphere and very fresh ingredients/drinks. Highly recommended.\n\nCozy little space in a convenient mall. My 10 year old enjoyed her tonkatsu ramen whilst my 7 year old loved his salmon ikura don so much he ordered 2 portions but predictably ate only 1 spoonful from the second bowl before declaring he was too full so I ate that up for him. In addition, the kids had a plate of gyoza each as well, and I quite enjoyed the chawanmushi.\n\nGood drinks, great people and excellent food. The Salmon Sashimi is really fresh. Chefs here are really creative too. Please come and try!\n\nShoutout to Arlene the waitress, Ken and Andy the chefs for making the place my go to.\n\nThis small little joint came as a pleasant surprise. We did an impromptu walk-in on a Saturday afternoon. We were greeted warmly and the service was very good. We were recommended the catch of the day and opted for the Isaki. Half sashimi and half grilled. The remainder of the fish was battered and deep fried into crispy goodness. The sashimi was fresh and succulent while the grilled meat was fragrant and sweet. Overall the food is good. The dried stingray was a surprise as it was one of the better ones I have had. Was hoping the pufferfish come as fried meaty chunks instead of jerkies. The place was cosy and nice to just relax & snack. Overall portions are on the smaller side but prices are not too expensive if you don't go for the catch of the day. Parking is cheap and should be relatively easy to find.\n\n\nOption: 7:\nName: Tamako Meal\nAddress: 128 Casuarina Rd, Singapore 579516\nPhone: 6553 4128\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.3\nReviews: \n\nHighly recommend its teishoku with several yummy side dishes: delicious and nostalgic.

Able to fill up your stomach tho. Dessert was probably the best out of everything, one or two pieces of sushi can be considered decent too.\nStaff told us place was packed and didn\u2019t give us really good seats but place had plenty of empty seats. When explaining the dishes, the staff just mumbled through quickly to get it over and done with.\n\nCame here on a Sunday afternoon to try the $58 omakase. Food was overall pretty decent - nothing mind blowing, but it was a pleasant meal. I only feel like the miso soup, dessert and lobster could be improved.\n\nLobster was clearly frozen and not the freshest because it was pretty dry and tough, and the miso soup was just very very normal like packet miso. Dessert tasted like an odd slightly watery mash of jelly and cheesecake. Sushi and sashimi were good.\n\nWasn't crowded and ambience was nice.\n\nDecent and chill place to have omakase. You get the food but not the typical omakase experience.\nNonetheless a more than decent dinner \ud83d\udc4c\n\n*Note, the beef in the 58++ omakase menu can be changed to a salted egg chicken\n\nNot really like Japen style, the food just normal but the service I feel good.\nWe order the $58 and $88 and the drink is sake. But for food I feel not really fresh\u2026.. especially seafood. So that\u2019s why I feel so so. I think the price I can eat better at other restaurants. \u256e(\u256f\u25bd\u2570)\u256d\n\nNice !

Food wise I would say it is average because my tempura is oily, the beef hot pot with spicy miso was okay. The chocolate lava cake is a bit over done and the cut open the chocolate inside does not flow out which is a bit disappointing. Well the overall meal is a good value for money but do expect the quality to be a bit inferior to other Japanese restaurants.\n\nFirst time trying this, and was surprised at the affordability and the quality of the food. Noticed this for some time but never stepped in as I thought it was going to be pricey, but we ended up spending less than $20/pax.\n\nOrdered the seafood hotpot as well as the set items (chawanmushi, apple and udon/soba) and they were tasty! They have a pretty wide range of food items on the menu - including sushi, noodles, rice, sashimi etc.\n\nQueue was pretty fast - the sign said waiting time was 15-55 minutes, but I got in within 5 minutes. Food also came pretty quickly - served within 15 minutes.\n\nI will likely return again the next time I want Japanese food.\n\nOrdered 3 pax set, a bit too much for 3, we left some foods. Love the salad with pumpkin slices especially. Forgot to take pictures of the rest, tempura, salad, beef rice with egg, fish. Membership discount 10%.\n\nCame here for dinner. Food is good for 3 pax. Quality and taste is still relatively good. Fantastic  food experience.\n\nThe set for two is sufficient for a family of four.  You get to choose the dishes you want with the set. The dishes are also served promptly. Ambience could be better if lights were dimmer.\n",

Food is authentic n lunch value set can be considered. Delicious \ud83d\ude0b\n\nVery decent Thai food for its price. Used to be cheaper and came here a lot when studying at a school nearby. Prices went up since 2017 but the food is excellent. The Thai Beef green curry is a must get, so is the basil sauce fish fillet. It is closed from 3-6pm so take note. Recently they seem to start taking reservations, so if you have a big group might want to call earlier to get seats. The Thai milk tea and lemon grass drinks are very nice!\n\nComfort meal with decent Thai food.\nWe\u2019ve dined at this outlet several times, good quality food is served here. If you enjoy milky curry, do give their green curry a try, tastier when soaked in the pineapple rice. Their appetizers are all good too, prawn cake is our favourite. Yummy Thai iced tea and green milk tea, sadly the mango sticky rice is always sold out. Take note that Jai Thai doesn\u2019t serve Thai pork dishes.\n\nDecent Thai food with reasonable price. I personally love their fried \u201cKang Kong\u201d and clear tomyam soup. Will try out other Thai dishes, green beef curry, pandan chicken, etc in the future\u2026\n\nBeen eating here for many years, maybe my own taste buds have changed as well but the food doesn't seem as good. A bit too sweet like every other generic thai food chain.\n\nOther than that the prices have gone up and portions have gone down, but that can be said for most places since COVID so it's understandable\n\n\nOption: 2:\nName: Sawadee Thai Cuisine\nAddress: 9 Tan Quee Lan St, Singapore 188098\nPhone: 6238 6833\nDelivery Available: Information Not Available\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.2\nReviews: \n\nAll the food was great and in good portions! Seafood pad Thai definitely worth it and not too salty or oily. Mango sticky rice was great as well - not overly sweet and just the right size for sharing at the end of the meal.\n\nWould return to try more dishes!\n\nNice thai food of good quality.\n\n1. Welcoming appetisers for the platter\n2. Thai coconut seafood soup is the best dish from our order\n3. The quality of the fish fillet needs some improvement\n\nService: Good!\n\nOrdered too much and no space for dessert.\n\nOverall can be spicier hence we requested for the kitchen to up the spice level.\n\nKnew we fell into a tourist trap the minute we stepped inside.... Food looked really pleasing from the reviews here, but you're really paying for plating and not authentic thai food. The prices were unreasonably high for thai food in Singapore, too, so no wonder we're the only locals here.  \ud83e\udd23\n\n1. Locals are lined up next door while we stupidly paid tourist/ western prices. Didn't do a good job separating white people's reviews from the noise.\n\n2. The signature Otah at $3++ a scoop was not satisfying. I thought there'd be a special way of cooking with the clay covers, but these was deco. Fish was tough and Otah didn't have 1 ounce of coconut / banana leaf flavour. Basically fish balls with somewhat coconuty paste\n\n3. Fried rice had no wok hei and was deconstructed for no good reason - your chilli padi and onions and whatever that yellow thing was, was raw. Maybe for people to adjust to their preferred spicy levels.\n\n4. Tomyum was recommended by the waitress as their signature but was sour and fishy as heck. Like what is this....\n\n5. Place looks dated and nothing like the pictures from 6 years ago\n\n6. Ok but to be fair, one dish was good and  somewhat unique: Crab Meat Curry. This I will recommend if you want to eat here.\n\nEverything seen here + 4 beers amounted to $160. Could have gone next door or any other thai restaurant for maybe 40-50% less. Note to self: sift carefully for local reviews next time. Take the \"worthy of a Michelin star\" review with a dollop of salt.\n\nInterior is kept clean and very presentable. Definitely more towards a fine dining type of venue.\n\nPortions were rather small for the price, for what can be considered common dishes.\n\nThe food was made to be on the milder side, which is less than authentic. The stir fry and texture of the noodles were pretty well done though.\n\nAbsolutely a welcoming place and a must try Thai restaurant in Singapore. They have a great choice of vegetarian options and its absolutely vegetarian! The flavour, taste, service was very good and would recommend this place!\n\n\nOption: 3:\nName: Diandin Leluk Thai Restaurant\nAddress: 371 Beach Rd, #01-17/18 City Gate, Singapore 199597\nPhone: 9023 9389\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: Closed\nTuesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4\nReviews: \n\nEnjoy my dinner with my family in this new outlet.

We arrived minutes b4 11. Friendly wait staff ushered us in. However, food took long to b served. Assorted veg platter comes with 2 fishes. Don't think this is indicated in d menu. Won't b nice if vegetarians order this dish. d sambal dip for d steamed veg is good. Disappointed that only red chilli padi is served. Where's d green ones??\n\nWill return again for d reasonably-priced food.\n\nPad Thai was good. Tom Yum Soup was good. Pineapple Fried Rice was bland and unimpressive. Pandan Leaf Chicken was big but over-fried and dry. Rosella drink was pleasant.\n\n*Update: Very thirsty after the meal. Restaurant uses a high amount of MSG, most likely in the soup. I wouldn\u2019t revisit.\n\nDidn\u2019t have to wait long for the table or food, service was pretty okay. Food was good but not the best Thai food I\u2019ve had in Singapore. Pineapple fried rice is very good and has a nice wokhei! Their snack corner has pretty tasty snacks, try the fried chicken skin!\n\nFood was horrendous, sarcastically a feast for your palette. Been to their Golden Mile outlet and food was decent. Re crowd, there was no one on a Saturday afternoon.

It\u2019s not inexpensive but the quality of the food and service are great, the atmosphere is relaxed and spacious, and they do have a range of set menu options, as well, if that\u2019s what you want. We\u2019ve never had a bad meal here. I think it\u2019s also a good place to bring guests. If you want Thai street food or mass market, there are other places for that, but for more of a fine dining experience, this is a great choice.\n\nOverall the menu looks Pricy. So ordering set meal . Overall taste are not authentic Thai.  Salad taste unique but made mostly from a fruit . The Tom Yum is very salty , the small prawns are not original prawn (\u61f7\u7591\u6ce1\u904e\u787c\u7802\uff09.  The beef taste more like Indian style rather than Thai style .\n\nThe plus point is the service .\n\nTo conclude :  it\u2019s a good place with good ambience and decorations. However if you are looking for authentic Thai food you need to look else where .\n\n\u201cFine dining price without the fine dining experience!\u201d\n\nLook somewhere else if you\u2019re looking for Thai fine dining. This place is cosy and impressive at first sight, until you have to interrupt your guests by leaving your seat to call the waitresses over. Yes, service is almost non-existent as I had to leave my seat on several occasions just to get a waiter. Not to say too, the food was not impressive. We looked at each other and agreed in unison that we had all experienced better ones in town.\n\nA regretful visit. To sum it up in a sentence, \u201cFine dining price without the fine dining experience.\u201d\n\nThai food flavours that come across as being refined, without being excessively salty or laden with MSG, as would be the case if one is used to typical Thai food budget options that are abound everywhere in local estates. We enjoyed some of the dishes, which stood out uniquely - the stir-fried crispy pork with homemade curry paste and long beans, and the fried prawns in filo pastry with avocado mousse. The Iced Thai Milk Tea is robust in its tea flavour, with the sugar syrup on the side. Ambience is a warm amber feel, while service is attentive. Price wise, well, it's not called \"fine cuisine\" for nothing, definitely not a price range one commonly associates with usual Thai joints. Our a la carte orders for a family of 5 came up to $315. The restaurant does run buffet options at $50 per person on certain days of the week, and they also have a range of set menu options.\n\ncame here for dinner during weekdays.  requested for window seats.\n\ngood decor, ambience and spacing.  surprisingly the service has wow-factor, i felt like i was in Thailand!\ud83d\udc4d\n\nvery comfortable and all the ordered food was good.  the fish and its dressing, however, were a bit bland for my liking.\n\n\nOption: 5:\nName: Royal Thai Cuisine (Bukit Timah)\nAddress: 60 Fairways Dr., Singapore 286966\nPhone: 9235 9797\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4\nReviews: \n\nQuite authentic Thai food, and decent service. Hard to get to unless you drive but parking is free! Their Thai milk tea is really sweet and flavourful, and did I mention it's really sweet?\n\nThe Baked Honey Pork Ribs is decent, though it does seem like they only season it last minute. They did cook it until the meat inside was soft but the flavour of the honey is only on the outside, and the inside of the meat doesn't have the same flavour.\n\nService is good though, and ambience is good. Quiet lunch with maybe 3 other tables with patrons.\n\nSurprise! A dinner date with my husband who chanced upon this place and decided to bring me here.\n\nThe place was dim, though, with hanging light bulbs that made it cosy. However, the surrounding area gave me a sensing that this place is abandoned with lots of empty flower pots and other decoration pieces lying around. The sight just makes me feel creepy, especially at night. Of course I am not sure if it's the design/theme of the restaurant.\n\nWhen I flipped through the menu, the condition of it gives customers a not so pleasant impression. The menu was old, pages were crumbled or wrinkled. The least can be done is to reprint the pages of the menu. Prices for the dishes were little on the high side but that is because I think of the fine cuisine that we are going to have. True enough, I was right!\n\nFor 2 pax, we ordered:\n1. Thai Fried Rice with Prawns(4 pcs)\n- was tad oily\n- not much of fragrance\n- portion was big that could feed 3 to 4(small eaters)\n- accompanied sides were salad, 2 slices of cucumber and a slice of tomato\n\n2. Tom Yum Clear Soup with Seafood\n- came in a pot that has a burner underneath\n- taste was sour and spicy\n- could feed 3 pax\n\n3. Honey Chicken\n- Chicken seemed to be fried but not overly done. Still could taste the tenderness of the chicken.\n- could feed 2-3 pax\n- nothing fantastic, quite ordinary\n\n4. Stir fried dou miaow with garlic\n- vegetables maintained its crunch but could blanch it slightly more as it has that rawness of the vegetables taste\n- could feed 3 pax\n\n5. Mango drink\n- refreshingly good\n\n6. Mango sticky rice\n- to go for no matter how full you are\n- rice was done up nicely and mangoes were riped and had a good combination of 80% sweetness and 20% sourness\n- mangoes blended well with the rice and not forgetting the coconut milk when drizzled onto the rice just enhances its taste. Yummy!!!\n\nWe visited this restaurant for lunch after a round of golf at the Champions. One of us is a Thai native and she commented that the food here is really authentic Thai. The only few places you can find real good Thai food, other than Golden Mile, is this place. We had Thai green curry, Thai basil pork, pineapple fried rice with prawns (even though this is not really Thai but it's really delicious), and stuffed chicken wings. The outdoor seating is really rustic and pleasant, albeit a few smokers around us. Service can be improved as there is only one lady serving the entire area.\n\nRecommend by my friend. Went to the other side for cafe. Never know that there is another well-hidden for Thai food. It is so right inside the area, so conceal into the greenery.\n\nOrdered more than 5 dishes including the desserts. The tom yum soup was so yummy. So was the fish cake.\n\nNice rustic place right next to a course course range. Food was good but what I love most was the environment - something you don't get alot from urbanised Singapore. Sadly I understand that they will be closing on 17 Dec 2023.\n\n\nOption: 6:\nName: Blue Jasmine, Singapore\nAddress: 10 Farrer Park Station Rd, Level 5 Holiday Inn Singapore, Singapore 217564\nPhone: 6824 8851\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.1\nReviews: \n\nThis Thai restaurant located in Holiday Inn Little India.\nGreat ambiance and service. Food didn\u2019t taste so strong like the authentic one but it\u2019s good for someone who is new to Thai cuisine or can\u2019t bare the strong smell of the fish sauce.\nMango sticky rice was not really good, coconut milk was bland, mango was too ripped and the sticky rice was dry at the outside.\n\nThe Thai food here was amazing and exceeded my expectations. Some of the must order would be the stir fried beef and lemongrass sea bass. Both sauces were so appetizing and addictive and both the meats were very thick and tender.\n\nThe mango sticky rice is also recommended as you'll get a whole mango that's sweet and juicy, accompanied by three beautiful pieces of blue pea glutinous rice. Kudos to the servers as well as they were efficient in refilling the free water and making sure we're well taken care of.\n\nHad an appetizing lunch at this outlet. Staff were warm and friendly and did a great job with the food recommendations. Finished off with a nice dessert and hot Thai tea. The lemongrass drink is not very aromatic and hope to see more items on the menu. IHG members can get 20% discount off the price. Bento sets take away are available to order online.\n\nFriendly and welcoming, like the laid back atmosphere. Menu is rather limited for Thai dishes. Pad thai, tom yum soups, mango and papaya salads were well done. Rest of the dishes were average. Rather pricey, and for quite a number of dishes to add on meats will have an increase in price. Enter via hotel lobby lift to reach the 5th floor.\n\nAmbience itself enough to get really relaxing time here with nice view of their roof top garden and pool.  variety of Thai Indian and western dishes available. Had western and Thai. Really good. Staffs are also friendly and quality of service really appreciated.\n\n\nOption: 7:\nName: Joe\u2019s Thai Kitchen\nAddress: #01-182 Block, 125 Bukit Merah Lane 1, 150125\nPhone: 6270 8484\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nThursday: Closed\nFriday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.2\nReviews: \n\nThe food there is scrumptious and the service is excellent \ud83d\udc4d\ud83e\udd29\u263a\ufe0f.

I later checked their Glass Door Reviews - not good working environment!\n\nSo I had to contact Oddle Eats searching for my order and was told Lalamove delivery was on the way. So from 11:30AM to 1:30PM, I was waiting for my order and super hungry. The food from Joe's Kitchen is BLAH. Brocolli was over-cooked, vermicelli with prawns came with NO PRAWNS (paid $23.40) and the Phad Thai was a clump. The deep fried crispy fish was not fresh and not crispy. The fish flesh was soft like porridge. The Thai fish cakes horribly salty.\n\nDelivery  by Lalamove = SUPER LATE\nStaff from Joe's Kitchen = HORRIBLE and CLUELESS; NOT CUSTOMER ORIENTATED\nQuality of food from Joe's Kitchen =  Salty, overcooked, terrible and not fresh\n\nDEFINITELY NOT RECOMMENDED. Will never order again from Joe's Kitchen.\n\nI ordered a Thai red ruby to go. Found HUGE lumps of redness and one even had a hair in it. This is terrible. They use teeny pieces of chestnut filled with a whole ball of starch. Super unauthentic and unethical.\n\nFood came out slow. Tomyum soup and basil pork and kailan were not up to standard but I would say the pandan chicken, prawn cake and fishmaw soup with crab meat was good. Fried rice was not oily, healthier.\n\nWe're back after 6 years to try the food here! We came in a group 4 adults for lunch on a rainy Sunday. Quite empty.\n\nWe tried:\n1. Mango salad\n2. Clear tomyum seafood soup\n3. Beef green curry\n4. Pad thai\n5. Honey chicken\n6. Garlic pork\n7. Mango sticky rice\n8. Red ruby\n\nOut of all the dishes we ordered, the pad thai was most disappointing as they fried it with tomato sauce. \ud83e\udd72\n\nThe rest of the dishes are 100%!! Loved them! \ud83d\ude0d\n\n\nOption: 8:\nName: A-Roy Thai Restaurant\nAddress: 238 Thomson Road #03-61/64 Novena Square (Velocity \u90ae\u653f\u7f16\u7801: 307683\nPhone: 6338 3880\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.2\nReviews: \n\nWe had a lunch treat at A-Roy Thai Restaurant at Novena Square.\nThere were 9 of us, we may have over ordered as there were leftovers.\nI must say that the Thai food here is really delicious and authentic.\nSpecial mention of the fish (cooked in lime sauce) - very fresh and well cooked.\nAs it was a treat, I don\u2019t know the actual bill amount paid.\nDefinitely will come back - suggest in a group of 6 or more so you can order a variety of dishes. Tip: share the rice so you can enjoy the dishes\n\nLocated at a convenient place at Level 3 at Novena Square. A very decorated big place. Staff are helpful and friendly. Vegetarian dishes are available. Fried chicken omelette, tom yam (spicy) soup are awesome. Enjoyed the lunch meal and portions with the four of us. The price may be slightly pricer but the food is really tasty. If you feel like eating good Thai food, this is recommended.\n\nQuite a busy Thur evening dinner crowd! Definitely a favourite w regular customers who like authentic Thai food. Food was served fast and hot and tasty. Pad- Thai was fried perfect and the stuffed Chicken Wings always a favourite. Good portions and lots to choose from the menu. Including the mango sticky rice dessert. Enjoy!\n\nMum\u2019s friend recommended this restaurant for dinner and we went back to this restaurant twice within the week. The food was amazing. Great and friendly staff! Highly recommended and great to go with family or group of friends. Authentic Thai food!\n\nThis place is very clean and the servers sterilise the tables and chairs thoroughly. Authenticity is legit from the quality of food and you can see many Thai diners as well. Tom yum soup has a kick and is not for non-spicy eaters. Hope to try the curries in future.\n\n\nOption: 9:\nName: Time For Thai SG\nAddress: 15 Cheong Chin Nam Rd, Singapore 599739\nPhone: 6909 3903\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20091:00\u202fAM\nTuesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20091:00\u202fAM\nWednesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20091:00\u202fAM\nThursday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20091:00\u202fAM\nFriday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20091:00\u202fAM\nSaturday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20091:00\u202fAM\nSunday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20091:00\u202fAM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 3.8\nReviews: \n\nCame to this outlet a few times and the food has been consistent over the years. Flavourful Thai food and fast service. Spicy and good! Prices are also quite comparable. Price came to about $150 for 8 people with sharing dishes. Good  value!\n\nNestled at a corner of cheong chin nam road is a Halal certified (please recheck for validity before going) restaurant serving delicious authentic thai food.\n\nServing portions were big. Special mention on the mango salad, it was super tasty and authentic! So were the dishes we had. You will love it if you prefer slight saltiness in your food. We love what we ordered!\n\nService was good. Food ordering via QR code. Food served within a decent time and the prices are decent (with exception to the prawn vermiselli which is pricier given the number of prawn given). One probable issue for some patrons is the limited availability of airconditioned seating area.\n\nWill definitely be back.\n\nNo frill Thai food. Anytime crave for decent Thai food with decent price this is the place. Try their glass noodle phat Thai, crab meat fried rice, basil chicken and mango salad. All rather authentic. Also you can select less spicy so good for people who cannot take spicy food.\n\nStumbled upon this gem after hiking at bukit timah. If you are craving for a spicy tom yum soup, this is THE place for you. Our orders came within 20mins. Not crowded even during weekend afternoon too! Near DTL and parking lots available. Price is wallet friendly!\n\nHad been craving for a clear tom yum soup for quite some time now bcos Far East plaza\u2019s cahaya restaurant weren\u2019t selling them anymore. Fyi, Time for thai serves red and clear tom yum soup too!\n\nTheir soup was utterly rich in flavour and we ordered more spicy version. I can confirm my tongue was burning but not to worry, its not as numbing as Mala. You know how your throat feels powdery after slurping down some tom yum soup? This tom yum doesn\u2019t do that! Fragrance weren\u2019t overwhelming and the seafood portion were adequate. If you are starving, get the large portion. Rice is not included\n\nPapaya salad was a refreshing appetiser. Tangy, slightly spicy and peppered with crushed peanuts, each bite doesn\u2019t disappoint. Serving was big though, i would say definitely too much for 1pax.\n\nPandan chicken was alright. Only comes in 3pcs per serving i believe. I prefer Koh nangkram\u2019s (along bugis st) pandan chicken tbh.\n\nHome-made iced lemongrass and thai green tea was delicious. Iced lychee, again normal & safe bet if u didnt know what to order. Will come again for sure.\n\nIt\u2019s literally Time for Thai, as we just walked-in after seeing the eatery from the overhead bridge!\n\nThere was a set meal for 2 but being small eaters, we ordered ala carte instead. My favourite would be the big & tasty Prawn cakes, the Fried glass noodles were not bad too (although it contains mainly vegetables, u can top up for meat/ seafood), & the Tom yum chicken red soup was spicy!\n\nIG @pingguo301\n\n\nOption: 10:\nName: Sawasdee Thai Restaurant\nAddress: 6 Trengganu St, Singapore 058460\nPhone: 6327 1733\nDelivery Available: Information Not Available\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.3\nReviews: \n\n*if u don\u2019t like ants, please don\u2019t go to this restaurant.

I suggest travellers can go for Thai food in hawker centre. Taste is not authentic AT ALL, maybe is Singapore style Thai food ONLY. Not real THAI FOOD\nFirst, the pad Thai. Tasteless, no \u201cWok Hei\u201d \u7121\u944a\u6c23\nU know\u2026 Thai stir fry cuisine are supposed to use hard fire so to make everything with \u201cWok Hei\u201d \u944a\u6c23 it just like they boil the noodle and mix with sauce for me when I am eating their pad Thai\nFor the Thai lemon fish. The soup is like water\u2026 not sour at all. It doesn\u2019t worth $34 (even more expansive than I eat in Australia). Believe me, don\u2019t order it, go for this fish is hawker centre, much better than this!!!\nAnd the papaya salad\u2026. Tasteless too, can\u2019t taste the fish sauce and the lime juice. I don\u2019t think they make it in a Thai way as all the ingredients are not mixed well.\n\nVery disappointed. $85 something for 2 people. I rather go to hawker centre than this.\n\nFor the restaurant reply : thank you for replying my review. But fresh ingredients doesn\u2019t means that you cook it right & nice and authentic\u2026 u know\u2026 it about how u cook not about the ingredients. You can cook bad even u have good ingredients.\n\nWhile searching for vegan/vegetarian Thai food we landed here. The restaurant is located in Chinatown. There wasn't any waiting to get seated. We ordered vegan pineapple fried rice and vegan Pad Thai. Both were delicious in taste and quantity is decent for the price. The service was fast too. Overall satisfied with our meal.\n\nPad Thai is really really good! Spring roll is okay, pork skewer is very tender and taste well too. The butterfly pea drink is sweet but very refreshing.\n\nHmm ambience is cool. Service is considerably warm but unorganised. Loved how the gray hair woman always have a smile on her face. There was a bit of miscommunication as my friend wanted her coffee w/o iced on a to go but afterwards, they gave her what she wants. It arrived with more ice than usual.\n\nWe enjoyed our dinner! Might come back soon too!\n\nWe ordered chargrilled pork skewers, which taste nice with the sauce. The pad Thai has the chicken option, which we think is yummy, as well as basil pork rice. Iced Thai green tea is too sweet even tho we have ordered half sugar, but the iced lemongrass tea is impressive. One of the best Thai food I have in Singapore.\n\nIf you love food as much as I do, you will enjoy the place. Great selection (even for me - allergic to rice!) And impeccable service. They are a little pricey though and the vegetables were a little too salty.\n\nStill, I would definitely come back. Really favour the basil chicken. Robust flavour and not too salty.\nEnjoyed the atmosphere and the tom yum soup too!\n",

Located in Race Course road and in the vicinity of Little India this place screams authenticity. The quaint place had nice decor and a good vibe. We had the butter chicken, lady finger vegetable curry, fish tikka, garlic and cheese Naan as well as a starter which was a flatbread filled with a spinach style filling and a curry on the side to dip the bread.  For drinks we had a mango lassi and lime juice. Everything was delicious and the service was delightful and friendly. Recommended to make a reservation as it got quite busy on a Thursday evening.\n\nExcellent dinner at Mustard on Race Course Rd. Restaurant is small and intimate and service is excellent and attentive.  They have a huge menu with tons of choices so we ordered way too much to try many things. Everything was wonderful but especially recommend the house special Chingri Maacher Malai, the Aloo Jhuri, Mutton Biryani and the kathi kababs.\n\nLocated in the Little India neighborhood. This restaurant has friendly staff, of which unfortunately not everyone speaks English.\n\nFood menu is extensive and you don't have to wait very long on your food. Not everything was of my personal taste, but I am sure the food was nice. Also enough dessert choices and even typical Indian drinks.\n\nDo note that the air conditioning is very cold here, somewhat too cold (heard the same thing from a co-worker who visited earlier).\n\nHad a very enjoyable meal here. You can taste the actual flavours, aroma, spices.\n\nAs compared to other restaurants, you can taste the actual ingredients in the sauces, as they use fresh ingredients and fresh spices.\n\nThe briyani was extremely aromatic as well!\n\n10/10 would come back again!\n\nExcellent food!\n\nWe arrived at opening at 11:30 specifically bent on enjoying authentic Bengali food\u2014we left satisfied and glad we came early!\n\nThe waiters are able to make excellent recommendations. We opted to go straight for mains:\n\n- Kosha Mangsho: tender chunks of mutton in a fantastic thicker gravy\n\n- Chingri Maacher Malai Curry: delicate shrimp and coconut curry presented in a tender coconut\n\n- Maacher Paturi: boneless fish fillet smothered in mustard, gently steamed in a banana leaf\n\nRice bread does not come with each main, and does require separate purchasing. We opted for:\n- Luchi: aka puri, lightly fried and crisp\n- Roomali Roti: one roti is rather large, and folded in on itself; delicate with a great chew\n- Plain white rice\n\nFor dessert, we enjoyed Rossomalai (aka Rasmalai), a dessert in most areas of India, but theirs is fragrant and richly flavored with cardamom, almonds, and cream.\n\nAll in all, a fantastic visit for those who enjoy Indian food and are looking for something different than what most restaurants serve. They do include Punjabi items in their menu, which is typically what most people think of when they think \u201cIndian,\u201d but venturing off to possibly \u201cunfamiliar\u201d dishes won\u2019t disappoint!\n\n\nOption: 2:\nName: Shahi Maharani North Indian Restaurant\nAddress: 252 North Bridge Rd, #03\u201321B, Singapore 179103\nPhone: 6235 8840\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 3 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.3\nReviews: \n\nOne of best restaurants of Singapore to have authentic North Indian food. The interiors of the restaurant has a heritage kind of a feel and staff is very polite and courteous.\n\nThough a bit expensive than usual, food quality and quantity was upto the mark and the food was delicious. Even the mouth freshener was really tasty. Would recommend visiting this place for authentic North Indian food.\n\nNice place and food tasted good. Especially the carrot halwa and chicken kebab. Fish gravy was little off... did not like it. Staffs were kind. The taxi dropped off me at fairmount hotel... but this restaurant is at raffles city shopping mall. But no worries, since both buildings were interconnected, I could just walk to the next. There is a corner to conduct some performance like singing. Reaaaaly traditional for Indians... haha.\n\nLovely service and food. Had my sons birthday there cos he wanted something different.  The lunch buffet on weekend is best value!! Lovely quality especially the appetisers.  And don't be mistaken the latter was rhe main course for us. Best you can order again and again!! The curries and nans as well as the dessert cum fruits were wonderful. My daughter who love the Indian food in Philadelphia was especially enjoying all the food including the sauces . And they were so kind to take a picture of the family and birthday and gave us a frame for that as well.. well done guys. Only down side, the deco has been there for many years.. a little dated but still acceptable lah..\n\nThis Indian restaurant in Singapore offers a unique dining experience. Unlike other Indian restaurants where I usually find the food heavy for dinner, here they have mastered the art of using a delightful blend of spices like turmeric, tamarind, cumin, fennel, and cardamom. The dishes, especially the curry-based ones like lamb, curry snapper fish, and chicken masala, are absolutely fantastic, and they pair wonderfully with the naan and roti. Don't miss out on the flavorful biryani rice too. To add to the exceptional experience, the wine selection, particularly the Shiraz, is a perfect complement to the meal. All of this, combined with the great service provided by Sunjav, makes it a truly memorable restaurant visit.\n\nAmazing experience. The service was so good. Sitting buffet starters, many varieties and can be served multiple times as well as per our requirements. Main course items were less,\nThe quality of food is good. Their service is exceptional.\nWhile booking the reservation, we mentioned we are coming for a birthday lunch, they arranged kulfi ice cream cake. They took photos and got them printed for us and given as a birthday card, which is unique.\nHighly recommended\n\n\nOption: 3:\nName: Spice Junction\nAddress: 126 Race Course Rd, Singapore 218585\nPhone: 6341 7980\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20094:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20094:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.3\nReviews: \n\nAs a Chinese Singaporean, I found the dinner to be extremely delectable. Parking can be done nearby in parallel to those shophouses. It was my first time having a South Indian cuisine, I really have no idea what to order so I kindly requested for recommendations and everything was pleasing to my taste bud. The person who took my order yesterday was really patient as well.\n\nGiving my layman description, I\u2019ve ordered meen pollichathu (Marinated spicy boneless fish wrapped in banana leaf), gobi manchurian (fried cauliflower sauteed with special sauce), kozhi porichathu (fried chicken marinated with various spices), porata (its like local roti prata but less oily), fish curry with mango, malabar mutton biriyani, mango lassi (yoghurt drink) and lemon soda. My favourite got to be the gobi manchurian as I have never tasted cauliflower done like this before. Biriyani portion was great for 2 pax sharing or for 1 hungry person, the mutton was yummy as well. Meen Pollichathu needs no explanation as it is one of their best seller and portion is reasonable for their price. The kozhi porchathu was probably my least fav as the chicken felt like its double fried since its a little hard, otherwise the taste is really good. Food were all served within 15mins upon ordering and the temperature was hot (everything is made fresh). Total bill came out to be around ~$87 for 2. I personally think its reasonable as I was extremely full by the end of the dinner and have no stomach for dessert haha.\n\nWould definitely being my Kerala colleagues to try their dishes one day.\n\nThis place is special in its way of treating your taste buds with the kerala food in Singapore. The service is good, and the ambiance gives you the picture of the land Kerala.\n\nWent for Onam Sadhya.. all the items served were cold and tasted like cooked in the morning and served for dinner. Taste was also bland and not worth Sadhya. Nothing special in the \u201cSadhya\u201d served and definitely not worth $24!\nBetter have Andhra meal at any restaurant, its better taste and value for money.\n\nAmazing food\ud83d\ude00!!!. Excellent service. It\u2019s an authentic place to get typical South Indian food.Especially Kerala cuisine. \ud83d\ude0bHighly recommend !!!\n\nI've only had lunch meals at this restaurant. The  quality of the meals is inconsistent. When it's good, it's really good.\n\nThey offer a lot of meat dishes and only a handful of vegetarian items. But there is enough here to get a good experience of the range and taste of Kerala-food.\n\nEdit: In subsequent visits, the quality further dropped. The vegetarian meals were not served on the banana leaf, the rasam was the worst I've tasted, the puliseri looked pale and was just sweet, the ulli theeyal was too sugary, and everything else was average.\n\n\nOption: 4:\nName: Punjab Grill\nAddress: 2 Bayfront Ave, B1 - 01A, Singapore 018972\nPhone: 6634 1701\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:30\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:30\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:30\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:30\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:30\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:30\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:30\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 4 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4\nReviews: \n\nDelicious! I am craving for the food again. They are tasty and taste authentic. I would come again.\n\nI like the service from staff, though they should check on us less. \ud83d\ude05 We had four people asking us about how everything was. The service was excellent because we were asked if we could take spicy food. When the food was served, it was individually to us; it felt like a special treat.\n\nLocation is also worth mentioning. I could think of another option where I could get delicious Indian food, but having Punjab Grill at MBS is perfect because there is so much to do around.\n\nOne of the best North Indian restaurants I have ever had a meal at. Under the stewardship of their new Chef Gorang Anand the menu and the cooking has been taken to a whole new level. Must try if you live in or visit Singapore.\n\nActually didn't spend a single cent, was a treat (Pre-opening Dinner Party). Went without knowing what to expect. The restaurant is in MBS. Heard from someone that this is one of the places serving best Indian food in Singapore. The food is relatively yummy. Chicken is tender. Naan is yummy. The uniforms of the waiters add to the uniqueness of the place. The waiters are relatively polite.\n\nThis is my favorite Indian restaurant in Singapore. I always spend a time to eat there when I am in town. The food is super delicious, service is great and they gave me some Deepavali seasonal dessert the last time I ate there.  Fantastic!!!\n\nDefinitely a must-go dining spot to  have food at Panjab Grill to have memorable experience Whether it's a unique chef's Mr Gorang Anand  tasting menu and the staff of Panjab Grill restaurant goes the extra mile to make each visit special.\n\nIn addition to the exceptional food and service, Panjab Grill also boasts a tastefully decorated interior that reflects the cultural and flavour richness of India. The attention to detail is evident in every corner, creating an ambiance that enhances the overall dining experience.\nI would definitely recommend this restaurant to everyone.\n\nThe chef Mr Gorang Anand at Panjab Grill are true maestros in their craft, consistently delivering dishes that not only tantalize the taste buds but also celebrate the art of presentation.\n\nEach plate is a work of art, a testament to the chef's commitment to both flavour and aesthetics.\n\nThe presentation is so visually appealing that it almost feels like a shame to disturb the arrangement, but the flavours are so irresistible that you won't be able to resist diving in.\n\nThe staff at Panjab Grill are more than just servers; they are passionate ambassadors of Indian cuisine. Their knowledge of the menu is impressive, and their recommendations are spot-on.\n\nThey create a welcoming atmosphere, making every guest feel like an honoured visitor in their home. The service is prompt, attentive, and infused with genuine warmth that adds to the overall surprising dining experience and homely taste abroad.  Standout dishes include the  \u201cMakki ki roti sarson ka saag\u201d , a culinary marvel that exemplifies the chef's expertise in blending spices and textures. The \u201cPaneer Bhurji\u201d is a revelation, with a perfect balance of heat and sweetness that dances on the palate.

We asked food to be non-spicy but it came spicy. Juice was fresh and came in big cups! Only thing which we felt was worth it. Service was also very friendly but we got a shocker when our bill came!\n\nFirstly the person who served us mistook our order and got us 3 starter soups. We were excited to see 3 small bowls and felt he divided the soup bowl for us. We are used to being served 1 big bowl of soup and him giving 3 was thought of as being kind.\nThose 3 bowls however popped up on our bill! When we questioned that when we had made individual orders, he just removed 1 bowl. Didn't cause much fuss and paid. And yes, that soup...not fresh but did not taste or smell aged. Regardless, was microwave heated. Could see the usual microwave stains of oil residue you can easily see inside the bowl and tell it was microwaved.\n\nWhy I am giving just a 1 star because what is most disappointing is we were also charged a 10% service charge on top of our meals! I just found out now when calculating our expenses. This the first time to experience that additional charge besides GST in Singapore. Even GST is already added, what you see is what you pay...but unfortunately, not here!\nIf you want to save costs, I'll recommend going elsewhere. A family member wanted to have a North Indian experience and quite some experience it was.\nDue to open setting, there were also some men who were just staring at my mother and when us men looked, they immediately turned their heads away! What nuisance!\n\nWill I plan to go here again? Nah, I'd even avoid crossing this place.\n\nGenerous serving!\nHad buttered chicken, decent but I've had better ones. The vegetable biryani was good and had ample variation on the vegetables. The mango lassi is pretty good, have that.\nA filling meal overall.\n\nVisited this place couple of times last week. Staff is very courteous and food is super. Not spicy at all. Tried veg/chicken biryani, mee goreng, nasi goreng, mutter paneer, naan, etc and everything was super.\n\nGood food and friendly staff , definitely will come back to try other dishes!\n\nGood food and reasonable price. They open until late night. Call first if you going there after 12am.\n\n\nOption: 6:\nName: Jaggi\u2019s Northern Indian Cuisine\nAddress: 36 Race Course Rd, Singapore 218554\nPhone: 6296 6141\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.1\nReviews: \n\nFood is good quality is also just nice but felt little expensive\nOne plate is $4\nTaste n quantity ok but for this price is too much\nService is good but has to Que up for every order or first buy n pay n then eat\nVery fresh food n good hospitality not spicy.\n\nNot too crowded even on a weekend which is always good in the heart of little India.

The chicken briyani want great and the chicken kerbab wasn\u2019t great too. Naan was a little too oily.\n\nI spent $38 on breads, paneer and sweets??? $10 for paneer makhani was expensive.

Enjoyed pani puri but maybe a bit too sweet for me. Equally the dal maklani was too salty and buttery albeit managed to finish quite a big helping. Pricing is bonkers tho with rice and dal dishes being close to 15 dollars. Service was excellent and I would come back and try a few other dishes. One issue is the lack of bathroom facilities or washbasin in the restaurant. You have to exit and do a couple of doors down and my nose never did recover from little India\u2019s more underground smells !\n\nI had a great experience at this Indian restaurant\n\nThe food was great and I enjoyed the service, the staff were friendly and helpful.\n\nI like the atmosphere, and I appreciated how quickly the food was served.\n\nWhile I haven't explored many Indian restaurants yet, I'm looking forward to returning to try more dishes in the future.\n\nSo far the best chaats I have had in Singapore. Nice and proper place to sit and enjoy the food. Prices are not exorbitant. One thing I dislike is that they don't have a proper hand wash inside the restaurant. Have to go out to wash and come back using the swing door, which defeats the purpose of washing hands. Indian food must be enjoyed by using hands, so hand wash point in the restaurant is a must.\n\nUpdate on 18 Sep,\nSince I liked the chaats, I thought of having at airport as I saw it was at T1 terminal @ L2. When I went there, they said it was moved to different location. Management must take out the signboard from T1 as it gives wrong information.\n\nVery good option for Indian vegetarian food. Was seated very fast and the service was also good. During peak dinner time 8-9pm place will be crowded and generally there will be waiting.\nVast Manu covers most of the Indian variety food. Food is really tasty, especially all the chat items are very nice. If you are looking for   Indian vegetarian food definitely worth a try.\n\nGreat North Indian cuisine. Service was slower than expected, however food was good. Be careful when ordering more sides as they charge for everything\n\n\nOption: 8:\nName: The Curry Culture - Cuppage Terrace\nAddress: 31 Cuppage Road Cuppage Terrace, 31 Cuppage Rd, 229457\nPhone: 6235 6133\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.2\nReviews: \n\nVery interesting setting.

Chili pakoras are no joke though, super spicy!\n\nUsed to be my go to for Indian food but finds that recent visits are less pleasant.

The chicken biryani is so so. The place is air conditioned with good hygiene. Quite a lot of tourists in the restaurant.\n\nButter chicken is good, but the tandoori chicken is okay but proportion is small, overall is pricey, and they have too many take away orders that took very long to serve our food, the outdoor tables are close to street where is not so good when raining\n\nAbsolutely brilliant food.

The Goalondo steamer fowl curry in their special Bengali menu was the star, and so is the ema datshi. Staff members were also accommodating, and were able to explain the dishes.\n\nI am a huge fans of indian food.\n\nI can tell you that, though the food and service were good, I likely will not visit this place again - I can easily find the food with similar standard in the Little India with much lower price and bigger portion.\n\nSpent about 114 sgd per pax. Those dishes I posted are shared by 3 ppl.\nNo tap water served.\n\nSenthil & team attended to us wonderfully. The hospitality at Yantra is unparalleled and met by very few Indian restaurants in Singapore. Chef Pinaki even stepped out to speak to our family. Their Palak Anjeer Kofte, a palatable twist on Malai Kofte, are a must-try! Can\u2019t wait to be back :)\n\nJust one caveat - the portions are pretty small so keep that in mind when ordering.\n\nWe had the Experience menu which comprised about 12 items ( including a complimentary one that was not in the menu) - not cheap but reasonably priced relative to food quality/ quantity. Good array of food ranging from some more unique dishes  eg Alaskan crab, cod fish to familiar Indian items like naan ( best garlic naan ever tasted) and bryani. Attentive service with food items explained at each course. I am normally not that big a fan of Indian cuisine but this won me over . Will go again\n",

We got one of the chefs menus instead. My favorite was the chili prawns and my least favorite was the fried rice, it just wasn't anything special compared to the other dishes.\n\nService was great and they even set up a kids place setting for our baby, which was sweet, even though he is much too young for solid foods.\n\nThe food was mediocre at best, but the service was good. We made a reservation for seven beforehand, yet the table we were assigned was extremely small, could not even fit the dishes we ordered.\n\nCompared to other Chinese restaurants in this price bracket, such as those at the Ritz Carlton and Hilton, this dining experience left much to be desired.\n\nBBQ Meat Combination 2/5\nSteamed Star Groupa 2.5/5\nPeking Duck 3/5\nSweet and Sour Pork 4/5\nStir fried Kai Lan 1/5\n\nOne of the best Peking ducks ever! Please note that all other dishes, despite the high price, are portions for one pax only.\n\nVery expensive but worth the Michelin star!\n\nFantastic restaurant, small portion but really great. I would say, \u70e7\u814a is the best!!!!!!! Highly recommended for family gathering or special occasions.\n\nPeking Duck was the highlight here. Level up with a touch of caviar. The duck here is more lean and crisp but I do think a little of fat adds to the flavour. Still good nonetheless.\n\nHad a soup (meh, especially for that price) and a Soft Shell Crab with Crab Meat (which was yums, creamy but not to the point of being jelak, guess it helped that we shared instead of having 1 each) and a refreshing petite fours of Osmanthus Jelly and Pineapple Tart.\n\nThe complimentary birthday cake was delish too, reminded much of Ritz's Royal Caraibe from 20 years back. Dark bittersweet choc mousse on a layer of caramelised crunch. Service was top notch, attentive yet but imposing, always there but invisibly.\n\n\nOption: 2:\nName: Wan Hao Chinese Restaurant\nAddress: 320 Orchard Rd, Singapore 238865\nPhone: 6831 4605\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.1\nReviews: \n\nCame here as we got 50% discount. Arrived here at 1.45pm. We didn\u2019t order too many dim sum as we ordered the Irish duck n noodles for 2pax. It\u2019s a mistake. Maybe we came late. The duck skin was a disappointment not crispy at all. Half a duck cost $65 before discount. Instead the dim sum were much nicer especially the steam ones. I would enjoy better if we ordered more dim sum. The ambience was nice and service was good.\n\nI have been wanting to try the food here and finally I did - after making advanced booking for a weekend slot about a month in advance. The dishes are good and unlike other restaurants serving Chinese Dim Sum, the place feels tranquil and quiet despite that the place is full on a Sunday lunch time. Great place for gathering and catch up over food.\n\nOrdered a variety of dim sum, all were really good except the egg tarts (mini and not the best). The price of their dim sum is pretty on par with other places but yet the fillings so generous and you can taste the fresh quality in their ingredients used. My favourite was the steamed glutinous rice, we even ordered a second serving! Service staff were quite busy and not easy to reach hence the slight markdown on service. Otherwise it\u2019s a good experience and we will be back.\n\nLovely dim sum lunch today at Wan Hao for our family of 4 with 2 kids.  The Irish duck was tender and juicy. The servers didn't push for us to order more expensive dishes like we experience in some other restaurants who try very hard to cross sell. The service was attentive and polite. I loved that it was also quiet and elegant for our lunch.\n\nOrdered dim sum.\nFood\nOverall okay for food. Duck was quiet hard to bite maybe they could cook medium well . For desert we got mango sago. Maybe they could add ice-cream to it.\nService\nWaitress and waiter both recommended food that were amazing. The waiter even taught us how to use our Amex voucher.\nAtmosphere wise\nWaiter led us to a room.\nIt was quite hot inside as most pf the air conditioning were outside .\nWould definitely come back here.\n\n\nOption: 3:\nName: Crystal Jade Golden Palace\nAddress: 290 Orchard Rd, #05 - 22, Singapore 238859\nPhone: 9177 2091\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 10:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 10:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.4\nReviews: \n\nMy husband located this restaurant on Google maps, it was about 10 minutes walking distance from our hotel. It is situated on the 5th floor of a shopping mall and closes at 10pm. Last order is at 9.30pm.\n\nWe shared a starter of crispy crab and prawn rolls. They came separately wrapped with red and green sauce.\n\nI had a lamb rack (one lamb cutlet to be precise) on a bed of potato and vegetables. My husband had braised sliced duck for one person with steamed rice. The food was nice and the service was quick. The plates were not hot, so the food became cold very quickly.\n\nThe wine is expensive, but always is in Singapore. More cost effective to buy a bottle.\n\nThe chrysanthemum and jasmine tea was nice.\n\nI had always wanted to try this restaurant. But it\u2019s always skipped my mind when I\u2019m at paragon due it\u2019s located at level 5.\n\nSo this time round, I\u2019m very focus to go to this restaurant with the purposeful trip down to paragon.\n\nAs much as I\u2019m excited and anticipated for this restaurant, it starts to turn me off little by little as i walked in, when we\u2019re seated to our table, we could smell a strong damp and moldy stench arising from their carpet floor\u2026 this is a killer for our dining experience in there.\n\nApart from that, the food definitely still maintain its Michelin standard (though the Michelin was no longer accredited in 2023), also we like the \u201cold\u201d staffs working there, the service from the traditional Chinese restaurant where you can experience, they know their stuffs, and they do know how to talk to customers. Had a great chat with the staff as well.\n\nI guess the restaurant really need to upgrade n change their carpet.\n\nFood was okay, nothing too grand or special. Of all the dishes we got, I would only highly recommend the sweet, sour and crispy fried mushrooms. The kangkong was good.\n\nServers were very attentive and helpful with the recommendations. Although as a tourist, we didn\u2019t know that every refill of our tea would be charged and they kept refilling without us asking them to - ended up paying $20 for hot water refills.\n\nAtmosphere was okay also, walkway going inside the restaurant gave it a good vibe.\n\nNice place to have dimsum with families ablnd friend inside Paragon mall. Many choices of dimsum. It is not a big restaurant but a very nice decoration. It was in the Michelin guide. The restaurant was not busy when we arrived. The service is good and workers are friendly.  It serves typical dimsum dishes like other dimsum restaurants. It also  serves regular chinese dishes.  We order multiple dimsum dishes, and foods are delicious. If you order lo mai kai, it will take about 20 minutes  to prepare. Other dimsum items were ready pretty quickly. I like the chicken feet. It is better than the one we have in the States.  It was soft and tastes so good. Other dimsums items are good too but not like wow.  Overall I like this restaurant and the service.\n\nExtended family dinner to welcome back our nephew and niece who are studying in UK, back to Singapore on summer break. The food was great and service was good, prompt, attentive and friendly. We've been here several times and always had good experience.\n\n\nOption: 4:\nName: Imperial Treasure Super Peking Duck\nAddress: 290 Orchard Rd, #05 - 42 / 45, Singapore 238859\nPhone: 6732 7838\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:45\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:45\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:45\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:45\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:45\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:45\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 10:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:45\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 3 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.3\nReviews: \n\n*A cosy popular place (well established and highly accessible in Orchard Rd area) to gather with family and friends to savour exquisite dim-sum as well as its signature Beijing roasted duck!\n*Prices have gone up somewhat apparently; nonetheless, the memories of dining there would be priceless.\n*Attentive staff provided meticulous service.\n\nThe Duck is just superb and to die for. Definitely must order this.\nAnother dish highly recommended would be the Beef Dices and Roast Pork. crispy and solid -\ud83d\udc4d\nOthers dishes are nice too and prices tends to be on the higher side.\nSo impressed with this \u2b50Auntie Li Yong \u2b50 whom was serving our table. (Hope i got her name correct)\nShe was so efficient and on the ball, service was just Top Notch, making sure my 2 kids are well taken care of also.

Wow.\nExcellent service from all staff and top notch dinning experience.\n\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\n\nGreat service and the peking duck is one of the best I've tasted. The chef managed to cut the duck into the same thickness and size as the cucumbers so that it is asthetically pleasing and a delight to eat. Only complain if I were to nitpick is that the wrapper for the peking duck breaks easily.\n\nEvery dish was good. Especially the fried soon hock. Though this fried fish dish turned out to be more expensive than the duck.\n\nFamily friendly place good for gatherings, the young and the old.\n\nMade a reservation for Imperial Treasure Super Peking Duck because they were touted as serving the best Peking duck in Singapore. The duck required advance order and this can be done while making the reservation.\n\nThe duck skin was indeed very crispy but I found the meat rather bland, but who eats Peking duck for the meat anyway? The rest of the dishes I ordered were quite ordinary but that may be because they were ordinary dishes to begin with.\n\nNot very likely for me to return..\n\nDelectable Peking duck with crispy skin and tender juicy meat as expected from their speciality. Quite an experience to have a chef preparing the duck for us. The fried mince duck meat, fried rice and other dishes were great as well. Recommend this restaurant if you\u2019d like to try Peking duck.\n\n\nOption: 5:\nName: Hai Tien Lo\nAddress: 7 Raffles Blvd, Singapore 039595\nPhone: 6826 8240\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 3 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.3\nReviews: \n\nI absolutely loved the food, especially the beef and scallops! The Chinese 8-course meal left me completely satisfied, and the service was excellent. The table setup provided a sense of privacy for our group, making the dining experience even more enjoyable\n\nCame here for birthday dinner and had the Daffodil dinner set which should be popular since many other patrons ordered the same.\n\nWould give 6/5 if we could. Food is fantastic. Service is attentive. Ambience is romantic. Price is value for money given the quality of the dishes. All worth it to put up credit card authorisation for the reservation ahead of time.\n\nLooking forward to coming back again next time.\n\nEating area is dim, and stiff\n\nService and serving of food was shockingly slow in which a multiple dishes had to be checked multiple times & server could not give adequate response or update, shirking responsibility to kitchen. Dish orders were missing/forgotten.\n\nIt was overall very frustrating and really tested patience when both trying to consistently check and lunch time was unneceasarily extended.\nIt was also difficult to get attention of server\n\nIf you do not know how to speak Chinese, do avoid this place as likely to struggle communicating to server\n\nFood only looks pretty but you can take it as a given that all the main cooked big dishes will have a lot of oil & salt.. best to make special request to exclude\n\nDefinitely not worth the $70++ per head when food, service, waiting time was ridiculous.\n\nDo get better tasting dim sum or chinese food elsewhere & for cheaper\n\nWe went for the weekday dim sum lunch buffet because they are going to discontinue buffet soon! Love the quiet atmosphere and service was good.\nMost dishes are delicious. Buddha jump over the wall is a must try soup - rich and tasty. I like the truffles charsiew bao and crispy wanton - unique. The porridge was disappointing and bland. Roast duck is so so. But we really enjoyed the desserts!\n\nHeard so much about Hai Tien Lo restaurant. Went there for dinner. Fine dining Chinese restaurant to be exact. We ordered the set dinner and we were surprised by each dish. Beautifully displayed in an artistic manner. Each bite of the dish bursting with different tastes and senses to the tongue. Each dish was painstakingly prepared and you could taste the real flavour of the ingredients. No flavour enhancer, natural, genuine taste from the combined ingredients brought out from the chef\u2019s skillful cooking. Check out the photos of the dishes I had.                                     The smoked fried chicken was excellent! You can smell the faint smell of smokiness. The skin so thoroughly fried and wafer thin, dipped into the special sauce, sour, sweet and a hint of spiciness, so freshing, a brilliant combination that brought out a whole new experience to my taste buds and senses. Other dishes were equally surprising and excites my taste and senses. Service was attentive and polite. I will make it a point to come again when the menu changes.

The restaurant was full but fortunately we waited for only around 10 minutes.   Was quote sceptical because I saw many foreigners and thought this could be tourist trap.  I was wrong,  the claypot pig liver is super delicious and the braise fish head is so flavourful.  This is indeed a very good Cantonese restaurant.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for Chinese restaurant with amazing food and friendly service, look no further than this hidden gem. I recently had the pleasure of dining at this spot and was blown away by the quality of their dishes.\nThe beef meat teow with wok hey was outstanding. Beef was so tender and portion size was generous, even for the smallest option on the menu.\nNext up was the roasted duck, which was an absolute standout. The skin was perfectly crispy and meat was tender and flavorful.\nFinally, I have to mention the cereal prawn ball, no hassle at all in removing the shell and  flavorful prawns.\nRestaurant was the friendly and welcoming atmosphere.\nIf you\u2019re in the mood for some truly Chinese cuisine, look no further than this spot.\n\nCame here because of the online reviews and  partly we were nearby. The foods are hit and miss. Can order the fried beef kway teow, vegetable and home-made tofu. Will not recommend the Indonesia curry chicken and the roast duck, roast pork and char siew combo.\n\nFood is served quick and they are delicious! Place can be loud sometimes due to the occasional loud talking and laughing by other customers but I would definitely recommend coming here for the food.\n\nWhilst visiting Singapore, my friend took me to lunch at his favourite cantonese restaurant. I can understand why - friendly, warm service and absolutely delicious food served with a smile. The fried rice, sweet and sour pork and special tofu were particularly  notable - all of the plates went back to the kitchen absolutely clean\n\n\nOption: 7:\nName: Yan Ting\nAddress: 29 Tanglin Rd, Level 1U The St. Regis Singapore, Singapore 247912\nPhone: 6506 6887\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 10:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 10:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 3 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.2\nReviews: \n\nFood was great and yummy! We ordered their signature set menu and enjoyed it. All the dishes were on point, not too salty and oily. Overall we enjoyed and will come back for their dim sum!\n\nSince opening in The St. Regis Singapore hotel in December 2007, Yan Ting restaurant has been a stalwart of the Chinese Cantonese fine dining scene, the epitome of extravagance and luxury. These days, there are plenty of Chinese fine dining restaurants around, but Yan Ting has certainly stepped up their game, remaining a premium dining destination of choice, serving well-executed and refined gastronomic delights on each plate.\n.\nAmbience at Yan Ting is opulent. The grandeur of the interior exudes a classy elegance, without being too over the top. The tastefully arranged layout is suitable for business or private dining, and the decor enhances the overall ambience without being too loud. I also like the bright ambient lighting, which isn't too harsh or dim. The pearl marble floors and plush furnishings feel sophisticated and comfortable.\n.\nService at Yan Ting restaurant is professional, discreet, and polite. Staff may not make much conversation, but they are attentive and observant. The accord each table good attention, answering queries, fulfilling requests, serving orders, and proactively clearing finished plates with finesse. Communication in English or Chinese Mandarin is decent. Felt very well treated here.\n.\nFood at Yan Ting follows the Chinese Cantonese philosophy of freshness of ingredients, little usage of herbs, and well balanced dishes that are naturally flavourful but not greasy. Yan Ting restaurant prepares classic Chinese Cantonese dishes according to time-honoured recipes, but presents them in beautiful contemporary style.\n.\nPortions are sized for individuals, but dishes are best shared. Prices are high. Prepare to splurge, budget about SGD $245 per person for a meal here.\n\nVisited Yan Ting to celebrate a birthday, but was left disappointed by the standard of service. Food was decent, but nothing to shout about.\n\nWe were seated at around 6.15pm, and ordered 4 set meals and half a Peking duck within 5 minutes. We waited for almost half an hour for the appetiser to be served, and similarly waited for approximately half an hour for the following courses. At 8.30pm, we had not yet been served our main courses, and decided to get the main courses to go and to get dessert served instead.\n\nAs for the Peking duck, we were served the Peking duck pancakes shortly after our appetiser. We opted for the second serving to be served as chopped duck, which I assume would have been sliced together with the first serving. However, we yet again had to wait another half an hour for the meat to be served, which meant that it was cold by then.\n\nWhat disappointed us the most was the level of service provided by one particular staff, Steven. While serving the dishes, it felt that he was simply dropping or tossing our plates onto the table. What shocked us the most was when he presented the bill, he seemed to throw the bill onto the table, pointing at the line for the signature without saying anything! When we asked if there was any way to give feedback, he said that there was none other than leaving our feedback online.\n\nTo Yan Ting\u2019s credit, the managers Bruce and Fiona did try their best to offer service recovery as we were leaving and apologised on behalf of their server.\n\nFor the price point that Yan Ting is charging, we would have expected better trained staff, as well as better serving processes. Overall, not an experience we would expect from a highly rated restaurant and not a restaurant we would likely visit again.\n\nWe were here on our vegetarian routine day. Even though they don\u2019t have many selections of the vegetarian dishes. You can ask them for the off menu. They will customise for you. We ordered hot and sour soup, truffle tofu, Gongbao vegetarian chicken, fried mushrooms Mien, and stir fried vegetables. Every dishes were tasty. However you might need to wait for up to 30-45 mins to serve your food.\n\nWe were hosted to lunch here, and the place was packed at 12 noon, so much so that reservations are a must.  One negative is that the place was too loud, with so many people talking, that I ended up with a headache.  Having a normal-level conversation was quite difficult.\n\nService was quite warm and quick, and the waitstaff were always quick to top up our teas.\n\nThe food was generally of a high standard, though some meat dishes were rather tough.  The pork jowl done charsiu style was tasty, but some pieces were tough to bite through or chew.  Similarly, not all pieces of the stir fried beef, which was delish, were soft.\n\nThe xiqolong bao was nce, but the standout dish for me was the siew mai. We ordered desserts of sago with mango , and quilingao, both of which made for a sweet ending to the meal.\n\n\nOption: 8:\nName: Wah Lok Cantonese Restaurant\nAddress: 76 Bras Basah Rd, Singapore 189558\nPhone: 6311 8188\nDelivery Available: Information Not Available\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 3 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.3\nReviews: \n\nThis is the quintessential Cantonese dim sum place with consistent quality and selection. We\u2019ll come by whenever we crave solidly good dim sum. Mind you the pricing is not cheap - see latest dim sum menu in picture. The roast duck is tender, juicy and not too fatty. Top it off with fantastic service, no wonder this place remains popular.\n\nThe staff were very attentive, they talk to clients with professional smile. However, I think the food I had was not impressive giving the high end price. We ordered half roasted duck, french beef cube$36, and fried squid\u2026 the portion was so small, especially the duck cost $44, only 8-9 thin pieces. For a glass of water they charged for $2 (staff did not mention it when we order), a small portion of peanut charged for $5 (did not mention too)\u2026Not recommended, there is better duck place in town..\n\nWe basically picked Carlton because of Wah Lok. We hated Carlton, but loved this restaurant and ended up eating here twice. Highly recommended. Egg tarts were very traditionally good and can easily have it by the dozens. No picture of egg tarts simply because they were gone before I had a chance.\n\nVisited on a Saturday 1pm for dim sum. Overall it is okay, but not as fantastic like it used to be.\n\nFood is decent but not fantastic, I'm talking from dim sum perspective and not main Chinese dishes.\n\nService is good, maybe primarily I avoided the lunch crowd and not too much ppl at that hour of 1pm+ for weekend.\n\nAtmosphere is hotel restaurant style where you have padded floor and it's a nice environment, not too noisy as compared to other restaurants.\n\nThere are better dim sum restaurant out there and not likely I will visit this restaurant. But I'll recommend for dinner, it is a nice place to host friends, colleagues, family, but never the dim sum.\n\nFirst of all, just want to say that Wah Lok is still my most loved Chinese restaurant in SG. The food is excellent and they stick to their tradition of making good food. However they did disappoint me in one aspect on my last dinner there. Ordered the abalone based on the menu and when it came, the slice abalone just looked pathetic in comparison. Upon checking with the manager, his explanation was that there was a word sliced in the order and picture was only for illustration (by the way, my order was the closest to the name on the picture). To me, this is downright misrepresentation and it really irks me that they could make such a big mistake and ruin their otherwise perfectly good track record. I hope the management quickly rectify such mistakes and live up to its fine history.\n\n\nOption: 9:\nName: Shisen Hanten by Chen Kentaro\nAddress: 333 Orchard Rd, Level 35 Hilton Singapore Orchard, Singapore 238867\nPhone: 6831 6262\nDelivery Available: Information Not Available\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 3 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.7\nReviews: \n\nThe restaurant offered a charming ambiance with its tasteful decor and welcoming atmosphere.\n\nThe service was exceptional; the staff was attentive. Our orders arrived promptly, and each dish was beautifully presented and bursting with flavors. I highly recommend trying the foie gras and crab roe soup- it was an absolute delight!\n\nWould definitely recommend to anyone seeking a memorable dining experience.\n\nIncredible place for lunch! Such a beautiful atmosphere accompanied by beautiful food.\n\nHad the half duck with the first course in pancakes (not pictured) and the second course wrapped in lettuce which was a great way to freshen up our palettes. The stir fried prawns in chili sauce is an absolute must and no wonder it\u2019s one of their signature dishes. The buns to accompany and soak up any leftover sauce were great, we would\u2019ve gotten more but didn\u2019t want to fill up!\n\nThe saut\u00e9ed wagyu beef with cumin was so aromatic and the meat extremely tender, and the fried rice with pork and seafood was delicious and equally portioned out for the three of us.\n\nWe had a fantastic time, the service was impeccable and we hope to come back soon.\n\nShisen Hanten beautifully blends the bold flavors of Sichuan cuisine with Japanese inspiration, all while offering traditional Cantonese dishes.\n\nTheir Mapo Tofu is amazing I would return here just for this dish. The perfect blend of spicy and savoury, with tender tofu bathed in a flavorful sauce, makes it a must-try. Their vegetable dishes are equally impressive. Here, the true essence of the vegetables shines through, highlighting their natural flavors and freshness.\n\nService at Shisen Hanten is impeccable, with attentive staff adding to the overall dining experience. Their commitment to ensuring your satisfaction enhances the enjoyment of the meal.\n\nGenuinely enjoyed the lunch here and the staff are very friendly, service was impeccable!! My mum has many food requests and the staff (Penny, Doris and Yvonne) were very accomodating to them. Penny was especially patient in suggesting different menu changes and making sure nothing was amiss during our meal. The lunch set menu was also pretty worth the price. Paid a bit more for the lobster but it was really fresh and tasted amazing with the sauce!\n\nFine dining time, and we love it. It's the most beautiful Chinese restaurant in Singapore. We have a great experience with the selection dishes that offer from Chef. It is kind of spicy but good to go.\n\n\nOption: 10:\nName: Man Fu Yuan Restaurant\nAddress: 80 Middle Road Level 2 InterContinental Singapore, Singapore 188966\nPhone: 6825 1008\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.5\nReviews: \n\nWe had their weekend dim sum buffet.

Man fu Yuan Is a good place to get a Chinese fine dining, you get excellent service and food in win win.\n\nService is good there, the 6 courses meal will get 5 stars if not because of the lobster with crispy rice noodle dish. While the lobster is fresh and the texture good, the noodle spoilt the dish with the fried noodle taste like rancid oil, disappointed. Other than this dish, all other dishes are up to standard.

If bread can be served so hard, what else can customer expect from the rest of the dishes.\nPork loin was tough and had no veg. Mushroom soup tasted nothing like mushroom. Mussels were fresh but too salty and small. Escargots were too salty too. Duck confit was quite tender. Steak was tender but lacking in presentation. Staff were  attentive. During reservation, I indicated that it\u2019s a friend birthday but there wasn\u2019t any complimentary dessert or wishes on the dessert plate. On a whole, 3 of us were disappointed with the experience. Wont consider coming back.\n\nWas lunch there on Wednesday. Expect to see less crowd since is the mid of the week , who knows they are full house throughout lunch period. Luckily we made reservation in advance.\nWe\u2019ve opt for $45++ 3 course set lunch, each of us ordered different dish.\nExcept the poached grouper taste so so and they serve ONE piece cheese as The cheese of the day\u2019s dessert that looks so minimalist , the whole lunch experience was great, cozy ambience, service staffs are attentive in just right way.\nThey serve good wine too.\n\nEstablished in July 2009, Bistro Du Vin (BDV) is fully committed to delivering a truly authentic dining experience in a French Bistro.

Like we were an imposition.\nThe tables around us were full of very loud and noisy people which totally spoilt the atmosphere of calm dinnertime.\nAfter the hefty bill and disappointing food ,we decided that we will not return again.\n\n\nOption: 3:\nName: Gunther's\nAddress: 36 Purvis St, #01-03, Singapore 188613\nPhone: 9010 3075\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 6:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSunday: Closed\n\nPrice Level: 4 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.5\nReviews: \n\nFantastic service, albeit slow pacing by the kitchen. Our simple set lunch lasted around 90 minutes. Cold angel hair pasta was excellent, everything else was rather unmemorable. The restaurant was packed for lunch and the atmosphere was very noisy; we could not have a tabletop conversation without leaning into each other to hear ourselves. For the price point, much better food was expected. Better food would also justify the mighty long waits between each course. Lastly, petit 4s were just a canele and a chocolate disc each (no more financier, at least for the set lunch)\n\nLove the angel hair pasta with caviar! I literally licked the plate!!! So good. The Apple \u201ctart\u201d is really good, so crispy and top a little ice cream on each bite sent me to heaven. It\u2019s worth the price, the whole experience is exquisite and I was there for lunch. I have to go for a dinner next chance I am back in Singapore.\n\nNice ambience, service is good. Food is good  but not surprising. Recommended the pork jowl, well cook, very soft, moist and tasty. Angel hair pasta texture is very good except the truffle oil fragrance overpower the pasta.\nRoasted gambas also recommended. We are eating course meal, I am not super impressed overall, maybe the ala carte menu might be better.\n\nI had high expectations of this place. Our meal started off very well, the bread was fantastic. Appetiser was great, the best being the cold truffle pasta. Mains was a letdown. Carbonara is mere 3 pieces of pasta sitting on a generous portion of pork slices. Pork however was tough. Apple tart with ice cream was great. Staffs were friendly, however we waited very long between each course.\n\nCelebrated our wedding anniversary here.\n\nThe restaurant and service staff are attentive to our dietary request, and the food are lovely.\n\nWith the pricing and the generous portion of the truffles. It really made my husband's day.\n\nMy gluten free pasta was seriously good and I could easily have another one. Another highlight was the pork and love how tender is was, as good as beef.\n\nEven though we told them last upon arrival that we came for our anniversary, they still got us a little celebratory cake that so yummy.\n\nOverall, nothing were disappointing.\n\n\nOption: 4:\nName: Saveur Bistro\nAddress: 5 Purvis St, #01-04, Singapore 188584\nPhone: 6333 3121\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: Closed\nTuesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.1\nReviews: \n\nIt\u2019s my find for 2023!

We love the food and the fact that it's a non pretentious place. We've felt really comfortable on both our visits. For starters we had the escargot and bone marrow. It was really good. We ordered 2 rib-eye with bearnaise sauce and a ravioli for mains.\n\nThe only thing we were not really comfortable with was how close the table next to us was. Overall we had a lovely time.\n\nGood restaurant, French cuisine, more like traditional or family style restaurant .\nRecommendation\n1. French onion soup\n2. escargots\n3.duck\n\nStepping inside Brasserie Gavroche, it had a nice old rustic charm to it, with the vintage looking wooden furnitures and 50s style hanging lights. Not a typical fine dinning setting but more of a simple sit down dinning for a close group of friends to meet up and chat over a hearty meal.\n\nThe restaurant serves some of the more classical French dishes such as foil gras and escargot, with choices of either cold or warm appetisers dishes. It seems the white asparagus is in season now and we ordered 1/2 dozen of escargots and the foie gras (served with toasted country bread) to go with it for our starters.\n\nThe escargot was baked with parsley and garlic butter. Classical proven dish that couldn\u2019t really go wrong, but nothing outstanding either. Felt that the escargots was a tad over baked for me as the meat was slightly tough. Overall the taste was rich and flavourful, and the leftover butter oil makes great dip for the bread. 3/5\n\nThe white asparagus was served with Parma ham, Benedict eggs and hollandaise sauce. The asparagus was crunchy and juicy, and would have paired perfectly with the savoury ham, if not for the lingering bitter vegetal aftertaste coming from the asparagus. Not sure what the Benedict egg and hollandaise sauce bring to the dish, didn\u2019t think the sauce went well with the dish. 3/5\n\nThe foie gras serving was generous! Some of the inferior foie gras I tasted had a powdery and crumbly texture with a strong metallic iron aftertaste lingering. But the foie gras served here was of a much higher quality. Smooth and buttery with a right proportion of fat; lighter in taste but yet flavourful (from the meat) and rich without being too overpowering. It left you wanting to try more as it didn\u2019t have the saturating greasy feeling. The yellow portion of the foie gras in the picture was actually solidified fat and simply pure decadent! I would strongly encourage everyone to at least try a small bit of it to savour the slow melting of pure animal fat essence in your mouth! The reddish condiment at the side was some sort of dried fruit puree and the slight sweet-sourness went very well with the savoury foie gras. The only disappointment I had with the dish was the hard country bread, but otherwise excellent dish. 4.5/5\n\nWe ordered 3 mains for sharing:  lamb tongue (not in regular menu), beef tartare and ribeye steak\n\nPersonally I prefer my lamb to be grilled for that rich \u201cmuttony\u201d favour. This lamb tongue was stewed and served on top of potato mash. I chose this main as lamb tongue was an interesting cut I had not tried before despite the cooking style. The meat was tender with a bit of chewiness to it. Taste was delicately light and I hardly get any \u2018muttony\u2019 favour in it. This was a very nice dish albeit it didn\u2019t suit my personal taste preference. 3.5/5, only because of personal taste preference, otherwise the dish deserved a 4.\n\nThe beef tartare was disappointing. I loved the Angus beef for its \u2018sashimi freshness quality\u2019 with a slight chewy texture. But the condiment was a tad overpowering from the pungent shedded onion and the overly tangy dressing. I felt that the taste was off balanced in the mouth, skewing more towards the condiment. Texture was good, chewiness of the meat went well with the onion crunchiness. The bread was disappointing hard. 3/5\n\nSaving the best for the last, the ribeye was the highlight of the meal for us. Perfectly grilled to medium rare with a pinkish tender center (an expected standard for any high end restaurant) and a slight crusty charred exterior. Decent fat content and the juice of the meat was well sealed during the cooking. Every mouthful was a fine balance of favour and texture. Tenderness of the meat interspersed with crispy charred parts, full bodied and juicy meat favour elevated by the light seasoning. It also went very well with the B\u00e9arnaise sauce as it presented a different taste profile. Just to show you don\u2019t need super expensive beef cut or A5 wagyu to enjoy a premium quality steak. 5/5\n\nWent for dinner\nOrdered the onion soup, lamb rack and mussels\nHad an amazing time wining and dining\nThe soup was delicious and fragrant\nLamb was very flavorful\nMussels was very fresh and tasty\n\nA Belgian in a French Brasserie\u2026 what could possibly go wrong.\n\nNothing actually. Superb business lunch. Relaxing atmosphere, warm traditional interior, capable and attentive staff, and the food - oh man - the food!!\n\nTried the morel mushroom soup and the evergreen Angus Beef tartare. Sublime! Just the way I\u2019d expect it in the best restaurant in Paris, or Brussels. And even the fries are \u201cBelgian Approved\u201d.\n\nThanks guys\n\n\nOption: 6:\nName: MERCI MARCEL ORCHARD\nAddress: 390 Orchard Road, 01-03 Palais Renaissance, 390 Orchard Rd, #01 - 03 / 04, Singapore 238871\nPhone: 6735 2608\nDelivery Available: Information Not Available\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 8:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 8:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nWednesday: 8:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nThursday: 8:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nFriday: 8:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nSaturday: 8:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nSunday: 8:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.7\nReviews: \n\nIt was my first visit with my wife to Merci Marcel, we were delighted by the overall vibes of the restaurant.

The staff were all friendly and provided a fast and efficient service. The food and coffee were amazing, not to mention the cafes' atmosphere was very relaxing. It was a lovely breakfast and experience.\n\nAmazing place, nice atmosphere. Food was excellent but the portions are small (unless you ordered pizza). Also on the higher price range, so do take note. Great for special occasions though!\n\nThe atmosphere of Merci Marcel at Orchard is really nice and relaxing. I was able to get some work done the both times I had gone, while enjoying a nice meal. The first time I had gone to the restaurant, I ordered the ravioli. There are two versions. One has nuts and the other does not. They make sure to seperate them. The green sauce is a chai based sauce (not a pesto). The staff is really polite and the manager also walks the floor and checks on each guest.

Love the foie gras and duck confit.  Satisfying meal. I would go again to try other dishes.\n\nTaratata Brasserie is a great place for traditional French food in the heart of Singapore. We enjoyed the carefully sourced wholesome and fresh ingredients. This allowed the meats to be lightly seasoned for the natural flavors to come through. The various sauces and condiments were hand-crafted in the kitchen by the master chef. The curated French wines were excellent, unlike the new world wines that are rushed to the table by adding sulfur and sugar. Overall, the experience at Taratata Brasserie reminded us of the leisurely meals we had in Paris and Europe during our holidays.\n\nHad a wonderful experience at Taratata. Service was fast and we finished everything on the plates. Would highly recommend the foie gras, duck confit, salad and escargot. The kurobuta pork was nice as well but it reminded me of chinese char Siew.\n\nThe pesto escargot sauce was great but the escargot itself was a bit chewy. the steak was a miss. No taste, very hard to chew on, we asked for medium but we received it quite too well done. Would suggest to try other surrounding restaurants instead\n\n\nOption: 8:\nName: Le Bistrot du Sommelier\nAddress: 53 Armenian St, Singapore 179940\nPhone: 6333 1982\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSunday: Closed\n\nPrice Level: 3 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.5\nReviews: \n\nIt was a nice Dinning experience, quiet and cozy, staffs are friendly, the service is fast, the food we ordered overall are good - I would like to recommend their chicken liver with bread and the main course lamb sharing!

The food is great with excellent service! The degustation set lunch is $98 per person and it\u2019s quite affordable especially the number of dishes and quality. Highly recommended place\n\nGreat Atmosphere, good food and the chef is friendly. First class service.

So a revisit was a long time coming. Good food and great service as always. There are 3 options/dining experiences you can choose from. I went for the most comprehensive one - 3 starters, 1 main with chef\u2019s premium ingredient and 1 dessert.\n\nWhile I can see how Rhubarb has been able to maintain its 1 star for so many years, I struggled a bit to find some key differentiating factor versus other French contemporary Michelin places. Good food nonetheless.\n\nService was really good. The dishes kept coming fast and I was done with my entire dinner in an hour.\n\nAll in all a very good dining place. If you haven\u2019t been there, it is definitely worth going.\n\nThe 4-course lunch Omakase was very very satisfying, with interesting notes and flavours that I\u2019m pleasantly surprised by. I also really enjoyed my chat with Joseph as a solo diner, so that my lunch was a little livelier. I had an absolutely lovely time and would return again.\n\nDecided to go last min as I suddenly met a long time friend. She said she didn\u2019t want to eat something too heavy. The starters were mainly seafood and fruits, which opened up her appetite after a full day of hard stress work. The main was a tender slowed cooked beef. Dessert was a coconut sorbet I think (?). Accompanied the meal with a Riesling. We quite enjoyed the night.\nFunny note, one of the appetisers is a mix of fruits and seafood, I confused the apple with an olive. The taste was good though. Please don\u2019t change the dish because of my comment.\n\nFood are all tastefully plated and delicious. They were kind to ask me if I have dietary restrictions and I told them I would like to have all cooked food. So they made changes for me to replace the lightly torched scallops to cooked crab stick for appetiser. Really appreciate it:) every dishes were all well explained and executed.\n\nOutstanding food, worth its Michelin star. Service is friendly. The atmosphere is a little bit let down by the lighting and impersonal musical background. Overall a very nice place to have an amazing meal. Prices very reasonable.\n",

The food here is really nice and the price is very reasonable for its quality. The place is on the bank of Singapore river, so the view is nice and relaxing. The service here is really good, and we managed to have a chitchat with Nod, who is a very nice person. Highly recommended restaurant overall.\n\nOrdered the grilled squid, which was very reasonable for the quality. One of the best I\u2019ve had. It has a good char on it, tasted super fresh. The lamb kebab was seasoned very well too. Tasted great with the pita bread that came along with it. The one that left me with the least impression is the beef souvlaki. Should have better seasoning. Service was alright. In fact they kept wanting to clear our plates when we were still trying to finish our food. Other than that, this temporary location was quite cosy.\n\nA bright, open and airy restaurant, I will start by agreeing with everyone else that Zorba does a great job of creating tasty Mediterranean food. In particular, the lamb chops and squid were excellent and I thoroughly enjoyed the Greek salad and the variety of flavours in the dips. The vegetarian platter which comes as part of the communal menu was a lovely array of chargrilled vegetables. Our toddler guest loved the tempura asparagus that came with the squid. We opted for the communal menu at $75 per head which is more than enough food. A bottle of Sauvignon Blanc will set you back $95 and a glass of wine is $16. Weirdly, after we orderedthe communal menu for 5 people, everything came at once. So the communal menu *looks like* starters, mains and a dessert but in actual fact the staff kept bringing the stuff out all at once, so we had to request two additional tables to put all the food on! It was weird and chaotic and ok / slightly amusing amongst friends, but if I was there for a business dinner or something it would not have been acceptable. In light of a restaurant bill in excess of $500 for 5 people it is also not acceptable. For that price point people do not expect to be shuffling around trying to find space for food and adding additional tables etc. It should have flowed out successively, as dips and bread starters, salad and squid, meat and vegetarian platters then dessert. As courses. The staff had no idea where to put the food themselves, they just kept bringing the plates out and getting stressed at the table as we shuffled things round. Then about 5 minutes after they\u2019d brought out all the savoury stuff, they tried to bring the dessert (!) which was the final straw for one of our party who asked them to take it away until we finished the mountain of food in front of us. The dessert let the communal menu down. It was a sad looking custard pie that we had to hack into pieces ourselves, with no ice cream or anything. The egg custard was over cooked and was more scrambled egg than custard.\nI am inclined to give any restaurant that allows me to bring my dog extra credit, and Zorba did allow us to bring our dog to sit \u2018outside\u2019 (still completely covered area) and near the open restaurant doors, so he could catch the breeze from the aircon. That\u2019s Thoughtful with a capital T. Lovely. Really appreciated that thank you. They also started well by offering him a water bowl,  but they never actually brought it. Luckily we brought our own. In fact the service generally was a bit all over the place. The youngsters serving our table couldn\u2019t tell us anything about the wine, brought the wrong number of forks, knives and plates and then went to clear tables after being asked to bring more forks and plates. They were pleasant enough, very polite but it was as if it was maybe their second or third day working and they were still learning.\nThere is also a fabulous children\u2019s play area for the toddlers to amuse themselves, which is just a fantastic idea. And very much enjoyed by our toddler guest.\nI don\u2019t want to be so critical of a restaurant that got so many things right. But you have to view these things in lieu of the cost of the evening and Zorba is not cheap. Therefore I expect the service and experience to match the prices of the food and wine.\nI would go again, but I would probably not look to spend the amount we did. Perhaps a simple brunch or dinner for two.\n\nGood atmosphere, good food and good service! I really love the food it taste amazing. Nod and the team really serve us well. Recommend to come with family or friends, very family oriented restaurant.\n\nI recently had the pleasure of dining at Zorba The Greek Taverna in Singapore, and it was an absolutely delightful experience from start to finish. From the moment we walked in, we were greeted with a warm and inviting atmosphere that transported us straight to the heart of Greece.\n\nThe food at Zorba's is nothing short of outstanding. The menu is a treasure trove of authentic Greek dishes, and every bite was bursting with flavour. We started with the mezze platter, acolourfull array of hummus, tzatziki, and dolmades that set the tone for an incredible meal. The moussaka and souvlaki that followed were cooked to perfection, and the portions were generous, making it a great value for the quality.\n\nHowever, what truly elevated our dining experience was the exceptional service provided by our waitress, Chantel. She was not just a server; she was a gracious host who went above and beyond to ensure our meal was memorable. Chantel's knowledge of the menu and her recommendations were spot on. She made us feel like valued guests, and her warm, friendly demeanour made the evening even more enjoyable.\n\nIn conclusion, Zorba The Greek Taverna is a hidden gem in Singapore. The food is top-notch, the atmosphere is inviting, and the star of the show was undoubtedly our wonderful waitress, Chantel. I can't recommend this place enough, and I can't wait to return for another taste of Greece right here in Singapore!\n\nThank you, Chantel, and the entire team at Zorba's, for an unforgettable dining experience!\n\n\nOption: 2:\nName: Blu Kouzina Dempsey\nAddress: 10 Dempsey Rd, #01-20, Singapore 247700\nPhone: 9710 8303\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 3 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.4\nReviews: \n\nThis was my third or fourth time here. My last visit was quite awhile back. The food, ambience, and service here are very good! Parking is free! Place tends to get crowded and there\u2019s sometimes a queue, so it\u2019s wise to make a reservation before heading down. Had the dips and bread, octopus, sea bass, spinach pastries, and finally, baklava for dessert! Everything was great! Octopus was nice and tasty + tender, sea bass was fresh, all the pastries were warm and the Greek coffee we had to end the meal was pretty good too! Will be back here again to try more food! Hopefully sooner than later! Highly recommended for authentic Greek Mediterranean food! Fantastic experience every visit!\n\nA lovely place for those looking for non pork meals. They don\u2019t qualify as a halal place  as they serve alcohol. But good for Muslim friends. It was my first time here and it\u2019s been a while since I had Greek food. I love the dips option from spicy to mild tasting dips. The fried calamari was great too followed by the medium rare lamb which was tender. Ensure you make a reservation to avoid disappointment. Good place to bring friends.\n\nAlways crowded on weekends such that even booking a table on same day is sometimes not possible.\nI really enjoyed the medium meat platter. grilling was on point  meat was juicy and not dry.\nmoussaka went down way too easily. Greek dip platter was on point flavour wise and the taramasalata was flavourful without tasting too fishy.\nsadly the pita bread is pretty small portioned, I'm not sure how you're expected to finish the dip given with the portions served\nGrilled octopus was also delicious.\n\nService was friendly and efficient.\nDecor isn't very Greek but honestly ambience is great (albeit a bit noisy)\n\nIt's harder to get a table here than the at its closest competitor, and for  good reason.\n\nGood food. Although the beef can be on the dry side, everything else was delicious.\n\nHighly recommend the grilled octopus. It is not chewy at all. For those who don\u2019t like squid or octopus, try to have a bite.\n\nRestaurant is packed on a Friday night and the food arrives pretty quick. Staff are quite alright. Some could use a little refining in politeness.\n\nThere\u2019s complimentary licorice candy. Absolutely love it.\n\nWill visit this place again. But recommend to come here in a bigger group to order a larger variety of dishes.\n\nFirst visit. Reservation was smooth via seven rooms. We chose an outdoor table as the weather was pleasant. The food was delicious. We had the whole oven chicken and chicken yiro wrap with fries. Pesto pasta was good as well. Desserts were amazing too.

I have been here 10 TIMES. The food is always so consistently good. They serve the best salad, octopus, sea bream, lamb chop and even chicken. Their dips and pita bread are also to die for. Service isn't as good as it used to be anymore but oh well.\n\nCelebrated a friend birthday here and the staff was quite helpful. We were introduced to a good spread. Wasn\u2019t expecting the food to be good in this type of cafe but was pleasantly surprised of the meat quality and portion. Slightly on the salty side but acceptable. Overall, would come back again.\n\nLoved having dinner here. Food, service, atmosphere all fantastic. Wayne was a great server who recommended some signature dishes - codfish roe was my fav. Octopus was well cooked and kebab was also unique but perfectly cooked.\n\nCame here multiple times including the one at the old location. Also recommended and brought my friends, colleagues here many times! Loved the food, ambience and service! Just so good! This time my friends and I came here to celebrate birthday and the bar manager treated us to complimentary alcohol and gave a small bottle of olive oil (we also purchased a big one!). Their olive oil tastes so gooooooood! The dessert was complimentary as well. I love the fish, octopus and vegetables the best!\n\nFood is fantastic. Price is reasonable as well, total damage is about $50/pax. (We ordered like 7-8 dishes).\nService is pretty prompt.

Meat platter was big enough for 4 of us with a good selection of grilled meat, flavourful and had good taste.\n\nBeautiful venue that really makes you feel like you\u2019re in Greece. Wide variety of seafood, meat and vegetarian dishes - the platters are definitely plentiful and good for big groups. Service is friendly and prompt which is appreciated.\n\n\nOption: 6:\nName: Place to R.E.A.D\nAddress: 46A Prinsep St, Singapore 188676\nPhone: 6333 0689\nDelivery Available: No\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 4:00\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u20092:00\u202fAM\nTuesday: 4:00\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u20092:00\u202fAM\nWednesday: 4:00\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u20092:00\u202fAM\nThursday: 4:00\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u20092:00\u202fAM\nFriday: 4:00\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fAM\nSaturday: 4:00\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fAM\nSunday: 4:00\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u20092:00\u202fAM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 3.4\nReviews: \n\nWe had order chicken leg blackpepper with is served very fast and the chicken is very small,spoiled and smelly,the rest 2 item not good 2/10 service is good but totally is not good\n\nDid a photo shoot for their new dishes then get a chance to try all.\nI do recommend to come here and try the Fried pizza, Seafood Mala pasta  ,Battered prawn with fish roe and mentaiko sauce  and Chicken rendang pizza.\n\nUnhygienic place. Sat inside the bar and there were 2 HUGE cockroaches that were running across the bar counter. My friend informed the staff and they were very casual about it and just killed it and informed us that it was dead without any signs of embarrassment or being apologetic. It ruined my experience there.\n\nThe beer came very fast, but they forgot to give us our fries despite us being the only customers at that point of time. Then when more customers came in, we saw food going out but our fries were not there. Only after we informed them then we reordered something else. And again, there were no signs of being apologetic.\n\nPlace is slightly humid but friendly staff.  Place for only beers. Not sure why but beers come very fast,  not food and non alcoholic beverages. Had to order pineapple juice twice and our spam fries 4 times.\nIt came after 1 hour.\n\nBe careful when you pass by the offers provided by this bar/pub. Cheated by the staff who is offering happy hour when we walked in. One of the staff offered happy hour price when we asked about the pricing, and when billing they started to deny offering the happy hour price. They do not admit their mistakes/miscommunication at all, felt no remorse and even argued back that they did not offer the price. Very upset at the way they're handling the whole situation, and going back on their words. Drinks were overpriced compared to the other bars/pubs (who would even go to a bar that sells overpriced drinks compare to the surrounding bar/pub?). Definitely not coming back to this place due to their bad services and dishonesty with customers.\n\n\nOption: 7:\nName: Blu Kouzina Siglap\nAddress: 907 E Coast Rd, #01-01, Singapore 459107\nPhone: 9710 8303\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.5\nReviews: \n\nVisited for the first time after hearing good reviews from friends. Awesome ambience and child-friendly. Helpful staff who helped us with food orders and wine recommendation. Dips were great, octopus tender and flavourful. Desserts were also delightful. The standout dish was the lamb chops!\n\nHad dinner some time last week and the food was pretty good but it was quite pricey. The waiter asked if we would like sparkling or still water and we thought still meant free tap water, but it turned out to be $10 bottled water. Don\u2019t make the same mistake as we did if you don\u2019t want to splurge on water!\n\nUnfortunately, we found a piece of stainless steel dish sponge in our food which is quite unhygienic and dangerous. The staff were kind enough to take it off our bill but this was a very eventful first experience dining here.\n\nWent to celebrate birthday with a few friends. The food and service were good. Only disappointment is that when we were leaving the place, the wine was actually not finished.  The staff could do better to confirm if we still want it before throwing the bottle away.\n\nI celebrated my birthday at this restaurant today, and it was a fantastic experience. We had been here a few years ago and were still in love with their delicious dips. This time, we ordered two servings of pita, which filled us up completely! We just couldn't resist that warm, fluffy pita bread \ud83e\uded3. After reading some reviews that praised the lamb shank, we took Uncle Bob's recommendation and were not disappointed. The staff was incredibly pleasant, and I want to give a big shoutout to Uncle Bob, Manager Jennifer, and Jay for making our celebration even more special. We'll definitely be coming back! \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf7d\ufe0f\ud83d\ude0a\n\nThe food was fantastic. My favourite dish would be the lamb chops - I've never eaten lamb like this before. It was without the muskiness you typically get from lamb, but it was a clear, smooth lamb flavour.\n\nWe had the dessert platter and I'd say the 'spring roll' is the best. the sweet custard with the thin layer pastry exterior makes it the perfect last bite for the meal.\n\nService was excellent. Special shoutout to Hakim who was very attentive and knowledgeable.\n\nThoroughly enjoyed my experience here!\n\n\nOption: 8:\nName: Pistachio Middle Eastern & Mediterranean Grill\nAddress: 501 Orchard Rd, #02-04/05 Wheelock Place, Singapore 238880\nPhone: 6262 6400\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.4\nReviews: \n\nI came to Singapore few weeks ago and was looking for Mediterranean restaurants. I stumbled upon this gorgeous place 5 minutes away from my hotel. I tried Kebabs on day one and man it was delicious. Atmosphere is great and all servers are friendly, specially three girls Urmi, Wendy and Fina are super nice, they make sure to get you a table quickly, take the order in timely manner and also make valuable suggestions on the menu. They always keep checking if everything is fine and customers are enjoying food. I loved the desert suggestion after eating my dinner. After first day I have been to this place 7-6 times and was always greeted with same service. I highly recommend this restaurant and will go again before I leave Singapore for USA.\n\nWe had the sultan's delight and mussels with garlic cream and cheese toast. The sultan's delight is really enjoyable. We could taste the smokiness from the eggplant puree and the lamb stew is really tender with tomato based sauce. It's tangy and smoky with some crunchiness from the pine nuts. Really enjoyable. But the mussel is pretty standard. It didn't taste really fresh but they're quite generous with the amount. The garlic cheese sauce is ok only.\nService was good and attentive.\n\nExcellent experience with vibrant dining experience. Food has great range of taste to excite the palate. Service is welcoming and top notch, they also gave a complimentary cake.\n\nVisited for my birthday meal with my family as I was craving some Mediterranean food and this place had great reviews. However, the whole experience ended up kinda disappointing - as I had high expectations too on my first visit.\n\nService:\n- It\u2019s a restaurant but I felt like there was not much service per say.\n- It\u2019s a pretty high price point but they don\u2019t serve complimentary water (charged at $3 a pot of hot water, or $11 for Evian water only)\n- Ordering isn\u2019t as fuss free as they try to make it. Online ordering only from mobile app, with just one physical menu at the door. Asked for any extra copies for easier viewing but none available.

The floor staff attend to you immediately and ensure the food served are hot. Unfortunately, there were some mishaps with the food served. When informed, it was immediately rectified and a new dish was served. I am very impressed with the service and the quality of food. Kudos.\n\nWe were there on a weekend for a late lunch. The place was very empty. We were ushered in quite quickly, but when we wanted to place an order, we waited quite a while to be able to get someone's attention.\n3 out 4 items we wanted to order were not available, but we were not informed when we sat down, hence very disappointed. They also have a pasta menu that is not available for weekends too..\nFood came quite fast, but the plates have very disgusting dirty and wet cotton string wrapped handles. I cannot imagine anyone's hand touching that and then touching the fries or wrap. Mocktail was a glass of diabetes, 15% to 20% syrup, coloring and milk. The orange cake was a miss too. It tasted like tapioca kueh.\n\nWe had a comfortable good time on a rainy Sunday evening, eve of PH, at Ela (Bukit Batok)! Our favourite dish was actually 'Keto' with Pulled Beef - the cauliflower rice was very well done with a generous portion of pulled beef! #mustry\nWe would like to do a special shout out to the one and only floor staff that night, Yani! She was like a wonderwoman, running the floor service alone, serving at least 5-6 tables of guests professionally - from bringing guests to tables, to taking orders, clearing tables, making drinks, serving the dishes etc.! Mad respect! Thank you for being so attentive and patient with your warm services! Will be back at the new outlet to try other items soon too! \ud83e\udd73\n\nIt was so cozy and absolutely loved the vibes. The food was exceptional and the service was great.\n\nThe smell of the pita was sooo good and the pita on my lamb was soaked with flavor. Tho you may want to note that lamb generally has a strong smell/taste. My suggestion is to maybe elevate their dessert as the cake tasted like any ordinary lemon pound cake with an ice cream scoop on top. Wish there were smtg more special.\nhonestly would come here again.\n\nFood is good, atmosphere is just nice, very family friendly place for people to hang out. The lamb ribs is the bomb; grilled octopus is ok for me, the portion is a bit small for us. But overall is amazing dining experience for us.\n\n\nOption: 10:\nName: Mykonos On The Bay\nAddress: 31 Ocean Way, #01-10 Quayside Isle, Sentosa Cove, 098375\nPhone: 6334 3818\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.4\nReviews: \n\nFood was amazing and prepared fantastically - delicious and hearty Greek/Mediterranean fare. All the restaurant staff were exceptionally warm, friendly, and kind, and it felt like we were having a sit down dinner at a family home. For the birthday celebration, everyone sang happy birthday as well and we were so well taken care of. The ambience was amazing. Definitely must try and we will definitely come back.\n\nGreat Greek Food\n\nHad dinner with a bunch of friends. We ordered to share. The meat sharing platter was of high quality and cooked to perfection despite it being a dish with many different types of meat. The breads and dips were also great.\n\nService was excellent. We had them arrange tables and then changed tables. They accommodated us each step of the way without any fuss. Service came promptly with a smile.\n\nThe place certainly lived up to its Mykonos name - blue and white furniture graced the place. Outdoor sitting was comfortable with ceiling ELV fans constantly cooling the place next to the water.\n\nWe went to Mykonos by the bay on 1st July to celebrate my daughter\u2019s birthday. I must say that the service staff was quite friendly but the  quantity of the food actually disappointed us. The food was nice but portions were extremely small so we have to order more food. Specially the platter, which was priced at $29 was totally not worth as the dips portions were too small.\n\nFood is excellent, especially the fish, perfect with the creamy garlic source. Not too crowded on a Monday night, it was windy and comfortable with the outdoor seats. Staffs are attentive. Overall very pleasant experience.\n\nAwesome grilled octopus, hummus and taramosalata. Love the breads. A little pricey but ok to indulge once in a while. Service staff were friendly and attentive too.\n",

Very different from what i usually have.\nThe chicken dish is the highlight of the meal. The chicken meat is sooooo soft and tender. The seasoning is on point. Goes really well with the breads. The rice that comes with the dish is really fragrant as well.\nLots of vegetarian options.\nOverall a positive experience and will recommend \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\n\nTotal bill is about $85++\n\nOrdered quite abit for 2 person.

Will definitely go back for the cauliflower salad and hummus.\n\nThis was my second visit today and my colleagues and I absolutely loved the food! I am usually not a fan of Turkish or Mediterranean food but this place is an exception. After trying the food a few months ago for the first time, I have been wanting to visit them again.\n\nEvery dish was delicious and tasted fresh and   wholesome. The Mezeplate is a good option if you are not sure what to order as it has a bit of everything and you can to try the different dips and appetisers. I enjoyed the hummus, cauliflower salad and eggplant dip very much. Their lentil soup was very good too - comforting and tasty.\n\nFor the mains, we tried two of their lunch set meals -  two rice dishes with the different chicken kebabs which were served with tea, soup and a rice pudding dessert. We also ordered their salmon which was so tender and flavourful. Several colleagues commented that it was the best salmon they had ever tasted!\n\nThe highlight of the meal was their dessert - Kunefe which was absolutely delicious! The taste and texture was so complex and had so much depth! The crispy stringy pastry with the creamy sauce, nuts and ice cream was indeed like what the menu described it to be - \u201ca slice of heaven\u201d!\n\nThis is seriously an underrated restaurant which serves amazing food and I would highly recommend it :)\n\n\nOption: 3:\nName: Alaturka Mediterranean & Turkish Restaurant\nAddress: 15 Bussorah St, Singapore 199436\nPhone: 9434 6026\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.6\nReviews: \n\nI had the pleasure of trying Turkish cuisine for the first time, and it was truly a delightful experience! The standout dish for me was the lamb; it had absolutely no odor and tasted fantastic. The grilled items were a highlight as well, bursting with delicious flavors. The restaurant\u2019s ambiance was beautifully decorated, and the staff was both charming and incredibly helpful, taking the time to explain the dishes to us. While it\u2019s not the cheapest option, the prices are fair for the quality you receive.\n\nOne thing to note, though, is that the platter we ordered was described as \u201cfor two,\u201d but for Asians, it\u2019s considered a generous portion. So, if there are four of you and you\u2019ve already ordered other dishes, I recommend going for the platter for two only; it\u2019s quite substantial. Would recommend to anyone looking for a great dining experience!\n\nFirst time having Turkish food and was really\npleasantly surprised. Their dips and bread was really exceptional. The bread was steaming when it came out it was both crispy and fluffy at the same time. The platter for 2 was also great all the grilled meats was tender and flavourful. Portion was also huge.\n\nVery impressive food & service displayed by the dedicated front staffs and chefs. It\u2019s nice walking in the street after a wine & dine session in the area. The staffs were very attentive, price is reasonable.\n\nVery delicious food with reasonable price.\nMy friend from Turkey said this is the only place with authentic Turkish food. My mom who is super picky about food said their food is good. Their dessert Kunefe is both crispy and creamy.\n\nThe staffs are friendly and knowledgeable. Will visit again.\n\nWent here for a birthday celebration and the attention to detail from their service staff is amazing, didn\u2019t mention to the staff that it was for a birthday celebration, only had a note in the reservation. But they went above and beyond, having candles in the dessert and even giving us props to take pictures with and proceeded to then print out the photo of us to keep!\n\nThe food also matches the service, authentic Turkish cuisine done perfectly, the Hummus was so good we had to order a second portion! I\u2019m not usually a fan of chicken but the chicken that came with the platter blew my mind, so juicy and tender. Then comes dessert, my first time having Kunefe and the only thing I have to say is that I wish I didn\u2019t share it, wanted it all to myself \ud83e\udd23\n\nDefinitely coming back here again!\n\n\nOption: 4:\nName: Cappadocia Turkish & Mediterranean Restaurant\nAddress: 69 Bussorah St, Singapore 199482\nPhone: 9677 9072\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.8\nReviews: \n\nHonestly, wasn\u2019t the most impressed with the service here at first, asked for order and the person simply said yes can continued doing his own stuff for 5minutes.\n\nHowever, when the food came, i didn\u2019t think too much about it afterwards. Starting from the hummus, absolutely generous and delicious portions. Perfect appetizer.\n\nThe butter rice with kebab was crazy delicious, we literally scraped the plate clean from the rice and the greek yogurt like substance in the centre.\n\nPizza was crispy and fragrant at the same time, the tomato sauce parts was absolutely amazing.\n\nStrawberry drink was okay!!! Not super special but nice!\n\nIn the middle of Arab street you find this restaurant. We were welcomed\u00a0by a real Turkish guy. Very friendly and he could advise us what was the best to order. We sat outside, along\u00a0the street. Within 15 min the table was full with all kinds of grilled meat. Real Turkish flavors and a nice apple tea were enough to make my day complete. Eating here, and watching the people pass by is a big joy.\n\nParking in this area is very hard, as you can understand.\n\nHad a great dinner here today. My friend saw this online with high rating stars so we just stopped by after work.  And yes, the food is delicious, the atmosphere is awesome, love the music too.\nSo if your family or friends are outgoing and friendly, this is the right place for you to gather together and laugh together and dance together !\n\nCuisine is new to me as a traveller. Trying the dish with my arab friends and the chef being a wonderful host in telling us about the different food added to the stellar experience of dining here. Service was awesome. Food was a good blend of flavors.\n\nJust returning home from an amazing service and hospitality from Cappadocia.\nChef Ahmed Hagras went out of his way to arrange a very sweet surprise for my husband's birthday at my request.\nThe whole staff sang happy birthday for him with a special kunafe.\n\nThe food itself is finger licking good, no doubt.

Very no frills and simple place.\n\nShe had a falafel moussaka, and I had the mexican beef bowl. The moussaka was delicious but I feel like 5 pieces of nacho chips wasn\u2019t enough and mind you this cost $13\u2026..\n\nThe beef bowl was a little dry, could do with some kind of sauce but it was good and we finished both dishes. The churros came freshly fried and was good too, but would have preferred actual choc sauce vs the hershey choc syrup.\n\nOnly gripes; the overly sugary lemongrass drink that was served premade with no ice. Had to ask for ice twice but given few pieces\u2026..  also very weird that we dined in but were served with plastic cutlery when we clearly saw metal cutlery, it was a little strange. It was practically only 2 tables and the lady served my food to the other table\u2026. Could tell she wanted to take it back to serve me but they already started eating it.\n\nI think its a quaint little place but some things need to be improved. At $30 for 2 expected just a little more.\n\nExcellent service. The beef Mexican rice bowl was not bad. With the homemade drink, I spent less than $10. I was there alone at 5 ish and I had the entire place to myself. I don't remember music playing but it sure would be nice to listen to some tunes.\n\nSmall quaint shop located near Tai Seng Mrt, they had a $10 set meal that had a wrap, small hash brown and a lemongrass tea. There was a small side of nacho chips with salsa.\n\nNothing amazing but I guess it was better than nothing coz there wasn\u2019t anything there open before 11am\n\nDropped-off my 10-months old laptop at LENOVO Service Centre at 3 Irving Rd, #01-17 Tai Seng Centre. BITC, Singapore 369522 on Tuesday 18 April 2023,\n\nThus decide to settle my late lunch within the area too.\n\nOne will be spoiled with choices as there are so many small eateries and cafes. I was drawn to  Olive Mediterranean & Middle East which was located across the street at 11 Irving Place #01-14/15, Tai Seng Point, Singapore 369551.\n\nOrdered for myself a Mexican Rice (Celantro & Spinach With Beef) Bowl at S$7.50.\n\nIf you are a small eater, the serving portion is just right. However, definitely a \"No. No.\" for someone who has a heavy duty digestive system, I would recommend that you order some nachos or Quesadillas too.\n\nIn my opinion, the rice is mildy aromatic (I was expecting a more pungent aroma of Celantro and spinach).\n\nI will rate the minced beef topping as \"healthy choice\".  It is relatively quite nice BUT will not leave one any special impression.  It will definitely taste alot better if there is a little more fat (this will enhance the juiciness) and more spices are added.\n\nHowever, if you working in this area, it is a great place to meet up with your colleagues and friends after work.  You can sufficient outdoor sittings surrounded with plants.\n\nStumbled on this place as i happened to be browsing around. Been awhile since i had my tacos and wraps, decided to try this as i noticed they had very high reviews.\n\nHad the beef Quesadilla - loved it as it was simply nice\nChicken Saffron Stew - Soooo tender and nice but soup wasnt as thick as i wanted but thats purely due to my own taste\nHashbrowns - Thumbsup as we all loved it. Hearsay its even better than M's hashbrown but i leave it for u to judge.\n\nService wise was top, very homely feel given by the lady boss and staff. She took her time to guide me through the menu and shared with me what we should order.\nI must say the food takes a pretty long time to come for a quiet Monday Afternoon but i guess Good Food - Time to prepare so no complaints from me on this.\n\nOverall i recommend this place based on the food served + prices. Very nice and they deserves better businesses. should be pretty quiet when its after office hours.\n\nWill be back again :)\n\n\nOption: 6:\nName: Le Rida (Mediterranean. French.

The food worth 2 stars. The meat was pretty hard, the starter was too sour. The dessert was really not able to match our taste. The house wines was tasteless, but the red wine taste better when it pair with the meat. I will strongly recommend you only order the red if you want to have their one for one house wine promo.\nOur bill was $128, you can get a much more better grilled meat platter and better food at other restaurants. :)\n\nLe Rida has a rustic ambience somewhat akin to an old time eating house in a small town. Quaint and homely\nFreshly baked pita bread with lemon chick pea hummus was delicious and filling\nMains of Lebanese lamb kafta kebab had the right balance of flavour and crunchiness.\nWash it all down with 1 for 1 Heineken draft at $17.90\n\nManager Sanjiv was both friendly and helpful in his recommendations and unlike in some establishments, he did not push you to over order.\nDefinitely worth a return visit!\n\nDidn't think the food was thaaaat amazing. Nor was the service. But at least they let us drink outside drinks.\nHOWEVER, i requested for no garnishing on my hummus. When the guy brought it over, there WAS parsley on it. And all he said was \"just pluck it out\". --.--\nSo if i was allergic to that, i should just pluck it out.... nice. The hummus wasn't good either. I've tasted better. Like a friend who went with me commented... it isn't creamy enough. Also, comments about the baklava was that it was too hard... and wasn't good.\n\nAbsolutely loved the food, I am heavily into Mediterranean food. I have tried most of the places around Bugis as well. The food here was so fresh, with perfect taste and presentation. It was completely worth it travelling from East.\nThe service was quick, the portion size was generous . We ordered mezze plateer and tabalu salad. They were scrumptious loved the customised heart shaped Pita bread. Hummus, was so creamy and so were all other dips.\n\nWould strongly recommend.. It has become one of my favourite place..\n\nEnjoyed a lovely evening with family and doggie. Food is nice and the 1 for 1 drinks promo is good too.\nLoved the dips platter and mixed grill with different meats\nThe pita bread is nice and soft and goes well with the hummus.\nGreat thing is that we can have our dog to eat with us....ha,ha, perhaps more like watch us eat. \ud83d\ude06\nStaff is friendly and helpful.

Very friendly staff,- quick service and very nice Singapore Sling. Super clean environment, good ambiance and price worthy. 5/5 will come back for sure.\n\nUnique experience eating middle eastern food. The food was great and there was quite a bit of variety. Also the staff were very friendly! It is a bit on the pricey side but it is still worth the experience.\n\nTried the set lunch ($28++) at Kazbar a while back! Had the Beef and Spinach Stew Set. The set lunch also came with a starter of homemade hummus and babaghanoush with pita bread.\n\nFood:\n- Hummus was smooth and creamy while the babaghanoush reminded me of a citrusy relish. My only gripe with the starter was that they didn't give more pita bread because the spreads were that good\n\n- The beef and spinach stew was a very comforting dish packed full of homely flavours. The beef was fairly tender and the spinach was really soft but for some reason I felt that there was too much spinach in the stew. Overall, the stew was well-seasoned and went quite well with the vermicelli rice\n\n- The salad was satisfactory but didn't particularly stand out\n\nService/Atmosphere:\n- This place is always crowded during lunchtime so high chance you need to make a reservation to get a table, especially if you're coming in a big group\n\n- Servers were really attentive and there were no problems with our food\n\n- Atmosphere felt warm and cozy, and was complemented by the fairly dim lighting\n\nOverall, a great experience. Will definitely be back again in the future!\n\nIf you like Hummus, this restaurant/pub has the best Hummus in Singapore \ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddec .\nJust order the big portion! You won't regret it.\n\nFor a person who doesn't like lamb, I'd like to share that this restaurant is the only one where I would not hesitate to order their lamb shanks!\n\nThe atmosphere is good for catching up with friends over a beer and a good Turkish meal.  A change from the usual type of dining places we locals normally go to. The friends I brought there thoroughly enjoyed the evening.\n\nThe staff are friendly and humorous.  It can get crowded Friday nights.  So go early!\n\nThey are open 6 days a week, closed on Sunday.\n\nSuper juicy and delicious kebab and loved the hummus and babaganoush too. The lunch special is good value for the quality and portion. Service was quick and helpful.

My last visit was quite awhile back. The food, ambience, and service here are very good! Parking is free! Place tends to get crowded and there\u2019s sometimes a queue, so it\u2019s wise to make a reservation before heading down. Had the dips and bread, octopus, sea bass, spinach pastries, and finally, baklava for dessert! Everything was great! Octopus was nice and tasty + tender, sea bass was fresh, all the pastries were warm and the Greek coffee we had to end the meal was pretty good too! Will be back here again to try more food! Hopefully sooner than later! Highly recommended for authentic Greek Mediterranean food! Fantastic experience every visit!\n\nA lovely place for those looking for non pork meals. They don\u2019t qualify as a halal place  as they serve alcohol. But good for Muslim friends. It was my first time here and it\u2019s been a while since I had Greek food. I love the dips option from spicy to mild tasting dips. The fried calamari was great too followed by the medium rare lamb which was tender. Ensure you make a reservation to avoid disappointment. Good place to bring friends.\n\nAlways crowded on weekends such that even booking a table on same day is sometimes not possible.\nI really enjoyed the medium meat platter. grilling was on point  meat was juicy and not dry.\nmoussaka went down way too easily. Greek dip platter was on point flavour wise and the taramasalata was flavourful without tasting too fishy.\nsadly the pita bread is pretty small portioned, I'm not sure how you're expected to finish the dip given with the portions served\nGrilled octopus was also delicious.\n\nService was friendly and efficient.\nDecor isn't very Greek but honestly ambience is great (albeit a bit noisy)\n\nIt's harder to get a table here than the at its closest competitor, and for  good reason.\n\nGood food. Although the beef can be on the dry side, everything else was delicious.\n\nHighly recommend the grilled octopus. It is not chewy at all. For those who don\u2019t like squid or octopus, try to have a bite.\n\nRestaurant is packed on a Friday night and the food arrives pretty quick. Staff are quite alright. Some could use a little refining in politeness.\n\nThere\u2019s complimentary licorice candy. Absolutely love it.\n\nWill visit this place again. But recommend to come here in a bigger group to order a larger variety of dishes.\n\nFirst visit. Reservation was smooth via seven rooms. We chose an outdoor table as the weather was pleasant. The food was delicious. We had the whole oven chicken and chicken yiro wrap with fries. Pesto pasta was good as well. Desserts were amazing too.

The dips are yummy, pitas are warm and tasty, the grilled octopus is one of the best I\u2019ve ever had!!!! The tacos giros are yummy and the beef is of great quality! One more thing to mention is that they even serve Greek beer!!! The service is good, decoration/interior design is top!

It was dry.\nBelly dancer with amazing dance skills was a surprising addition.\nHad a great time.\n\nA bit further down the road from the more crowded food areas, but well worth the extra distance. The chicken kebab lunch special was excellent, the apple tea was also wonderful, and the staff are very attentive.\n\nThis was an excellent find while going through that area!\n\nMezze platter - 3.75 stars\nDips were delicious. Pita was bland and could've been better.\n\nKebab platter - 3.75 stars\nSausage was great. Beef and chicken a bit dry. Lamb was salty.\n\nThe food is really delicious and there are many must try middle east delicacies. The  downside of the restaurant is the service though they charge 10% service charge.\n\nHi, the best place in Arab street for authentic food. I keep coming back here and the food is very affordable, choose this restaurant if you can\u2019t decide! We even got a free dessert, from Amar, his service was great!!!\n",

They charged you $10.50 for the spicy pork meal they will give you the value of $10.50 meal.\n\nSpicy pork was well marinated, right amount of cabbage as well. The cabbage soup is also good got tofu inside too. Love the whole combination.\n\nPlenty of seats available and the queue moves quickly. My plate of spicy pork came out sizzling \ud83e\udd75 you can see the bits of sauce splatter on my tray hahah\n\nWorth it \ud83d\udcaf\n\nIt\u2019s truly a Korean food stall that\u2019s 100% worth the value.\nThe new items which is the spicy soba is really good. Soba is not soaked in water and it\u2019s the dry mixed type.\nThe chilli sauce is not spicy and well portioned, so that the soba doesn\u2019t get thick sauces on it.\nThe pancake is really authentic and first time liking a Korean style pancake.\nShrimp tempura 6 pieces for $5.5, it\u2019s definitely the best deal every.\n\nTaste nice! Portion wise very big.\n\nGot really confused what to order as all the menu looks good.\n\nPrice is good for the portion\n\nThink can share for two people.\n\nEach set comes with one side dish. You can choose between kimchi anchovies or cucumber.\n\nI came here 30 years ago, and they are still in operation! Kim\u2019s used to be in a food court setting, but now they have their own setup.\n\nUnique to Kim\u2019s is their water based hot plate. A must try are the beef bulgogi, spicy chicken and kimchi soup.\n\nHeard lots of good reviews on its authentic yet affordable korean food so I decided to head down for lunch on Saturday. We ordered a spicy beef soup which comes with a side of rice and one side dish, a chives pancake as well as beef bibimbap.\n\nThe soup was pretty delicious, nicely salted and the vegetables and meat portion was very generous. It wasnt very spicy, which is good for those with a low spice tolerance.\n\nBeef bibimbap was hot (temperature wise) which makes the rice nicely scorched and slightly crispy at the bottom. The sauce is slightly different from others I've tried, with a twang of sweet soy and meaty taste. The bibimbap comes with a small dish of bibim sauce as well, so you can personalise how much sauce you can add.\n\nI do love the chives pancake, its fluffy yet crisp. Theres a nice balance of veges in it, so the chives is not too overwhelming.\n\nOverall, the food is worth the trip for me. Flavours were all on-point and the meals were all quite healthy and not too oily. Great for families to visit!\n\nAesthetically, the place gives off a canteen vibe (no music and wallpaper decor), but for the price range, it doesnt bother me. Service was great as well, the staff was very helpful and multilingual (-1 though as I wanted another soup and they gave me the wrong recommendation :( )\n\n\nOption: 2:\nName: Chang Korean Charcoal BBQ Restaurant\nAddress: 71 Loewen Rd, #01-01, Singapore 248847\nPhone: 6473 9005\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 3 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.1\nReviews: \n\nWe celebrated my niece birthday and as we had quite a few people we were given a room which provides the privacy. Service was attentive and the bbq was done before they serve.  So we do not leave the place smelling like bbq. Plus a huge variety of banchan. Abit pricey and might not be for everyday. But for special occasions it is a good choice for korean bbq\n\nStandard of food is good. My family enjoyed different soups, and meat were nicely grilled for us. Generous servings of side dishes. Awesome\n\nHad lunch here on a weekend and was immediately seated. As it was just both of us, we could not order more to try. Tea was on the house.  There were 10 varieties of ban Chan, including cold marinated crabs which was a nice surprise. We ordered marinated pork ribs and pork belly plus a huge steaming pot of Kim chee stew. The meat was cooked away from our table, as per request. The marinated pork rib was very flavorful    The pork belly was not bad. And the Kimchi stew too sour to our liking.  Staff were all very friendly. Overall a good experience.\n\nLove the meat, tender and juicy.\n\nThe side dishes were great, there's also the soy sauce marinated raw crab as a side dish.\n\nFavourite gotta be bossam and the bean paste soup. Packed with flavours and has this umami taste.\n\nA little pricey. Services were alright.\n\nUnderwhelming korean dishes. The banchan was nothing special and tasted less than average. The stew was bland and thin in flavour. I would expect the prawns in the soup to be fresh and whole rather than frozen. The egg came in a generous portion. The pancake was very crispy but somehow lacked the depth. Meat was ok. Can get much much better flavours with the price we paid for.\n\n\nOption: 3:\nName: Bigmama Korean Restaurant\nAddress: 2 Kim Tian Rd, Singapore 169244\nPhone: 6270 7704\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: Closed\nTuesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4\nReviews: \n\nFood felt very authentic and Korean. Service was pretty fast and helpful. There weren\u2019t many people here when we came here for lunch on Saturday.\n\nThe rice portion is pretty generous. Must have it if you get soup. Also ordered a seafood pancake which was great. They were also very generous with the ban chan.\n\nOrdered the 2 person set for $95. Consisting of Suyuk, Dalgakbi and Seafood pancake.\n\nFood was very nice. They were very flexible in the dishes as we are allowed to change the seafood pancake into a seafood stew and two drinks, as long as it does not exceed the original price of that dish \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb.\n\nIt was slightly expensive, and the set for 2 can easily allow 3 pax to dine.\n\nHad a really enjoyable meal here. Kids loved the shoyu meat and pancake. Bibimbap was excellent as were all the sides which were plentiful, distinct and authentic. Some of the best kimchi I\u2019ve ever tasted.\n\nFood was delicious and authentic. Side dishes were tasty and refillable. The space is small so tables are close to each other. They made sure that we leave at 8pm for our 6.30pm booking. On the pricier side so would have expected at least plain water to be served. I brought my own basmati rice for bibimbap due to diet and they gladly obliged (same price). Service staff are all very busy so service is efficient but not warm.\n\nReservations required! Bigmama is super popular and crowded. I walked in when they opened for dinner at 5.30pm and was told I only have 1 hour for dinner as they were fully booked from 6.30pm.\n\nLuckily they prioritised our orders and served really quickly. The very nice restaurant owners took time to explain how to eat the various dishes, which were so so good. Highly recommend ordering the samgyetang, portion is good for 2-4 pax, the soup was hearty and delicious while the glutinous rice is super yummy and filling.\n\nTheir refillable banchan was super delicious especially the glass noodles, kimchi and lotus root salad - while they only have 6 dishes, everything was really good and we had a second serving. Suyuk was pretty interesting as well but pales in comparison to the samgyetang.\n\nBy the time I finished at 6.30pm the restaurant was already full of people. Can\u2019t wait to come again to try the rest of their dishes. Highly recommended!\n\n-edit- oh yeah they don\u2019t serve barley tea or water which is weird. And their drinks are not cheap.

Initially wondering why the place was so empty when I arrived but after a while it was totally packed.\nA little confusing on the menu because the physical one outside the shop had dinner menu and lunch menu and the electronic one only had lunch. Not sure if could only order from the lunch menu tab but upon asking could order from anywhere from the menu. There were duplicate dishes on ala carte and lunch menu because portion size was smaller and it comes with a set of soup and rice.\nOrdered quite a few items to try, the most important thing I wanted to try was the marinated raw crab and we also ordered the galbi along with some other dishes like seafood pancake and kimchi stew.\nEverything here was good, from the sides to the mains. The galbi was cooked by the staff and it was cooked to perfection. Raw crab was also nice and flavourful and well marinated.\nBill came and it was slightly expensive but definitely worth for the quantity and the quality. Would definitely come back again!\n\nReservations are recommended. When we visited on a Saturday for lunch, the place was packed.\n\nThe pork was good. The staff isn't very interactive or smiley, but they are quite helpful when it comes to grilling the meat.\n\nWas brought here by a friend for dinner. He came here here quite a few time and highly recommend me to come here. There were already a crowd when we reached. There was 5 group ahead of us and we waited for almost half and hour before it was our turn.\n\nApart from the ala carte, they also have different sets available. The Korean bbq here Is cooked via charcoal. The stuff will help you prep the food. Sides dishes is refillable. The marination of the meat was fantastic, not too sweet nor salty.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the food and would definitely be back again.\n\nThe newly revamp joint has a real modern touch. Service is absolutely amazing. Food quality is top notch. Many tables was having the raw crab. Looks good however didn\u2019t dare to try. Seafood pancake was delicious & they don\u2019t skimp on the ingredients. Btw the steam egg is FOC. Every table has it. We wanted to order however the waitress explained they will provide every table with one.\nHighly recommended.\n\nFirst time trying Guiga and I\u2019m so glad we did! Everything from service to food was perfect. I loved the beef tartare and marinated crabs\u2764\ufe0f We got the Black Pork set with a side of beef ribs and the samgyetang, which is by far the tastiest I\u2019ve had in Singapore. We didn\u2019t quite enjoy the steamed egg, maybe cos we let it sit there for too long because we were busy eating up the feast we ordered!

Comes with a variety of ban chan dishes - ten to be exact. I was personally expecting the meat to be grilled on the table but it was done in the kitchen instead. Pork collar was overcooked and tough to chew. The beef on the hand was done alright. The other main dishes that we ordered were slightly better than the BBQ option than we had.\n\nI reached 630pm and had to queue outside for a while for 25mins. The server was passionate and shared with us what\u2019s the highly recommended dish to go for. Order an oxtail soup and a recommended BBQ. Oxtail soup was okay and lags of umami. The pork belly is overcooked and served on a hot plate that\u2019s not hot. Then I would recommend serving on the plate instead if there isn\u2019t any sizzling effect, why bother? Food for thought. I think probably we picked the wrong dishes? I don\u2019t know\u2026 but I\u2019m sure paying for that price I can get better BBQ meat for sure. Head down and try for yourself, review is base on my personal preference. You might have a different experience than I have.\n\nFood:\npork bokkeum $30\nserving size was generous and it was filled with lots of veg, onions and mushrooms. slight spice gave it a nice kick but doesn\u2019t come with rice. quite a challenge to finish it even if we weren\u2019t full because it got quite jelak\ndolsot bibimbap $20\ncan\u2019t go wrong, really nice and we polished it off\nhaemul pajeon $17\nthere was seafood with every bite of the pancake, they certainly don\u2019t scrimp on the ingredients. personally not a fan of how soft the pancake was though ):\nadditional items:\nsikhye $4\nreally nice and smooth drink, but serving size was a tad small, moreover no complimentary water which is usually a norm in korean joints\nhite beer $17, rice $2\n\n10 side dishes came complimentary but nothing really stood out. some were quite salty as well \ud83d\ude05\noverall not too bad, but nothing that stood out as being really delicious\n\nSuperb Korean food. Great, authentic taste.\n\nLove the japchae - nice texture, flavourful. Oxtail stew is good too. The BBQ platter is fantastic.\n\nThis place reminds me of a joint in Seoul that I used to frequent, esp their bokkeum octopus, which has such a generous amount of octopus compared to other places where there's more veg in the dish.. their side dishes are also good and a hit for my toddlers.\n\n\nOption: 6:\nName: OPPA SHASHABU KOREAN BBQ BUFFET\nAddress: GR.iD, 1 Selegie Rd, #01-18, 188306\nPhone: None\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4\nReviews: \n\nThe thousand reviews are mostly from prior locations. This location is new.\n\nSo much seating at this place! The price matched the food well. Passable quality food but they throw tons of options at you. Would totally suggest to go for small quantities first to reduce food waste. Having said that the staff is attentive and helpful.\n\nYou will be warmly greeted by their staff. The friendliness and attentiveness from this restaurant is fantastic! They deserve a pat on their shoulder it's comparable to HDL man! Buffet price are reasonable with meat and seafood and inclusive of drinks. I don't even need to top up for their soup base either. They have chef cooked the BBQ food and some cooked food dishes. Shabu shabu is cooked by ourself in the steamboat. As I'm a kidney dialysis patient and I can't consume high sodium food so they are so kind to allow me have separate soup pot to put plain water(also the restaurant are not full house so they gave us a big table). They constantly check on us if everything is OK and keep refilling our soup base. Thumbs up on their service.\n\nA jewel from the beloved JCube.\nOppa BBQ is back!\n\nI like BBQ, but good ingredients deserves to be sha-shabu-ed.  Very happy to discover an additional option - a silvery shabu pot!  BBQ is still available but this time its done in the kitchen - so no more smoky clothes after the meal, and served on a cute warming platter \ud83d\ude0b\n\nThe cooked food section have expanded - from the other reviews there is a variety to surprise every return visit (fried chicken too!).  But most importantly my beloved tteok-bokki is back!\n\nFinally a big thank you to the warm welcoming staff - great to see the crew from Jcube again.  We will be back!\n\nOverall satisfied. For lunch they serve french fries, toppoki, JapChae, seaweed soup and fried Gimmari. I am not a big eater. It's more than enough for me. My son loves the meat.\n\nOPPA Vibes; Definitely a place to unwind over some Soju or Beer. ALL YOU CAN EAT and kids friendly (kids per pax is super affordable. Good spread of sauces, hot food and a separate 3 tier classy trolley for us to put our Buffet loot. This really shows the genuine gesture from the shop owner. Love the friendly staff. Super fresh short plate, beef. Let the pics convince you.

Wide spread of side dishes, porridge and kimchi is the best, but some of them abit salty. My favourite dish here is their Tteokbokki, very soft and chewy, is a must order!\n\nHad one of the beef/pork sets and octopus soup. Was a very satisfying and hearty meal, especially with the free flow side dishes (very yummy!). Service staff were also attentive and helpful! Gave us a free steamed egg dish as well; thank you!\n\nthey had a great variety of side dishes, take note some of the dishes cant be refilled e.g. KIMCHI\u2026.. which was kinda weird cause it\u2019s a korean restaurant\u2026 but anw we ordered a $25 pork belly and two small slim pieces of meat was served.. quality wasnt that great\ncold noodles were okay - abit sour but noodles were chewy and refreshing\nsoft tofu hotpot - soup was not the best I\u2019ve tasted, they included alot of ingredients like octopus, some meat, black fungus, 3 big pieces of tofu, and more\n\noverall it was a meh experience\n\nNo frills. Homely simple korean restaurant with very nice food, especially the side dishes.  However be warned that the staff may insist that you order minimum dishes per pax. Even though we were 3 small eater adults + a fussy toddler, we were made to order 3 main courses which was really too much for all of us. So only come when hungry. Their dishes also tend to be a little pricey\n\nFinally returned after a couple of years since the food standard dropped. Served 13 side dishes of which one of them is porridge which I think it's a good choice if comes with young children.  And it tastes nice. Ordered BBQ pork+beef set which the staff helped us grilled and cut into small bite sizes.\n\n\nOption: 8:\nName: 8 Korean BBQ Shaw Centre\nAddress: 1 Scotts Rd, #04 - 20 / 21, Singapore 228208\nPhone: 9018 9212\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.1\nReviews: \n\nWe ordered the 4 colors pork belly set - original, wine, miso and garlic.

We were craving for more and ended up order additional strip. The curry flavor was a great surprise too. The overall experience surpassed our expectation and we will be back again!

I had some special request for the table and they gladly helped. Wonderful service\n\nGreat food. Definitely must come enjoy.\n\nLove the yuzu makeolli drink\n\n8 Korean BBQ Shaw Centre is an absolute gem for Korean BBQ enthusiasts! The quality of the meat is outstanding, and the interactive grilling experience is both fun and delicious. The variety of marinades and side dishes add a delightful twist to the meal, making it a must-visit spot for anyone craving authentic Korean flavors. The service is top-notch, and the ambiance is perfect for a memorable dining experience. Highly recommended!\n\nCame here for a family dinner on a weekday night - the entire Shaw Center was pretty quiet and the restaurant itself was about 1/3 full. Service was quick and friendly, food is so-so, definitely had better. Their speciality is pork (we order the 8-flavor platter ) but it was the 1 beef dish that I personally liked best. The appetizers were fine. Not super impressed.\n\nWent there for company\u2019s team dinner. The first visit was a lasting impression. The meat flavors are so balanced. The prawn with sake was awesome. Reasonable pricing for the quality of food. Service was fantastic.  Vanessa cooked the meat well and very attentive and friendly.

And tried different dishes. The restaurant is ran by Korean. It is authentic Korean cuisine. The atmosphere is chill and cozy. Our favorite food is the spicy chicken feet pot and the beef rib soup.\nThe panchan\ud310\ucc2cthere are also nice and the waiter and waitress are responsive. Just that sometime they get really busy.\nIt would be really lovely to go there for a sip of the hot soup on a rainy and cold morning.\nReally like this place a lot.\n\noverall a popular place with good options of home cooking style Korean food, better to have more than 3people sharing , portion is big for 2 person, you may only get a chance to try 1 or 2 type of food. The pork and chicken dishes are big portion. Chicken feet comes with steam egg and rice balls, it\u2019s a good combination and good to share.\nCame at around 630pm on a Friday evening, it started to get very busy from 7pm.\n\nCame here on a Wednesday night at 7 p.m., and no reservations were needed. I have walked past this restaurant a few times, but I was more familiar with their nostalgic cultural Korean decorations. They moved recently to a new area along the same stretch, and it's so minimalistic now... A lot more space is catered for diners, with rooms for big groups. Side dishes was pretty okay only. Toilet is huge too!\n\n\ud83d\udca7 Water is complimentary\n\nWe ordered:\n\n\ud83d\udc14 Jjimdak ($55)\nBraised chicken in dark sauce, this dish is one of my favourites in korea. And this standard is pretty okay! Huge portion that feeds at least 4 people. Chicken could have been braised longer to have more flavour. The japchae noodles at the bottom soak up a lot of sauce, so it's quite filling, along with potatoes and carrots.\n\nI rate: 3.5/5 \ud83c\udf1f\n\n\ud83c\udf43 Minari Jun ($28)\n1st time trying Minari, and we were surprised how fresh this vegetable pancake tasted. It didn't have a celery scent and tasted rather clean. Quite flat as well. Would like it if it's bigger.\nI rate: 4.5/5 \ud83c\udf1f\n\n\ud83c\udf76 Pine Nut Draught Wine ($28)\nThe way it's served is pretty interesting! In a small vat with a wooden scoop into a shallow bowl. It was a little gassy and had a faint, nutty sweet aftertaste.\n\nI rate: 4/5 \ud83c\udf1f\n\nThis place serves very authentic Korean food. Although traditional bbq was available, no one was having that as the standout are the Korean cooked dishes. It's quite close to the Korean food I had in Korea last year. The standout is the braised short ribs. It's so tender and meat falls off the bone easily. Pair the rice with the braised sauce and it's heavenly. The radishes and carrots were so yummy too. 2nd best was the assorted pancakes. It was like no other I had tried before. There were fish, mushroom, prawns and it's so all very special. It really fills you up too. The place was not very closely packed where you're sitting shoulder to shoulder and tables well spaced apart, unlike some other Korean restaurants here. The restroom are also very clean.\n\nWent for an early dinner and was given a spacious seat for our family of 4. Ordered the barbecued pork belly and beef. They will actually sliced the meat and barbecue the meat for you so that you don\u2019t have to actually do it yourself. Ordered the beef bulgogi for the kids and the kids loved it. Not too many of non spicy options for kids though. Kimchi pancake tasted great while the cold noodles were quite soggy. Overall prices are on the higher side, especially the barbecued meats. Service can be improved, cos we waited quite long for the rice to be ready and there wasn\u2019t anyone to inform us that we have to wait for the rice.\n\n\nOption: 10:\nName: Woorinara Korean Restaurant\nAddress: 19 Lor Kilat, #01-02, Singapore 598120\nPhone: 6464 9282\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 3.9\nReviews: \n\nOne of the many Korean joints in the area. This one feels more of the homely variety. Focus of our meal was fried chicken and it was reasonably delicious although the cheese seemed to dominate the taste a fair bit. The kimchi pancake was nice.\n\nWent for lunch on a Saturday afternoon and the place was full.\n\nOrdered the fried chicken platter, jajangmyeon, and seafood pancake. The fried chicken was tender and juicy. Noodles were springy and flavourful. The pancake was a bit disappointing as it was overly doughy and lacked crispiness. The sauce for the pancake was too salty as well.\n\nLots of free sides were given together with the meal. Overall left with full bellies. Bill came up to $63 for two people.\n\nOrdered the Pork BBQ set for lunch with Spicy Tofu soup and a Stir fry Squid. During lunch there's only 2 tables including ours, service was quite good they bbq for you and service were prompt. The pork were very ordinary not as good as others around the area. The Tofu soup, soup base was good, but I'm not a fan of frozen mixed seafood pack with tiny shrimps and clams, and the Spicy fried Squid were very disappointing too. I'm ok with frozen seafood, but not the kind of pre-cut seafood where it becomes rubbery after cooking, and that's exactly how the squid were like. Maybe I ordered all the wrong stuff from the menu, it looks like their specialty was fried chicken.\n\nA cozy place to have Korean food. This is my second time here as it is quite far to travel from the eastern part of Singapore. The Korean  ambience here to me is a plus. While the food here is not the kind that will blow you away, they are  decent. It\u2019s a place to eat and drink and chill.\n\nCame on a Friday night and the place was packed! Service was quite fast and they have free-flow chilled water. Food was not super amazing but it\u2019s a chill place with kpop videos playing in the bg!\n",

And let\u2019s talk about the food - absolutely delicious every single time! The raw prawn dish, in particular, is to die for.

Very attentive to your needs. Ambience very nice, feels like you are transported to a local eatery in Vietnam with the low tables and chairs. Vietnamese music in the play too .\n\nAuthentic Vietnamese cuisine, with authentic ambience too. Food is nice as expected. Tried the fried chicken wings, snail with spinach and beef pho. Will try other dishes next time when I come back again  :)\n\nStumbled into this restaurant on a Sunday and it was empty compared to the rest of its neighbours.\n\nWe ordered the BBQ meat dishes as recommended and asked for them to help us with the BBQ in the kitchen.\n\nPork was the best of the lot.\nThe premium beef was out of stock and we opted for the VN beef. It tasted like protein just not beef. It was coated with alot of sweet sauce and we could quite make out what meat it was.\n\nThe coke we ordered was flat and there wasn\u2019t and fizz left.\n\nWe packed some more food home.\nThe usual, Pho, spring rolls to continue out dinner as it was really stuffy and hot in the restaurant.\n\nStaff was friendly except a little forgetful.\nWe waited half an hour only to be informed they ran out of the dish we ordered.\n\nI have been a regular customer of the restaurant since a few years ago. And now also still a regular customer . It can be said that I will come once or twice a week. The food here is very suitable for my difficult palate. Especially the dish \"Cha Ca\". The fish is very fresh and sweet. Add dill and onions. Hanoi taste 100% . It is very difficult\nto find a restaurant in Singapore that makes such a authentic foods same here . Highly recommend it very much.\nThe service is also fast and attentive. Hope the business prospers.\nThey also have wine from a small and very beautiful city in Vietnam.

Service is average.\n\nNo frill Vietnamese food. The beef pho is fine but I prefer the beef more tender. Fried egg is ok. Fried Chicken and Kang kong too. But won\u2019t purposely visit again.\n\nA fantastic little place for a casual sunset dinner whilst in a riverside walk/bike ride. Food was delicious (great Smokey BBQ flavour on our meat, plenty of fresh veges and self serve condiments) at a reasonable price. Photos show the red bean smoothie, chicken bun and beef boon.

The portion sizes are unreasonably small and the overall quality of the food is low, with some ingredients missing. Based on my experience, I cannot recommend this place.\n\nI guess the good review could be the free 5 dollar return voucher. \ud83e\udd14\n\nTried the various dishes shown in picture, all were very good, fried spring roll were packed with meat, chicken was very tender, grilled pork is super delicious with the dry noodle. Everything that we tried taste good and the quantity is not bad too. Used eatigo discount and the whole meal was super worth it. Highly recommend this place and will surely be back!\n\nFood is decent with an interesting interior decor.\n\nHowever, as ironic as it is, despite being named after the dish, I'd always appreciated the diverse non-Pho menu options at the Rangoon Road branch. I'd believed that might have been the chain's strategy to Vietnamese food seeing as there isn't much more complexity to Vietnamese cuisine in Singapore aside from Pho and Banh Mi.\n\nThinking that was the standard across all Mrs Pho branches, I was a little disappointed to see that that menu at this branch was rather limited mostly to Pho and Banh Mi with limited other options.\n\nStill, the food was decent.\n\nFirst off, the food is mediocre or less. The pho soup was just salty and missing that deep brothy taste. The dry noodle were the same as you\u2019d find in any Kopitiam or Hawker\u2019s Centre. The drink cups were the size of kids drinks.. the cup is half the size of an iPhone. The only thing that tasted good was the fried spring rolls but they were very tiny as well.\n\nAlso, the place was empty (only us) even though we went during peak dinner hours.\n\nPho is good. Rather than giving another plate for the leaves and bean sprouts, they're already in the soup, which is a bit different from the western countries.

Long Phung offers a spread of delicious Vietnamese dishes at prices that won't break the bank.\n\nEvery dish is packed full of flavour. You'll be left craving for more. And as you're dining, let your cup of Vietnamese coffee slowly drip, and you can enjoy the robust beverage as a perfect finisher to your meal.\n\nSeating space is adequate, but do arrive early if you're looking to dine as the spaces fill up quite fast, especially on weekends.\n\nWe were out in the east and decided to try this place because there were a lot of good reviews. Seems like a pretty traditional Vietnamese menu. Food was good and you can tell it wasn\u2019t seasoned for foreigners\u2026it had very sublet but well balanced flavors. We loved all the sauces and the balance of crunch & soft textures. Our favorite was the fried spring rolls the flaky crust was so good it was addictive. The smoothies left a lot to be desired, they seem to be very skimpy on the fruit. Otherwise I love it that the food is also very light so you don\u2019t feel so stuffed at the end. We didn\u2019t get any noodle soup, maybe next time, but most people seem to have some sort of soup. We would definitely go back. The downside is the location (if you aren\u2019t close) but the price, value and quality are all top notch.\n\nMost of their dishes come with sweet sauce which  I like. Beef was okie, not very tender but their spring roll was good. Their crepe was special, inside got prawn and pork belly. I think they add coconut to the crepe\n\nPaid 23.22 for the meal. Food was decent, served very quickly.\n\nAll seems fresh. My spring rolls may have been sitting a while as all 4 pieces were stocked together. Tough texture for the skin. Ingredients were fine.\n\nOverall more of a good vibe. Maybe skip the ones I have ordered and get a pho or fish. Didn't satisfy my cravings.\n\nAuthentic Vietnamese food. Speedy service. Love the jellyfish salad, grilled squid, and beef stew. Banh Mi bread is exactly the same as those found in Vietnam. Returned twice in less than a week.

Got the meatball one. Bread was good warm, crispy on the outside, and soft on the inside, meat was so soft and tender and tasty!\n\nUpdate: I tried the beef banh mi and it was delicious! I still prefer the pork one though the beef was very tasty. The pork one has more sauce so it makes it less dry. The beef one isn\u2019t dry, it\u2019s just drier than the pork meatball one. Will try the fish next time I\u2019m there!\n\nForgot to take a photo of the chicken skewers - they were small. Considering the price you\u2019re paying, all of the dishes were small. That would be no issue if they were very tasty, but they are average or tasteless. The prices listed are not the final prices. They do not tell you that it does not include GST.

However, I found the food to be lacking in authenticity and taste. The spring roll skin was thick and dry, and the soup lacked the strong flavors I expected.\n\nOn the bright side, the service was commendable. One of the staff members noticed that the spring roll might be too big for my son to eat comfortably, so he kindly offered to cut it in half, showing good attentiveness to the customers.\n\nI ordered a vegetarian banh mi for takeaway. The bread was still crispy after the 20-min trip. The lemongrass tofu, sauteed mushrooms and pickled vegetables tasted nice. Wish there was a bit more toppings though as I'm more used to having my banh mi overflowing with ingredients. The staff was super friendly and nice even though I was there for just 10 seconds to pick up my order.\n\nNondescript Viet joint at the quiet UE square. Food was quite good though I felt my dish (dry rice noodle salad with lemongrass beef) should have more meat, there were too little beef slices. However, we liked the fried spring rolls and my husband enjoyed his chicken pho. A bit pricey (nearly $70) for 2 mains, an appetiser and 2 coconuts.\n\nVisited this place because I had a strong craving for bahn mi and happened to be in the area. Unfortunately, my craving was not satisfied.\n\nI wasn't a fan of their bahn mi. While it had some crispiness, I expected more, and the bread was a bit thicker than I prefer. I ordered the chicken flavour and I found the gravy to be on the sweeter side. They also used a generous amount of vegetables, and the taste of the veggies overwhelmed the overall flavour, which I didn't particularly enjoy.\n\nMy friend tried the beef pho, and it also left us with a rather average impression.\n\nWon\u2019t be returning here again.\n\nMoc Quan is a nice Vietnamese restaurant. The slice beef pho noodle is very smooth and tasty. Sliced beef is thin and easy to eat. The sauce is also on the spicy side.\n\nThe creme brulee has coffee taste. It's soft, not too sweet, as the sauce is bitter, but with the crystal sugar, the sweetness is just right.\n\nThe peanut sauce for Goi Cuon Is spicy. We requested for the peanut sauce to be without the chilli, and the staff were very nice to make it for us.\n\nOne of the staff is very kind to offer to refill our water at the end of the meal.\n\nIt was a pleasant experience.\n\nThey had outdoor seats too, which is good for those who do not want to be under aircon.\n\n\nOption: 7:\nName: Signs A Taste of Vietnam Pho\nAddress: 277 Orchard Rd, #B2-15, Singapore 238858\nPhone: 8685 4838\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20098:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20098:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20098:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20098:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20098:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20098:30\u202fPM\nSunday: Closed\n\nPrice Level: 1 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.7\nReviews: \n\nVery tasty pho, meat portion was slightly less than I'd have wanted (just perhaps 1 more slice of beef) but I finished the whole bowl including the soup which was very good.\n\nIt's located very near Somerset MRT but in a slightly inconspicuous spot.

Kris+ allowed here took with 6mpd earn rate.\n\nThis is my first time to this outlet at Rangoon Road, and I was told by my friends that this was one of the earlier outlets.\n\nI did not even know there was an outlet here at the end of Rangoon Road, where it was very quiet. It's not really accessible unless you drive.\n\nWe ordered the sliced beef pho and Hanoi sliced chicken pho as mains, and the fried spring rolls. Our friends ordered the fresh spring rolls as well, but they weren't really to our liking.\n\nThe fried spring rolls has minced meat and yam, packed fully, but the size of the spring rolls were tiny.\n\nThe sliced beer pho and the chicken pho were pretty decent, but that's also because I have actually never eaten really fantastic or bad pho. The good thing is the portion was quite big, so no lack of soup or ingredients.\n\nUnder staff for better services. Still give 4 stars for services. The team of 3 boys, make it work and still bring out great food.\n\nOne of the better Pho we ever had try from many other places.\n\nA place I frequent if I need a quick-fix for pho. Menu here has been revamped. Their regular pho, like it or not, comes with Japanese Wagyu. Tender and pricey. They have a \u201clight\u201d portion for smaller eaters \u2014 but my guess is to cater for folks used to their older menu (and prices)? You pay a bit less than before, but also get less to eat. Thankfully, their broth is still good. Now, do I need Wagyu in my pho? Not me. I think it is best kept on a grill. I love their wing bean, and its size has shrunk too. Seems like a trend\u2026 enough surprises for today. Service is nearly nonexistent. I thought their robot was more cheerful. They \u201cfeed you like family\u201d but sure don\u2019t treat you like one. Unfortunately. Finally, I think their toothpicks should be managed with more hygiene in mind (see photo).\n\nCame for lunch on Saturday afternoon. Not very crowded but notice a lot of delivery orders. The sturgeon in a hot plate was very nice and recommended. Also had the pork pancake which was crunchy but a little difficult to eat. In Vietnam it comes with a thin rice paper to roll up and easier to hold and eat. Also liked the salted lemonade and Vietnamese drip coffee.\n",

Very friendly staff,- quick service and very nice Singapore Sling. Super clean environment, good ambiance and price worthy. 5/5 will come back for sure.\n\nUnique experience eating middle eastern food. The food was great and there was quite a bit of variety. Also the staff were very friendly! It is a bit on the pricey side but it is still worth the experience.\n\nTried the set lunch ($28++) at Kazbar a while back! Had the Beef and Spinach Stew Set. The set lunch also came with a starter of homemade hummus and babaghanoush with pita bread.\n\nFood:\n- Hummus was smooth and creamy while the babaghanoush reminded me of a citrusy relish. My only gripe with the starter was that they didn't give more pita bread because the spreads were that good\n\n- The beef and spinach stew was a very comforting dish packed full of homely flavours. The beef was fairly tender and the spinach was really soft but for some reason I felt that there was too much spinach in the stew. Overall, the stew was well-seasoned and went quite well with the vermicelli rice\n\n- The salad was satisfactory but didn't particularly stand out\n\nService/Atmosphere:\n- This place is always crowded during lunchtime so high chance you need to make a reservation to get a table, especially if you're coming in a big group\n\n- Servers were really attentive and there were no problems with our food\n\n- Atmosphere felt warm and cozy, and was complemented by the fairly dim lighting\n\nOverall, a great experience. Will definitely be back again in the future!\n\nIf you like Hummus, this restaurant/pub has the best Hummus in Singapore \ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddec .\nJust order the big portion! You won't regret it.\n\nFor a person who doesn't like lamb, I'd like to share that this restaurant is the only one where I would not hesitate to order their lamb shanks!\n\nThe atmosphere is good for catching up with friends over a beer and a good Turkish meal.  A change from the usual type of dining places we locals normally go to. The friends I brought there thoroughly enjoyed the evening.\n\nThe staff are friendly and humorous.  It can get crowded Friday nights.  So go early!\n\nThey are open 6 days a week, closed on Sunday.\n\nSuper juicy and delicious kebab and loved the hummus and babaganoush too. The lunch special is good value for the quality and portion. Service was quick and helpful. Will definitely be back to try more.\n\n\nOption: 2:\nName: Pistachio Middle Eastern & Mediterranean Grill\nAddress: 501 Orchard Rd, #02-04/05 Wheelock Place, Singapore 238880\nPhone: 6262 6400\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.4\nReviews: \n\nI came to Singapore few weeks ago and was looking for Mediterranean restaurants. I stumbled upon this gorgeous place 5 minutes away from my hotel. I tried Kebabs on day one and man it was delicious. Atmosphere is great and all servers are friendly, specially three girls Urmi, Wendy and Fina are super nice, they make sure to get you a table quickly, take the order in timely manner and also make valuable suggestions on the menu. They always keep checking if everything is fine and customers are enjoying food. I loved the desert suggestion after eating my dinner. After first day I have been to this place 7-6 times and was always greeted with same service. I highly recommend this restaurant and will go again before I leave Singapore for USA.\n\nWe had the sultan's delight and mussels with garlic cream and cheese toast. The sultan's delight is really enjoyable. We could taste the smokiness from the eggplant puree and the lamb stew is really tender with tomato based sauce. It's tangy and smoky with some crunchiness from the pine nuts. Really enjoyable. But the mussel is pretty standard. It didn't taste really fresh but they're quite generous with the amount. The garlic cheese sauce is ok only.\nService was good and attentive.\n\nExcellent experience with vibrant dining experience. Food has great range of taste to excite the palate. Service is welcoming and top notch, they also gave a complimentary cake.\n\nVisited for my birthday meal with my family as I was craving some Mediterranean food and this place had great reviews. However, the whole experience ended up kinda disappointing - as I had high expectations too on my first visit.\n\nService:\n- It\u2019s a restaurant but I felt like there was not much service per say.\n- It\u2019s a pretty high price point but they don\u2019t serve complimentary water (charged at $3 a pot of hot water, or $11 for Evian water only)\n- Ordering isn\u2019t as fuss free as they try to make it. Online ordering only from mobile app, with just one physical menu at the door. Asked for any extra copies for easier viewing but none available. You also have to pay upfront in mobile order.\n- Feels like I visited a restaurant but received fast food style service.\n\nAtmosphere:\n- Overall atmosphere is okay. Like a typical restaurant\n\nFood:\n- Average, I\u2019ve had much better at other places for a similar price point.\n- Pita bread, spreads and kebab grills were okay.\n- Saffron rice & Briyani rice were disappointing. They use basmati rice which gave a nice texture. However, flavour is so subtle that I could barely taste the difference between the 2.\n\nSummary:\nWould I return? Definitely not! For the price point, the food and service didn\u2019t live up to expectations for a highly rated restaurant. Will continue on my hunt for yummy Mediterranean food!\n\nFirst time at this restaurant, and I can say the dining experience was great.\n\nFood is great and the serving is not bad as well.  I can only say good things about the service of the Staffs.\nThe place is easy to find and the ambience is something to remember.\n\n\nOption: 3:\nName: Tabbouleh Lebanese Restaurant\nAddress: 54 Bussorah St, Singapore 199470\nPhone: 6291 4100\nDelivery Available: Information Not Available\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.6\nReviews: \n\nEven though the restaurant is in quite a touristy location, the food is actually pretty good. One of the more popular restaurant along the pathway. Staff are friendly and helpful. Lovely place to be to watch people walk by while enjoying dinner. Parking is limited in the area though.\n\nFood is really great. Had a very nice dinner with family. The street sets the mood for good food.  Food felt authentic and very tasty. We had chicken Mandi, mixed grill and \"pizza\".\n\nPlace also has some good baklava.\n\nParking lot picture below.\n\nWhile initially heading for a different restaurant, at which we were repelled by the pushy staff / promoters, we headed down Arab Street to look for an alternative. Most of the other restaurants also had promoters out which tried to lure us in. The guys at Tabbouleh just let us check the menu first and then we asked for a table. Service generally was ok, we waited a bit to actually order, food did not take a very long time though. The atmosphere actually was quite nice, views on the mosque, night time street impressions with a table outside. The food was delicious, I normally don't like Hummus a lot, but here I liked it. It was well presented as well. In the end I got the feeling that despite the 10% service charge it was expected that we give additional tip, which was a bit strange hence the 3/5 for the service. We did like the tea at the very end which rounded up an otherwise nice dinner experience. Thank you very much.\n\nWe choose the restaurant because of its good reviews and as the staff was not at all intrusive as most of the other places in the area.\nWe shared a mixed appetizers plate, which was alright. Overall good, but also no particular highlights.\nThe iced lemon tea was perfect after an exhausting day.\nA plus was the free mint tea at the end, which we really appreciated.\nThe service could be more attentive, while the food was out quite fast. All in all a rather average experience.\n\nCozy al fresco location with a view of the mosque, serving great Lebanese food. While the kabab meats and lamb mandi could have a bit more salt, the rice was superb. Chicken however was overcooked and became too dry and hard. They also serve great baklava for desert or take-away. We were served also complimentary mint tea at the end of the meal. Nice.\n\n\nOption: 4:\nName: Beirut Grill\nAddress: 72 Bussorah St, Singapore 199485\nPhone: 9069 1925\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.2\nReviews: \n\nGood food and ambience.

The standout dish for me was the lamb; it had absolutely no odor and tasted fantastic. The grilled items were a highlight as well, bursting with delicious flavors. The restaurant\u2019s ambiance was beautifully decorated, and the staff was both charming and incredibly helpful, taking the time to explain the dishes to us. While it\u2019s not the cheapest option, the prices are fair for the quality you receive.\n\nOne thing to note, though, is that the platter we ordered was described as \u201cfor two,\u201d but for Asians, it\u2019s considered a generous portion. So, if there are four of you and you\u2019ve already ordered other dishes, I recommend going for the platter for two only; it\u2019s quite substantial. Would recommend to anyone looking for a great dining experience!\n\nFirst time having Turkish food and was really\npleasantly surprised. Their dips and bread was really exceptional. The bread was steaming when it came out it was both crispy and fluffy at the same time. The platter for 2 was also great all the grilled meats was tender and flavourful. Portion was also huge.\n\nVery impressive food & service displayed by the dedicated front staffs and chefs. It\u2019s nice walking in the street after a wine & dine session in the area. The staffs were very attentive, price is reasonable.\n\nVery delicious food with reasonable price.\nMy friend from Turkey said this is the only place with authentic Turkish food. My mom who is super picky about food said their food is good. Their dessert Kunefe is both crispy and creamy.\n\nThe staffs are friendly and knowledgeable. Will visit again.\n\nWent here for a birthday celebration and the attention to detail from their service staff is amazing, didn\u2019t mention to the staff that it was for a birthday celebration, only had a note in the reservation. But they went above and beyond, having candles in the dessert and even giving us props to take pictures with and proceeded to then print out the photo of us to keep!\n\nThe food also matches the service, authentic Turkish cuisine done perfectly, the Hummus was so good we had to order a second portion! I\u2019m not usually a fan of chicken but the chicken that came with the platter blew my mind, so juicy and tender. Then comes dessert, my first time having Kunefe and the only thing I have to say is that I wish I didn\u2019t share it, wanted it all to myself \ud83e\udd23\n\nDefinitely coming back here again!\n\n\nOption: 7:\nName: Cappadocia Turkish & Mediterranean Restaurant\nAddress: 69 Bussorah St, Singapore 199482\nPhone: 9677 9072\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.8\nReviews: \n\nHonestly, wasn\u2019t the most impressed with the service here at first, asked for order and the person simply said yes can continued doing his own stuff for 5minutes.\n\nHowever, when the food came, i didn\u2019t think too much about it afterwards.

But the experience was way better.\n\nThank you everyone at Cappadocia for helping make this day special for him.\n\n\nOption: 8:\nName: BYBLOS - Authentic Turkish & Lebanese cuisine\nAddress: 14 Bussorah St, Singapore 199435\nPhone: 6296 8577\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20091:00\u202fAM\nTuesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20091:00\u202fAM\nWednesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20091:00\u202fAM\nThursday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20091:00\u202fAM\nFriday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20091:00\u202fAM\nSaturday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20091:00\u202fAM\nSunday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20091:00\u202fAM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.5\nReviews: \n\nThe perfect place chosen for a birthday celebration!!\n\nFrom great service, to amazing ambience, to tasty food... everything was simply perfect!\n\nAwesome selection for both veg & non-veg menu!!\n\n2 thumbs up!\n\nThank you Byblos for making our evening beautiful!\n\nQuality food, ambience and excellent service from staff made the dinner special. Thanks to receptionist Mahiti for always giving a great smile to all guest. It definitely makes a difference.\n\nWe celebrated my brother's birthday here and had a great time. The restaurant is beautifully decorated with classic Turkish designs and really put us in the mood for their cuisine.\n\nWe ordered the mixed grilled platter to share and they portioned it for to the seven people in our party. The salads were fresh and the dessert was delicious. I highly recommend their kunfa as it's authentic, made fresh and absolutely scrumptious.\n\nMy only drawback was the warmth. There could have been better distribution of air-conditioning, other than that we had a swell time. I know there are many other restaurants in the area offering a similar experience but Byblos stands apart with class and authenticity.\n\nLOVE the food!!! Hot, freshly baked lavash bread, delectable and well seasoned kebabs, even the salads appealed to my picky 11 year old. Ambience was lovely, only downside was the music is a wee bit loud (I was sitting indoors), but the staff brought down the volume. Our plates were all cleaned out, clearly we enjoyed dinner at Byblos. Highly recommended!\n\nFood was very delicious, flavourful, and served decently quickly. Our first experience with Turkish food in Singapore and it was an extremely pleasant one. Our waiter was Hassan and the service was exceptional. He recommended different dishes and drinks to us and these were what we ordered: Hummus (served with Lavash), Cheese and Garlic Ekmek, Tabbouleh, Lamb Mandi, the Chef Special Tasty Kebab, Kunefe, and Mint tea. We initially felt that the Tabbouleh was too salty and Hassan helped us exchange for a less salty salad immediately without any extra charge. After the change, the salad was very refreshing and a flavour explosion on the tongue. Saffron rice with the Lamb mandi was incredible and the lamb was fall-off-the-bone tender. The Garlic taste in the ekmek was very intense and the Cheese paired well with the Ekmek, both Ekmeks best paired with the hummus. The mint tea was very light yet could cleanse our palettes well. The Kunefe is unique-tasting and quite heavy so best shared with other people. The degree of sweetness for the dessert because you add the syrup as you wish. We booked a table using the Eatigo discount so all alacarte dishes (excluding drinks) were half priced. Amazing deal.\n\n\nOption: 9:\nName: Istanbul Turkish & Middle Eastern Cuisine\nAddress: 25 Baghdad St, Singapore 199664\nPhone: 6296 4084\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.6\nReviews: \n\nFriendly staff\nFoods were delicious and well cooked\nFree complementary\nPrice was okay and worth to eat.\n\nIf you are coming Singapore don\u2019t hesitate to visit this restaurant.\n\nFood was really really good, it improved my mood to be even better.

Actually the joy of having tapas is that we can all try different dishes and share with friends and family- a very fun experience.\n\nThe decor and environment was cosy, with real bricks and European art collections like plates and mirrors from various sources, tastefully displayed to transport guests to another place..\n\nWould come again for a romantic dinner or family gathering, or just a chill evening with friends over yummy Spanish food\n\nA few years ago, I ate the paella with dishes made by Chef Edward. I visited today and ordered the paella that my son wanted to eat, but as shown in the photo, the bottom of the paella was too black and the texture of the rice was the result of cooking by a beginner, and the seafood all had a very fishy taste. There was no saffron scent, it was very salty and how much MSG was used... Even though I couldn't eat it all and left it behind, my tongue felt numb and it tasted like I was going to have a headache. There were only three tables including us, but the customers who arrived later than us were not served first, and when I asked to confirm our order, the waiter cut me off and replied that he would be back soon, which was also unpleasant. I visited again with delicious memories, but today I had such a terrible experience that I will never return. I hope you find your original intention and pay attention to the freshness of the ingredients. (For reference, the mussels I ate at My Little Spanish Place in Boat Quay, which I visited a month ago, were very fresh and delicious.)\n\nJune 2023\n\nFirst visit & the food quality was quite mundane really.The only bit that I enjoyed in the Paella were the prawns which were fresh and of decent size. Other dishes were middle of the road kind , not bad but certainly won\u2019t make you crave for more.\nComfortable ambience & helpful staff. A bit overpriced to be honest.\n\nNice food with a good ambiance. We love their seafood dishes. Even a vegetable-based has a special sauce to eat with it. We return here a few times for different occasions.\n\nSuper nice staff, but at this price point I'd expect more from the food. We ordered plenty and so could sample different things and there were some winners (the pan con tomate was fantastic), but there were too many that were disappointing. The gambas al ajillo, while sizable, had no heat in either sense of the word. The garlic bread was far too oily and some other dishes were over salted.\nFinally, and without wanting to sound like a lush, the glass of house red was ok but the volume provided was equivalent to what a sommelier would pour to let someone taste the wine.\n\n\nOption: 2:\nName: FOC Restaurant\nAddress: 40 Hongkong St, Singapore 059679\nPhone: 6100 4040\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: Closed\nTuesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 12:00\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nSaturday: 12:00\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nSunday: 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 3 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.5\nReviews: \n\nWe came here for our wedding anniversary and were absolutely impressed!

They have a really good variety of tapas that you can enjoy in a small group setting. Each tapas were unique with its own set of flavour and texture, teasing the palate, readying it for the main course. Squid ink paella has that sweetness from the squid ink and further enhanced by the fresh lemon. The octopus was cooked perfectly with balsamic vinaigrette and was not chewy at all. For dessert, the churros with chocolate sauce was a good way of ending the meal. Highly recommended place to visit.\n\nWe had the lunch sets here and we enjoyed all the dishes that we picked. The Spanish Appetizers and Smoked Salmon Salad are good, the Braised Beef Cheeks are so tender and juicy, the Grilled Halibut is delicious, and the desserts are refreshing. Service is good, except that there should have been a queuing system at the door before it opens for service. Everyone rushed to the host when the door was open at 12. It\u2019s rather messy.\n\nWe came on a Sunday around 1.30pm and had the set lunch. Portions were generous especially for the starters - we had the smoked salmon salad and scrambled eggs, which were tasty and well-balanced, the highlight of the meal. The grilled halibut and lamb rump mains were good. The lamb rump was well grilled if slightly gamey and accompanied with a delicious Proven\u00e7al vegetable side. Desserts were a nice note to end on but tiny in comparison to the previous courses. Service staff were quite busy throughout and could be hard to get their attention, but courses were served quickly after ordering. Very worth it with our 1-for-1 deal but on the pricey side otherwise.\n\nWine and Co Holland village used to be our go to tapas place but since their brilliant chef left we haven\u2019t been able to find a good tapas. Then we found this place and it will be our go to. Like most tapas places in Sg it\u2019s expensive but the quality of the food is excellent and our favourite dishes  were cooked to perfection and tasted just as they should be.\n\nThe staff were very polite and service was quick. It\u2019s a little dark away from the windows and a little noisy near the windows but if you\u2019re going for a quick lunch that doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s a little difficult to find.\n\nWe came here for dinner and the ambience was lovely. Overall the food was delicious and it exceeded my expectations, especially the dishes we ordered from the warm tapas section. However, service wasn't that great. I had ordered a mocktail but was charged and delivered a cocktail. We also wasn't informed that the wagyu steak was minimum 300g, which left a bitter taste that night. Although it was stated in the menu, it was still misleading to include $28/100g. If it was stated better ($84, additional $28 for 100g onwards) We would have just ordered a dish more value for money such as a lobster. Aside from that, everything was well executed and we would definitely come again another time.\n\n\nOption: 4:\nName: Binomio\nAddress: 20 Craig Rd, #01-02 Craig Place, Singapore 089692\nPhone: 6557 0547\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20091:45\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20091:45\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20091:45\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20091:45\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20091:45\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:00\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u20099:15\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 3 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.4\nReviews: \n\nFood was so good, full of flavour and depth.

Grilled potatoes are also great for sharing.\n\nThe crust of the pizza is different from those that you can usually find at the normal fast food chain.\n\nThe sea salt ice cream is amazing too \ud83d\ude0b\n\n\nOption: 6:\nName: Esquina\nAddress: 16 Jiak Chuan Rd, Singapore 089267\nPhone: 6222 1616\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: Closed\nTuesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nSunday: Closed\n\nPrice Level: 3 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.4\nReviews: \n\nHad dinner with the lads yesterday and it was a great time. We ordered each of the mains to be shared amongst us, tapas style. We also sampled some of the appetizers. All I can say is that we were blown away by each dish that came out. Whilst small, each dish was bursting with flavour!\n\nWe also took each of all the desserts and it was the perfect way to wrap up the evening.\n\nMy second time at Esquina, the last time was prob 2 years back. They are one of the few restaurants that still maintained the quality and consistency of the food. Still as good as I remembered and definitely one of the best Spanish restaurants in Singapore! All the dishes were amazing, couldn\u2019t find a fault.\nPrice is always steep at these restaurants ($167 for 2 pax), but definitely left the restaurant with my belly very full!\n\nVisited in Oct 2023\n\nFinally visited Esquina during the Singapore Restaurant week for the 8-course menu for $98++. Really well crafted menu which covered a wide variety of items across starters and mains. The octopus and pork main dishes were fantastic.\n\nService was decent.\n\nA definite recommendation and I myself hope to be back again soon.\n\nAlways been a place when you want simple delicious spanish tapas and that stands true after a decade. Menus has changed but their mission to deliver excellent food remains. We came for restaurant week and it was worth the return :)\n\nHad lunch with a good friend at this restaurant. Sat at counter and had the chance to see the team in action. Tried the following- 1 Prawn with sour dough. The olive oil was great with slice garlic. 2. Tuna tartar was very refreshing. 3. Sucrine lettuce grilled and dressed in green yoghurt and macadamia nuts. 4. Sliced grilled octopus tentacles.\nEverything was yummy, beautifully presented. I want to come back again soon.\n\n\nOption: 7:\nName: Tapas Club Orchard Central\nAddress: 181 Orchard Rd, #02-13 Orchard Central Singapore 238896\nPhone: 9060 4794\nDelivery Available: No\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4\nReviews: \n\nWas here for my friend's birthday. Nice Latin music and friendly staff. The food was a thumbs-up, especially the Squid Ink Paella is my fav. The cocktail is a must-to-order. I highly recommend this restaurant for any occasion.\n\nFirst time to try.  Nice ambience. One weekday lunch time, and it wasn't crowded. Minimal people dining in, but the service was still slow due to maybe short of manpower. Service lacks assertion.\n\nModerate selection of tapas. We ordered the set lunch and 1 classic tapas. Set lunch was priced as 19 ++ because you wouldn't get any set that would cost 19$. The minimum is 21 coz, as you can see on the menu, one main is 2$ additional cost the least.\n\nFood wise. All tasted nice. More of the salty side. Paella squid ink was good, salty. But the portion was so little.  Ham croquettes was good also. Iberico pork was good, salty also. The mashed potato was good. Everything we ordered was good for one person. A little pricey.\n\nFree water. And pickled olives.\n\nOverall, it's good to try.\n\nDinner having Mexican food and drinks and we tried the Tapas Club at Orchard central....it was good and just right. We ordered tapas green peppers, potato brava, squid fritters, pulled pork tacos and of course paella. The tapas are good and tasty. Paella are crisp but I would say I would ask them to make our paella more crispier at the bottom, chicken and other seafood are quite few, lucky the way they cook the rice is good so I forgot to count the meats and seafood. Dessert are the ones we really love and would come back for more, banana fritters and churros with chocolate dip.these you should try when you pass by and dine at Tapas Club. Drinks are OK,lots of wine varieties you could choose from.\n\nI want to share one good experience I have with a staff name Jenny at Orchard Central Outlet. Super accommodating and made us feel comfortable. Her service deserve to be recognised and praise. I think overall the staff did a great job to made us feel welcome. I would definitely come back again in the future :D.\n\nSeafood and chicken paella looks great but taste was disappointing\nThe garlic prawns and fried squid tapas were better. Also ordered the chocolate lava cake which did not live up to its standard. Service was fast tho and restaurant was not crowded on a sat noon.\n\n\nOption: 8:\nName: Tapas,24 Singapore\nAddress: 60 Robertson Quay, #01-04 The Quayside, Singapore 238252\nPhone: 6513 6810\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 5:00\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nTuesday: 5:00\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nWednesday: 5:00\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nThursday: 12:00\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nFriday: 12:00\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nSaturday: 12:00\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nSunday: 12:00\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.2\nReviews: \n\nSalut! I am so happy to chance upon this Spanish restaurant. I have walked past this place so many times and if it is not because of Google reviews, I wouldn\u2019t have known how good it is and stepped in. This place feels so welcoming with its warm, chic airy interior, and soothing Spanish music that fills the air. I came here specially for the chef special grilled octopus (octopus con alubias blancas y piment\u00f3n), that really paired perfectly with Cava. I wish they have a wine dinner featuring specially curated Spanish wine and their food. Will definitely be back here.\n\nUpdate: and we are back again to try their Jamon Iberico, Gambas Al Ajillo, and of course the Churros. Delicious.\n\nDrinks were very affordable. Food is ok. Pork was under seasoned. Chorizo had not much taste. Roasted eggplant and clams were good. Tomato bread was soggy. Service ok. Most staff were helpful and friendly.\n\nWe decided to try this place after hearing so much about it and it didn\u2019t disappoint. The food was great, with adequate size per portion to match the pricing \ud83d\ude07\n\nWe especially enjoyed the tortilla, bikini sandwich and the tomato pur\u00e9e soup. Had lots of cava to accompany the meal too \ud83d\ude0a\n\nCame here to celebrate one of my friend's birthday - we made a reservation beforehand. The restaurant had ample seating both on the outside and the inside. When we arrived, it was quite crowded but not too noisy although it was a Saturday night. The menu (see pics) was rather extensive for both food and drinks. Food had a good mixture of starters, sharing and individual main courses. They also had a small kid's section on the menu for those who have kids. They also have pork-free options for Muslims, which was great! We ordered 3 starters and 1 sharing dish (there were 3 of us). One thing to note: the portions for starters here aren't too big, so if you are expecting something bigger, you would be disappointed. They came rather fast, but the issue was that the paella (sharing dish) took almost 45 mins to an hour to prepare - although they said on the menu that it would take 30 mins tops.\n\nAlthough it did take quite long and we were starving at that point of time, what made the entire experience bearable was the waitress serving us. We didn't catch her name but she was super personable and bubbly, entertaining our every demand by giving us recommendations, smiling and being genuine and even telling us that we could get a free birthday dessert if we signed up for their membership on the spot, which we would have missed out if she did not tell us. She also kept apologising for the long wait, which honestly wasn't her fault so she didn't need to at all!\n\nAll in all, we spent about 2 hours there (half the time was spent waiting and chatting). The food was decent and average, the environment was fine too but the professionalism of the serving staff was really what made it all worthwhile.\n\nFrom the moment we sat down, our server, Bella, has charmed us with the best service and recommendations.\n\nAll her recommendations were on point, especially shout out to the clams dish (super juicy and fat clams) and the $10+ Happy Hour Tapas with small platter of best tapas.\n\nWe really want to compliment Bella and hope this review gives her the recognition for her great and upbeat attitude for the entire evening. \ud83c\udf89\n\n\nOption: 9:\nName: TINTO Spanish Restaurant Sg\nAddress: 10 Dempsey Rd, #01-21, Singapore 247700\nPhone: 9729 5002\nDelivery Available: Information Not Available\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.5\nReviews: \n\nFood quality was top notch and every dish was amazingly yummy and delicious! Definitely one of the top Spanish restaurants in Singapore!\n\nOnly 3 areas of improvement:\n- to have more cocktail options, they had way too many wine options.\n- it was relatively noisy at the courtyard, might be the infrastructure or design of the restaurant where the noise keeps bouncing back.\n- should have cleared the plates on the table before serving the new dish, and not get customers to help hold the plates while they are serving.\n\nIt's a 4.5 stars for me personally.\n\nMy 7 y/o daughter and I enjoyed our dinner with TINTO. The service was impeccable - our server was attentive and patient with us, explaining the dishes as they were served.\n\nThe Gambas (prawn) starter was excellent and our favorite! The Grilled Asparagus was great, and we appreciated that it wasn't too salty. The Grilled Squid and Chorizo Paella didn't disappoint, albeit the serving was smaller than I expected.\n\nAll in all, a lovely experience and a small notch above Tapas Club.\n\nPretty good Spanish option in the Dempsey enclave! The gambas is quite possibly the best I\u2019ve had in SG and honestly wish I did not have to share that at all. Paella also very decent and tasty. The only letdown we had was the churros that we ordered, when it arrived it was cold and not at all enjoyable. Ambience is alright, they have a pretty courtyard but the main restaurant is very noisy. Service was a bit slow but still alright.\n\nReally liked this place: Elegant, but still relaxed atmosphere, attentive service. The person who seems to be the restaurant manager is indeed checking that everything is taken care of. I also appreciate that, at the beginning, they ask what type of water you like, including warm and ice water. This is a lovely attention to detail.\nThey have a full vegetarian menu with creative and interesting dishes - I want to come back to try more of these. Also very good Spanish wine options.\nThis would be a definite 5 stars if not for the below:\n1) At our table, we had one starter and two mains. One of the mains was paella, which takes time to prepare (it's called out in the menu). They brought the other main so early, that one person at the table was pretty much done with the food when the paella arrived.\n2) the vegetarian dish of the grilled gem lettuce was really nice, especially the chimichurri. Great use of herbs and flavours. Unfortunately, it was quite oily, which made it very heavy. A less oily preparation would have been great.\n\nPS: The restaurant was full when we were there. For privacy reasons, I edited the other diners - but it certainly wasn't empty.\n\nParty of 4...we came here for a birthday celebration. First impressions upon entering the restaurant exuded positive vibes - ambience, decor, welcoming crew. We were led to the inner section which was very cosy and inviting... I knew a great night was in store. Great menu and price points. We were attended to by the inimitable Ara who made the evening very enjoyable. The recommendations were on point. Food was fabulous.

More or less always packed. Made reservations and was given the outdoor seating close to the waters. Crab croquette was heavenly albeit a bit small portioned. Patatas bravas was great too with a super addictive sauce! Would have given 5 stars if the paella did not fall short. Have tried better elsewhere, the flavours were simply not the best.\n\nGood spot for sipping wine and chilling.\nThe ham platter was my favourite, each type has a different fat and saltiness level which is very enjoyable with bread. The other tapas were just ok. The steak (not in photo) is a bit underwhelming as well. What pulled the rating back up is the wine and the service - the sommelier really knows his thing.\n\nUpdate: Bumping up my rating because of a better experience the second time around. The iberico pork had such a good flavour profile. Meanwhile, the bone marrow is so sinful, yet almost worth all that cholesterol. I'd skip the churros, a little too oily, a little too crispy, and not enough chew on the inside.\n\nFantastic food, so much choice! We got 3 tapas each and struggled to finish them all. Seated by the waterfront with stunning night time views, just fab! Service was great, food came out very fast and the servers were very helpful and friendly - highly recommend!\n\nGood location and quite easy to get to.\nAs the name of the place suggest this is a Spanish restaurant so is all the food and majority of the wine selection.\n\nThe food was good and the wine selection is nice. Paella was huge.\n\nService was okay and the place does get busy.\n\nIf you looking for Spanish cuisine this could be a good choice\n\nWe went to Boat Q outlet and it is not spacious place and very packed with customers.\nThe food we ordered we enjoyed except the squid rice not up to our expectation. And the price for what we ordered for 3 of us at 288++ would say very expensive and unexpected. Could use this money for even better deal food. But it is an experience!\n",

We meant to go to the restaurant next door but they were closed. We came in here on a whim. The food is amazing. My friend had the goat curry. I had the fish curry. Both were spicy but flavorful. The plantain chips are hot and crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. The coffee was amazing, presentation and taste.\n\nWe had a wonderful dining experience at this restaurant. The standout feature was their incredibly welcoming, friendly, and attentive service. The staff patiently recommended dishes and even showed photos of them when we needed assistance.\n\nWe ordered the peanut chicken stew and goat curry, both of which were absolutely delightful. The flavors were well-balanced with just the right amount of spice and heat, and there was no gamy taste from the goat meat.\n\nThe cocktails were also a hit, and the evening was rounded off with delicious desserts. The overall ambiance was cozy and inviting, making it a perfect setting for a memorable evening.\n\nWe'll definitely be returning, and I can wholeheartedly recommend this restaurant to friends. It's a gem worth visiting again and again.\n\nWent there for dinner and I had cauliflower and buttermilk fried chicken for starters and the portion is pretty generous. Absolutely love both of it. Got the fish curry too and it was amazing tho pretty spicy. However we didn't enjoy the Malindi Halwa dessert so much with it's jelly-like texture. Service is really top notch as they were always attentive.\n\nIt\u2019s my first time trying Africa\u2019s cuisine, and I\u2019m pleasantly impressed with the food.\n\nWe ordered a variety of curry based dishes, with different level of spiciness - and we enjoyed all of them.\n\nHighly recommended the Goat Curry, where in our opinion is the best one there.\n\nGreat ambience and fantastic customer service from the staff. Our waiter spent time to recommend us the dishes. The food is definitely on the pricier side and it felt that it might have been adjusted so much to suit the local palate that the food does not feel uniquely african. When the food tastes very similar to local dishes, it does not really justify the high price.\n",

Little things like offering to cut the cake we brought for a birthday celebration, asking if we wanted to pack the leftovers before we even had to ask, random staff actually looking over to smile and say goodbye while we were walking out after dinner, and that old school culture of staff treating customers like family is something we don't encounter much anymore these days...\n\nFood is perfectly done classic Cantonese food.

We got one of the chefs menus instead. My favorite was the chili prawns and my least favorite was the fried rice, it just wasn't anything special compared to the other dishes.\n\nService was great and they even set up a kids place setting for our baby, which was sweet, even though he is much too young for solid foods.\n\nThe food was mediocre at best, but the service was good. We made a reservation for seven beforehand, yet the table we were assigned was extremely small, could not even fit the dishes we ordered.\n\nCompared to other Chinese restaurants in this price bracket, such as those at the Ritz Carlton and Hilton, this dining experience left much to be desired.\n\nBBQ Meat Combination 2/5\nSteamed Star Groupa 2.5/5\nPeking Duck 3/5\nSweet and Sour Pork 4/5\nStir fried Kai Lan 1/5\n\nOne of the best Peking ducks ever! Please note that all other dishes, despite the high price, are portions for one pax only.\n\nVery expensive but worth the Michelin star!\n\nFantastic restaurant, small portion but really great. I would say, \u70e7\u814a is the best!!!!!!! Highly recommended for family gathering or special occasions.\n\nPeking Duck was the highlight here. Level up with a touch of caviar. The duck here is more lean and crisp but I do think a little of fat adds to the flavour. Still good nonetheless.\n\nHad a soup (meh, especially for that price) and a Soft Shell Crab with Crab Meat (which was yums, creamy but not to the point of being jelak, guess it helped that we shared instead of having 1 each) and a refreshing petite fours of Osmanthus Jelly and Pineapple Tart.\n\nThe complimentary birthday cake was delish too, reminded much of Ritz's Royal Caraibe from 20 years back. Dark bittersweet choc mousse on a layer of caramelised crunch. Service was top notch, attentive yet but imposing, always there but invisibly.\n\n\nOption: 4:\nName: Summer Pavilion\nAddress: 7 Raffles Ave., Singapore 039799\nPhone: 6434 5286\nDelivery Available: Information Not Available\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 4 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.6\nReviews: \n\nThe staff is AMAZING! Our waiter took special care to ensure that we had really nice pictures for the \"birthday cake shot\".\n\nThe food was nice, but nothing too special.\n\nI would go back for the service and ambience alone.\n\nWent there for lunch for the first time. We had orchid lunch set. Especially love the soup, the smoked duck and the lobster rice/fish noodles. We didn't get to take any photo so just find some photos online to show some of the best dishes we had.\nYes it's pricey, but it's worth the money.\n\nGreat food and good service. There were just 2 of us and the restaurant was able to adjust the dim sum portion to 2 pieces each so that we could try more variety. Love that flexibility!\n\nGood ambiance with impressive crockery that have beautiful black brush ink paintings of flowers. Each diner was served your individual bowl of fried cashew nuts as appetisers instead of communal serving in most Chinese restaurants. Nice touch!\n\nWe had steamed live prawns that were served with very fine strips of ginger, scallions and chilli in a light sauce for dipping. A silver finger bowl with a lemon slice was provided. Nice touch!\n\nIngredients used in Sze Chuan Styled Stewed Sea Cucumber Fish Maw and Braised Bean Curd Bamboo Pith were fresh and good quality. However the flavours of both were not memorable and the gravy for the beancurd had too much cornstarch.\n\nFried Rice Crab Meat with Dried Scallops was full of \"wok hei\". The only dish that left a good impression.\n\nGood hospitality for there is no charge for warm water.\n\nI was here on a weekday afternoon (prior reservation is recommended). The place quickly got crowded at around 1pm, mostly with business folks who presumably were there for lunch meetings.\n\nExcellent place for dim sum. The food isn't cheap here, but what you get in return is high-quality food, in fact the best dim sums in town, and excellent service.\n\n\nOption: 5:\nName: Song Garden Chinese Restaurant\nAddress: 122 Middle Rd, Level 2 Mercure Singapore Bugis, Singapore 188973\nPhone: 6521 9299\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.3\nReviews: \n\nThe food quality is overall average. Lobster soup is rich in taste but the serving of the lobster is under expectation. In fact most of the dishes portion is relatively small for that price range.\n\nService experience is also under expectation. We sat at a place with a blind spot and the service staff are not attentive to our request. I have to walk to the counter for help. Suggest to provide some electronic buzzing system if the restaurant has under staff to serve the customer.\n\nCame across this place via Google search.\nSuppose to come here for DimSum. But only available in the afternoon.\nBut we still decided to stay for dinner.\n\nFood is not bad, very well presented. Taste is pretty ok especially the chicken and the laksa prawn.\n\nBut when comes to the service by the restaurant staff, I gotta give them a lower rating. It certainly under expectations.\n\nFirstly, they are not welcoming at all when we were at the counter waiting to be seated.\n\nSecondly, the waiter is not attentive. They have no smile at all (which is important in service line).\nWhen we request for tea or request him to add hot water, he just came and grab the teapot and go off with super monotonous attitude. When we say thank you, the staff don't even response at all (basically like a robot).\n\nTherefore, I don't think we will come back again. The food is ok but definitely not the best compare to the same level restaurant elsewhere. Also the service staff and their attitude didn't impress us despite the restaurant is not busy at all (only 3 tables including our table).\n\nCame for lunch, excellent staff service and quality food. Recommend to come \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\n\nThe food and atmosphere was good but one of the staff had a really bad attitude and kept showing us black face. One other staff was very friendly so I'll rate it as 4 stars. Maybe the first staff had a bad day \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nCosy environment. Great for family gartherings. Dimsum.

It is situated on the 5th floor of a shopping mall and closes at 10pm. Last order is at 9.30pm.\n\nWe shared a starter of crispy crab and prawn rolls. They came separately wrapped with red and green sauce.\n\nI had a lamb rack (one lamb cutlet to be precise) on a bed of potato and vegetables. My husband had braised sliced duck for one person with steamed rice. The food was nice and the service was quick. The plates were not hot, so the food became cold very quickly.\n\nThe wine is expensive, but always is in Singapore. More cost effective to buy a bottle.\n\nThe chrysanthemum and jasmine tea was nice.\n\nI had always wanted to try this restaurant. But it\u2019s always skipped my mind when I\u2019m at paragon due it\u2019s located at level 5.\n\nSo this time round, I\u2019m very focus to go to this restaurant with the purposeful trip down to paragon.\n\nAs much as I\u2019m excited and anticipated for this restaurant, it starts to turn me off little by little as i walked in, when we\u2019re seated to our table, we could smell a strong damp and moldy stench arising from their carpet floor\u2026 this is a killer for our dining experience in there.\n\nApart from that, the food definitely still maintain its Michelin standard (though the Michelin was no longer accredited in 2023), also we like the \u201cold\u201d staffs working there, the service from the traditional Chinese restaurant where you can experience, they know their stuffs, and they do know how to talk to customers. Had a great chat with the staff as well.\n\nI guess the restaurant really need to upgrade n change their carpet.\n\nFood was okay, nothing too grand or special. Of all the dishes we got, I would only highly recommend the sweet, sour and crispy fried mushrooms. The kangkong was good.\n\nServers were very attentive and helpful with the recommendations. Although as a tourist, we didn\u2019t know that every refill of our tea would be charged and they kept refilling without us asking them to - ended up paying $20 for hot water refills.\n\nAtmosphere was okay also, walkway going inside the restaurant gave it a good vibe.\n\nNice place to have dimsum with families ablnd friend inside Paragon mall. Many choices of dimsum. It is not a big restaurant but a very nice decoration. It was in the Michelin guide. The restaurant was not busy when we arrived. The service is good and workers are friendly.  It serves typical dimsum dishes like other dimsum restaurants. It also  serves regular chinese dishes.  We order multiple dimsum dishes, and foods are delicious. If you order lo mai kai, it will take about 20 minutes  to prepare. Other dimsum items were ready pretty quickly. I like the chicken feet. It is better than the one we have in the States.  It was soft and tastes so good. Other dimsums items are good too but not like wow.  Overall I like this restaurant and the service.\n\nExtended family dinner to welcome back our nephew and niece who are studying in UK, back to Singapore on summer break. The food was great and service was good, prompt, attentive and friendly.

The rice is fluffy and well cooked.. almost like fried rice with individual grains.. and the mutton curry is succulent and soft to the bite, with very deep indian smell and taste to the curry sauce. Worth all the $5.50 paid for it\n\nCheap and nice crab promotion. $38.80 for 3 crab with any flavour really worth the price. But Asam fish taste not that fresh and some vege got bitter and sour taste like not that fresh. However, it is still worth going if promotion still valid.\n\nNow there is promotion on for new zichar restaurant. (1) One whole fish for only S$18. (2) Indian curry chicken $4.50, if add egg and vegetable, it becomes a set at S$5.\n\nOnline but no response for whole day, after saying can order we placed order and pickup time. We already on the way to pickup since there was no response, after spam call for few times 6pm+ pickup call say crabs smelly not selling say order cancelled.\n\nOrder since 11am confirmed already, no responses no reply. Best part, WhatsApp was ONLINE ALL THE TIME. Absolutely disgusting service, no apologies aftermath and not remorseful through phone convo. NOT RECOMMENDED!!!\n\nI went to the place on a Saturday at 615pm. There was only one other table of diners then. The place got really crowded after 7pm. There was only one waiter serving everyone so service is kinda slow. Food is on the saltier side but still very delicious. Strongly recommend their black pepper crab.

I highly recommend the mussels as I single handedly polished the entire bowl. Great buzzing atmosphere too for a Friday night!\n\nExtremely friendly staff and good service. Grilled Cod Fish is a must try, suoer tasty, juicy and fresh!\nMango mustard salad taste weird to me (maybe just I don't like it) but overall its a good experience!\n\nHave been to Coriander Leaf a few times and most recently again with my husband. Food was great, in fact even better than we remembered! We ordered the duck curry, the garlic naan (best naan we ever had), miso cod and spicy eggplant, and ended with the spiced lava cake. We had a delightful meal, and highly recommend the combination of the red curry and the garlic naan, it's a flavour explosion! We will be back :)\n\nGreat food with vegetarian, vegan and gluten-free options. The dishes are Asian / Middle Eastern inspired, and very flavorful with spices and herbs.\nIt's great for diverse groups: There is no pork / lard used in the premises, and the meat is halal. They do serve alcohol (therefore, the restaurant is not halal-certified), so it really covers a large range of preferences.\nService is excellent:; Very attentive and efficient, and food orders arrive fast.\nSpecial callout: I was there with a larger group. We could pre-order dishes via WhatsApp (quick and easy). The dishes were served sharing style. This was super efficient (no time spent on lengthy ordering process) and allowed everyone to sample very diverse flavors.\n\nOverall, it was a good experience. Some food like the lamb was very good, but the stingray was not fresh. Naan was very good,served hot, and freshly made. Each serving per dish was small, good for 2 pax. Wide varieties of asian food to select from.\n\n\nOption: 9:\nName: Xiao Ya Tou\nAddress: 6 Duxton Hill, #01-01, Singapore 089592\nPhone: 6226 1965\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 3 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.4\nReviews: \n\nGreat place to catch with friends over delicious food and drinks.\n\nThe menu never fails to impress with the Asian twists. Huge variety of drinks as well.\n\nGreat team to provide a great experience here, and always a fabulous visit.\n\nFor 6 pax, we had the crispy crab omelette, truffle roast duck, spicy brussel sprouts, wok-fried wagyu hor fun, XYT hokkien mee, kurobuta char siew. The food was surprisingly good! My personal favourites were the truffle duck and brussel sprouts.\n\nOverall a cosy and interesting bar to dine and chill with friends!\n\nWent on a rainy Thursday night 7pm. There were empty seats & mostly are foreigners. Made a reservation for 5 persons. We sat behind & it\u2019s really dark there. We had to keep turning on our Hp flash light. Service & Atmosphere is very good. Staffs are friendly & restaurant decorations are retro vibes & pretty. Even the utensil they used are pretty. Food portions are small so it\u2019s actually quite expensive. Taste is unique & not bad but I don\u2019t really think it\u2019s fantastic till it\u2019s worth the pricing. We paid over $300+. We had a Yakult cocktail @ $48 for 3 pax, coconut lime mocktail & ice dirty chai latte (couldn\u2019t taste the chai taste) at $10 each.\n\nLobster kueh pie tee taste good. Ugly broccolini is deep fried till very crispy, not to my liking.. Crab fried rice is tasty as it\u2019s fried with XO sauce. Crispy Squid is not bad but the wilted kale is deep fried also so it\u2019s crispy too. It doesn\u2019t taste like veggies. Crispy crab omelette with the Singapore chilli dip had a tinge of Assam taste. Truffle roast duck is good, skin is crispy. But truffle smell & taste is not obvious enough. Crispy tofu is small portioned, it goes well with the Salty black pepper sauce.\n\nLastly is the xinjiang style Lamb ribs. We were suggested to order 2 portions since we had 5 person..  For 1 of the plate, whole ribs is totally fats & no meat. Every bite I took i thought I will at least ate the meat part but too bad it\u2019s totally fats. End up i felt so nauseous & my stomach rumbles so badly that i threw up when I reaches home. It\u2019s is the smell of the Lamb ribs \ud83d\ude22\u2026\n\nKind of anticipated the meal here so was a little disappointed.. Also understand why it\u2019s mostly foreigners since it might felt like fushion Tze char. But I really appreciate their good service.\n\nHands down one of my top 3 places in Singapore.\nThe style of the place is so laid back and the staff is very nice.\n\nDrinks and food are out of this world and of outstanding quality.\n\nCome here, have a good time and drink a Soju Bomb!\n\nCosy little restaurant with a nostalgic atmosphere with good food. The kurobuta char siew was fatty and yummy. The fried chicken wings were not bad and the duck was good too but not much truffle taste.\n\nThey also have a good selection of cocktails and we had fun with the menu and drink selection.\n\n\nOption: 10:\nName: ThaiPan Restaurant\nAddress: 175 Albert St, #01-02 Inside iBis Styles Singapore Albert Hotel, Singapore 189970\nPhone: 8869 4272\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 7:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fAM, 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 7:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fAM, 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 7:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fAM, 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 7:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fAM, 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 7:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fAM, 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 7:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fAM, 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 7:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fAM, 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.2\nReviews: \n\nHeard about this establishment from friends who lived near Mandarin Gardens, decided to order out on a Saturday afternoon. It was pretty quiet on a Saturday post-lunch afternoon, and I was attended to promptly.\n\nThe staff who took my order was conscientious and meticulous. She made sure to present the signature dishes as well as repeated my orders to confirm them. She was also helpful in making sure that I could come back after the food is prepared as I had to run a short errand around the area.\n\nI ordered the small portions of the following: Jing Du pork, tofu with chicken floss, butter squid. The olive rice was available in a standard size.\n\nThe family was not impressed with the food, the pork had a sweet vinegary flavour and was quite tough, the tofu with chicken floss was decent, but nothing to rave about. The butter squid was quite mushy, perhaps it was better to have it on-site? The olive rice had wok hei but barely any other flavours.\n\nWas quite disappointed, perhaps due to the hype from the previous reviews. Probably won't be heading back for the food, despite the excellent service. Will also be sharing my disappointment with my friends at Mandarin Gardens.\n\nGood service from the restaurant staff. I liked the foods here especially the olive fried rice, \u4eac\u90fd\u6392\u9aa8 and butter squid. The food quality is great and consistent. I dined in during lunch time and really enjoyed the quiet atmosphere here with great food.\n\nWe dropped by on a Wednesday and got the Butter Squid at 50% off. Also tried the Jing Du Pork and Fried Hong Kong Noodles, all of which were yummy. Ambience was quiet and peaceful, service staff was attentive.\n\nWill be back here again!\n\nI had a great experience at Thaipan on 24 Mar 2023. I went there for my ROM lunch and it was superb! The food was really yummy and the service was good. The staff were very polite and both my families were very pleased with the food presentation and taste! Their yam ring and fried salted egg prawn ball along with their fish were all cooked excellently! When I reserved the place and informed that it was for my ROM lunch, they specifically bought fresh flowers for the table. I would recommend this place as the price point is good too! (Attached photos of yam ring and cereal chicken)\n\nWow! My wife and I hosted a dinner for 13pax. The boss Mrs Wong curated a 10 course dinner for us that was absolutely amazing!\n\nYou have to try their famous curry fish! We opted for the tail as there is more meat, but this dish you have to order before hand!\n\nThe ambience now is quiet as this 20 year old brand just moved here 1year ago.\n\nMrs Wong stopped the business for a while as she had a bad fall, but now she is well and she's back!\n\nHer team is dedicated and friendly, service was wonderful!\n\nThere's parking in the IBIS Styles Bugis hotel and around the vicinity, there is even a durian stall across the small road, so a great place for tourist to try out local cuisine and have durian(if you are in the durian season)\n\nHighly reccomended!\n",

The waiters rushed through explanations of their dishes. And while they tried to entertain our questions about the dishes, the way that they did it was quite cursory and generally seemed quite reluctant to hold a conversation.\n\nMy first 3 star Michelin experience. I found the service a little stiff, as the evening progressed the staff loosened up a bit which was nice, everything was so extra, the presentation of the food was so interesting and exciting. The food was good but I can probably tick off this experience. Make sure you like seafood! A once and a lifetime experience!\nIt was pretty cool we got to meet the chefs after.\n\nI certainly had very high expectations of Odette, it having 3 Michelin stars and being #14 in The World's 50 Best Restaurants list at the time of the visit (november 2023).\n\nWell, fame is definitely not everything! From start to finish, what lacked was soul and personality, and the whole experience made me think reputation by terms of media and rankings might be increasingly decadent.\n\nTo start off, we were offered a small and uncomfortable-looking table right by the entrance door, even though I had reserved a table in the Private Dining Room over a month prior. We had to insist on being placed in the intended room.\n\nThe whole time, it felt like we were doing the restaurant a favor being there and I could sense so much pretentiousness in service, food and ambiance. The flavor and even the high quality ingredients were shadowed by this and the gimmicky presentations of the food.\n\nAt a USD 500/SGD 700 price point per person (without wine pairing), I most definitely cannot recommend\u00a0Odette to anyone.\n\nWhat a lovely and delicious evening out in Singapore. Service was what you would expect from a 3* establishments. All the dishes, from the butter to the pigeon, were out of this world. The staff was well orchestrated and did a great job of providing information on each dish and engaging us in conversation throughout the evening. Having been fortunate enough to dine at other 2 & 3* restaurants around the globe I would put this in my top 3 in a very close race with Mudec in Milan for number 1 and edging out French Laundry in terms of the menu. I will definitely try to secure another reservation next time I'm in Singapore.\n\nOdette has always been on my to-try list and this year I was treated to a birthday dinner here!\n\nAn amazing French experience savoring the 7-course meal. We were totally impressed by the presentation as well as the flavour of each dish. Not to mention the excellent and attentive service by the crew! It was also nice of them to gift a bottle of strawberry jam for every guest.\n\nAn unforgettable meal, or rather gourmet journey at this 3-starred michelin.\n\n\nOption: 2:\nName: Whitegrass Restaurant\nAddress: 30 Victoria St, #01-26/27 CHIJMES, Singapore 187996\nPhone: 6837 0402\nDelivery Available: No\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: Closed\nTuesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSunday: Closed\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.7\nReviews: \n\nOur first time here. The service was hospitable and genuine, no pretense despite being a Michelin-starred restaurant. Alex and Kim were friendly and was impeccable in their service. Food was amazing with unique combinations of fresh ingredients. Chef also came over to each table to interact which we felt was an awesome touch. Strongly recommended!\n\nWell deserved Michelin Restaurants.\nThe bread is so crispy on the outside and so so so soft on the inside. Pairing with the bordier butter, it is really exceptional.\nEvery dish of the food is amazing.\n\nThe service is so good. When the table is full of crumbs, the waiter will clean it up to sweep away the crumbs. The waiter are also friendly and knowledgeable about the dishes.\nWhen we found a bone in the fish and the chef came out to apologize. Felt the service was so good.\n\nThe atmosphere in the round room felt great too.\n\nOne of the best fine dining places I\u2019ve ever been to! I can\u2019t keep track of what was being served because there was just so many different courses, but each course was really tasty \ud83e\udd70 I don\u2019t think I\u2019m a small eater but I was so full by the last few courses, I don\u2019t think I ate any at all. Remember to pace yourself. I\u2019m most impressed by their bakes; their toasty black sesame bread was literally the best bread I\u2019ve ever had in my life.\n\nWhite Grass is a hidden gem, providing a distinctive dining venture with its fusion of Japanese and European flavors.\n\nEach dish is delectable, especially the bread, pastries, and desserts rank the finest that I ever tasted.\n\nThe real flower centerpiece adds a pleasant fragrance, and the stylish decor contributes to the overall charm, making it an excellent option for couples and hosting friends.\n\nOn my second visit, I can confidently say they consistently exceed my expectations.\n\nVery good ambience and attentive service. The bread is crispy outside and moist inside. Sesame bread is delicious too. Abalone is well done combined with the sauce and texture. The lobster meat is too soft for our liking. Everything is fine but no distinctive wow factor.\n\n\nOption: 3:\nName: Alma by Juan Amador\nAddress: 22 Scotts Rd, Singapore 228221\nPhone: 6735 9937\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: Closed\nTuesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSunday: Closed\n\nPrice Level: 4 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.6\nReviews: \n\nNice environment and friendly staff.\nAnd the food is great!\n\nIt\u2019s my honour to have an opportunity to try the New Menu.

They were happy to accommodate vegetarian food for the prix fixe menu, which is great value. The signature tofu with black truffle was sublime, as were the Japanese tomatoes with tomato sorbet. The amuse bouche of tomato with a sour plum film was another delight.\n\nIt's a nice space too, with a beautifully designed interior and a superb selection of wines and in particular rare whiskies.\n\nThis one's going on our repeat visit list for sure!\n\n\nOption: 4:\nName: Iggy's\nAddress: 581 Orchard Rd, Level 3 voco Orchard Singapore, an IHG Hotel, Singapore 238883\nPhone: 6732 2234\nDelivery Available: No\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: Closed\nTuesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20091:30\u202fPM, 6:30\u2009\u2013\u20098:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20091:30\u202fPM, 6:30\u2009\u2013\u20098:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20091:30\u202fPM, 6:30\u2009\u2013\u20098:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20091:30\u202fPM, 6:30\u2009\u2013\u20098:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20091:30\u202fPM, 6:30\u2009\u2013\u20098:30\u202fPM\nSunday: Closed\n\nPrice Level: 4 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.3\nReviews: \n\nOne - starred Michelin restaurant located within Voco Hotel (previously known as Hilton Orchard), serving Modern-Contemporary cuisine,established by Restaurateur-Sommelier Ignatius Chan in 2004. There is heavy influence of japanese ingredients used in the menu and served in the European way. Opt for the menu with two main courses for a wholesome dining experience. Food presentation is beautiful and tastefully presented, and what's good to look at is also good to eat.\n\nLovely experience.  Good service and attentive staff. Well deserved Michelin star with the food. Has fantastic courses paired with champagne. Air- conditioning is way too cold and freezes everyone. Any warm dish turns cold too quickly. Dessert was also a star and did not let down the entire course of dinner. Felt the staff could have been more confident in introducing each course.\n\nCame here to celebrate our anniversary, a surprise dinner planned by my husband for us. The restaurant is intimate with only a few tables available, so you get undivided attention from the staff. It is also an open kitchen concept which I love so you can see the chefs hard at working preparing their masterpieces for us. I enjoyed pretty much every single dish, the abalone wellington was definitely unique and one of a kind. Overall had a really good experience here.\n\nHad our belated anniversary lunch at Iggy\u2019s as we were having a staycation at Hilton. A lovely resturant with friendly and helpful crew. Love the fact that we are able to view how the chef and his team prepared our meals to the kitchen.\n\nAs the husband and I do not take raw fish, the chef was able to customize to our taste by searing the fish, love how the raw yolk enhances the overall taste of the dish. They did an interesting take on the sponge gourd which brought the vegetable to another level. The linguine was average. The roast beef has charred edges which was a nice touch. Overall we enjoyed the 5 course meal at $150++ per pax.\n\nCame here for lunch with 2 overseas guests who would like to taste a Michelin restaurant.  Decided to bring them to Iggy's as the restaurant has been one that has been keeping their reputation for years. Food was great as you can see in pictures.. perhaps ..some touch up to the interior may make the place feel warm and friendly.\nDamage : $200 (lunch)/pax\n\n\nOption: 5:\nName: NOX - Dine in the Dark\nAddress: 83 Club St, Singapore 069451\nPhone: 6298 0708\nDelivery Available: No\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: Closed\nTuesday: 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 3 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.6\nReviews: \n\nFantastic once in a lifetime experience!

The customer service at the lounge was really warm and friendly too!\n\nVery very unique experience and 10/10 will recommend to come to this place. The picture was taken before the dinner and the dinner was served incomplete darkness. The service is very heartwarming and very friendly.  Dining in pitch dark really gives us the perspective on how a vision disabled person experience their day to day life (just the eating part alone). I think I should not reveal too much details but rather let you experience yourself. This unique experience start from the time u step in the restaurant. Really must try!!!\n\nAbsolutely great experience. Booking with credit card is necessary. When arrived we waited at this fancy bar area where an appetiser is served. We can order bar drinks too. Lockers were provided to keep your bags, phones, watches that illuminate. Then we were taken to a second floor where the room was in complete darkness. When you can see, the sense of touch smell and taste elevates and became more sensitive. Food and wine were great just have to be careful when consuming since we can\u2019t see. Servers are all very passionate, friendly and professional. They told us they can\u2019t see and we are impressed by how swift and accurate they serve. They were also very engaged in conversations with us. Menu changes every two months we were told. Highly recommended!\n\nGo on a culinary adventure, bring out your inner child, enhance and explore with your others senses. Travel a journey to 12 different exciting yummy dishes.\n\nTldr: Very interesting experiential concept; Recommended for the novel experience. 3 course menu for $88++ (4 dishes per course, features seafood & red meat); 2 flight wine pairing for $30, 3 flight wine pairing for $40.\n\nNox is an experiential dining concept where you dine in total darkness while being guided and served by visually impaired waiters. I started off at the bar area (lit up) and got the \u2018Kwai Feh\u2019 cocktail ($22) - the gin and grapefruit pairing was pleasant and refreshing. They also served a small canape of celery root puree mousse & uni in a crispy cone (included in the set course), which was light with the sea flavor of uni.\n\nFor dinner proper, we had to remove and deposit any luminescent personal items (including phones) into a locker before we were brought to the pitch dark dining hall.\n\nNox serves a standard 3-course meal (appetiser / main / dessert) for $88. Each course is split into 4 separate dishes, making it effectively 12 different dishes over the 3-course dinner. Wont spoil the menu by sharing the exact dishes, but there was a good mix of seafood and red meat. The food was generally tasty and of good quality, although nothing spectacular. I also topped up $40 for the 3 flight wine pairing. After the meal, the dishes were revealed back at the bar area.\n\nIt was also interesting to experience how the visually impaired waiters used tongue clicks and whistles to navigate through the dining area with trays of food and drink without running into each other or dropping things. Overall a very interesting experience; highly recommended to try.\n\n\nOption: 6:\nName: Nouri\nAddress: 72 Amoy St, Singapore 069891\nPhone: 9230 2477\nDelivery Available: Information Not Available\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: Closed\nTuesday: Closed\nWednesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nThursday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nFriday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nSaturday: 6:00\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nSunday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.6\nReviews: \n\nAn exceptional experience, very fortunate to have visited this unique restaurant last night. These folks have real flair, making the visit enjoyable from the moment we arrived. I think that I can relate to the chefs \u201ccross roads\u201d concept, an amazing set menu with elements from across the globe. Great wine pairing, loved hearing the story lines.  Loved the casual, relaxed atmosphere. Everything presented with confidence and fun.  Well deserving of its Michelin status.  Each course was remarkable, but I was particularly taken with the chocolate fish ball!\n\nI recently visited Nouri and I must say, the experience was outstanding. The food was absolutely delicious, with a unique blend of cross-cultural flavors that truly impressed my taste buds. From start to finish, every dish was beautifully presented and expertly prepared.\n\nThe renovated space is also fantastic, with a modern yet elegant atmosphere that adds to the overall dining experience. There is also a renewed chef table.\n\nThe service was top-notch and the staff was incredibly attentive. I highly recommend Nouri to anyone looking for an exceptional dining experience in Singapore.\n\nThank you, Nouri, for an unforgettable evening!\n\nThe owner did a wonderful service. We went in for lunch before our flight and the service was prompt and the food came out in a nice pace for lunch. The food was ok and this is my second time here. It has been consistent during the years. This is a nice spot to bring business guest for lunch as it is usually quiet during lunch in the area where most of the comparable restaurants may only open for dinner.  Yes, it is quite pricey.\n\nFood was great, service was great, atmosphere was great. It was relaxed and we had a good time over good food. All the options were presented to us so well; tea, opening drinks, etc. I was just slightly shocked that the selection of tea to end the meal costed $30ish per pot. But other than that, I enjoyed dinner.\n\nUnique flavors, warm, friendly service, beautiful plates, reasonably priced. Staff generously explained every dish and ingredients and an energetic open kitchen made for a memorable dining experience.\n\n\nOption: 7:\nName: Cure\nAddress: 21 Keong Saik Rd., Singapore 089128\nPhone: 9338 4207\nDelivery Available: No\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: Closed\nTuesday: 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: Closed\n\nPrice Level: 3 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.6\nReviews: \n\nThe food was really good and quite surprising. Everything was really original and tasty. Special mention for the main courses which were amazing, espacially the Mussels one. I was also quite surprised, in a good way, by the wines. The only thing I can say is that it was a little too cold in the room for me. Thank you very much for the experience.\n\nThe dining experience was very enjoyable. I thought the overall ambience and plating / presentation were 10/10. What stood out most was the hospitality. The staff noted it was my husband\u2019s birthday and gave a little something which was thoughtful and useful - a little goodie bag comprising samplers of Irish cream, the very same bacon butter that came with the soda bread in the menu, and a useful fridge magnet with the recipe of the said bread. Such a nice way to remember the meal by!\n\nVisited in Oct 2023 as part of the SG Restaurant Week\n\nGood starters where my favourite was the treacle bread. The foie gras br\u00fbl\u00e9e was also decent. Among the mains I really liked the beef preparation and also the fish & squid laksa. The meal rounded off with a couple of very nice dessert items. The \u201cIrish Cloud\u201d dessert was particularly good.\n\nAll in all, Cure is a very solid restaurant and should be on your F&B places to visit in SG.\n\nWe had the Restaurant Week lunch set. The meal was a 6 course meal with add on for an extra mains and cheese platter. You can also add on extra for wine pairing.\n\nThe appetiser consisted of 3 small snacks. The Soda Stout Treacle bread with butter was soft and served hot and the fkavours was a delicate balance of savoury and sweet.\n\nThe 2nd appetiser consisted of their rendition of Tayto, which had a potato skin with soft cheese, and captured the flavour of potato crisps.\n\nThe next appetiser was pig head cheese wrapped with cabbage. Light texture and flavour.\n\nThe main course of wagyu  beef was nicely plated, and we really like the flavours of the sauce. Beef was also perfectly cooked rare/med rare, but the portion size was a bit small.\n\nThe dessert Irish Cloud was one of the star dishes, it had a white chocolate outer shell with vanilla cream and basil sherbert. The flavours  are light and allows the ingredient flavors to blend with each bite.\n\nService and ambience was also good overall, small restaurant, with enough space between each table, and acoustic panels also helped dampend any noise.\n\nThe service staff was attentive and introduced each item on the menu\n\nExcellent and innovative creations from beginning to end.\n\nWe started with the Soda, Stout and Treacle Bread.  Oh what and experience it was as it came with butter that had bacon bits and black onion powder infused in it.  The bread, served nicely warm, looked like a muffin and had great texture.\n\nThe Tayto Cheese & Onion was a tad too small, so could not taste the potato, nor cheese nor onion.\n\nThe Lovage & Jameson Soft Serve Asparagus Morel was like a tiny ice cream cone, delightful and playful.  Morels were made into a Ragu mousse and hidden deep in the cone.\n\nA family favorite was the Salmon, Juniper & Seaweed which had Japanese influence, as salmon was cured for 3 days, then wrapped with seaweed and covered with crusty bread crumbs deep fried.  This was really a winner and we could eat 10 each, if given a choice.\n\nQueen Scallop, Cider, Horseradish was a refreshing dish with icy yuzu taste, like a palate cleanser.\n\nThe Porridge of Sea Urchin was lovely, with generous amount of sea urchin and barley porridge covered with a beef tartare, another crowd pleaser.\n\nThe 7 Tales of the Fox & Silver Duck was a good mains.  With duck in 4 renditions, foie gras custard and green apple, chewy ball, crispy tart and duck meat with mulberries.\n\nChildhood Memories of Peat was interesting.  Like eating charcoal.\n\nShanty\u2019s Whip Citrus Custard is a fruity sweet custard.\n\nWe topped up with Tipperary Brie Cheese, Onion Eccles.  Brie was nice and Eccles was amazing!\n\n\nOption: 8:\nName: Restaurant JAG\nAddress: 41 Robertson Quay, #02-02 STPI Creative Workshop and Gallery, Singapore 238236\nPhone: 6871 8973\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: Closed\nTuesday: 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSunday: Closed\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.8\nReviews: \n\nExcellent services with quality food and fantastic atmosphere. The restaurant only has limited table, definitely need reservations to come here. The place focuses more on a wide range of quality vegetables across the world. Very unique presentation of the dishes! My partner was having the vegetarian option and it was as good as the non vegetarian options. The chef even packed us his hometown cake to bring home for tasting.\nA little high on the cost, but worth the experience!\n\nOne of the most breathtaking food experience I had the chance to enjoy.\n\nAmazing culinary journey. The contemporary symphony of aromas and textures through a vegetarian focus was fresh, exciting and new. Every dish is meticulously crafted to bring a delightful balance of flavors. The wine pairing was on point. Compliments job to the chef.\n\nExcellent service. Attentiveness and professionalism exceeded our expectations.\n\nThe atmosphere was warm, friendly and cosy. We felt welcomed and in optimal conditions to savor our dinner.\n\nWe recommend this restaurant to anyone passionate about food.\n\nBeautiful vegetarian cuisine, beautiful ambience, beautiful service and staff. Just take that leap for tastebud and exquisite ingredients discovery. Presentation of the food, attention to your dining experience made it such a pleasant experience. Do come by each season for different culinary exposure.\n\nChef Jeremy and the team did a fantastic job championing seasonal vegetables. The wine paring was beautifully done for each course to highlight the taste of the food with a great balance.\n\nThe ambience of the restaurant was intimate and lovely but the light was slightly dark. It was a birthday celebration and we had a great time throughout the night.\n\nThe menu was exceptional, a great variation of vegetables and herbs tastefully balanced and beautifully presented. The choice of courses was perfectly matched. The staff was very attentive and friendly. The chef introduced himself to all the guests and was very accommodating.

Would highly recommend getting the seven course menu as there were so many more elements in our dinner incorporated that made it all the more special. Flavours were all very well balanced and overall we left feeling very satisfied.\n\nVisited in Sep 2023\n\nBraci was on my list of restaurants to visit for over 4 years and I must say that it was worth the wait. It is no surprise that Braci has retained its Michelin 1 star for 6 consecutive years. The menu was a progressive one which is definitely inspired by Chef Mattie\u2019s Italian roots. There are 2 choices for people (5 course and 7 course). I would suggest people to go for the 7 course as the additional dishes in the 7 course meal are worth it. One of my favourite parts of the experience was trying out the 100 yr old balsamic vinegar.\n\nIf you\u2019re not taking the wine pairing, I would strongly recommend folks to try out a few of their cocktails, esp. their Negroni (one of the most unique ones I\u2019ve had)\n\nService was good. The restaurant is able to cater to some food allergies (like my shellfish allergy).\n\nA definite recommendation for fine dining lovers.\n\nAmazing time at Braci for a birthday celebration for my husband. The Italian food was superb with beautiful floral aesthetic to each dishes. Staff is polite and friendly too! Special thanks to Chef Matteo who is very engaging and make the day extra special! Love the black truffle \"hide and seek\" dish which is one of the highlights of all dishes! It so savoury and unforgettable\u2026.\n\nnice food nice atmosphere. i tot the service could be more positive. but i still enjoy the experience especially on a chill night in the rooftop. overall quite an expensive experience but they were very nice to add an additional anniversary dessert for us:)\n\nOther than the desserts and A5 miyazaki wagyu the rest is just average. Burnt A5 miyazaki wagyu comes with bitter taste. Would still recommend diners to top up and try the wagyu beef. If not you might get the duck which is just average.\nWaiter was coughing while serving so not sure if that is a good service.\nThe desserts is awesome and the balsamic vinegar is nice too.\n\n\nOption: 10:\nName: T\u00f3ng L\u00e8 Private Dining\nAddress: 60 Collyer Quay, Level 10 OUE Tower, Singapore 049322\nPhone: 6634 3233\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSunday: Closed\n\nPrice Level: 3 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.4\nReviews: \n\nEvery dish is on point. We curated our own menu and we emailed them in advance. We used the klook vouchers so that saved us $60. We love the ambience that the rotating restaurant has to offer. I must say the view of Marina Bay Sands is stunning. A great place for celebrations. We went there for birthday celebration and they gave us a free birthday cake. The staff were so attentive and took so many nice candid pictures for us. We really enjoyed ourselves dining at Tong Le Private Dining. Thank you!!!!\n\nFood was really good for its price. We had the Colorful Cloud Dinner Set Menu. I will say it started out amazing and plateaued off around the main course. But for its price I am won't be too picky. Service was good, staffs were friendly and professional. The revolving platform gave a 360 view of the city which was a huge plus for me. Atmosphere was quiet when we came early on, but started to get a bit rowdy due to a huge party to our sides despite the closed-off rooms. But overall a pretty decent visit. Will recommend!\n\nI had the pleasure of indulging in an exquisite dining experience at T\u00f3ng L\u00e8 Private Dining, and I can confidently say it was an absolute delight for all the senses. The first thing that captivated me upon entering here was the stunning view. The restaurant's unique concept of a rotating dining room allowed me to indulge in a 360-degree panorama of the cityscape, adding a sense of wonder and spectacle to the already exquisite dining affair. The menu was a testament to the chef's creativity and culinary expertise. Each dish was a harmonious blend of flavours, beautifully presented and bursting with vibrant colours and textures. I must also mention the impeccable timing of the service. Each course was served with precision, allowing us to savor every bite without feeling rushed. The staff's attention to detail and their commitment to providing exceptional service truly enhanced the entire dining affair. Overall, my dining experience at here was an unforgettable journey of culinary delight and I cannot wait to return to experience their wonders once again :)\n\nMost rotating restaurants live off the gimmick of being exactly that - a rotating restaurant offering a 360 degree view of a location. Many times, the food in such restaurants isn\u2019t a priority, but the experience is. This restaurant, however, serves excellent food and offers a great view of Marina Bay Sands and the fountain and light show in front of the mall, as well as a nice view of parts of the Singapore skyline. The rotation is very slow and it take about two hours to do a full 360 revolution. If you are unlucky, you will be at the opposite side of the fountain show both times it occurs. For a period of the 360 tour you are very close to an office building - so close that you can see the monitors of the people working in the building.\n\nThe seating arrangement is varied, from two/four person tables, to separate dining rooms for larger groups. The restaurant has a very good bar which has a great selection of cocktails and spirits. The restaurant is quiet which makes it easy to have a business conversation, if that\u2018s why you are there.\n\nThe restaurant offers a seven-course menu which is perfectly timed for a two-hour dining experience. The wine menu is very extensive and there is a sommelier that can provide advice if you require so. The menu was extremely well thought-through and the various dishes were perfectly combined to provide a first-class dining experience.\n\nThe staff is very attentive and friendly, and made us feel welcome from the minute we set foot in the restaurant.\n\nWe would come to this restaurant again, and in particular for the dining experience. We were positively surprised by every course.\n\nLocation: 5/5 (in the financial district opposite Marina Bay Mall)\nAmbience: 4/5\nMenu: 5/5 (albeit a fixed menu)\nFood: 5/5\nDrinks/wine selection: 5/5\nStaff: 5/5\nPrice/quality: 4/5 (pricey but very high quality)\n\nQuality of food matches the price. The family all agreed it was a perfect place for a family celebration. The service was immaculate and staff very attentive to details. We didn't mention it was a BD celebration but when we clinked our wine glasses, they must have overheard us saying Happy BD, and they surprised us with longevity buns. They also understand Chinese etiquette well as our son discreetly wanted to foot the bill, but the attending staff came quietly to check with my husband who was the host if they should accept my son's card. That's so thoughtful as in Chinese custom the host foots the bill and they respected that.\n",

The bathroom didn't have toilet paper though.\n\nThe place was kept surprisingly cool regardless of the number of people there.\n\nThe drinks are also expensive but quite interesting and creative.\n\nWow. Legit authentic cafe vibes here.\n\nWe happened to stumble into this cafe after running an errand. Loved the atmosphere with the unique antiques and deco.\n\nThere's a table for two in a car!\n\nThe staff are really friendly, and the atmosphere is so calm and comforting.\n\nGenerious food portion and quality is comparable to high end restaurants.\n\nDefinitely coming back here with friends!\nHighly recommend trying this place out. It's worth it!\n\nGreat place for a brunch experience. The coffee is up to standard and did not disappoint. Ambience is rustic with a touch of nostalgia. I would definitely come back again!\n\nI like the western foods and the deco. Good place for photography. The dessert and  coffee also good.  This is my second time visiting. Already try the tuna during my 1st visit, today I try the Salmon taste good too. The service are good. My personal view the pricing are slightly on the high side.\n\nWas around the vicinity, visited the cafe together with wife for get our brunch fixed. Interesting decorations they have spending effort. We didn\u2019t have any reservations and luckily enough there were seats. Noticed they have a extensive menu for a cafe. Staffs were friendly and attentive, food taste good too. Pricing is reasonable. Will definitely be back.

(Still a little greasy in the end)\nhowever, there was an aged waiter, don\u2019t know if it\u2019s their manager ( if it is, their training is awful \ud83d\ude05), keep pushing us. Bill and take away our cutlery\u2026\n\nPersonally likes the vibes and environment here. But if you prefer a quiet place to discuss or chit chat, it might be not suitable.\nThe food is superb. I am willing to come back for their grilled octopus. I seldom eat octopus, but yea, their grilled octopus surprisingly delicious. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83e\udd13\n\nHave visited Symmetry quite a few times. Really like the menu here with the Shakshouka being my favourite. Vegetarian options available too.\n\nGood, fast, efficient service. Reservation is recommended as the place can get quite crowded, esp. on weekends.\n\nA really good place to have brunch/lunch and a boozy one too.\n\nquaint and pretty caf\u00e9.\n\nwe ordered their big breakfast and waffles. personally felt that their big breakfast tasted average, but their waffles on the other hand were so good!! the sourness of the fresh berry compote helped to balance out the sweetness from the maple syrup, and the blueberry icecream was perfect (wasn\u2019t too sweet). they served a pretty mean coffee too, really aromatic blend.\n\nchill vibes all around, can\u2019t wait to be back!\n\nHappened to park just right outside the shop and decided to have lunch here.\n\nI remembered I used to frequent this place many years ago. However, it's quite difficult to get the roadside parking.\n\nThe coffee here is still as enjoyable. the price for the main course is kinda steep.\n\nWe ordered 2 drinks and 1 chicken burger and 1 salmon.\n\nThe total bill is about 90ish.\n\nMight not come back so soon.\n\nService and ambience are good.\n\n\nOption: 4:\nName: The Dempsey Project\nAddress: Block 9 Dempsey Rd, #01-12, Singapore 247697\nPhone: 6475 2005\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 8:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 8:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 8:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 8:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 8:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 8:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 8:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.5\nReviews: \n\nThe food quality and taste are constantly nice. Staff are friendly and attentive. It\u2019s one of our staple dining options at Dempsey hill. They also update their menu time to time. The indoor dining area is nicely cooled with spacious seating. However, it is quite noisy during weekend peak hours.\nOverall, we like this place and often bring home chocolates and cheese after the meal.\n\nJust the right ambience and choice of songs for a chill and relaxing night for a good gathering with friends\u2026 and the crew were very nice to always check in with us to see what we needed\u2026 and it was very sweet of the crew to offer us the free desserts \u2026 \ud83e\udd70 will be back\n\nLove the atmosphere.\nFood wise slightly above average and there's room for improvement. To highlight, the fish finger is too fishy.  Service team maybe need to be more attentive. Overall still a good place to hang out\n\nMy first visit to Dempsey project and it won\u2019t be my last for sure. Food is great not just taste but presentation and creativity! The ambience is perfect especially for pet lovers. Staff are extremely friendly, prompt in servicing and very helpful. Eg. gave us decent advice where to sit to avoid morn sun. Staff was eager to please. Very impressed with the crew professionalism and attitude.\n\nOnce in a while when I want to have a carefree breakfast/brunch - I am reminded of these place. The environment in Dempsey certainly helps - and the food selection for breakfast menu has improved tremendously since a couple of years ago.\n\nI do enjoy the breakfast\u2026 tasty\u2026 but the coffee is a bit of a letdown. For the price offering - I would expect a full bodied aroma coffee without the need of extra shot.\n\nPrice wise? Definitely on the pricier end - what is to say with the morning at Dempsey and a relaxing breakfast in an old colonial building.\n\n\nOption: 5:\nName: The Populus\nAddress: 146 Neil Rd, Singapore 088875\nPhone: 6635 8420\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20096:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20096:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20096:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20096:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20096:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.3\nReviews: \n\nThere is truly something special about this brunch place. Not sure if it's the decadent food, the superb service or the fantastic atmosphere and decor.\n\nI first ordered their homemade cold mocha brew, and it was very rich in flavor and literally the best way to start your day. For the mains, we ordered fried chicken topped on a crispy spring onion pancake and a giant croissant filled with creamy scrambled eggs and sizzling bacon. I loved both of them, not sure which one more. The pancakes with chicken was very hearty and the egg and bacon croissant is a classic. We ordered their walnut cheesecake for dessert to split and it was moist, but firm at the same time with a tasty frosting. The food prices may seem expensive, but for the great quality ingredients and inspired plates you are getting, it's totally worth it.\n\nThe restaurant is a bit small and can be very busy, so make sure to reserve before hand. The cooks are very talented, apparently they won quite a few competitions in the past.\n\nReserve ahead for the weekend, 75 min dine-in time as it\u2019s super busy. Came for the buckwheat pancakes and loved it. Blueberry compote with fresh fruits and crispy cornflakes crumble complement the  grainy and soft yet moist and fluffy pancake (sounds crazy). Very filling. Scrambled Eggs and harissa fried eggs with lamb are good too.\n\nWent for brunch on 5/8 and had a good experience there overall.\n\nFood: Had seafood pasta (which had an savoury and interesting taste that I like and hence devoured), truffle fries (your usual fries) and waffle ice cream! Okay not too bad but not like super fantastic.\n\nService: Very prompt, the servers noted our requests throughout meals and food arrived quickly too. Kudos to them for the good service!\n\nDuring our recent visit, we decided to sample the seafood linguine and the Halibut & Soba dishes. While the prices were on the higher side, I must say that both selections were undeniably delicious, making the expenditure worth it.\n\nFor those planning to dine here, I strongly recommend making a reservation in advance, especially given its popularity. However, keep in mind that it might not be an ideal spot for a work session, as the dining time is limited to around 70-90 minutes during peak hours.\n\nOverall, this establishment left a positive impression, and I'm eager to return and explore more of what they have to offer.\n\nNice ambience with coffee aroma when step into the cafe. The coffee is nice and suit my preference. All the food we order is nice and tastes good. Definitely will come back again.\n\n\nOption: 6:\nName: 6 Letter Brunch\nAddress: 103 Frankel Ave, Singapore 458225\nPhone: 8366 0168\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 8:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20098:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 8:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20098:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 8:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20098:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 8:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20098:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 8:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 8:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 8:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20098:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.4\nReviews: \n\nExcellent place to grab a leisurely brunch if you are in the east. Was there with friends and we had a good catch-up over brunch.\nThe portions of food were very big, enough for a full lunch actually, but this is reflected in the pricing.\nThey have a delightful policy of letting kids eat free on weekdays though, so you may want to consider some bonding with your child during the upcoming school holidays!\n\nVery tasty food with a lot of healthy choices available in the menu.\n\nThe interior is lush with greens and design is clean and minimal. The soft music in the background brings good vibes to the atmosphere.\n\nWe ordered the pancakes, baked Atlantic salmon and smoked salmon avocado sourdough toast. All 3 of them are great! Very reasonably price and the price in the menu is the nett price you pay (no GST and service charge).\n\nHighly recommend to try out this place and I will definitely come back again. The downside is, very hard to find parking if you\u2019re driving down.\n\nLazy Sunday perk up with Grab order.\nWe ordered a variety of brunch meals and it came up to be near 100 bucks on the bill.\n\nThe food kept its flavour despite taking out.\n\nNutty Banana Croissant\nPeanut butter with a generous spread of granola and banana held together by a lightly toasted croissant. Now for a good balance, they\u2019ve thrown in some berries! Lovely and filling.\n\nGrilled Chicken Burger\nThe fries was soggy. Now this is a global problem that requires attention. How the hell can you retain the integrity of delivery fries?\nThe buns was nice and the chicken patty was well grilled and juicy.\n\nMr Frank\nThis looks big and intimidating.\nNot sure if we got around to finish it but for 17 bucks it\u2019s something you can share!\n\nGood Day Breakfast\nThis was a mash up of everything you would expect in an English breakfast. There\u2019s salad, sausages, avocado and sourdough. I need a good cup of tea.\n\nWe\u2019ve been to the cafe before.\nBright and airy. Lots of plants - but I think they need TLC.\n\nIt\u2019s a safe bet guys. Go order and share the plates.\n\nStopped by for a simple drink and snack on a Sunday afternoon. The place had very nice vibes and the drinks were good.\n\nMy only wish was that we had space in our stomachs to try more of their food selection.

The mushroom soup  pizza and beef bolognese are decent. They are famous for their \ud83c\udf6a cookies.\n\nHad their seafood pan. I must say the bread they served was amazing. It\u2019s crispy on the outside, soft and moist on the inside, more importantly, the bread was warm when served. A perfect combination to dip into the seafood pan.\n\nI think this was our second visit, perhaps after a very very long while! Wife decided to hop by for an afternoon cuppa after dropping off the kids at our in laws.\n\nAs we already had lunch prior, we ordered light. A nice pasta to share with coffee. The prawn Bisque was decent.\n\nLoved the atmosphere, very relaxing environment coupled with really nice food. Coffee was great too.\n\nVisited before and tried the Lamb and Prawn Rose this time around. The Lamb was super soft but a little bland, while the Prawn Rose was nice.\n\nThere is a playpen for kids at the outdoor tables, hence we weren't able to enjoy much of the nature ambience.

For making our birthday dinner a very pleasant one with your thoughtfulness and friendliness :)\n\nFood standard is great here \ud83d\udc4d\nWe ordered ceaser salad , crab spaghetti and aquapazza. Spaghetti and aquapazza are delicious.\n\nWe visited here for brunch around 11am for 2 pax walk-in.\nThere were few people inside. I requested bigger table as I got a lot of stuffs on my hand and not much customer inside, but a lady staff looks obviously not happy that I requested that.\nWe left restaurant around 1pm, but restaurant has not packed during our brunch. I am not sure why the lady was so unwillingly give us a bigger seat.\n\nOverall, although the price is not reasonable, it\u2019s still good restaurant in terms the quality of the foods and the atmosphere.\n\nThe cafe is part of hotel with separate entrance from mall. Very nice brunch spot. Ordered fish taco and baked egg. Baked egg is petty good because I love chorizo. But fish taco is slightly disappointing. Too much batter and lack of citric flavor\nTheir dessert menu is also limited. Thrifts, tried their tasting coffee set. MAD milk is naturally sweet from date, interesting idea.\n\nThis is an outlet I visited before with the missus and today I decided to invade Oriole with the 3 monkeys !!! The girls loved the overall decoration, they claimed it\u2019s cozy and homely haha. Anyway, all the dishes were ordered by them and they sang super high praises for \u201cwhatever-they-ordered\u201d (laughs). They loved the silky and smooth mushroom soup; THEY LOVED THE CHICKEN WINGS !!! They basically loved everything hahaha. We will be back for more Oriole, many thanks for hosting us well, till then !!!\n\nWe walked in on a Sunday afternoon and Jazzy assisted us. My aunt had a bad back and requested for sofa seat. Because most of the sofa seats were taken due to reservations, Jazzy mentioned she would try her best. After awhile, she came over and mentioned that the seat was available as they managed to get a sofa seat for us. Jazzy was very helpful throughout and her willingness shined through\n\nWe ordered the Sweet Soy Pork Ribs which was rather tender and the Smoked Salmon Waffles which was good. Overall a great experience and special shout out to Jazzy who was helpful, patient and an asset to the service industry :)\n\n\nOption: 9:\nName: MERCI MARCEL ORCHARD\nAddress: 390 Orchard Road, 01-03 Palais Renaissance, 390 Orchard Rd, #01 - 03 / 04, Singapore 238871\nPhone: 6735 2608\nDelivery Available: Information Not Available\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 8:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 8:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nWednesday: 8:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nThursday: 8:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nFriday: 8:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nSaturday: 8:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nSunday: 8:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.7\nReviews: \n\nIt was my first visit with my wife to Merci Marcel, we were delighted by the overall vibes of the restaurant. We ordered the eggs Ben and French Toast Brioche, latte and flat white. The food and coffee were excellent, the portion of eggs Ben was a bit small though. A great place to chill!!\n\nMy first visit to Merci Marcel and my friends and I had a good time bonding over the food and the servers were great, especially Marilyn who was patient in giving us and overview of food selects and sharing the specials of the day. Soft yellow lighting gave it a nice cosy family/friends evening gathering atmosphere vibes. Thumbs up!\n\nVery good! Although we didn't have a reservation, they managed to fit us in. The staff were all friendly and provided a fast and efficient service. The food and coffee were amazing, not to mention the cafes' atmosphere was very relaxing. It was a lovely breakfast and experience.\n\nAmazing place, nice atmosphere. Food was excellent but the portions are small (unless you ordered pizza). Also on the higher price range, so do take note. Great for special occasions though!\n\nThe atmosphere of Merci Marcel at Orchard is really nice and relaxing. I was able to get some work done the both times I had gone, while enjoying a nice meal. The first time I had gone to the restaurant, I ordered the ravioli. There are two versions. One has nuts and the other does not. They make sure to seperate them. The green sauce is a chai based sauce (not a pesto). The staff is really polite and the manager also walks the floor and checks on each guest. They will definitely see me again.\n\n\nOption: 10:\nName: My Awesome Cafe\nAddress: 202 Telok Ayer St, Singapore 068639\nPhone: 8798 1783\nDelivery Available: Information Not Available\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nWednesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nThursday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nFriday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nSaturday: 10:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 10:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.6\nReviews: \n\nI had the most incredible dining experience at this restaurant! From the moment I walked in, I was welcomed by a warm and friendly staff. The ambiance was enchanting, with soft lighting and tasteful decor that set the perfect mood for the evening.\n\nThe menu was a culinary masterpiece, offering a wide range of mouthwatering dishes that catered to various tastes. I started with the recommendation and it was an explosion of flavors that left me craving more. their signature dish was nothing short of perfection. Every bite was a delightful journey for my taste buds.\n\nThe service was impeccable; our server was knowledgeable about the menu, attentive, and made excellent recommendations.\n\nFood, Service, Ambience, everything was simply AMAZING. Bong was a super friendly host ( he posed with us too). I highly recommend this place to folks looking out for a wholesome and healthy meal. Lookout for the portion sizes, they are pretty huge.\n\nWe were amazed from the entrance. The place has the soul, every detail of the decoration matches. Waiters were really helpful as we weren\u2019t sure what we want to eat. Food arrived in few min, we took veg options- very fresh and tasteful. Burger was a monster and it\u2019s my favorite if I have to choose!\n\nWould give the service here 6/5 if we could because it was excellent. We came here for lunch with the kids and they enjoyed themselves tremendously. Special shout out to the service staff here. It is not easy to find a place that is hip, trendy yet so welcoming to kids and we felt right at home. Food was also yummy, healthy and clean but tasty. Highly recommend!\n\nLove the bake duck confit, pineapple cake, love the friendly staff, love the environment, love the recycling school table and oil tank (outdoor, as a standing table) love the old tcm medicine cabinet as a deco,\n\nWanna celebrate your birthday? It's not an issue. Ask for sparkler on the cake\uff0c(do note it is chargeable ya)\n\nHighly recommend.\n",

Not sure if the serving ala carte order would be the same or not. As for the taste, not much of surprise in any way.\n\nThe Arrabiata pasta (not fresh pasta) didn't gave the woah effect in any way as well. Saving grace was the fresh prawns.\n\nMy wife tried the Gnocchi with gorgonzola. Pasta (fresh) texture wasn't good, sauce not really to our likely.\n\nAnother disappointment is the dessert from the set lunch, which we had ordered the flourless Chocolate cake. Look at the picture and you will understand. Taste, so-so, maybe due to the presentation.\n\nLastly is the Tiramisu, saving grace to not get below 3 stars.\n\nOverall, not a place which we would be considering to go again.\n\nThis is my 5th visit to Poco Loco. Each visit I am always bowled over by the great food . This is a hidden gem at Upper Thomson. I have eaten at many Italian restaurants, I have to say the pasta here are extremely good, full of flavour and really satisfying . Not sure where did the chef previously came from but I dare say it is even as good as some of higher class restaurants like Etna. Highly recommend.\n\nGenerally the food is fresh and not too bad. We had mushroom soup, calamari, spaghetti carbonara, spaghetti arrabbiata, spaghetti vongole, Panna Cotta and chocolate flourless cake.The first 2 items and the last are worth trying. Could give the calamari a miss though. The restaurant is within 5mins walking distance from tel station exit 4.\n\nValue for money! We tried PocoLoco for the first time and we really enjoyed our meal. We ordered 1 dinner set ($45), which consisted of an appetiser, 1 pasta dish, 1 main course and 1 dessert, there\u2019s an option to order a glass of wine for $8. We ordered an extra pasta dish with lamb as well. Portion was good (not too small/big) and our favourite was the pork collar main course (part of the dinner set). Price was nett and drinks were reasonably priced as well ($2 for jasmine green tea and other soft drinks). Overall it was enjoyable and value for money.\n\nJun 2023. I always loved pocoloco Italian food. We got mushroom soups, seafood pasta and lasagne.\nNothing to complain about.\n\n\nOption: 2:\nName: Fun Toast\nAddress: Singapore 123456\nPhone: 8833 0033\nDelivery Available: Information Not Available\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 0\nReviews: \n\n\nOption: 3:\nName: Open Farm Community\nAddress: 130E Minden Rd, Singapore 248819\nPhone: 6471 0306\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20094:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20094:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 3 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.2\nReviews: \n\nMade a reservation for 12:45pm lunch. Was slightly late but they called to double check and kept our reservation. Was for a birthday celebration and it\u2019s my second visit here. Their menu changes time to time and I have not tried their current menu before. Ordered 3 mains and all 3 mains are VERY good. Come and try for yourself. Staffs there are friendly and welcoming, one even joined for a birthday song for my friend. Overall, another good experience with Open Farm.\n\nFirst time visit, we were 2 adults and 2 kids. When we arrived, we were served with a smile from the front staff. Told to wait 5 minutes till they get the table ready.\nJoseph (manager) was really nice to manage us to get a standard table instead of a high table (where we placed earlier)\n\nGood menu for kids and adults. Ordered fish and chips for kids. They loved the fish, very light battered and crispy.\nWe ordered the hanger steak, and steak can only be  served as medium cook. Which is quite annoying when someone may prefer medium rare or other options. The steak portion is literally three pieces, not worth $42. Extensive drinks menu, ordered a lemongrass cocktail, which was very refreshing.\n\nOverall service, ambience is nice. Bit disappointed with the steak portion and pricing.\n\nThis place is always booked out, so advanced reservations are highly recommended. It's a great weekend family brunch place with a sizable playground and sand pit for kids to have some outdoor fun. The compound is big with lots of areas for kids to explore. It's a nice space with high ceilings and lots of natural light. The service is on point with a very attentive and warm team of wait staff. However, the food is not as good as I'd hoped, especially for the prices they charge. Overall, lovely space, good service, very kid friendly, OK food, high prices.\n\nBest cocktail in Singapore, Australia and Borneo! Their small plates can vie for Michelin star and their desserts are amazing too! Service standards are also excellent in spite of a full house. I had an entirely vegetarian lunch from the set menu and I love it! Happy National Day!\n\nMe and wife went for birthday and anniversary, staff was super amazing seeing we have baby they help us move seats inside. The ambiance was cozy specious and service was top notch. Food was a different style which we never had before and desert was just purely amazing too.

The meat is really tender and well flavoured. Went well with the garlic and mashed potatoes. They do their mussels and clams really well. Mussels were juicy and cooked to perfection. Our bellies were pretty pleased with our options and we didn't expect the portions to be so generous! Service standards vary according to the service crew set on duty. We were impressed on our 1st visit but nay on our 2nd. We will be back nonetheless.\n\nA family-friendly restaurant, the staff are attentive and would provide toys to young children to keep them entertained.\n\nFood is fantastic, with generous portions. Even the kids meal look to be more like an adult\u2019s portion. Highlight of the meal include the ribeye steak which was flavourful and tender, and the pesto crab fettuccine, which was simply delicious and made me crave for more.\n\nParking would be an issue for those who drive as there\u2019s limited lots, but those taking public transport, would be extremely convenient since it\u2019s located just 1min outside Sixth Avenue MRT, and sheltered all the way.\n\nGreat service, a very cosy place for families especially with kids. Food was really good too including the free meals for kids below 11 on weekends and PH. My kids loved their beef sliders and carbonara! Desserts were on the pricier side though..\n\nFamily friendly restaurant.\nFood was good and generous portion.\n\nWe enjoyed our experience and will return to try out the rest of the menu.\n\nGoogled places to eat at 6th Ave as was exploring the Downtown line.\n\nSaw Little Lazy Lizard's menu and thought why not to give it a try. Tried it with my girlfriend for lunch.\n\nWhen entered, we were welcomed warmly by one of the servers and he ushered us to our table.\n\nMenu had a fair selection of food choices for us to choose. We each ordered a main and light bite to share.\n\nFood ordered:\n1. Pork Bulgogi pizza\n- lovely and tasty\n- thin and crispy regular base\n\n2. French Toast\n- portion was good 2 to share actually\n- bread was fluffy (think Brioche was used)\n\n3. Lazy Lizard wings (chef's recommendation)\n- honestly when it came was little disappointed to see it was like regular fried wings. Maybe was expecting to be more special with its marinade or if its sauce that is outstanding\n- deep fried timing was good, light and crispy and wasn't overly salty yet flavourful\n\nI don't mind visiting this place again to try out their mains.\n\n\nOption: 5:\nName: Waterfall Ristorante Italiano\nAddress: 22 Orange Grove Rd, Level One, Garden Wing, Singapore 258350\nPhone: 6213 4398\nDelivery Available: Information Not Available\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 3 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.5\nReviews: \n\nProfessional service was provided by the thoughtful and attentive staff. An entire birthday cake, not merely a slice, was given to us. Most dishes were great. The highlight of the meal was the seafood stew. All the breads were also exceptionally delicious. However, the sea bass tasted very ordinary and the sky high price tag went to the showy \u2018performance\u2019 by the chef. Restaurant was too dim and had a funky smell.\n\nThe staff are very friendly and the food is also tasty. The portion is surprisingly big and we ate till our hearts content.\n\nStaff very helpful and polite. Atmosphere is chill with soft music. Food serve just in the right timing.  Of cause the price is not cheap. But it worth the price overall.\n\nLastly thanks for the birthday cake. Love it but we were too full to finish it.\n\nBooked Sunday afternoon to have their set lunch, only to find out they only serve buffet that day at $78++ per person. Opted in anyway and didn't regret it, given the fresh ingredients, great taste of Italian and friendly staffs! Personally I love the dessert section especially Panna Cotta! If I had to pick on something, it'd be the dim lighting. No discount on the bill even with Shangri-la Circle membership, but you do get extra points.\n\nRemember, when you get into the lobby, you are on 3F. You need to take an elevator to get down to 1F where the restaurant is.\n\nThe restaurant has decent ambience for a semi chic and comfortable dinning experience. The salt crusted fish is delicious and if you want to see some fire show. The winner for me is the crab pasta. Yum!\n\nEverything about this place is 5 stars!\nThe ambience is so perfect that you are at ease the moment you are inside the restaurant. Menu is designed in such a way that you can have the best vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes without feeling less about your dish. Staff is courteous and even after attending so many guests, they always find time to attend to you/your requests. The serving is very clean and within time. They have good sitting arrangements both inside and outside.

It's a good hangout for golfers after their practice and games. They served different alcoholic drinks, including their craft brew.\n\nDiners can view part of the golf course in this unenclosed establishment. The food wasn't spectacular but wasn't shabby too. One could get the typical western dishes here, besides the finger foods. No particular dish stood out to me or I haven't tried enough of them.\n\nThe atmosphere was good in the evening with the warm lighting but there were the occasional annoying insects.\n\nService was fine but it could be hard to get the staff's attention sometimes. It seems popular for families too. The location is inaccessible unless one drives. But there weren't enough reasons for me to drive all the way here just to dine.\n\nEver been to an eatery where you have relaxing ambience close to Mother Nature, coupled with great tasting food, throw in some nicely house brewed beers and background music? Yes this is the place - all rolled into one!\n\nTheir pizzas are very thinned crust with great cheeses and sliced salami. Another dish is their hummus and pita - came with four soft yet crusty pitas. Love their pasta and burgers too. Did I say the flamb\u00e9 waffles lit with flaming vodka and contrue liquor? Nicely done.\n\nWill come back again during the day to soak\nin the nature atmosphere.\n\nMicrobrewery restaurant at a public golf course is a good establishment. The IPA tasted  nice, but not all its brews were available, so I couldn't compare if others were as good. Humus was okay for bar bites, but $5 charge for additional pita would make the price a bit steep. Having the pita warmed was a nice touch!\n\nCame here for coffee and dessert (apple crumble) which was nice.\n\nEnvironment: Nice spot to have a meal or drink as its surrounded by nature, that happens to be the downside as well. The place is literally crawling with insects and mosquitos are aplenty. Do bring some sort of repellent, i got bitten a fair bit.\n\nFood: The coffee ive ordered was strong and the apple crumble came adorned with fresh fruits and was quite nice.\n\nAccessibility: The parking is free and onsite. You probably wont consider this place unless you drive.\n\nPrice: Not fantastic but you have saved on parking anyway\n\nMy family all time favourite restaurant! We love their pizzas, steak and fries (which finally made its way on the menu again) and their deserts. The best part for us was the walk after our meals to the Rider's Cafe just around the corner where we call our cab from. It's a dark walk at night but we enjoy the chat along the short walk as we occasionally see some horses in the stable. It's all gone sadly and I hope the same fate doesn't befall upon this and the Thai restaurant across from them.\n\n\nOption: 7:\nName: Fusion Spoon at Botanic Gardens\nAddress: Singapore Botanic Gardens, Tanglin Gate, 1 Cluny Rd, #B1-00, 259569\nPhone: 6255 5110\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 7:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 7:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 1 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 3.8\nReviews: \n\nOverall okay for what you get. The service is zero self service food Court style western and Asian food. Aircon strong very fast food style. The menu price does not match the computer screen. Its hard to use not friendly user. But food came out ok lah. Nothing spectacular but it's what I expected for tourists trap places like this.\n\nAverage food quality with decent amount of serving. I would say it's like a cozy coffee shop with different varieties of food to choose from.\nIt's like HANS concept with affordable food and ample space for even big groups to dine in.\n\nI rate this place as the \u201cworst eatery\u201d in Singapore. in Salad for 15 sgd with salmon there is 10 grams of salmon itself! The cutlets in the burgers look like they were cooked yesterday, all the salt in the world was put in the fries, the freshly squeezed juices have no taste.\n\nGood food nice cozy place to sit! We ordered quite many things only thing is I didn\u2019t like the chicken nuggets! It was really weird textured on the other hand every other thing we ordered was good. There is a play area too so kids stay busy and let you eat in peace! One more thing there was just 1 host in day time so things were processing very slow.\n\nThe food menu needs alot of work. It's really a big mess now and ordering through the POS is very limiting.\n\nFood was ok, mostly packaged food taste. Basi lemak was but dry chicken. Lucky the Chili was good and rice ok.\n\nCoffees are in tiny cups and feel expensive. Tea was not bad.\n\nReally wish we could do add-ons. Kaya toast set comes with drinks but no soft boil eggs. At least that's what it says on the POS. So we didn't order.\n\nMac and cheese all box type. Although next table has the little pizza which looked decent for kids.

Tables are very closely arranged. The good thing is their service is efficient and steady. Despite crowded, food serve was quick and doesn't have to wait long.\nWe ordered the seafood horfun and beehoon, bitter gourd black bean pork ribs, mince meat fried egg, hotplate tofu, cereal soft shell Crab and baby Kailan. All the dishes were delicious and flavourful. Not very salty and everything were fresh. Good food happy customers.\n\nThis place is quite popular with the locals. While the area is being upgraded, it is not very accessible. I do like the Prawn Minced Meat Rolls and Sweet Sour Sliced Fish are excellent options. Baby Kai Lan is too hard for older people. Coffee Pork Rib is a bit bland. Cereal Prawns are pretty lovely. Home-Made Tofu with Minced Meat is disappointing - while the meat is flavourful, the tofu doesn\u2019t absorb the flavour, so you get a too salty feeling from the meat, but the tofu is tasteless. The salted fish fried rice is well received, so do try it.\n\nLovely place to it Hongkong food, such as Assam Fish Head, Cereal Chicken, Chicken Wings, Prawn Paste Chicken, Tofu with Minced Meat, etc. Located in Novena area, this is a lovely restaurant to visit for sure if you like Chinese/Hongkong casual food. Affordable price also.\n\ngreat zhi char food.\nassam fish head is very nice. the paste is homemade.\nxo beehoon fish soup\u2019s soup is refillable.\nfried prawn roll is crispy and lots of fillings.\n\nA reasonably priced restaurant with good tasting Chinese food. The oil soaked croaker fish was super crispy. We crunch crunch crunch almost every part of the fish. The sauce was not too salty and just nice to eat on its own without rice. The braised brinjal was really flavouful and umami, best to eat with rice. Will definitely go back again.\n\n\nOption: 9:\nName: Hippo Family Restaurant\nAddress: 72 Circuit Rd, #01-13, Singapore 370072\nPhone: 6844 2770\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 1 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.3\nReviews: \n\nA nice neighborhood family alfresco restaurant serving local tze char delights at affordable prices.\n\nThe lady boss and staff were friendly and attentive and the restaurant was clean.\n\nThe food was affordable and delicious in a home cooked manner.

If I were to be very picky, the gravy for the dishes can be a tad too starchy.\n\nThe food is good and super affordable. There's a wide-range of dishes too!

They have a small play area for kids to play, which is equipped with swing, hanging  rods, etc. Staff is attentive and service with a smile.\n\nWe ordered cappuccino and fresh juices for kids. Coffee was delicious, right temperature and good flavour.\n\nDefinitely recommended to check out if in the dempsey area.\n\nIt's a really nice spot for a family weekend brunch at Dempsey Hill. There is a playground with really rustic contraptions for kids to enjoy and for parents to snap some nice pictures. There is a second playground, but a paid membership is required to access the exclusive area. A prepayment of $20 per diner is required to secure a reservation. The food tasted fresh, and the portions are sizable. The service staff are very friendly and welcoming. Overall, it was a great weekend brunch experience for the family with good food and excellent service.\n\nLate update but it should be recorded. Had a really nice Christmas lunch there in last Dec!!\n\nFood, decor and service are all good! Just like went to a cozy restaurant in an European city! We like the appetizers much! Salad sauce is fresh with great balance on the portion. Pizza is crispy and yummy. Main courses are coming with different side dishes. All tasted great. Just the dessert a bit below our expectation.\n\nThey served gingerbread cookies to us which is unexpected. And the Santa and Elf family visit really surprised our kids! They can pick a small gift from the Santa\u2019s bag!\n\nThere\u2019s little playground and IG photo spots for the kids in outdoor area. It\u2019s nice whatever you\u2019re sitting in indoor or outdoor area.\n\nI\u2019m thinking to come again in Easter Holiday and see what program they will have.\n\nAT feast Singapore, Dempsey venue and the Private Dining space were apt for our occasion. Staff were pleasant and supportive. It is a kids friendly venue. Food was amazing.

Not sure if the serving ala carte order would be the same or not. As for the taste, not much of surprise in any way.\n\nThe Arrabiata pasta (not fresh pasta) didn't gave the woah effect in any way as well. Saving grace was the fresh prawns.\n\nMy wife tried the Gnocchi with gorgonzola. Pasta (fresh) texture wasn't good, sauce not really to our likely.\n\nAnother disappointment is the dessert from the set lunch, which we had ordered the flourless Chocolate cake. Look at the picture and you will understand. Taste, so-so, maybe due to the presentation.\n\nLastly is the Tiramisu, saving grace to not get below 3 stars.\n\nOverall, not a place which we would be considering to go again.\n\nThis is my 5th visit to Poco Loco. Each visit I am always bowled over by the great food . This is a hidden gem at Upper Thomson. I have eaten at many Italian restaurants, I have to say the pasta here are extremely good, full of flavour and really satisfying . Not sure where did the chef previously came from but I dare say it is even as good as some of higher class restaurants like Etna. Highly recommend.\n\nGenerally the food is fresh and not too bad. We had mushroom soup, calamari, spaghetti carbonara, spaghetti arrabbiata, spaghetti vongole, Panna Cotta and chocolate flourless cake.The first 2 items and the last are worth trying. Could give the calamari a miss though. The restaurant is within 5mins walking distance from tel station exit 4.\n\nValue for money! We tried PocoLoco for the first time and we really enjoyed our meal. We ordered 1 dinner set ($45), which consisted of an appetiser, 1 pasta dish, 1 main course and 1 dessert, there\u2019s an option to order a glass of wine for $8. We ordered an extra pasta dish with lamb as well. Portion was good (not too small/big) and our favourite was the pork collar main course (part of the dinner set). Price was nett and drinks were reasonably priced as well ($2 for jasmine green tea and other soft drinks). Overall it was enjoyable and value for money.\n\nJun 2023. I always loved pocoloco Italian food. We got mushroom soups, seafood pasta and lasagne.\nNothing to complain about.\n\n\nOption: 2:\nName: Jai Thai Restaurant\nAddress: 7 Clover Way, Singapore 579080\nPhone: 6258 0228\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u20098:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u20098:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u20098:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u20098:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 1 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.2\nReviews: \n\nA hidden Thai outlet in industrial estate with strong support from the nearby workforce. Food is authentic n lunch value set can be considered. Delicious \ud83d\ude0b\n\nVery decent Thai food for its price. Used to be cheaper and came here a lot when studying at a school nearby. Prices went up since 2017 but the food is excellent. The Thai Beef green curry is a must get, so is the basil sauce fish fillet. It is closed from 3-6pm so take note. Recently they seem to start taking reservations, so if you have a big group might want to call earlier to get seats. The Thai milk tea and lemon grass drinks are very nice!\n\nComfort meal with decent Thai food.\nWe\u2019ve dined at this outlet several times, good quality food is served here. If you enjoy milky curry, do give their green curry a try, tastier when soaked in the pineapple rice. Their appetizers are all good too, prawn cake is our favourite. Yummy Thai iced tea and green milk tea, sadly the mango sticky rice is always sold out. Take note that Jai Thai doesn\u2019t serve Thai pork dishes.\n\nDecent Thai food with reasonable price. I personally love their fried \u201cKang Kong\u201d and clear tomyam soup. Will try out other Thai dishes, green beef curry, pandan chicken, etc in the future\u2026\n\nBeen eating here for many years, maybe my own taste buds have changed as well but the food doesn't seem as good. A bit too sweet like every other generic thai food chain.\n\nOther than that the prices have gone up and portions have gone down, but that can be said for most places since COVID so it's understandable\n\n\nOption: 3:\nName: Good Eat\u2019s Family Restaurant\nAddress: 1 Tanjong Pagar Plz, #01-40, Singapore 082001\nPhone: 9088 5813\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20098:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20098:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20098:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20098:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20098:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20098:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20098:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 3.4\nReviews: \n\nTakeaway the roast pork dry noodle ($4.50) with braised egg ($0.70) on 12 June 2023.\n\nInitially wanted to eat the dumpling \ud83e\udd5f noodle but was informed no dumplings.

An entire birthday cake, not merely a slice, was given to us. Most dishes were great. The highlight of the meal was the seafood stew. All the breads were also exceptionally delicious. However, the sea bass tasted very ordinary and the sky high price tag went to the showy \u2018performance\u2019 by the chef. Restaurant was too dim and had a funky smell.\n\nThe staff are very friendly and the food is also tasty. The portion is surprisingly big and we ate till our hearts content.\n\nStaff very helpful and polite. Atmosphere is chill with soft music. Food serve just in the right timing.  Of cause the price is not cheap. But it worth the price overall.\n\nLastly thanks for the birthday cake. Love it but we were too full to finish it.\n\nBooked Sunday afternoon to have their set lunch, only to find out they only serve buffet that day at $78++ per person. Opted in anyway and didn't regret it, given the fresh ingredients, great taste of Italian and friendly staffs! Personally I love the dessert section especially Panna Cotta! If I had to pick on something, it'd be the dim lighting. No discount on the bill even with Shangri-la Circle membership, but you do get extra points.\n\nRemember, when you get into the lobby, you are on 3F. You need to take an elevator to get down to 1F where the restaurant is.\n\nThe restaurant has decent ambience for a semi chic and comfortable dinning experience. The salt crusted fish is delicious and if you want to see some fire show. The winner for me is the crab pasta. Yum!\n\nEverything about this place is 5 stars!\nThe ambience is so perfect that you are at ease the moment you are inside the restaurant. Menu is designed in such a way that you can have the best vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes without feeling less about your dish. Staff is courteous and even after attending so many guests, they always find time to attend to you/your requests. The serving is very clean and within time.

All dishes were cooked really well. Price point on the higher side. Would I come back? Probably. Is it worth the price? Hmm can\u2019t say for sure.\nThe food was undeniable good though\n\nFresh ingredients, taste of the original ingredients, simply steam the fresh crab with soya sauce, this require very fresh crab, and the soya sauce enhanced the taste.\n\nAnother dish I like was their yong tou fu, they make their own Toufu.\nIt was tender and the minced meat were well blend in their toufu.\n\nThe food here is excellent, very high quality and flavor is authentic and tasty. The peking duck is really good and the pancakes they used are really unique and delicious. Service is also very good even when busy. The restaurant ambience is very nice and is a great place for many occasions whether entertaining guests or celebrating family events\n\nOver the years, the food standard has dropped IMO as they were really good in their initial few years back in 2011 when the Island new clubhouse was completed. Nevertheless, we still patronize them as the savings on the 10% service charge as member helps to defray the costs of the meal. In addition, the roast duck is nicely done - crispy skin and juicy meat on the inside. As a member's club, the service level from the wait staff is acceptable.\n\nGreat place for a sit down family dinner. The service is good and food is yummy! Request for the table with the view - the sunset over the golf course was simply breathtaking!\n\n\nOption: 7:\nName: Trattoria da Mimmo Restaurant and Pizzeria\nAddress: 3 Clover Way, Singapore 579078\nPhone: 9088 2659\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:45\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:00\u202fPM, 5:45\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: Closed\nWednesday: 11:45\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:00\u202fPM, 5:45\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:45\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:00\u202fPM, 5:45\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:45\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:00\u202fPM, 5:45\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:45\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:00\u202fPM, 5:45\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:45\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:45\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.5\nReviews: \n\nCame here with a group of friends for dinner. Service was impeccable and the food - we had their pasta and pizza which was really delicious! Their dessert - lave cake was decadent as well. Would definitely come again!\n\nHad a great meal here, from starters of calamari, a tasty seafood soup and burata cheese, to a medley of freshly basked pizzas to hearty al dente pasta, everything we ordered was delicious and authentic. Had to call ahead to reserve for our party of 7 but had an enjoyable evening. Thanks to the helpful service and kitchen staff!\n\nExcellent food and awesome service! Food took quite awhile to come but as they say good things come to those who wait. We ordered both the pizza special (white sauce pizza with ham, mushrooms n some cheese) and pasta special (lobster pasta). I love that the pizza wasn\u2019t salty\u2026 Lobster pasta had so much depth of flavor, rest was also very generous with the lobster meat! Our bellies were very satisfied by the end of the meal. Awesome place!!\n\nSmall Italian restaurant located among the industrial and residential area at Marymount. They served authentic Italian food that was so good. Recommend to try their fried calamari, carbonara, squid ink pasta, grilled pork, anchovies pizza, lava cake.\n\nWent for dinner and had delicious pasta. Tried the spaghetti with clams and spaghetti with seafood and both were excellent. Tiramisu was delicious as well. Great service from the wait staff.

The food, service and atmosphere are nothing short of excellent.\n\nFor those who like spicy, find the chicken in the chill is a must order! The barramundi dish left a very good impression in my dining experience.\n\nOverall, highly recommend for you to come down and try! I will definitely come back again to try the other dishes.\n\nYou have to give this restaurant a try. This is my 3rd visit. I have always enjoyed their food. Presentation is top notch, like a piece of art. Though it's fusion food, the flavours of East and West are cohesive. In my opinion, the people who created the dishes have a profound knowledge of flavours and texture. Who would have thought of grilled octopus and feta cheese? Amazing flavours!\n\nSome of the best modern twist to Chinese food. I absolutely loved every dish I tried when I was there. Here are two of my favourite dishes.\nI spent my 18th anniversary there with my wife and we were absolutely impressed! I will definitely dine with you guys again! Unforgettable\n\nA very carefully designed location for a well-balanced preparation of such a lavish selection of appetisers, entrees, and desserts. Not to mention the coffee and cocktails they offer.\n\nService was also top-notch, from greeting us to showing us to our table, taking our orders, taking our pictures, and repeatedly checking to make sure everything was okay on our end.\n\nYou get the impression that everyone is catching up and having a good time, which somehow makes a romantic dinner seem more informal. Friends catching up and couples enjoying a good supper together make up 80/20 of the crowd.\n\nEverything about the experience was wonderful, including the ambiance, the cuisine, the service, and even how clean the restrooms were.\n\nWell done Birds of A Feather team and management. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK! SINGAPORE needs more places like yours. Congratulations for a job well done!\n\nThis is one of the best places in town for amazing lunch! The ambiance, service and food is worth the trip there. The amazing part of the food is that it\u2019s not too spicy and the ingredients and herbs are so delicately put together that just lifts the spirits up!

Maybe it\u2019s the Japanese families dining around you, but it feels exactly like Japan in this place. Although the food isn\u2019t the best, there is a warm homely flavour to the dishes. Had the seasonal special Hamburg rice with demi-glace sauce and was pleasantly surprised by the huge portion, with the beef being tender and not too gamey. Special shout-out for the salmon head which also comes in a generous portion for a very reasonable price!\n\nDo take note that only members may gain entry or bring guests to dine at the restaurants within the Japanese Association.\n\nWe adjourned here for desserts and coffee after lunch at Akane.  The staff here are friendly and helpful.\n\nIf possible, request for the private room at the end if you are a large group.  There is a $10 surcharge but this can be waived.\n\nThere are special offers which include free flow beverages for $3 each if you order a mains or dessert.  It was well worth it, as we could try their cold brew coffee, cappuccino, mango juice and teas etc.\n\nWe enjoyed desserts like matcha ice cream, coffee with vanilla ice cream, mochi and cheesecake cup.\n\nYou need to be a member or signed in by one to enter Akane or Donguri.\n\nHokkaido milk soft serve is the best.\nRestaurant closes at 8.30pm.\nMember only venue.\n\nThe service and taste must be good because it\u2019s the Japanese restaurant in the heart of Japanese Association... did look fine to me.\n\nThe dishes like set menu, donburi, and assorted sushi are around $20 should be good pricing. I actually felt like ordering Unagi Bento with a free drink bar for $27 or so...\n\nThe problem is, only the Japanese Association members or the escorted guests can dine there and I had to leave the place just before ordering like a guy in a wrong place.\n\nRestaurant is located inside of Japanese Association building, and need to be accompanied with member. Variation of food is quite good, covering from Japanese, Chinese to Western option. Quality of food is also good. Location could be a challenge as no MRT nearby (accessible only by bus).\n\n\nOption: 10:\nName: MTR Singapore\nAddress: 440 Serangoon Rd, Singapore 218134\nPhone: 6296 5800\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: Closed\nTuesday: 8:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 8:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 8:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 8:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 8:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 8:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.5\nReviews: \n\nNo comment is needed on the food served in MTR. super fresh.\n\nI ordered Rava Idly, Uddina Vada, Masala Dosa and Masala tea.\n\nRava Idly: coriander and nut and smth more in the Idly. soft and fluffy. perfect match with mint chutney.\n\nUddina Vada: wooooow. this is the heaven. 0.01mm of layer of crispy and very soft dough.

I will definitely come back again.\n\n\nOption: 3:\nName: Lotus Vegetarian Restaurant\nAddress: 103 Irrawaddy Rd, #02-07 Royal Square@Novena, Singapore 329566\nPhone: 8668 0090\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.3\nReviews: \n\nWe are not vegetarian but what is not to like? This place makes eating too enjoyable. The food is very very delicious and the service staff are very very attentive. Super recommendation coming from a pure meat and seafood lover.\n\nPetai - great sambal chili fried with a whole plate of goodness\n\nOlive fried rice - we had two plates, one after the other, enough to justify the deliciousness of the dish\n\nCurry 'mutton' - good curry but something seems to be lacking in the flavour\n\nSalted egg yolk - we had two plates of this too\n\nGlutinous yam (suan pan zi) - delicious? We had four plates of this.\n\nIt is in my personal humble opinion that you are missing out on very good food if you have not tried this as a vegetarian.\n\nFood is OK. The grilled mala fish is good! Impressive imitation of the texture very close to the real fish version.\nSatay is also nice.\nThe rest are so so. Kids says favourite truffle fried rice that is usually fragrant at other places has no truffle taste. Frankly, I prefer the high tea at their other outlet.\n\nVery delicious meal here! Portion is big price is reasonable. The fish is a must have! Very tasty \ud83d\ude0b I\u2019m a meat lover and I thoroughly enjoyed myself at this vegetarian restaurant. Good job to the chef! Staff was attentive.\n\nCelebrated our friend's birthday dinner at Lotus. It was indeed a great choice we've made and no regrets too. Food was well prepared and delicious. Atmosphere was chill and clean. Will come back again.\n\nWe came just to try the Grilled \"Fish\" and we were not disappointed albeit the flavour we chose does not resemble much of the original \u70e4\u9c7c. It was still tasty and we would want to return to try the other flavours. The other dishes were also pretty good. The tofu box was really interesting with some diced mushrooms that provide an unusual taste and texture. The spinach in superior broth was done really nicely it tasted so premium. Tau Kwa Goreng was perfectly fried but a little spicy for me.\n\nWe were seated near a cabinet and discard trolley where staff kept walking to & fro, sometimes talking over our heads as they reach for stuff. Pretty unpleasant and lack of service etiquette.\n\n\nOption: 4:\nName: Afterglow\nAddress: 24 Keong Saik Rd., Singapore 089131\nPhone: 6224 8921\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: Closed\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.1\nReviews: \n\nVisiting Afterglow was a vibrant journey into the heart of plant-based cuisine. The experience started with their signature Afterglow Maki Rolls, a perfectly balanced spicy and tangy treat that set my taste buds alight, though they were a bit dry; however, upon request, the waiter kindly offered me some complementary almond spread as a dip.\n\nNext came the Cauliflower \u2018Steak\u2019. It was nothing short of a culinary marvel, turning a humble vegetable into a dish bursting with flavor and texture, both hearty and delightful.\n\nFinally came the Acai Bowl, a dessert that defied all my expectations. It wasn\u2019t just a simple bowl of fruit and granola; it was an artful blend of fresh, juicy fruits, the crunch of granola, and the velvety smoothness of acai sorbet. Each spoonful was a celebration of taste, striking a rare balance between indulgence and health. This dish wasn\u2019t just the end of a meal; it was the highlight, leaving a lasting impression of how incredibly satisfying and diverse vegan food can be.\n\nAfterglow isn\u2019t just a restaurant; it\u2019s a testament to the beauty and richness of vegan cuisine. It\u2019s a place where every dish is crafted with care, not just for the flavors but for the story it tells about plant-based eating. For anyone who cherishes vegan food or is curious about it, Afterglow is a must-visit. I loved it and will definitely be back!\n\nHad a very attentive server explaining the ingredients behind the dishes. The menu is well marked for common allergens such as nuts, gluten, alliums, etc.\n\nWe absolutely loved the vegan meatballs. Each dish was flavorful and even our non-vegans friends had an enjoyable experience at this restaurant. The salads are also nicely seasoned. Would like to come back for their desserts next time.\n\nThe place is quite cozy and intimate but perhaps not suitable for larger groups (6+ people) as it is hard to navigate between tables.\n\nFirst time visited with a friend for a lunch. The ambience and atmosphere is relaxing. The food portions are quite big and very satisfying. Really grateful for the kind lady who explained us and asked us if we had any allergies etc and notified us of the dishes that have nuts at the same time gave some good recommendations. Very attentive, detailed and the food was delicious. Such a heartwarming experience.\n\nTheir last day of operation will be November 30. I love their food and the atmosphere. Anything with their vegan cheese sauce is delicious, such as their baked sweet potato fries \ud83c\udf5f Nothing is fried here btw - generally the food is rather health focused but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not tasty. Try their TomYum Zoodles, homemade dips and ofc the cheese sauce while you still can!\n\nSome of the dishes are very nice, but overall too pricey. I like the vegetable pur\u00e9e, tomyum zoodles and cold lasagne very much. The beetroot hummus is good too. Kimchi roll is decent as well.\n\n\nOption: 5:\nName: Sufood\nAddress: 252 North Bridge Rd, #02 - 19, Singapore 179103\nPhone: 6333 5338\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.4\nReviews: \n\nThere are new dishes. \ud83d\ude0d\nStaff friendly and the food is delicious\nToday Main Course ~~Cheesy Lemon Zest Liguine with Balsamic Vinegar (they can help removed onion garlic) and Lion's Mane Mushroom Steak with Crispy Mix Veggie.

The vegetables were tender and juicy, and the cheese sauce added a nice richness to the dish. The rice was fluffy and fragrant, and complemented the skewers well. The portion was satisfying and filling. The service was attentive and friendly, and the restaurant was cozy and modern. I would definitely recommend Sufood to anyone who loves vegetarian food or wants to try something different.\n\nThere are new dishes. Very nice place for vegetarian dishes which is not mock. Never fail to make you feel good after each meal with their smiley staff. Thank you!\n\nThe food is very delicious, it feels very healthy, and the service staff are very friendly and enthusiastic.

Wholesome vegetarian meal at decent pricing. Staff were helpful but clearly busy.\n\nThey also have a bread bar and small grocery corner selling fresh vegetables and interesting and healthy foodstuff. The coconut bun was tiny but so delicious. Ask for it to be heated up for you.\n\nA tip: it can get really packed so you might end up with a sofa seat rather than a dining table. Try booking a table!\n\nCompared to typical Chinese vegetarian restaurants, which serve mainly fried foods , this restaurant serves many greens options, and the salad really tastes good.\n\nOrdered three different types of pizza, and the odd one is the \"Tom Yum.\" Pizza tastes really a bit weird.  The taste of Yum ingredients does not blend well with the pizza \ud83d\ude05.\n\nWe also ordered two burgers, and they are very nice.\n\nOverall, this is a very nice restaurant for both vegetarian or non vegetarian persons who like to have a healthy meal \ud83d\ude0b\n\nVery pleasant ambience and super polite staff! I was so pleased to see that there were so many vegetarian options on the menu! :\u2019)\nThe turmeric risotto was quite interesting, it tasted and looked a lot like an Indian dish, ahaha! The pesto noodles were also quite good.\n\nA healthy vegetarian restaurant that serves great food along Orchard road. The ambience is very cosy and quite with separate sections.\nThe food is very fresh and delicious. Dumpling was served hot with a lot of ingredients inside. The salad is huge and I love the sauce so much.\nThis restaurant also provides nutrition count in their menu which is very convenient for anyone who is on diet or care about fitness.\nDefinitely will come back to try more if I'm around this area and want something fresh in a hot day.\n*water is charged.\n\nI find the restaurant a bit dim. The food was fabulous. Everything was nice, except for two. Tom yum pizza and the broccoli pizza. The taste was exotic and overwhelming for my wife and I. Rojak is a must try, and I love the varieties of Tea  in the Menu.

Love most of the dishes I tried in my multiple visits here. Highly recommended. There were alot of insects in the restaurant on the day of my visit but it could be because of the rain.\n\nOrdered via grab food. The kimchi jiggae healed my flu. The bulgogi fries were addictive.  The tteokbokki had the perfect chew.  Can't wait to actually eat at the restaurant to have a full experience.\n\nI enjoyed my dish Army Stew which as you can see from the photo was bubbling away for minutes. My wife was rather underwhelmed by her dish though unfortunately.\nThe Kimchi Jeon (pancakes) were nice enough though not better than Indian flavoured breads/uttapam in that the flavour was not as storied/flavourful as we expected.\nStaff were very nice and I'm sure if we had visited it when busier then we would have probably enjoyed it more. Their sister branch we happened to pass one evening and had a completely different feel, more intimate and cosy so we may try that another time. Very nice man on the reception.\n\nThe rare place that my daughter who is a vegan to enjoy Korean food. Surprisingly it's quite good even for a non-vegetarian like me.\n\nExceptional Korean food at a decent price.\n\nFood is excellent & service is prompt. Tofu soup is delicious and flavourful, with the ingredients generously portioned. Omelette & Kimbap are also great.\n\nThis is also one of the few Korean places I've encountered where the Kimchi pancake can be shared between 2 people, which is great if you aren't dining in a large group.\n\nDefinitely give this place a try if you get the chance!

White chutney was coconuty and spicy.\n\nTotal score: 15/15\n\nAdd-ons: Masala Tea ($4.16) was fragrant from the spices used and warm and comforting to drink.\n\nThere was a little waiting time but it was definitely worth the wait as the plain thosai was very delicious. From the thosai to the sambar and the two different chutney. Service team were really responsive to requests and new orders.\n\nThe place was brightly lit and a cozy place to have your Indian vegetarian classic as well as your familiar Singaporean dishes with a vegetarian twist.\n\nPerfect if you visit with friends/family as you can order various things from the menu and share them together. Our favorites are the biryani and butter naan. Read many reviews saying that the carrot cake is a must try but it didn\u2019t really suit our palettes. The samosas are tasty but not very special. The lychee drink is refreshing, really helps after a long walk exploring the city. Would definitely visit again on our next trip to SG.\n\nThe first time I went there, I had the vegetable briyani, Gobi 65, Aloo Gobi and mango lassi. The food was good and the lassi was awesome, don\u2019t fade the lassi.\n\nThe second time that I went there, I had the fried carrot cake, murtabak and Gobi Manchurian and I\u2019ll say to skip the Gobi Manchurian as the cauliflower was almost non-existent and I was just eating a lot of batter. The fried carrot cake is decent for an vegan take as it is not commonly available and the murtabak is alright but can be skipped.\n\nFood was really nice. Enjoyed the dishes! The service can be improved, we were more or less asked to leave the moment we finished our food. We understand that they have limited seating and a queue but just felt rushed.\n\nGood variety on the menu but I do find it moderately highly priced. Service was typical yet they really do have interesting things on the menu with Chinese and muslim influence. It has its own character but I do very much prefer pure Indian cuisine. It\u2019s nice for the occasional change. Location was good, walking distance to the Little India train station and restaurant is clean and cool with air conditioning.\n\n\nOption: 9:\nName: Ananda Bhavan Restaurant (Vegetarian)\nAddress: 95 Syed Alwi Rd, Singapore 207671\nPhone: 6398 0837\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 7:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 7:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 7:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 7:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 7:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 7:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 7:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 3.8\nReviews: \n\nFood is good, Service is good too. A little improvement can be done in the seating area and hygienic. They could have much better crowd comming in with that.\n\nVisited Anand Bhavan, opposite to Mustaffa after a long time few years later. I always recommend to visit and try their menu. This is Indian Vegetarian Resturant, better to try their tiffins items rather than rice items. Service will be quick, though there was a huge rush, served within 10 mins. Tired their Masala Rava Dosa, Mini Sambar Idly, Sambar Vada, Onion Uttappam and Poori set, and all\nOf them tasted good. Sambar have lot of Brinjals only instead they can add lot of other vegetables also.\n\nWrong decision to visit this place and worst was to ask for take away. Just wanted to get idly set take away and thought that it would be fast. But unfortunately, waited for about 30 minutes after payment was made. The place has kitchen next to the washroom entrance and it was smelly and very unpleasant to stand there to wait for my order to be delivered to me. Overall, not very clean place to visit. Observed many foreigners there who might be looking for only vegetarian food and had limited choice rather to be there. I am sure it could be managed better in terms of cleanliness, service, order management for simple stuff. However, I was there after many years and may take me another few years to step in again.\n\nPrice: $3.60 (Plain Thosai)\n\nPlain Thosai: 5/5\nThosai was savoury, crispy, soft and had a good sour flavour.\n\nSambar: 4.5/5\nSambar was savoury, flavourful, a little sweet from the vegetables and familiar tasting.\n\nChutney: 5/5\nThe orange chutney was flavourful, tomatoey and a little spicy. The white chutney was quite gingery and sweet from the coconut. The brown chutney tasted peanuty, savoury and was rather spicy.\n\nTotal score: 14.5/15\n\nAdd-ons: Masala Tea ($2.60) was fragrant, warm and comforting but could use more spices.\n\nService was fast and I received my thosai within 5 minutes. It will be quicker to get your drinks directly from Counter 1 at the restaurant as they seem slightly short-handed in the drinks area. The lady managing counter 1 is really nice and makes your drinks after seeing your receipt. I saw this as a good thing since I could decide when I wanted to have my masala tea instead of having it served while I was having my thosai.\n\nThe place was air conditioned and the place can get crowded and is a really bustling place near lunch time.\n\nAll in all, I enjoyed my brunch of thosai and masala tea at Ananda Bhavan Restaurant (Vegetarian). :)\n\nOne of the popular South Indian breakfast places of Singapore. The food preparation is Tamil style and quantity is apt.\n\nOverall the taste, quality and hygiene was good and rates were genuine.\n\n\nOption: 10:\nName: Fo You Yuan \u4f5b\u6709\u7f18\u7d20\u98df\u9986\nAddress: 103 Desker Rd, Singapore 209625\nPhone: 6744 8009\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: Closed\nTuesday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.2\nReviews: \n\nWhat a hidden gem! Very homely and cosy environment with great food!\nWe enjoyed every dish and the innovation behind each of them. Unique dishes not seen elsewhere and the set meal allowed us to have a taste of all the great dishes. Most dishes were made from scratch, even the ikan bilis! All made with minimal or no seasoning and all natural ingredients. Yum! \ud83d\ude0d\nVery worth it and I'll definitely be back again!\n\nGreat for celebrations. Remember to make a reservation. We were a group of 11 people and service was great. They made special provisions for parking because we had a family member with mobility issues. We also had a birthday cake and celebration.\n\nFoodwise, in my opinion \u4f5b\u6709\u7f18 serves the most unique vegetarian cusine in Singapore. The best is still Miao Yi (for personal reasons) but it closed down \ud83d\ude22 Forget about the \u81ea\u5728 \"empire\", Shu and coffee shop zizar, it's always the same old thing.\n\nWe had the cold dish with \"ice vegetable\" salad, which is really good. The yuzu monkey head mushroom is always a hit. The sugarcane flower is unique. And last and not the least, the humble bee hoon - is always a family favourite.\n\nA Delightful Vegetarian Culinary Journey at Fo You Yuan Vegetarian Restaurant\n\nApart from the outstanding food, the service at Relocate Vegetarian Restaurant was impeccable. The staff members were friendly, attentive, and eager to cater to our needs, making us feel welcomed and valued throughout our dining experience.\n\nOverall, Relocate Vegetarian Restaurant has truly impressed us with their diverse and mouthwatering selection of dishes. Whether you\u2019re a vegetarian or simply looking to explore plant-based alternatives, this restaurant is an absolute gem. We highly recommend it to anyone seeking a memorable dining experience with top-notch vegetarian cuisine.\n\nThe delicate strands of noodles were expertly stir-fried with an assortment of fresh vegetables, creating a harmonious medley of taste and aroma.\n\nThe Rendang was a true masterpiece. The rich and aromatic coconut-based curry was impeccably spiced, resulting in a tantalizing symphony of flavors.\n\nOne of the highlights of our meal was the Vegetarian Shark\u2019s Fin Soup. It was a delightful surprise to find a cruelty-free alternative that retained the essence and texture of the traditional dish.\n\nThe Sweet & Sour dish was a perfect balance of tanginess and sweetness, complemented by succulent mushroom and an assortment of colorful bell peppers and pineapples.\n\nTo end our meal on a sweet note, we indulged in the Yam Paste with Gingko Nuts. The smooth and velvety yam paste was flawlessly cooked and paired beautifully with the tender gingko nuts\n\nOld school vegetarian restaurants good not too salty good service. Friendly staff. Must try for old school vegetarian restaurants. They have moved a few times already hopefully they can stay here. Finally found them again. I have been eating at this restaurant over 15 years now...still as good as the first time I tried....\n\nI'm super glad that we have a Chinese vegetarian in Desker Road, stone throwaway from Mustafa. Food was authentic and feeling good old days. Fantastic and thank you for opening an outlet in Little India.\n",

Quality of the chicken is fantastic with very juicy juice that flows out each bites and the taste for both original and spicy chicken are speechless! First time eating and I have to praise their effort to make it so delicious for us to enjoy a simple delicacy.\n\nJollibee Novena Management and services is very poor. Ordered serve were incomplete. Sizes or chicken are really not same or cur is very small.\nI ordered 2 pc chicken joy with 2 side meal with rice but no rice given to us.\n\nThe cut of chicken is very small. Not worth the price\n\nDissapointed with their quality of food. My chicken was underweight and cold when served. The meat was dry, full of bones and not crispy, and the standard was a far cry from when they first opened in Singapore. Though there was only one staff attending to the walk-in counter orders and collection, the staff was also looking at her phone, not paying attention when I walked up and stood in front of her to request for chilli. I'm certainly not going back to this outlet again.\n\nTried the fried chicken for the 1st time. Its pretty decent\n\nQuite nice but seems smaller portion than other fast food chain's. also the parts are not as meaty.\ngot two tubs of unknown sauce or gravy along with the chicken n fries. the coke zero tasted dilute than from bottle. wonder if they put ice cube in container to chill the drink.

I went with my wife on a Saturday afternoon for lunch and surprisingly, there was no queue. Waited a bit to make my order at the counter and ordered a 4-pieces meal for 2 before making payment. FYI, only Nets or cash is accepted. Service was relatively fast and everything was ready on a big serving tray. The chicken meat is juicy and tender. I like the seasonings and marination on the meat which are way better than other chain fried chicken outlets. The fried buns are an interesting and delicious side which complement the mashed potatoes and coleslaw. All in all, a very satisfying meal and I would definitely return whenever I crave fried chicken\n\nAs an Eastie for over 50 years, I must have been living under the rock. Today is our first time ever visit Arnold\u2019s Fried Chicken. Singapore\u2019s very own KFC.\n\nWhat can I say? Move over, KFC !\nAFC is way yummier. The chicken is moist (I suspect the chicken might have been marinated with milk or Yoghurt) and the \u201csand\u201d-blasted chicken skin is crispy.\nEven the coleslaw is fresher than KFC\u2019s.\n\nAll I can say is that AFC has won a new fan !\n\nHappily enjoying 39 year old chicken recipe with family. Great eatery concept. Simple food queue system way of ordering. It\u2019s tender chicken set will get your fingers wanting for more. Brilliant coleslaw for all to share. Here we go for fried chicken goodness.\n\nwent for lunch on monday. outlet is quite small with about 12-15 four seaters.\nfood was served fast.\nfried chicken tastes better than other fried chicken faat food chains.\neverthing else is self service.\nstaff came around regularly to clear table\n\nIt has been many years since I last ate here.\n\nThe fries were rather disappointing as they were cut too thick and were not hot and crispy.\n\nThe chicken on the other hand was pretty good. It was freshly fried and crispy and delicious.\n\nWhile not knocking on the food quality at Arnold's, I believe Popeye's chicken presents better value for your money, as the set meal comes with a soft drink whereas at Arnold's it is charged separately.\n\n\nOption: 3:\nName: MOS Burger Express\nAddress: 200 Holland Ave, B1-03 MRT Station, Singapore 278995\nPhone: 6235 5721\nDelivery Available: Information Not Available\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 2.7\nReviews: \n\nFinally got to try MOS Burger's onigiri as it is only available in express outlets and not regular outlets. As an onigiri lover who tried various ones in Japan and Taiwan, i had to say that it was a disappointment. Primarily the rice was too soft and mushy that it could hardly hold its shape together. The tuna filling was fine. Not gonna buy again. The express outlet did provide a convenient quick stop for a bite and service was ok.\n\nBBQ Cheese Wagyu Burger doesnt taste like bbq... taste like tomato sauce... parfait the mochi is frozen... horrible..\n\nI don't know why they are rated so low, but as someone who treats Mos like their macs and eats it super frequently, this place produced the best fish burger I had from MOS overall. I didn't get the name but the slim man with specs had such a sweet and polite service. What a lovely spot for a quick meal!\n\nWhat I like. This is a good place to stop, get what you want, and go. There are limited seats. The milk/lemon tea comes with syrup separately which is good since you can adjust. There is also an auto machine. There is customized salad in a cup.\n\nWhat I dun like. They dun have the normal cheese burger in the menu. Everything is a tab more high class and expensive. But subjected to change.

I am glad I found one in Singapore. They are now certified halal. So, even better. I got the set with a crispy chicken burger, fried chicken, fries and a drink. The crispy chicken burger was not spicey at all but the size was good. The fried chicken was juicy, but not spicy as claimed. Fries was very small. Drink was not refillable. Service was a bit slow and could be improved. The restaurant was maybe half full at the time. So, easy to find seating. Overall, pretty good but a bit underwhelming compared to my experiences at Jollibee in the middle east. Portions are a bit bigger there and the drinks are always refillable.\n\nFirsr time here in 10 years\nSelf service kiosk menu was useless, spagherti was not available however at the counter it was, store does not accept visa or mastercard and thats a massive disappointment.\nFood took a while to be served, everthing was just warm\nThe uncle incharge of bussing tables were chucking all the left overs on a separate open trash bag instead for using the bins itself and that's unhygenic\n\nDissapointed!\n\nThe line was insane\u2026.. probably 30 mins in line and then 40 mins waiting for our order to be cooked because there was so many people BUT they did not lie about the chicken because how was it so juicy even with breast meat my mind is blown?? Skin was so crispy it was delicious. The burger was also really good, typical spicy chicken burger there was nothing not to like about it. Spaghetti was yummy too, yes it was sweet but not overwhelming, peach and mango pie was great!!!\n\nChicken joy and palabok is very delicious.. good for family and friends.

Compared to KFC the chicken is not as greasy, has a nice spicy heat to it, the cheese fries were good, and the chicken tenders were very good. The location is inside the entrance to a busy MRT line, so easy to get to. Seems to be popular with shoppers and local business workers\n\nIt's one of my favourite fast food fried chicken for a quick bite. The fried chicken is always served hot. Mashed potatoes sauce is good.\n\nThe Mac and cheese looked kind of ugly but the taste was great. The mashed potatoes and the biscuits were also delicious. My few criticisms of it was that the chicken in the chicken sandwich was kind of soggy and not that crispy. I was also not able to get a straw for my drink.

The burger was delicious, with a crispy chicken patty and cheese covered generously with truffle sauce.\n\nDeserve a 0 rating! Dirty tables, extremely poor service, and surprisingly rude people, especially, Thava  who claims to be the manager. Such ineptitude is disgraceful for a manager. She handed us the tray, instead of the take out bag as we had ordered. Moreover, 25% of our order was missing. When asked her about the poor service, she remarked rudely that she was busy. No apology, zero finesse. Shame on you Burger King! Folks don't go here unless you're itching for a bad experience!\n\nThey managed to mess up even with the simplest order. Ordered tempura chicken nuggets with curry sauce, and somehow, they didn't give me the sauce. The chocolate Sunday with mint candies in the picture tasted so bad. The soft serve is too sweet but not milky. The candies are stale as if they were old. They gave very little chocolate syrup (compared to McDonald's), which made it even worse. It's definitely my last visit of BK, especially for this outlet.\n\nAbsolutely horrible crew service. I see my order prepared and it cons the the counter. Crew checks and calls pit a number. I inform them that this is my order and she insists it is not. It is a number she called a while back. I asked again as she continues to call out the same number. She then decides to check and finds out its my order and just simply says yours and walks away. No apology or any form. I guess this gives me another reason to avoid fast food like Burger King and to eat at home. Foe the cost, triple the amount of food. Thus happened at 11.05 am today at CLARK Quay Burger King.\n\nBurger King food was pretty consistent with other Burger King branches. Food was fresh and quite quickly prepared. Wiping clean of tables and dine-in area could be improved.\n\n\nOption: 9:\nName: McDonald's\nAddress: 163 Ang Mo Kio Ave 4, #01-438, Singapore 560163\nPhone: 6777 3777\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 6:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:00\u202fAM\nTuesday: 6:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:00\u202fAM\nWednesday: 6:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:00\u202fAM\nThursday: 6:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nFriday: Open 24 hours\nSaturday: Open 24 hours\nSunday: 6:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:00\u202fAM\n\nPrice Level: 1 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.1\nReviews: \n\nWent to purchase for take away, around 1.40am just now at this outlet.\n\nService staff so nonchalant.

I love their nuggets. apple pies. corn and esp their French fries. You cannot find anywhere that give you the type of French fries that Mcdonath have. You must have it there to get the most of it. Once you pack back though still taste good but not as good as you have it there. I also love their chicken nuggets. Both my hubby and me love to have our Mcdonath meals in house. We never pack back to get the best of it. Service provided at most of its store are good and tip top. Keep it up Mcdonath.\n\nLove the new breakfast bagel! Shld keep it permanent on the menu, pls! Perfect.\n\nThe team works very slowly, food is subpar. Service needs some work to say the least. Ordered food at a non peak period and it took pretty long to get my food ready. This is regardless of dine in or take out. And the outlet has been this way for awhile. I honestly have no idea how it has sustained business this long\n\n\nOption: 10:\nName: Jollibee\nAddress: 60 Paya Lebar Rd, #01-05/06/07, Singapore 409051\nPhone: None\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 3.8\nReviews: \n\nLoyal supporter at Jollibee\u2019s other branches. First time coming back to Paya Lebar outlet since Covid period and was totally disappointed with what I got. Ordered a two piece meal for takeaway. While one piece was quite good, the other piece looked dubious, as if it was some left over half eaten piece of chicken. What\u2019s with the tiny piece of bony fried meat that left me wondering which part of the chicken it was. Don\u2019t they even QC their chicken parts before serving to customers? Hope that they can at least have more pride in their work and respect for customers.\n\nThe sundae is just half cup and it'selting already . And I ask the crew if this is the standard and she said Yes .\ud83e\udd74poor service . .I worked in Jollibee also that's why I know what is the standard portion of Sundae \ud83d\ude04\n\nThe 2nd photo is Sundae from Jollibee BEDOK u can see the difference \ud83e\udd74\n\nChicken is fresh n juicy. Pasta a bit sweet, overall $7.40 for one pc chicken n pasta, 3 out of 5*\n\nThe food is a one of a kind good, the menu also has a wide variety of food from burgers, to spaghetti and even more! The service was also too good to be true, the good was served in a flash and they were also very kind to their customers. The atmosphere was also very peaceful. All in all the experience was one of the best i have ever experienced.\n\nFood is great\u2026 hottest chicken I\u2019ve ever had in SG. But they have only one kiosk and no Paywave \ud83d\ude1f\n",

Service was great - the hostess was warm and friendly, and explained dishes clearly. Food was good - subtle flavours that meshed really well together, and beautiful presentation. The lamb in particular was executed perfectly. I also loved the mignardises and that the kitchen was open but calm and not chaotic.\n\nHere for birthday lunch, cosy setting but nothing much to shout about for the interior. Had the lunch menu, food is good but nothing really outstanding that I can remember. Hmm maybe Cherry Gazpacho is quite special. Perhaps its a normal lunch menu, maybe should come back again for special collaborations when they have one.\n\nSome changes to the menu itself. Menu is very refreshing, akin like the Spring season. As always, hostess & chef hospitality are the best. To us, their food, restaurant atmosphere, relationships between staffs & us are what made us being their regulars.\n\nA very nice ambiance intimate dining room that caters to about 6 pax capacity and some counter seats for perhaps, Omakase? Set menus are definitely French and heavy on seafood.\n\nThe service was nicely paced, dishes was explained, and professional. Their wine recommendation was good as well.\n\nThe presentation of each dish is where the star is. The taste is ok, balanced.\n\nRecommended for date night, probably not the best suit for big  groups or business dinner unless you reserve private room.\n\nWe booked the restaurant to celebrate our 25th year wedding anniversary.\nWe took the $268 set dinner and added on foie gras ($20) for one of our dinner set, and changed one of the dessert to cheese truffle.\nAll the dishes are wonderfully made, and even the bread basket (uniquely in a cloth pouch) is warm and hot, with specially made bread spread.\nThe service is amazing and special mentioned to Louis who has made our experience really enjoyable.\nWe also had Yamanaka-san who personally served us for one of the dishes.\nThe downside for the place is that it is a small restaurant and seatings are quite closed to one another. It's no issue for us and we mingled with other patrons.\nHighly recommended.\n\n\nOption: 2:\nName: PUTIEN Kitchener Road\nAddress: 127 Kitchener Rd, Singapore 208514\nPhone: 6295 6358\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 9:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fAM, 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.5\nReviews: \n\nIt was absolutely delicious.

Chilled abalone and pig trotter jelly was a good, refreshing\u00a0start. Next up was sea cucumber in abalone sauce and buns with shredded pork meat. Delicious! The main dish was a pot of braised pork belly with abalone yet\u00a0again. A small portion of Buddha jumps over the wall to conclude the feast \ud83d\ude0a\n\nI really enjoyed the smooth, clean taste of all dishes.

The food, the service and the atmosphere was all incredible. We were treated to the most wonderful waiter in Arvin whose wine knowledge and food explanations were the highlight of the day. He answered all our questions and was forthcoming and generous in sharing his food knowledge. All the dishes were fantastic and very flavoursome. I can\u2019t wait to come back again! We had the amekase menu.\n\nHaving dined at this Peranakan restaurant upon a family member's recommendation, we were eager to experience its Michelin-acclaimed cuisine. Opting for the tasting menu, we were treated to an exceptional culinary journey. As someone with Southeast Asian roots, I might be a bit biased, but I must say this restaurant truly stood out. It exceeded my expectations and proved deserving of its Michelin accolade.\n\nHad this slightly less than a year back. Food was delicious, staff were attentive to all our requests. Restaurant was nicely located at Dempsey with free parking. Knowing that we were celebrating a birthday, they gave us a small dessert (kinda) which I felt was very thoughtful of them. The staff were also patient in taking countless number of picture for us. Definitely deserving of the one Michelin star. Will definitely be back again in future!\n\nI believe this brings the best of Peranakan fine dinner to the guest. Dishes are true to the original flavors yet giving a refreshing new twist. Great place to bring visitors to try our local delights but elevated.\n\nFantastic experience. The food was both friendly and approachable, given these were ingredients I've never tried before. Think elevated family meals cooked perfectly. Patrick and the rest of the staff were professional and genuinely proud of the food.

Food was good, and the portions were fairly generous for fine dining. What I found extra special was who each dish was beautifully presented with such intricate details.\n\nFood was hands down beating expectations. I knew it would be amazing for a Michelin star restaurant but I actually thought it was better quality than just a 1 star. Also appreciated the large diversity in courses and in between tasters for the full menu. If anything there can be too much food you get full!. The smaller space feels more intimate and nice to look into the kitchen area. The option to choose your tasting size was also nice\n\nCons\n- entrance door is difficult to find for building\n- wine list is long\u2026but not high diversity in selection. It seemed like the median price was $800-$1000 for any wine bottle. Not many options for simpler but quality,  less exclusive wines. Also although wine is \u201cthe\u201d thing for most of these places, still wish there was more spirit friendly options\n\nMy favourite fining dining experience in Singapore. The food was exquisite, delicately well-balanced and carefully served. The ambience was intimate and soothing. The butter and bread was heavenly tasty, soft and aromatic.\n\nIt was a birthday celebration for us and we had a wonderful time. Definitely recommended for a special occasion.\n\nStunningly well presented and proportioned lunch taster menu. From the first perfectly warmed brioche and seasoned butter, through an exquisite selection of canap\u00e9s, fish, duck and desserts the team provide culinary delights that will challenge your vocabulary to do justice to the experience of your tastebuds.\n\nWe had the lunch tasting menu (SGD 148) and it was absolutely amazing. Their Parker house roll with Shio Kombu butter was packed with intense umami, and I would have demolished the whole bun (6 servings) if I didn't have breakfast (haha).\n\nThe menu is French, with a pretty heavy Japanese influence. Appetizers came in small bites that piqued the palette. The small bites were:\n\nAnkimo glazed in Ponze with Katsuoboshi cream and salted radish\nSmoked Eel Riletter with apple and marigold\nSpring pea tartlet with smoked cream crue and marinated Ikura\n36 month aged comte cheese cornet\n\nThe main appetizer was a picturesque feature of aged Hamachi with fennel, shiso and N25 Kaluga Reserve. Superbly refreshing and slightly salty, it set up the tone for the next heavier main course - the Roasted Venison with green asparagus. I could say that this is one of the best roasted venison I've ever tasted - so tender and flavourful, with no gaminess to it. Beautifully executed!\n\nI was also immensely impressed by their dessert - to be honest I feel a lot of fine dining restaurants are a letdown when it comes to desserts, like falling off a sharp cliff in the tasting experience, but I was super super happy that their desserts allowed us to end the meal on a high note. The warm and light pistachio souffle was a perfect complement to the cold and rich Abinao chocolate with espresso cremeux.\n\nThe only part I felt they could improve on was the petit fours, not bad but a tad bitter for the earl grey tart and the canel\u00e9 was way too hard. But look how pretty the Choux is with white chocolate butterflies on top! There was definitely a lot of effort from the pastry chef.\n\nOverall an amazing experience and I think well worth the price tag!\n\n\nOption: 7:\nName: Iggy's\nAddress: 581 Orchard Rd, Level 3 voco Orchard Singapore, an IHG Hotel, Singapore 238883\nPhone: 6732 2234\nDelivery Available: No\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: Closed\nTuesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20091:30\u202fPM, 6:30\u2009\u2013\u20098:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20091:30\u202fPM, 6:30\u2009\u2013\u20098:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20091:30\u202fPM, 6:30\u2009\u2013\u20098:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20091:30\u202fPM, 6:30\u2009\u2013\u20098:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20091:30\u202fPM, 6:30\u2009\u2013\u20098:30\u202fPM\nSunday: Closed\n\nPrice Level: 4 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.3\nReviews: \n\nOne - starred Michelin restaurant located within Voco Hotel (previously known as Hilton Orchard), serving Modern-Contemporary cuisine,established by Restaurateur-Sommelier Ignatius Chan in 2004. There is heavy influence of japanese ingredients used in the menu and served in the European way. Opt for the menu with two main courses for a wholesome dining experience. Food presentation is beautiful and tastefully presented, and what's good to look at is also good to eat.\n\nLovely experience.  Good service and attentive staff. Well deserved Michelin star with the food. Has fantastic courses paired with champagne. Air- conditioning is way too cold and freezes everyone. Any warm dish turns cold too quickly. Dessert was also a star and did not let down the entire course of dinner. Felt the staff could have been more confident in introducing each course.\n\nCame here to celebrate our anniversary, a surprise dinner planned by my husband for us. The restaurant is intimate with only a few tables available, so you get undivided attention from the staff. It is also an open kitchen concept which I love so you can see the chefs hard at working preparing their masterpieces for us. I enjoyed pretty much every single dish, the abalone wellington was definitely unique and one of a kind. Overall had a really good experience here.\n\nHad our belated anniversary lunch at Iggy\u2019s as we were having a staycation at Hilton. A lovely resturant with friendly and helpful crew. Love the fact that we are able to view how the chef and his team prepared our meals to the kitchen.\n\nAs the husband and I do not take raw fish, the chef was able to customize to our taste by searing the fish, love how the raw yolk enhances the overall taste of the dish. They did an interesting take on the sponge gourd which brought the vegetable to another level. The linguine was average. The roast beef has charred edges which was a nice touch. Overall we enjoyed the 5 course meal at $150++ per pax.\n\nCame here for lunch with 2 overseas guests who would like to taste a Michelin restaurant.  Decided to bring them to Iggy's as the restaurant has been one that has been keeping their reputation for years. Food was great as you can see in pictures.. perhaps ..some touch up to the interior may make the place feel warm and friendly.\nDamage : $200 (lunch)/pax\n\n\nOption: 8:\nName: Les Amis\nAddress: 1 Scotts Rd, #01 - 16 Shaw Centre, Singapore 228208\nPhone: 6733 2225\nDelivery Available: No\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:00\u202fPM, 7:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:00\u202fPM, 7:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:00\u202fPM, 7:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:00\u202fPM, 7:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:00\u202fPM, 7:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:00\u202fPM, 7:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:00\u202fPM, 7:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 4 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.6\nReviews: \n\nLes Amis restaurant is a gastronomic wonderland that transported me to a world of culinary bliss! The ambiance felt like a page out of a Parisian romance novel, with soft lights and a melody of enchanting tunes. The menu, a poetic composition of flavors, offered a dance of taste that left me in awe. The waitstaff, dressed in elegant attire, choreographed a dining experience that was nothing short of a culinary ballet. Each dish, a masterpiece plated with precision, tasted like a symphony of harmonious ingredients. If you're yearning for a dining escapade that feels like a rendezvous with gourmet dreams, Les Amis is the destination to indulge your palate in a poetic feast!\n\nOrdered the dark chocolate cake and it was so delicious! The cake is placed on top of a tart shell which is very special. Almonds are super fragrant too.\nHope that delivery service can be included in the future and handwriting on the chocolate could be better \ud83d\ude05\n\nHad a very pleasant dining experience at Les Amis. Patrick, our server, was very friendly, attentive, and entertaining. He suggested a perfect wine to have with the steak. He also patiently explained every dish to us. The amuse bouche tartalette with bacon and mushrooms was a good introduction to the meal. Notable food from our dinner are the French egg, crab souffl\u00e9, simmered celery root, salted brioche, herb sorbet, and poached pears. The caviar that was thoughtfully used in some of the dishes is an interesting addition of a complex salt flavor; it did not overwhelm the taste of the other ingredients. The wagyu was tender but I expected a bit more flavor and it lacked a bit of surprise. The herb sorbet is most interestingly a refreshing palate cleanser. Overall, it was a memorable and pleasant gastronomic experience.\n\nTruly Michelin 3 stars! Excellent food with great creativity,  best service, excellent wine pairing, and the deserts are the best.  Not cheap but it is worth it!\n\nEverything was impeccable, the food was great and the portions were generous, great wine pairings and amazing service.\nToni and the team were very kind and took genuine care of us.\nThe Blu Lobster appetizer, their sour dough, the riz de veu and the cheese course were divine.\nHighly recommended.\n\n\nOption: 9:\nName: Rhubarb\nAddress: 3 Duxton Hill, Singapore 089589\nPhone: 8127 5001\nDelivery Available: No\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:15\u202fPM, 6:30\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:15\u202fPM, 6:30\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: Closed\nThursday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:15\u202fPM, 6:30\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:15\u202fPM, 6:30\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:15\u202fPM, 6:30\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nSunday: Closed\n\nPrice Level: 4 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.6\nReviews: \n\nVisited in Jul 2023\n\nThe last time I had visited Rhubarb was 4-5 years ago. So a revisit was a long time coming. Good food and great service as always. There are 3 options/dining experiences you can choose from. I went for the most comprehensive one - 3 starters, 1 main with chef\u2019s premium ingredient and 1 dessert.\n\nWhile I can see how Rhubarb has been able to maintain its 1 star for so many years, I struggled a bit to find some key differentiating factor versus other French contemporary Michelin places. Good food nonetheless.\n\nService was really good. The dishes kept coming fast and I was done with my entire dinner in an hour.\n\nAll in all a very good dining place. If you haven\u2019t been there, it is definitely worth going.\n\nThe 4-course lunch Omakase was very very satisfying, with interesting notes and flavours that I\u2019m pleasantly surprised by. I also really enjoyed my chat with Joseph as a solo diner, so that my lunch was a little livelier. I had an absolutely lovely time and would return again.\n\nDecided to go last min as I suddenly met a long time friend. She said she didn\u2019t want to eat something too heavy. The starters were mainly seafood and fruits, which opened up her appetite after a full day of hard stress work. The main was a tender slowed cooked beef. Dessert was a coconut sorbet I think (?). Accompanied the meal with a Riesling. We quite enjoyed the night.\nFunny note, one of the appetisers is a mix of fruits and seafood, I confused the apple with an olive. The taste was good though. Please don\u2019t change the dish because of my comment.\n\nFood are all tastefully plated and delicious. They were kind to ask me if I have dietary restrictions and I told them I would like to have all cooked food. So they made changes for me to replace the lightly torched scallops to cooked crab stick for appetiser. Really appreciate it:) every dishes were all well explained and executed.\n\nOutstanding food, worth its Michelin star. Service is friendly. The atmosphere is a little bit let down by the lighting and impersonal musical background. Overall a very nice place to have an amazing meal. Prices very reasonable.\n\n\nOption: 10:\nName: Hjh Maimunah Restaurant and Catering\nAddress: 11 Jln Pisang, Singapore 199078\nPhone: 6297 4294\nDelivery Available: Information Not Available\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 7:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20096:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 7:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20096:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 7:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20096:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 7:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20096:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 7:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20096:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 7:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20096:30\u202fPM\nSunday: Closed\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.4\nReviews: \n\nOkay\u2026 the food is good enough to make the queue worth it. The queue moves super slow mostly due to some staff takes very long in dishing. But trust me, the food is worth the chaos in getting the food. Plenty of seating including upstairs.\n\nTheir specialty is the spicy squid in squid ink sauce. It\u2019s quite spicy but flavourful. Other classic dishes like fried tofu with egg, chicken curry, beef rangdong and variety of fried dishes are all done well.\n\nIt\u2019s Michelin bib, and we are fan of nasi Padang. The black squid samba was great.  The rendang chicken was a little over cooked but the flavourful gravy help.  The the handout anchovies potatoes chilli was ok. Asam fish was well done with perfect ladyfingers.  The samba chilli provided was very fresh and right amount of spiciness and flavour. Cuttlefish was forgettable. Tahgay long bean salad cannot go wrong. Yes I will be back again.  Here there is more consistency than many other NP restaurants around the area.\n\nDecided to give them a try because of good reviews. There\u2019s more seats available upstairs and it\u2019s air conditioned.\n\nThere\u2019s one shared toilet upstairs too.\n\nOrdered some dishes to share for 2 paxs and it cost us $26.60.\n\nHonestly speaking, beef rendang and fried chicken is tough and dry. Brinjal was bland.  Begedel is soggy. Asam ikan taste okay.\nAlso, food wasn\u2019t served hot.\n\nStayed nearby and came to eat here almost every day! Food is authentically Indonesian and tastes absolutely delicious, they accept credit card payments as well which is quite a novelty in small shops in Singapore (dont know why). Everything we tried was good \ud83d\udc4d\n\nLike what many claimed, this was one of those long saved but not checked off places in my books too - finally found a day in which we are craving for some spicy food and decided to head down here!\n\nAt 1:30pm, the queue was still stretching out of the store, although it does move relatively quickly, it\u2019s pretty hard to get a table even with second level seating - somewhat like a hawker centre if I may.\n\nThe selection was in abundance compared to the other Nasi Padang stalls (which really isn\u2019t in the same league), from the normal begedil to the rare tahu goreng.\n\n\ud83d\udcb0 the price point is okay - though the tahu goreng at $8 was pricier than the fish and chicken which were $5 a piece.\n\nFood was really good in general! The tahu goreng, grilled chicken and fish are a must order when you visit \ud83c\udf57 \ud83d\udc20\n\nDefinitely will revisit when I\u2019m craving for a good Nasi Padang with a wider variety!\n",

Pizza is on the average side. Crab pasta tasted like the non-spicy version of chilli crab which is quite unique. Would say the fish was the best. The fish itself is roasted very well and also love the layered potatoes.\n\nOverall, felt that it was Italian cuisine tailored to the Singaporean palate. Also, the restaurant is understaffed, there was only two service-crew serving everyone. Atmosphere-wise, it\u2019s on the top  level of the hotel but there\u2019s no views of anything. It was basically a poolside restaurant with the occasional crying / screaming of kids and babies in the pool.\n\nWould only recommend if you are hotel guest or looking for a casual restaurant in the area.\n\nWhen you're looking for a less crowded Italian restaurant on Orchard Road, this is a good place to hide. Nice small restaurant, located on the Rooftop of Voco Hotel. The food is good, but it could be better. Service staff were wonderful and knowledgeable of the menu.\n\nI\u2019ve visited with my mom during singapore trip. They served great dishes. I especially recommend Truffle Burrata Cheese Pizza.

These 2 are my favourites!\n\nI had a really lovely lunch with my family. It was a special occasion to celebrate and the food and service was excellent (the pool view is great as well).

I did not make any reservations and at 6:40pm it seems like they are fully reserved up. Anyway the waiter was very nice to let us have a table for outside area.\n\nThe happy hour oyster attracted me and to my surprised, the $2.50 per oyster is large and creamy. They did not give some miserable quality for promotional price. Commendable for this!\n\nOrdered the blueberries rosemary smash and they put real jumbo size blueberries and a fresh sprig of rosemary. A very refreshing drink served in large size in my opinion. It lasted me the whole entire 2 hours of conversation.\n\nAn ideal place to chitchat in a nice environment that is not too noisy. The service of the staff is very attentive too. The young crews are super friendly.\n\nOysters are great - super succulent and pair perfectly with hot sauce and lime. Pizza is quite average but the sweet potato fries are something else. Cocktails were average. The interior is beautiful and I heard there a live band plays occasionally.\n\nKind of hidden from sight.  Hidden in a corner. This place is packed after 12 on weekends. Live singer play around 1pm on weekends. Came for their around the world brunch with many varieties to choose from . Their drinks are good too. Many tend to come here with friends to chill. The vibes are good here. Very laid back atmosphere.. food is fantastic enough because of its wide choices. Mess tin of fries is great for sharing . Quality itself worthy of price point.  Wish I had rooms for cakes.  Maybe next time.\n\nThis restaurant is packed on weekends and the attraction is probably the live band and mostly female crowd. The food is actually pretty decent but I\u2019d say the pizza was better than the Vongole pasta (which was rather salty). Service can be slow due to the large number of tables the waitress needs to attend to.\n\nSides would be more suitable for big groups to share. The food were great. The cheese fries had mozeralla and nacho cheese which provides different layers of taste. The portions of the mains was very filling too. It might get a little crowded even on weekdays dinner so it would be better to make a reservation first.\n\n\nOption: 3:\nName: Saizeriya\nAddress: 277 Orchard Rd, B2-11, Singapore 238858\nPhone: 6702 4451\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 1 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.1\nReviews: \n\nAtmosphere is 10/10.There is a lot of space inside.\n\nMy queue time is around 10-15minutes depending on certain hours.Avoid peak hours like lunch break 1-2pm to skip the queue.\n\nThere are a lot variety of foods and it also provide free flow of plain water.\n\nService was good here at this branch and my food came rather quickly. Taste is just like how the other Saizeriya branches are around Singapore. Simple, a huge variety of pastas to choose from.

No white linen table cloths although you can get a small decanter of white or red wine to create more of a moment. They offer a number of vegetarian options, I tried both the mushroom soup and the pumpkin soup. The mushroom is the better of the two with a nicer thick consistency and hearty flavor. If you are a soda drinker like me - recommend adding the free flow drinks to satisfy your cola craving.\n\nSaizeriya is like the Italian food joint for those of us craving Italian food on a tight budget, serving Italian fare fit for discerning peasants.\n\nThe standout dishes at Saizeriya include their affordable Escargot and Garlic Focaccia. These offerings provide a garlicky explosion that will destroy your breath for the remaining day.

Not only were the sides and pasta absolutely delicious, with a wide range of options to choose from, but the service was impeccable. The staff was attentive, friendly, and made sure every aspect of our meal was enjoyable. I truly appreciated the excellent service that accompanied the delectable pasta dishes. The olive oil cake was excellent as well. A little cramped in terms of the seating but nevertheless I'll definitely be returning for more memorable meals!\n\nMost memorable anniversary dinner that I've had. Food is generally good. What stands out most is their service. It's impeccable. Do take note that they have strict dress code requirements. I was rejected initially due to not wearing covered shoes and have to wait till the customer who is using their loan shoes is done with his meal. Having said that, I'm still very satisfied with the overall experience. This shows how good the service was. Special mention to Kishore for his great service and for providing a Polaroid photo of my wife and I to remember the night. Will definitely be back!\n\nMy second time here and the food and service is still as great! Special thanks to Margie who took care of us for tonight. She recommended us a few dishes based on our preference and everything was good! My favourite would be the  grilled octopus as it was not chewy or tough but of right firmness. Would definitely visit again! Thanks Margie!\n\nWe recently dined at this fantastic restaurant and had an amazing experience. Their pizza (only available for lunch), mussels and pasta were both outstanding, bursting with flavor. The service was top-notch, with Winson going above and beyond to ensure a delightful dining experience.  Who gave us food and desserts recommendations we really enjoyed\n\nSister and brother-in-law brought us here for a birthday celebration\nThe food was excellent! Even a Caesar salad was unforgettable. Mussels starter with delicious buttery bread. Beef tagliatelle was very moreish too\n\nService was top notch!! Super attentive, constant water filling and checking in on us if we needed anything. Was most impressed when they gave us a card with a handwritten note from every single staff on duty + a Polaroid for keepsake. This is service like no other.\n\nHighly recommended please do come here for an awesome Unforgettable dining experience\n\n\nOption: 5:\nName: La D'Oro\nAddress: 333A Orchard Rd, #01-16/17 Mandarin Gallery, Singapore 238897\nPhone: 8382 6200\nDelivery Available: Information Not Available\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.3\nReviews: \n\nAll the dishes were beautifully executed. I started with Tasmanian baby squid as antipasto, followed by two plates of pasta of the day, namely lamb pasta as well as pumpkin ravioli. Normally, I don't include dessert in my review, but the yuzu sorbet from the restaurant is truly commendable.\n\nWell located in Orchard. Oysters fresh and sweet. Family liked the bolognese and thin crust pizza.\n\nPumpkin soup was standard, it reminded me of blended baby food.\n\nMy personal favourite is the uni pasta, the cream base sauce on the Uni pasta is just right, not overwhelming, savoury enough to also enjoy the  uni. I didn't  taste the yuzu in the sauce but I did enjoy the ginseng leaves as part of the flavor.\n\nAll the pasta are generously portioned,  so it's good to share.\n\nOne of the best restaurants in Singapore! We have been to many Michelin star restaurants but we think LaD'oro definitely deserves the recognition because it is better than many of them. The food is great in terms of taste, look, creativity, combination, presentation and portion. The chef finds every opportunity to surprise you and show you the difference between Italian and Japanese ingredients. The effort from the chef and experience as a guest is flawless! The menu we had is Autumn and we will be back for the next season. The Sendai Wagyu is the most impressive dish but unfortunately I forgot to take a photo.\n\nPretty nice and grand Interior, and initially I thought the price will be exorbitant but it's not. Def not cheap but I think it's acceptable to me. 3 of us spent around 50 each for 1 uni pasta (this costs the most but worth it as the sea urchins are quite large), 1 pizza and 1 side (yummy baby squids!), and we were very full. They taste good as well.\n\nwe booked dinner for 6.30 pm on a Sunday and there were only 2 other tables occupied. soft music and lighting made the atmosphere pretty romantic for dates! we ordered truffle fries (but they ran out of fries, only had wedges - we still prefer truffle w fries though), Pizza Bismarck and Tagliatelle Hokkaido Snow Beef A5 Bolognese. BOTH the pizza and the bolognese were SO GOOD. we loved it so much. they have really nice and pretty cakes too btw but we didn't get to try as we were very full but will def return to try those!\nservice by the staff was really good as they were very attentive to customers' needs - they even offered to split our pasta into 2 portions as they guessed we were sharing it!\n\n\nOption: 6:\nName: LINO @ Forum\nAddress: 583 Orchard Rd, #01-01/04, Singapore 238884\nPhone: 6235 8690\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.5\nReviews: \n\nThe cocktails were great and at 42++ for 3, it\u2019s really a sweet deal.\nThe antipasti were amazing. We had the melon with ham as well as the octopus which were really cooked well and tasty.\nThe main dish today was a miss. The beef was really tough even cooked medium. Tendons were striped across the entire steak which should never be the case with a ribeye.\n\nSo far one of the two best pizza's I have had beed eating in Singapore. Great tomato passata, decent salami and cheese. All ingredients are fresh and good quality. I was really surprised with short waiting time, just a couple of minutes and all three pizza's have been served. Very friendly and helpful Staff.\n\nThe portions match the pricing, so rest assured that you'd be full! I got 2 mains (iberico pork and pesto pizza) for sharing and were beyond full. The food was flavourful and good but was a tad too rich/salty to finish. Come with more friends for a bigger bang for your buck.\n\nVisited Lino 2 weeks ago for dinner, so yeah this is a long overdue write-in. I didn't manage to reserve a table online, so my friend and I just do walk-in. Unfortunately that day the restaurant had quite a few of big groups, hence we got the smallest table there - a little wonky and cramp.\nHowever, I must say that the experience was delightful. The standout dishes that I tried were the Burrata Pizza, Truffle Fries, and Scallop Risotto.\nThe burrata pizza was a true masterpiece. The combination of the creamy burrata cheese with the freshness of tomato and pesto sauce plus the perfectly crust, not only visual appealing but also bursting with flavour. It's a must try for any pizza enthusiast. Truffle fries - excellent. The risotto was cooked beautifully with a creamy texture that complemented the succulent scallops.\nThis restaurant is definitely one of the top choices for those looking for Italian food in central Singapore.\n\nI like it, but I'm not sure if I like it enough to come back regularly.\n\nWe ordered some items for delivery, and they arrived nicely packed and looking gorgeous. Got ourselves 2 pizzas, a salad, and an extra serving of calamari. Not much heating up was required, to enjoying the taste of the food; which is great. Definitely something that you can readily order for parties and gatherings.\n\nThat all said, I'm not sure if I'd pay 20sgd for calamari, or the salad. Even 30sgd for a pizza is a little on the high side, no matter how good it tasted; given that there was no meat on my pizza.\n\n\nOption: 7:\nName: Picolino\nAddress: 1 Scotts Rd, #03-23/24 Shaw Centre, Singapore 228208\nPhone: 8940 3873\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.4\nReviews: \n\nOne of the most value for money Italian cuisines in Singapore. All the dishes we ordered were outstanding except for the mushroom soup which was too watery.\nWe really love the Caesar Salad, Burrata pizza & seafood aglio olio.\nDefinitely will be back to try other items on the menu.\n\nGreat service! Very helpful attentive crew who recommended the Chianti wine which went down great with the pizzas. Good price too for the bottle at $60. Pizzas freshly made, indeed try the burata. Calamari also went down well and overall a very nice atmosphere and casual dining place to hang out/gatherings along Orchard Road. And they open on a Monday night too! Enjoy.\n\nThe pizza is OK, crusty chewy edges on a thin crust, 12 inch, good for 2 to share. The surprise fav here was the Caesar salad.\n\nThe rest we had were somewhat disappointing, especially the chicken wings that felt like they were double fried leftovers from last night. The fusion pasta of Salmon and Ikura was a failure too, there was a strong fishy smell in the dish. Can't find fault in the Tiramisu, but can't find praise either.\n\nService was prompt. Reservations recommended.\n\nvery cosy atmosphere, simple and quiet. staff was friendly and attentive too. be sure to make your reservation before coming down because the place is filled during meal times.\n\nsweet potato fries are done very well and not overcooked. truffle mac & cheese had the right proportions of cheese to pasta and truffle goes very well with this dish too. aglio olio had full prawn so and sufficient ingredients to go along with, fresh and well made!\n\nhave yet to try their pizzas and it looked so good and portion seemed to be decent too. worth coming and trying!\n\nUpdate: ended the night throwing up multiple times, will be reporting to the relevant authorities.\nThe horlicks tiramisu dessert is sour and taste extremely bad. We ate just one mouth and gave up. There was zero attempt of service recovery even after alerting the staff that the tiramisu is sour.

Money well spent and a very fun afternoon thanks to wine/prosecco free flow as well.\n\nWent for Sunday brunch. Cheese room is lovely with a wide selection of cheeses. Loved the unique chocolate cheeses and burratas. Mains selection is ok, could be larger. Lamb stew was nice. Desserts are good as well.\n\nThe restaurant offers an array of \ud83e\uddc0 cheese.\nIf you are a cheese lover, this will be the restaurant for you!\nWe had buffet but the selection is limited unlike the conventional buffet.

The portions were generous and came nicely warmed. The highlights for me were the robust flavours of the bolognese sauce, richly portioned with beef , reminiscent of what might have come freshly prepared from an Italian kitchen, as well as the four cheese pizza. The truffle-scented toppings sprinkled with a generous portion of caviar and the blend of cheeses made this a sheer delight and were a crowd pleaser. The kids were very happy with their meal too. Will definitely order again to try the other items on their menu.\n\nWe ordered the 4 cheese gourmet pizza, the premium burrata and the pasta bolognese for our sons' birthday. The food flavours were outstanding. We loved the rich truffle flavours for the pizza, the caviar provided the opulence for the burata. And we were so surprised by the strong beef flavours of the bolognese, with its rich tomato flavours. Absolutely delightful! :)\n\nOrdered the burrata pistachio, 4 cheese gourmet pizza, black truffle pesto pizza and diavola pizza for a group lunch. Reviews all round were positive, especially in relation to the freshness, quality and generosity of the ingredients (e.g. heaps of caviar which complemented and did not overwhelm the flavours of the dishes). No compromises here. Will definitely order again :  )\n\nIf you like the idea of \u201cPita bread filled with Indian cheese cubes, sour tasting salami, lettuce with salad dressing and tomato\u201d then please order Italian Focaccia Panini from them.

I saw a review that the garlic fried rice was a must try, it did not disappoint.\n\n\nOption: 2:\nName: Gochi-So Shokudo Japanese Restaurant \u3054\u3061\u60e3\u98df\u5802 @ Chinatown Point\nAddress: 133 New Bridge Rd, #02-41/42 Chinatown Point, Singapore 059413\nPhone: 6441 3800\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4\nReviews: \n\nHad lunch yesterday at the Chinatown Point outlet. It has the toughest pork belly dish I have ever ever eaten in a Japanese eatery. Chewed a piece of it for a few minutes and still not broken up. Give up.... need to cut into very small pieces to swallow whole earlier. Good exercise for the jaws though.\n\nStay away from the iberico yuzu koshio yaki. The pork belly is just too tough. I had many meals there. Their butadon pork bowls are generally OK. Good value for the taste and price, but this was the worst meal i had so far.\n\nSuper yummy and service was great. We changed our order after submitting and the service staff helped us change it manually!!! Really grateful. There's also a promo for this signature loin set (in the picture) for GSS! Its my 2nd time here and won't be the last ;)\n\nCame during weekday lunch. Not very crowded, managed to get seats for 5 with 0 waiting time. Ordered their cheeses pork cutlet which taste awesome! Pork skin is crispy and meat is very tender. Set comes with soup and mixed vege. Price is $17++ so after GST and Service charge is about $22\n\nOrdered the Iberico Black Char Siew Don. Iberico pork was chewy soft and tender! Nice! Restaurant was empty though, perhaps just avoid those that was mentioned by other reviewers. But this don was nice! $11.50\n\n\nOption: 3:\nName: Kiwami: Ramen & Gyoza Bar (Chinatown Point)\nAddress: 133 New Bridge Rd, #02-38 Chinatown Point, Singapore 059413\nPhone: 6223 1669\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.6\nReviews: \n\nThis was dinner in Chinatown Point.  We ordered the Teppanyaki beef set and a pork cutlet.\n\nTaste wise,  it was okay. We hv had better ones, but this was alright.  The set came with the beans,  soup,  rice and some pickled veg.\n\nThe pork tonkatsu was rather mediocre.  The crust was over done.\n\nHowever, the price is not too expensive.  Quite affordable and will surely fill you up.\n\nAmbience is quite nice with great lighting.  Service was also alright.\n\nOverall,  but too bad.\n\nMy favourite ramen place in Singapore - excellent choice of ramens at a very reasonable price and great flavours.\n\nCame here on a weekday evening, and the place was half-full.\n\nWe ordered the following -\n\n1) Premium Kiwami Tonkotsu Ramen - Nice robust broth of ramen that comes with toroniku cha-shu (tender roast pork cheek) and Okinawa ramen egg. Meat was so tender.\n\n2) Hokkaido Oyster Fry - Tender oysters baked that are so cripsy. The sauce pairing is on-point.\n\n3) Cheese Teppan Fondue Gyoza - Grilled Gyozas on a bed of fondue cheeze. This was a really good combination. Gyozas were packed with flavour.\n\n4) Hokkaido Snow Crab Fried Rice on Tonkotsu Gravy - Silky smooth tonkotsu gravy that is served with snow crab fried rice. A little bland, but quite tasteful.\n\n5) Kiwami Freezer\n\nFood was lovely and tasty but staff were just a little shorthanded at times and it was just a bit hard to get their attention.\n\nDIsappointed by this restaurant that is in my point of view over rated.\n\nThe food was good but not exceptional.\n\nThe service was not good and we food bad to be interrupted during the dinner and be asked to go to the cashier to pay.\n\nVisited during off-peak for dinner. Wait staff were friendly n attentive.\n\nFood is well-prepared. Beef is tender n juicy. Marinade n seasonings aren't too overpowering.. Tomato cheese gyoza is an interesting combi. Teppanyaki set meal is value for money. Will return for more!\n\nOnly complaint, d air-conditioning is a little on d warmer side.\n\n\nOption: 4:\nName: Nomiya Izakaya & Sake Bar\nAddress: 11 Trengganu St, Singapore 058465\nPhone: 6232 7827\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.8\nReviews: \n\nNot the usual Japanese food as they are very strong and heavy in seasoning. Most of the dishes are tasty, but a bit on the salty side. Services are excellent and prices are slightly on the medium high end. Appreciate their complimentary birthday ice cream and also farewell sorbet for every guest.\nSpace is a bit tight and got a table of ladies that was virtually talking in a shouting volume that made our visit quite a displeasure one.\n\nBest dish - charred Brussels sprout and saut\u00e9ed mushroom\n\nHad a great time here. Food was great and unique. We had the burnt butter prawns, lobster croquette and charcoal chicken. Would reorder the first and last for sure.\n\nService was fantastic - best service I\u2019ve had in a long while. On my way out after the meal, I mentioned it was my birthday and Joan, the kind waitress, made me come back to the table to serve me really good ice cream with a candle and sake. Really sweet of them.\n\nWe had the set for 2 (Wagu Sirloin version) and added on pork jowl and sashimi platter $39. We paired our meal with Akai Umeshu and Earl Grey Sake. The eggplant and edame was ok, the foie gras chawamushi was rich and delightful and the wagyu and pork was perfect 10/10. The skewers were alright except for the chicken piece which was a tad too hard and mainly bones. The truffle caviar noodle was aromatic but we felt the caviar was abit too much and truffle abit overpowering for us. The complimentary birthday hojicha dessert and yuzu sorbet was on point. Service was warm and prompt when i feedback on preference for lower chair and the aircon. I spent almost $270+ for 2 pax for a very filling and overall satisfying meal. Highly recommend and would definitely return again.\n\nSimply amazing food.. we had 9-10 dishes and there is not a single one that we concluded as \"so-so\" .. Every dish was so tasty and different! I can't even tell you what's the highlight because they were just so good..\n\nProbably the most memorable was the prawn cos we were all wanting extra serving of bread to soak up the sauce . It was full of flavor~\n\nSuggest to try their sets if u are unsure..\n\nLastly, don't drive there as its in those alley on Chinatown.. parking is good Ng to be difficult.. it's only a few mins walk from China town MRT.. very accessible\n\nThe bar was full on a Thursday night.\n\nThe service was warm & friendly, and they constantly checked in for orders, or ensure that our sake glasses were full.\n\nThe menu was extensive for a small restaurant. We mostly had skewers last night - loved the off menu Wagyu skewers, miso butabara, and my fave yuzu infused tsukune ball. The other recommended dishes like Brussels sprouts & lobster croquette were unique as well.

The raw oysters were fresh, large and juicy. The seared cheese oysters ideally needs to be eaten quickly for the best taste. Scallops were tasty with the two cheese options. The one criticism I had was of the rice bowls. The rice was a bit under seasoned and and there was also just a bit of too much rice for the topping. Despite it being a short grain rice, the rice is also less sweet then the rice typically used in Japan. Staff was friendly and service was quick. Great place to dine alone or for date night!\n\nwhat an experience!! service was top notch albeit a little slow. but bare in mind, two staffs were handling orders from 3 floors. however they were very attentive and constantly checking in on all of the patrons.\n\nfood was simply amazing. no frills, no bull. oysters served was fresh and larger than my wrist. dons were nicely portioned and tastes delicious too!\n\ngreat selection of alcohol as well! highly highly recommended.\n\nOur favorite couple place! Best oysters in town! Fantastic service and quality of food ! Oysters just slide into your mouth, silky, juicy, yummy ! You must also try their mozzarella beef short plate. Mozzarella cheese just ooze out when you bite on the beef\n\nFirst time trying oyster buffet\u2026\nThe oysters were really huge, fresh and juicy! Mini don is good..wished i had 2 stomachs to try all of them.\nService was great..staffs were attentive and fast.\n\nAmazing experience! Oyster and scallops were out of this world!

Appreciate his kindness. ARIGATO \u2661\n\nDecent Oden specialized Izakaya. Many interesting plates of food from Smoked Pork Belly to Crab Namero and Beef Tongue stir fry. Mixed Oden seems good but somehow feel like the individual Oden items would showcase themselves a lot better.\nPortions may be on the smaller side but still  great flavors going on here.\n\nWent to meet up with a friend. He suggested omakase and I went along with it, though thought it was slightly expensive.\nBut! Not regrets! Every single dish was delicious! Especially the nori-syouyu sashimi and the miso flavoured cheese platter.

Food is not great, staff is not knowledgeable and reservation got bumped.\n\nOne of the omakase experience is having the staff explain to you every dish that you\u2019re eating and what order to eat them. 50% of the meal, the staff didn\u2019t even say a word and just told us to eat in any order you like.\n\nFood didn\u2019t feel expensive even though we went for the top range.\n\n3 stars because it\u2019s a small and quiet place. Nice ambience for a get together. Come but don\u2019t come for the food and service.\n\nThe food was just ok for the price you pay. Tempura set is at $30. But they serve ice cream which gives a bit more score but overall, taste is just ok.\n\nThe service was bad though. The servant asked us to leave even if we were yet to finish our meal.\n\nA wonderful little place in town that seats 16. Marukyu serves up with a rather good Japanese Omakase selection, making them stand out from the bevy of Korean BBQ shops spattered across the area. Great attentive service from their wait staff. Checking frequently to make sure our cups are filled and promptly clearing away emptied dishes. Will help speed things along if the staff were familiar with their own menu. Thankfully their super friendly head chef was moving around the front of house to make recommendation of the seasonal catches as well as his yummy specials. Food coming out from the kitchen was beautifully plated up, a feast for the eyes. Did not disappoint.\n\nA traditional Japanese restaurant with lots of sashimi in their menu. Lunch set prices is very reasonable and most of the sets includes sashimi. Wanted to order noodles they have none when we were there. Ordered some set lunch to try also some sushi. The taste is at most \u201cacceptable\u201d but sashimi is fresh. Server is really going through the motion didn\u2019t feel right to dine at such environment. The place is rather small but clean.

The portion is overwhelming for its price, it can actually feed more than two people. The service is great, too. Sebastian, the manager, is very accommodating and approachable.\n\nVery nice. Big serving. Reasonable price. Recommended when you are craving Japanese curry dishes. Good service too\n\nOverall good, but poor service from a singular staff.\n\nWe had a mixed experience at this outlet. The food was decent, but the service was uneven. Our waitress, [didn't catch her name but she tied her hair up, wore specs, and wore a red uniform] was very polite and attentive. She displayed great service and was efficient.\n\nHowever, another server, [Sebastian/Cebestian?] was relatively rude and unhelpful. He wore a black uniform and had a black face mask. When we asked about store policy & promotion items, he seemed annoyed by our questions. He also appeared to be not well service trained to answer such questions, as he could not give proper and polite answers to paying customers. He also spoke unclearly to customers. He displayed a poor attitude and was condescending to the patrons. Hope that management can consider training him more.\n\nWe were very disappointed with the service from him. His rudeness and lack of knowledge made our dining experience unpleasant. He also gave his staff member the wrong form for patrons to look at when they're signing up for the 8-minute challenge.\n\nHowever, we would like to commend the lady waitress, for her excellent service. She was a pleasure to deal with and made our experience much better. The food was great as well.\n\nGood service from the service staffs, polite and friendly. Foods were serve fast and hot. Taste is good. Comparing to Novena and Bugis Junction outlets, here in Chinatown Point is better in terms of services and food quality.\n\nThe chicken taste better than the pork i feel, cause the pork taste harder but the curry is so on point and the service here is amazing.\nMust try the salmon bites, recommended!!\n",

Tom Yum fried rice is quite spicy but if you like Tom Yum, this one is a must-try. Stir-fry Kalan with roasted pork is one of my favourite Thai dishes. Overall the food here is authentic and they have many choices. Better come with a group so you can try more dishes.\n\nI have ordered sweet beef with vegetables and rice in total for a price of 16.50 SGD. The dish was honestly incredebly delicious due to very well cooked beef and rice as well as its tasty sweet sauce. The atmosphere was alright for a normal lunch/dinner, although I would say the main disadvantage of the place is that the indoor area have no closed doors and no air conditioning, hence, all sitting areas are fully outdoors which made my experience slightly uncomfortable, as I am someone who prefers to eat food in chilly environments with air conditioning. The service was decent and the food was cooked in a timely manner. Overall, I am quite satisfied with the place and would recommend anyone interested to try out Thai food in Singapore. I will definitely come back again.\n\nI don't usually eat Thai food but I have to rate this one highly. One of the best Thai food places I've been to. As I don't usually take spice very well, I ordered less spice for everything. Everything we ordered came shortly even though the restaurant was packed. Lastly, the dessert was also amazing.\n\nGreat pricing, and yummy! No service charge just 8% tax. The papaya salad was fresh, and enjoyed the pad thai and minced pork basil \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d Thai ice tea was refreshing too!\n\nCooking of the food is good but the ingredients are not fresh, frozen chicken prawn pork really spoilt the taste.

Overall it\u2019s flavour is good!\n\nFish maw soup with quail eggs: 5/5\nThai basil chicken rice w egg (no spicy) : 5/5\nI love the fact that they added long beans and onions to give different layers of crunch and flavour to it! And they accommodate to my request for non-spicy a spicy rice.\n\nGreat place for families. For those dining I. Big groups I recommend you make reservations first if you want to sit indoor with air con.\n\nSoo 47 is a casual Thai Street food style restaurant that offers robust Thai cooked food at reasonable prices. Don\u2019t expect the original Thai food taste as fish sauce is missing or at much lower levels in several Thai classic dishes like Pad Thai, perhaps in response to a healthier lifestyle or just a preference of consumers these days. I do miss the heavy the \u201csavory kick\u201d from Nam Pla and Thai condiments. However the dishes are still delicious and I recommend the egg \ud83e\udd5a dishes, prawn \ud83e\udd90 cakes and Thai simmered fish \ud83d\udc1f (add in fish sauce if you like). Service is good and prices are considered reasonable in pricey Singapore.\n\nOperations seems to be a bit unstable. Staff were rushing and appear to be quite chaotic.\n\nThe food was decent, and the fish was on point. Will order again when I am back. If you love fluffy omelette, this is the right place. Beansprouts with salted fish was underwhelming, can't seem to bite into any salted fish.\n\nOverall, still a good experience. Hopefully less chaotic.\n\nThe dishes are small and you can order a variety of it. Prices are reasonable. We like the steam fish in lime juice. Tom yum clear soup is good too.\n\nCame on a Friday night, had to wait 5-10min for a table.\nThe steamed seabass was delicious. Highly recommended, the soup of the fish is very tasty as well. The salad was great as well, nice starter.\nThe staff were friendly and came with our orders relatively quick.

The stall requires customers to write down their order number on a piece of paper and pass it to the staff, who will only take the order if it's presented on the paper. While I understand that this system can be helpful during peak periods, it seems unnecessary when there are only a few customers.\n\nThat being said, the food was quite good. I tried the tom yum soup, olive fried rice, and pad Thai. The tom yum soup was generous in its ingredients and tasted decent. The pad they had a good flavour and wasn't dry. The olive fried rice was okay. While the prices were a bit expensive for a hawker stall, I understand that in this economy, the prices are reasonable. Overall, it was a decent experience.\n\nSolid Thai food store at the corner of Tiong Bahru market. Tom yum soup with so much seafood is only 6.5 (whaaat!) but a bit watery. Green curry is the best in my opinion\n\nHad the garlic chicken and the serving was generous. The garlic has no bitterness so kids should find it acceptable but it lacks the strong garlicky flavour. $6.50 for the dish, add 50c for rice. The portion of chicken is like what you would expect in tze char for small or medium. I will come back and try the other dishes.\n\nYummy Thai fried kway teow and green curry. Lots of healthy vegetables\n\nThis is one hawker stall tucked right in one of the corner of Tiong Bahru Market. It's just located beside the famous Jian Bo Chwee Kueh stall. The decor of the stall is very interesting. After lunch hour, while most of the stalls are either closing or their food items are sold out, this is one of the stall that still served proper meal. I ordered their Phad Thai. I was really happy when they dished out the phad Thai serving on a piping hot ceramic plate which not many hawkers have ceramic cutleries now. Food is nice and the serving is generous, for the price of $5.50.\n\n\nOption: 7:\nName: Somboon Thai Cuisine\nAddress: 40 Beo Cres, Block 40, Singapore 160040\nPhone: None\nDelivery Available: Information Not Available\nDine-In Available: Information Not Available\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nSunday: Closed\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.9\nReviews: \n\nThe gem is located in a residential area in the heartland.

Most of the service staff and chef are very friendly and are Thais but understand simple English or even Mandarin. Highly recommend if you are in the area.\n\nThe glass noddle is sweet based and it\u2019s good. Not so oily. The seafood are fresh. Compare with Phad Thai, will recommend glass noodle.\nThe steam fishes is a whole complete piece and it\u2019s very fresh. The spices and lime goes very well with the fish. The soup is clear and taste. With initially the sweet layer, then a little sour layer, followed by the spiciness.\nThe mango sticky rice is amazing. The glutinous rice is not over cooked. It\u2019s just nice that chewy yet not so soft. The mango is fresh and a little sour, one of the best ever tried.\n\nVery tasty authentic Thai food.\nA place to go to for Thai food buddies..\nEasy parking behind or opp at multistorey car park..\nMust try.\nHospitalible boss and staff.\nThe lunch menu is good for group lunch.\nDinner can come after 6 30pm.\nReserve yr table...\n\n\nOption: 9:\nName: Siam Square Mookata - Best Mookata Restaurant in Singapore\nAddress: 22A Havelock Rd, #01-14, Singapore 161022\nPhone: 8119 6664\nDelivery Available: Information Not Available\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 4:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 4:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 4:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 4:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 4:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 4:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 4:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.2\nReviews: \n\nThis stall is located within the popular havelock road hawker center. Good location as there are ample parking space and most of the stalls are close with many tables available. Overall it\u2019s still a decent mookata, not enough for the 4 star rating but good enough to give it a try. Chili, fresh meat are pretty average and the rest mostly consist of frozen food.\n\nOne of the best Thai mookata places. Love the lamb option alot. Their pork belly original and black pepper is very good too! Came here a couple of times alr and the lamb and pork belly are the regular dishes that I order! Definitely worth a try.\n\nBBQ buffet is the main highlight of this new restaurant near by the lake. 59 dollar for 2 people for food. The only restriction is for items priced 4 dollar and above. Rest all items in the menu including ice cream is unlimited. The quantity and quality of the meat is great. The meat or what ever we use for the bbq provided are very fresh and so it\u2019s very tasty as well. The bbq stove is a gas stove and so the time to prepare the bbq is very less. It\u2019s more of a instant food rather than traditional bbq. The staffs here are so friendly and very attentive. Two things which are the base of this bbq is the quality and taste of the sauce they provide and the base liquid or soup provided to boil in the bbq pit. It can be a good place for any kind of people like couples or even family. A very well recommended place.\n\nCame here for dinner because we were craving for Thai mookata for dinner. Food are reasonably priced at range of 2-5 dollars per plate depending on what you order. In total two of us spent around 38 dollars.\n\nDownside: Meat quality is definitely those which are not high quality. Don\u2019t expect much for the price point.\n\nMookata lovers... must come and try. So much variety for chilli. Meat so fresh n seasoning so good. Price is so affordable and reasonable. Even if you are first time eating mookata, this place is never a mistake. I'm a satisfied customer and will return again for more.\n\n\nOption: 10:\nName: Thai Kha (Thai Street Cuisine)\nAddress: 2 Havelock Rd, #01-01/48, Singapore 059763\nPhone: 6786 6388\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 8:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 8:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 8:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 8:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 8:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 8:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 8:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.6\nReviews: \n\nThis is a very reasonably priced Thai hidden gem. We ordered the drunken noodles as we saw that it was highly raved, and be warned that it is flavourful but very very spicy, even for someone like me who can usually take spicy food (so pls ask for less spicy if you can\u2019t take spicy food). The pork basil rice was a steal at $6.90. Chicken wings were juicy, and the steamed tapioca was delicious! Overall the quality of the food is good for the price point. Worth a visit!\n\nThai Kha is by far the best Thai restaurant in Singapore! Consistent quality & taste of food and great service will convince you to return. Having ordered in the first time during the pandemic, this is my go to place when it comes to Thai cuisine. Order online or visit their restaurant, a beautiful and well maintained space. \ud83d\ude0a\ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffb\n\nWent for dinner on a weekday, very quiet. Ordered through QR and food cooked fresh, but contrary to great reviews, our food was so so. Truly not bad. Drunken noodles was still a bit wet, but tasty enough but lacking oomph. Boat noodles not bad. Egg not crispy enough but tasty. Portion quite large. Spent 37.20 sgd for these 3. A viable option if around the area. Vegetarian options available for most dishes.\n\nCasual place with good food. Tried the drunken noodle, prawns, fried rice and morning glory - liked the spicy kick but prawns were ok. Good food with reasonable price - would come back for casual lunch if nearby!\n\nVisited Thai Kha at Havelock 2 (#01-01/48) for lunch recently!\n\nFood:\n\n- Had the Pork Krapow ($7.90 before tax, asked for less spicy) as my main dish. I personally thought that the pork was soft, tender and well-seasoned. Overall, the dish was well-balanced and tasty, although I wish that the egg was runny - it was cooked through.\n\n- I also had some Chicken Wings ($8.90) to share. Felt that they were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. My only gripe with this was that they could have been bigger.\n\nService/Atmosphere:\n- There were 6 of us who went for lunch together, and we all ordered Krapow with varying levels of spiciness and/or additional meat.\n\nThere was some miscommunication on the part of the service staff and they mixed up some of our orders. However, I don't deem this to be a serious shortcoming on the part of the staff - my only wish is that they would be better prepared for future orders!\n\n- The restaurant wasn't crowded during lunchtime and is a good value for money option if you're willing to travel to Havelock 2 mall. Seems like a hidden gem to me, if I'm honest.\n\nI will be back again. Very impressed with the quality of the food here.\n\nKudos to @cravings_satisfied_jay as well for suggesting this place!\n",

Everything tasted great.\n- My only gripe was the serving size for some of the items. The churros in particular, were extremely little.\n+/- Overall the service was friendly but as the place became more packed into the night, it was hard to get the servers' attention.\n\nA nice Mexican restaurant with different tiers of happy hour prices depending on the time of the day. Their frozen margaritas are delicious and a great accompaniment with their food. I recommend sitting outdoors by the Riverside if you don't mind not having air conditioning..\n\nAte early evening. Was leaning towards tacos but saw the Al Pastor Red Snapper and had to try it. Glad I did - it was sensational. Would have been 5 stars for atmosphere apart from the sticky table. Will definitely be back for more.\n\nFood was pretty good. We were able to hang out for extended time as there was not a lot of people on a Friday night. Only downside is there\u2019s no air conditioned area. It was very hot and humid. A bit uncomfortable.\n\nWe chose the table outdoor because inside is a bit suffocating for me when there was crowded. Decoration with Mexican vibe is cool.\nQuesadillas and nachos were so so.\nBaja fish tacos was good but not really impressed.\nTried the mango margaritas and vodka soda.

The works!\n\nWe ordered from the Paya Lebar outlet and we're pleasantly surprised as it's hard to find decent and hearty tex mex fast food in Singapore. While this is not Chipotle, it sure beats the measly burrito bowls at GYG (the worst!).\n\nOrdered the Pulled Beef Burrito Bowl, pretty good quality stuff. Loved the jalapenos amd portion is decent.\n\nThis is sad. There's literally only 4 small chunks of chicken in each taco. And there isn't any other channel to feedback this to. I bought this as a set meal for close to $20 (inclusive of delivery).\n\nI can't tell the difference between the burrito bowl and the nachos other than the bowl has rice and the the nachos are often stale. I like their wings but I've ordered delivery several times now and almost every time there's something missing (paid extra for cheese, or jalapenos but amount is exactly the same as an order without extras), mismatched order (chicken added instead of beef). Enough is enough, I won't order from here again.\n\nOrdered herbal chicken quesadillas. Paid for extra cheese but the extra is not noticeable at all. With Guzman, without topping up for extra cheese, it has way more cheese. Part of the Herbal chicken doesn't seem fresh as it is abit mushy n we tot it was fish initially.

Thanks Los Amigos we had a fruitful evening at your cosy restaurant. Will definitely be back for MORE!!!!!\n\nOn a picturesque evening, my friend and I sought a place to unwind, and serendipitously, we stumbled upon Los Amigos Mexican restaurant. The ambiance, adorned with vibrant decor and a backdrop of lively music, immediately caught our attention.\n\nOur culinary journey commenced with an array of delectable choices, including the signature Prawn Ceviche, spicy pork belly, rib-eye steak, and a sweet finale of churros drizzled in rich chocolate sauce, all paired with my beloved margaritas.\n\nThe Prawn Ceviche emerged as the star of the show\u2014a harmonious blend of succulent prawns and zesty lime, delivering a medley of sour, juicy, crispy, and tender sensations all in one bite. The spicy pork belly added an extra kick to our palates, which I relished, though my friend found it a tad too fiery.\n\nRegrettably, the rib-eye steak didn't align with our taste preferences; its flavor and texture left us disappointed, slightly dampening our dining experience. However, we concluded our meal on a sweet note with the heavenly churros, perfectly complemented by warm, velvety chocolate\u2014a delightful treat.\n\nIn essence, Los Amigos offered a mixed dining experience with highs and lows. While some dishes soared to culinary perfection, others fell short of our expectations. Nevertheless, the lively ambiance and attentive service ensured an enjoyable evening overall.\n\nHola!\nLove the vibes of Los Amigos!\n\nStaff are all extremely friendly and helpful!\nA shoutout to Boss, AJ, Vinod and Black for making our experience extra awesome!\n\nWe had Tacos, Quesadillas, Ceviches\u2026 everything was just perfect.

Yes, hawker stalls are cheaper and your mother\u2019s food might taste better to you, but check out the view. If you don\u2019t want crowds, don\u2019t come at 6:00 on Friday or Saturday. We had a late lunch riverside and no waiting. Deep fried items freshly cooked. \ud83d\udc4d\n\nI LOVE THIS PLACE. THE LADY IS EXTREMELY NICE ITS A BEAUTIFUL RESTAURANT. OMG THE FOOD IS DELICIOUS, COME AFTER A GOOD NIGHT OF DRINKS AND FUN AND YOU WILL BE IN HEAVEN. I RECOMMEND THE REFRIED BEANS AND SHRIMP QUESADILLA AND BIRRIA TACOS.BEEN HERE 3x IN ONE WEEK. NO COMPLAINTS\n\nThe restaurant outlook, ambience, seating and food were good. We had some reservations before walking in to the restaurent as Kids demanded but believe me - It is worth spending time and money here. We ain\u2019t any real Mexican to gauge the authentic Mexican taste but when it comes with Indian flavours and thats when you love the taste.\n\nOrdered all kids choices from the menu but all of us adults got surprised too with the taste of all.\n\nKudos to the servers as they taken care of the order very well and our appreciations to the chef.\n\n\nOption: 8:\nName: Nixta Mexican Grill & Bar\nAddress: 116 Amoy St, #116, Singapore 069936\nPhone: None\nDelivery Available: Information Not Available\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.3\nReviews: \n\nVery good Mexican restaurant (and it is my favorite food in the world). The cocktails are well balanced and they are able to go off menu. The food is great, and the wood grill is bringing good flavor. Negative points: Cocktails are a bit pricey\n\nMy team mates organise this dinner session and it was my first time having Mexican food.\n\nWe had fish taco, potatoes and beef taco (not sure what is the dishes names). I also thought taco is crispy type but it is pretty similar to peking duck wrap that I am familiar with.\n\nIt was a new experience and I enjoyed it.\n\nI understand the restaurant is pretty popular so reservation is needed. The restaurant ambient is nice too.\n\nI mean, it\u2019s good - but not 18$-a-taco-good.\nThe appetisers are served in relatively big portions (the guacamole is very well seasoned, but again, 26$ for chips?)\nThe only thing I found amazing and well priced was the half chicken - it was beautifully cooked and seasoned.\nThe tacos were a let down - greasy, small, nothing special.\nAnd the atmosphere is very, very serious.\nFor similar prices you can find more creative food for sure.\n\nEvery single dish that we ordered tasted sooooo good. Tlayuda de la Casa was something super unique which I have been eyeing on ever since I found out about this restaurant and wasn\u2019t sure which one it was in the menu but the wait staff was super helpful and recommended that we add the lobster meat. It was sweet and savory in all the right balance.\n\nWe managed to make it early for the happy hour which has tacos and drinks. However, we ended up in the first dinner seating and couldn\u2019t keep the table past 8pm and we had to pack most of our food to go\u2026\n\nFood was impeccable, as much as the service was great, we believe that it could be better since there was a hefty price tag to this restaurant.\n\nNixta. Coming from the word \"nixtamalization\", a process by which maize/corn is processed by an alkaline solution. #TIL.\n\nWhat can I say? The food here is pretty good but make sure you wallets are thick. Best dish is the Tlayuda de la Casa, a crunchy tortilla with corn all other ingredients. We opted for the additional lobster but the super sweet corn is all I can remember of this dish. The whole dish is just perfect.\n\nNext best is the giant churros. Amazing soft and hot churros topped with cinnamon sugar. The sauces were only a distraction.\n\nThe fingerlings cooked in duck fat were pretty good with the cheese and sour cream too. Duck and pork belly tacos were decent but the portions were kinda small. My other friends seemed to like the chicken. While I admit that it was pretty juicy and tender, I find it a bit too salty. Like salt baked chicken.\n\nService staff were very competent and friendly. One of them even offered to help us take photos.\n\nWe did end up going elsewhere for more food.\n\n\nOption: 9:\nName: Super Loco Customs House\nAddress: 70 Collyer Quay, #01-04 Customs House, Singapore 049323\nPhone: 9816 0659\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nSunday: Closed\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.3\nReviews: \n\nVarieties of veg food is available.\nPre booking is highly recommended.\nHave been here 2 times and will definitely go again since the quality of food, service and the ambience is amazing.\nMBS view dining is great.\n\nVisit Date - 13 August 2023\n\nIt was a very pleasant experience at Super Loco @Customs House. On a Sunday it was quiet and we had booked a table outside overlooking the Marina.\nIt is recommended to visit during sunset, there is a refreshing breeze and slowly the marina lights up all happy and colourful - a perfect way to gear up for the new week.\nWe were served by Danial. He gave some unbiased suggestions highlighting what he likes and why and some other items why his colleagues like\n\nBased on that we ordered\nA Bottle of Pineapple and Calamani Margarita - It was light & refreshing\nTrotilla chips with salsa roja\n\nFor the main course we had\nWagyu Steak - juicy bite sized on a taco\nBeef Quesadilla - quite tasty\n\nThis should have been enough for dinner but for us it was not complete without a dessert so we indulged in\nChocolate Lava - as mentioned by Danial, the Mint ice cream and choco-lava cake made a super combo.\nPanna Cotta - personally I liked this the best. The tang of lemon sorbet balanced the sweet Oaxaca cheese topped with the crunch of pistachio crumble. This is an item to return for.\nThanks Super Loco\n\nDon\u2019t be surprised by my 5 STAR ratings\ud83e\udd23 I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s not because of my birthday\ud83c\udf1d\n\nSo I celebrated my birthday at this restaurant and it was on a Saturday\ud83d\ude0a I love went to other restaurant before but not this location. The VIEW is superb even at 6pm(before sunset)\n\nI ordered Chefs Recommendation $48/6 dishes.. I would say the portion is not too much and just nice for my appetite\u2026 So, as I put in the reservation remark column, they gave me a hat that night with a complimentary citrusy shots\ud83e\udd23 Ok, it\u2019s a bonus drink, what do you expect? A glass of beer or wine? \ud83e\udd23\n\nSo.. If you like to enjoy beautiful view with nice Mexican food, you should consider here and make your reservation early at least a week before your selected date\ud83d\ude09\n\nAbsolutely delicious and satisfying Mexican fare in a chill, laid-back setting by the Bay. No complaints and would definitely return! The chips and dips are a must-order!!\n\nDropped in just before last call for orders at 9pm on a weekend, but the staff were friendly and helpful even though we were latecomers. We ordered a selection of tacos, tostados, the nacho chips and a salad - everything was served very quickly, tasted fresh, balanced, overall just really delicious.\n\nThe nacho chips with the range of dips was probably the star of the night. It\u2019s usually a starter that I take for granted but the sauces here pack a punch - so so good and deceivingly simple-looking. I may not be a regular diner at Mexican restaurants but I\u2019d imagine that it would be hard to top this off. Can\u2019t wait to go back!\n\nWe got an outdoor seat beside the Bay Area with the backdrop Marina Bay Sands.\nThe view was awesome, there were a lot of people gathering around the area just to take photos in the evening.\n\nEverything we ordered tasted fantastic, and the plating was colourful. The service was warm, friendly and attentive. It rained halfway and Solihin quickly relocated us indoor, and offered to leave the door open so we can enjoy the view, until the rain got heavier.\n\nOverall, it was a unique and warm five star experience!\n\n\nOption: 10:\nName: Guzman y Gomez - Funan\nAddress: 107 North Bridge Rd, #B1-35, Singapore 179105\nPhone: 8499 3048\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 10:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 10:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 10:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 10:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 10:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 10:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 10:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.6\nReviews: \n\nAlways love to Guzman for a quick Mexican fix!

Not bad at all although diff frm authentic Mexican. Tables are small and very near to each other (maybe it is this branch only). Servings of nachos is hearty.\n\nHad a breakfast here. Try their burritos bowl tacos, and burrito. Had Jarritos as drink too, it was very refreshing. All was very nice and fulfilling, great Mexican Restaurant \ud83d\udd1d\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb\n\nAll the staffs were also very friendly and helpful. Will definitely come back for another visit when staying near Funan.\n\nService was very slow. Burrito bowls, tacos, and the enchiladas were fine and tasted as good as the other branches.\nHope that they can improve the kitchen process and not keep taking new orders when there are many waiting in the kitchen.\n",

Friendly service; we left, saying we'd probably be back and were greeted warmly when we did. Curries are delicious and the pakoras are tasty too. Chili pakoras are no joke though, super spicy!\n\nUsed to be my go to for Indian food but finds that recent visits are less pleasant. Staff not able to describe properly the dishes seems they can\u2019t speak English well. The food are just ok not fantastic.\n\nLove the bread basket, butter chicken and palak paneer! The chicken biryani is so so. The place is air conditioned with good hygiene. Quite a lot of tourists in the restaurant.\n\nButter chicken is good, but the tandoori chicken is okay but proportion is small, overall is pricey, and they have too many take away orders that took very long to serve our food, the outdoor tables are close to street where is not so good when raining\n\nAbsolutely brilliant food.

Enjoyed pani puri but maybe a bit too sweet for me. Equally the dal maklani was too salty and buttery albeit managed to finish quite a big helping. Pricing is bonkers tho with rice and dal dishes being close to 15 dollars. Service was excellent and I would come back and try a few other dishes. One issue is the lack of bathroom facilities or washbasin in the restaurant. You have to exit and do a couple of doors down and my nose never did recover from little India\u2019s more underground smells !\n\nI had a great experience at this Indian restaurant\n\nThe food was great and I enjoyed the service, the staff were friendly and helpful.\n\nI like the atmosphere, and I appreciated how quickly the food was served.\n\nWhile I haven't explored many Indian restaurants yet, I'm looking forward to returning to try more dishes in the future.\n\nSo far the best chaats I have had in Singapore. Nice and proper place to sit and enjoy the food. Prices are not exorbitant. One thing I dislike is that they don't have a proper hand wash inside the restaurant. Have to go out to wash and come back using the swing door, which defeats the purpose of washing hands. Indian food must be enjoyed by using hands, so hand wash point in the restaurant is a must.\n\nUpdate on 18 Sep,\nSince I liked the chaats, I thought of having at airport as I saw it was at T1 terminal @ L2. When I went there, they said it was moved to different location. Management must take out the signboard from T1 as it gives wrong information.\n\nVery good option for Indian vegetarian food. Was seated very fast and the service was also good. During peak dinner time 8-9pm place will be crowded and generally there will be waiting.\nVast Manu covers most of the Indian variety food. Food is really tasty, especially all the chat items are very nice. If you are looking for   Indian vegetarian food definitely worth a try.\n\nGreat North Indian cuisine. Service was slower than expected, however food was good.

The mutton biryani was rich and tender. Accompanied with the Malai chicken kebab, which was served on a sizzling hot plate that oozed rich flavours. Finally, the Gulab Jamun was rich and fragrant without exceedingly sweet. Topped with the Mango milkshake served with passion, the food was downed with great enjoyment.\n\nCome on down if you are in the vicinity, you won\u2019t regret it.\n\nThe food was excellent, the service exquisite. Thanks to the waiter we ordered incredibly good food. The Goan fish curry was probably the best I ever had. The mint chutney was very strong in taste, hence it was the first time I ever really appreciated it as an appetizer sauce.\n\nWould definitely recommend, way better than expected.\n\nLove their lamb rack briyani. The briyani was not too oily, flavourful and lamb rack was succulent. Lamb was not gamey at all. Their lassi and dal makhni were very rich in flavour. They have a variety of sauces to complement different dishes which pairs very well.

Loved sitting on the floor upstairs. The chef / owner was lovely. I think my favorite dish was the butter chicken, but honey everything we tried was lovely. The samosas and the tandoori chicken were also great. Yum!\n\nHad an incredible time here! My group stumbled in not knowing at all what was in store for us.\n\nWe first of all were impressed that this place made the Michelin List so many years in a row, and then we saw the hilarious Spice Challenge and were intrigued with all of the fun events this place hosts like the Full Moon Nights & the cooking classes. The owner/chef was so awesome. He was so funny and sarcastic and also encouraged us to get out of our American-Indian comfort zone and wouldn\u2019t let us all just order Tikka Masala as we originally planned, and because of that, it turns out I found authentic Indian food I loved even more! I really wish I lived here so I could take the cooking classes with him!\n\nMany thanks for providing our group with such an entertaining experience and pushing us out of our comfort zones. It was truly a time!\n\nWOW! Where do I even begin\u2026 easily one of the best, most delicious places to eat out I\u2019ve ever been to! Great and authentic setting, delicious Indian cuisine and lovely staff to make you feel like home. The spicy challenge is so fun and the taste of the food there is simply out of this world! A must visit if you happen to be in Singapore!\n\nChanged my perception of Indian food in Singapore : well-curated, small portion size, so I didn't feel stuffy while digesting and a bit pricy. Masala tea was better than I had in Mumbai but it would have been perfect if the sugar was on the side.\n\nAn amazing and authentic environment with unique deliveries of classic dishes. They have a sauce heat sampler platter to see what heat level you like.  There's a challenge wall for those seeking immortality as well. But the naan and sauces are too notch. A must try. The proprietors are amazing and have a fun sense of humo(u?)r.\n\n\nOption: 6:\nName: Komala Vilas Restaurant, Singapore\nAddress: 76-78 Serangoon Rd, Singapore 217981\nPhone: 6293 6980\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 7:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 7:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 7:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 7:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 7:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 7:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 7:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.3\nReviews: \n\nA delight to every South Indian dish that\u2019s being presented! The restaurant holds the legacy with not just the location, the interior but also to the taste with food. We tried a few variations including the famous meal and biriyani. A must try will be the meal combo, served hot. We had to wait for around 30 mins to get seated but it\u2019s worth the wait.. ground floor and first floor has seating capacity. The prices are very reasonable for the quantity being served. Will definitely recommend this place for all South Indian vegetarian fans!\n\nFood here is good, not that very bad. Service got to improve. Environment can be cramped and noisy. Pricey but still okay, you pay what you asked for. I was served food first, even finished up eating the foods but drinks were served after 5-10 after finishing up my meals. Masala tea arrived 30-40 minutes late upon ordering. This is not acceptable at all. And never even apologized for serving the drinks late. I ordered one ice tea and one masala tea. Also, I personally feel the standard of the food have dropped a lot. Used to patronize here often but I think it's about time that the service and food taste is falling apart.\nOverall food is 7.5/10.\nService is 3/10.\nEnvironment is 4.5/10.\nThis review is based on my honest opinion.\n\nArrived at around 11am on a Saturday morning and there was already a queue. However the queue moves fast!\nWas allocated to a seat on level 2. Contrary to what was written in other reviews, I didn't feel that the staircase was narrow. The entire restaurant is air-conditioned and clean.\n\nBe sure to order at the cashier before heading back to your seat, where you'll hand the receipt to the waiter.\n\nThe lady at the counter was friendly and honest! She prompted me that what I've ordered is sufficient for the amount of people I came with (rather than allowing me to order more eventhough that'll mean they'll earn more money).\n\nThe Bhatura was huge, delicious! So was the mysore dosai! The masala tea was flavourful, packed with spice and not too sweet. The Gobi Manchurian was however a little too salty for my liking.\n\nBe sure to ask the waiters for your Masala Tea if you will like it to be served before/during your meal. If you don't, I noticed that they'll only serve it at the end of your meal.\n\nWill be back!\n\nI saw this on a food travel show and immediately wanted to try it out.\n\nThere was a short queue but seated after 5min or so wait. Service was friendly and no fuss. Dining area is simple but as expected.\n\nDefinitely lived up to expectations with amazing, fresh, authentic and tasty food. I had the dosai meal which had 3 curries, some chutneys, Daal, sambar, and even a sweet sago coconut pudding. Amazing flavours, colours and spices. A generous meal which was thoroughly enjoyable.\n\nFor a sweet finish I tried the almond hawa and milk kova which were both new to me. Very sweet but had their own unique taste and texture which hit the spot.\n\nOne improvement would be to use less plastic for serving food - lots of little plastic containers on my meal set and for sweets.\n\nOverall a great experience and will definitely be recommending and be back.\n\nThe food and service is always good in Komala Vilas. We stay nearby so we can walk to this restaurant during our jaunt in Singapore.\nI wish they include an elevator to go upstairs for lunch. On request they let my parents share the meals but mentioned there will be no refills.\nTaste is always exceptional.\n\n\nOption: 7:\nName: Mustard Singapore - Flavours of Bengal & Punjab\nAddress: 32 Race Course Rd, Singapore 218552\nPhone: 6297 8422\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:45\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:45\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:45\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:45\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:45\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20094:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:45\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:45\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.6\nReviews: \n\nWelcome to delightful India right in the middle of Singapore. Located in Race Course road and in the vicinity of Little India this place screams authenticity. The quaint place had nice decor and a good vibe. We had the butter chicken, lady finger vegetable curry, fish tikka, garlic and cheese Naan as well as a starter which was a flatbread filled with a spinach style filling and a curry on the side to dip the bread.  For drinks we had a mango lassi and lime juice. Everything was delicious and the service was delightful and friendly. Recommended to make a reservation as it got quite busy on a Thursday evening.\n\nExcellent dinner at Mustard on Race Course Rd. Restaurant is small and intimate and service is excellent and attentive.  They have a huge menu with tons of choices so we ordered way too much to try many things. Everything was wonderful but especially recommend the house special Chingri Maacher Malai, the Aloo Jhuri, Mutton Biryani and the kathi kababs.\n\nLocated in the Little India neighborhood. This restaurant has friendly staff, of which unfortunately not everyone speaks English.\n\nFood menu is extensive and you don't have to wait very long on your food. Not everything was of my personal taste, but I am sure the food was nice. Also enough dessert choices and even typical Indian drinks.\n\nDo note that the air conditioning is very cold here, somewhat too cold (heard the same thing from a co-worker who visited earlier).\n\nHad a very enjoyable meal here. You can taste the actual flavours, aroma, spices.\n\nAs compared to other restaurants, you can taste the actual ingredients in the sauces, as they use fresh ingredients and fresh spices.\n\nThe briyani was extremely aromatic as well!\n\n10/10 would come back again!\n\nExcellent food!\n\nWe arrived at opening at 11:30 specifically bent on enjoying authentic Bengali food\u2014we left satisfied and glad we came early!\n\nThe waiters are able to make excellent recommendations. We opted to go straight for mains:\n\n- Kosha Mangsho: tender chunks of mutton in a fantastic thicker gravy\n\n- Chingri Maacher Malai Curry: delicate shrimp and coconut curry presented in a tender coconut\n\n- Maacher Paturi: boneless fish fillet smothered in mustard, gently steamed in a banana leaf\n\nRice bread does not come with each main, and does require separate purchasing. We opted for:\n- Luchi: aka puri, lightly fried and crisp\n- Roomali Roti: one roti is rather large, and folded in on itself; delicate with a great chew\n- Plain white rice\n\nFor dessert, we enjoyed Rossomalai (aka Rasmalai), a dessert in most areas of India, but theirs is fragrant and richly flavored with cardamom, almonds, and cream.\n\nAll in all, a fantastic visit for those who enjoy Indian food and are looking for something different than what most restaurants serve. They do include Punjabi items in their menu, which is typically what most people think of when they think \u201cIndian,\u201d but venturing off to possibly \u201cunfamiliar\u201d dishes won\u2019t disappoint!\n\n\nOption: 8:\nName: Muthu's Curry\nAddress: 138 Race Course Rd, #01-01, Singapore 218591\nPhone: 6392 1722\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 10:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 10:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 10:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 10:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 10:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 10:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 10:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4\nReviews: \n\nCould not believe this is a Michelin\u2019s recommended place. It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve been here and sadly to say, I\u2019ll not come back again.\n\nI ordered the curry fish head, chicken tikka and chicken biriyani. The expectation of the curry fish head was high but was the biggest disappointment. Not much taste, more towards blend with lots of unnecessary spices. Chicken tikka was not bad but the biriyani was also terrible. Rice was cold and stale.\n\nLet\u2019s come to the service. The server, an Indian guy who took my order was kind of rude and distracted. When taking my order, he was also at the same time talking loudly to other Indian servers. I had to repeat my order thrice. He didn\u2019t seem to be happy working there. He was very uninterested when I asked him a question about the menu and gave the \u201cwould u hurry up\u201d face. When he came back with the glasses and water, he slammed it on the table loudly. Only when i stared at him, he retracted back. I didn\u2019t get his name though but I could recognize him. Ironically, the friendliest server was a Chinese lady server that day.\n\nFor the price you are paying, it\u2019s definitely not worth it for the food and the service. Both are terrible. The management should do something about most of the servers there. Their attitude seems that they own the restaurant or they are not interested to receive any customers.\n\nI urge anybody or tourist or what\u2019s to visit this restaurant to try other authentic Singapore Indian food elsewhere. You will be getting better food and service elsewhere\n\nGood Indian food here. Fish head curry is a must. Quite a big portion of fish head here. Butter chicken was also good.\n\nIt was getting mire crowded at dinner time. Reservation might be required at dinner time. Luckily we came slightly before dinner time.\n\nPrice was expensive though. 4 adults cost me SGD 200+\n\nMy first visit to this restaurant was a memorable one. The food was remarkably tasty, and the staff\u2019s friendly and attentive nature added an extra touch of warmth. I will definitely be returning for more delightful meals and their top-notch service.\n\nfood was very authentic and service was quick. although the pricing will definitely be slightly higher than ur usual indian street spot. this restaurant is well air conditioned and has proper plating and service so price is definitely what you get. staff also abit too eager... clearing plates before we leave the table even. the place wasn't packed so i feel like such etiquette should be rectified to enhance customer experience\n\n22/07/23\nHave higher expectations for Michelin restaurants. Fish head curry is average. The curry has full flavour of curry spices but lack of savoury. Curry chicken has similar taste too. Overall food is only slightly above average.\n\n\nOption: 9:\nName: Madras New Woodlands Restaurant\nAddress: 14 Upper Dickson Rd, Singapore 207474\nPhone: 6297 1594\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 7:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 7:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 7:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 7:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 7:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 7:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 7:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 1 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.2\nReviews: \n\nI love the vadai, it's the tastiest I've ever had and I'm surprised how nice and crisp it is outside, and soft and warm inside.

The Briyani Mutton is a flavor explosion - tender, fragrant, and perfectly spiced. The Tandoori Prawn is a succulent masterpiece, charred to perfection. The vibrant atmosphere and friendly staff enhance the experience. Whether you're a foodie or a spice enthusiast, Apollo is a must-visit for a mouthwatering journey through Indian cuisine. This place is a true gem that satisfies cravings and ignites a love for authentic Indian flavors. Don't miss out on this remarkable culinary adventure!\n\nWent to Banana Leaf for dinner with my colleagues while on a business trip in Singapore, we really enjoyed the authentic Indian food. Our food was served on banana leaves which was a really cool experience plus the food was exceptional and tasty. The service was also good.\n\nMy parents and me were there for lunch, ordered the medium sized curry fish head with briyani rice and lime juice. The curry and side vegetables were flavourful, of acceptable spiciness . Medium size fish head portion was just nice for 3pax. The bill came up to $80+.. Feel that their food is over-priced. Go to them  if u don't mind paying a bit more\n\nRipoff ! The rice which was supposedly free flow is so expensive!\n\nGive it a try when you are in little India. Our bill was about $100.\n\nWe ordered medium fish head curry, tandoori chicken and we got the portion of rice which comes with vegetables and gravy.\n\nMasala tea was bad- skip. Overall a nice experience and you can bring your family and friends if they are from out of town!\n\nHowever it\u2019s not worthwhile to order the rice if u r not a big eater !\n\nFirst time at banana leaf on a Friday evening. Atmosphere was great. Gotta say the fish head curry packed a punch with the rich, tangy flavour of the gravy. Perfect match with the biryani rice.\n",

Initially wondering why the place was so empty when I arrived but after a while it was totally packed.\nA little confusing on the menu because the physical one outside the shop had dinner menu and lunch menu and the electronic one only had lunch. Not sure if could only order from the lunch menu tab but upon asking could order from anywhere from the menu. There were duplicate dishes on ala carte and lunch menu because portion size was smaller and it comes with a set of soup and rice.\nOrdered quite a few items to try, the most important thing I wanted to try was the marinated raw crab and we also ordered the galbi along with some other dishes like seafood pancake and kimchi stew.\nEverything here was good, from the sides to the mains. The galbi was cooked by the staff and it was cooked to perfection. Raw crab was also nice and flavourful and well marinated.\nBill came and it was slightly expensive but definitely worth for the quantity and the quality. Would definitely come back again!\n\nReservations are recommended. When we visited on a Saturday for lunch, the place was packed.\n\nThe pork was good. The staff isn't very interactive or smiley, but they are quite helpful when it comes to grilling the meat.\n\nWas brought here by a friend for dinner. He came here here quite a few time and highly recommend me to come here. There were already a crowd when we reached. There was 5 group ahead of us and we waited for almost half and hour before it was our turn.\n\nApart from the ala carte, they also have different sets available. The Korean bbq here Is cooked via charcoal. The stuff will help you prep the food. Sides dishes is refillable. The marination of the meat was fantastic, not too sweet nor salty.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the food and would definitely be back again.\n\nThe newly revamp joint has a real modern touch. Service is absolutely amazing. Food quality is top notch. Many tables was having the raw crab. Looks good however didn\u2019t dare to try. Seafood pancake was delicious & they don\u2019t skimp on the ingredients. Btw the steam egg is FOC. Every table has it. We wanted to order however the waitress explained they will provide every table with one.\nHighly recommended.\n\nFirst time trying Guiga and I\u2019m so glad we did! Everything from service to food was perfect. I loved the beef tartare and marinated crabs\u2764\ufe0f We got the Black Pork set with a side of beef ribs and the samgyetang, which is by far the tastiest I\u2019ve had in Singapore. We didn\u2019t quite enjoy the steamed egg, maybe cos we let it sit there for too long because we were busy eating up the feast we ordered!

Food took 10 minutes to arrive from the time we got a table and ordered.\n\nMust Try (\u203c\ufe0f): The meat in BBQ Set C - Beef Brisket, Marinated Beef Rib, Marinated Chicken - delicious and good value at $79.80 before tax and service charges // The shredded cabbage salad with black sesame dressing banchan.\n\nService: Good - the service staff was polite but the chicken was left on the grill for too long.\n\nNote: The restaurant\u2019s ventilation system isn\u2019t great - the smoke will get absorbed into your clothes and hair.\n\nThe food is great, excellent customer service, banchan is delicious, so happy to try their Ganjang Gejang.We had a great dinner at Supulae Korean BBQ, thank you very much, definately will be back again.\n\nSupposed to go to another outlet across the road for korean bbq but the queue was too long. Ended up in this restaurant.\nNice refreshing sides.\nThe meat are delicious and the sauces are what you will experience in korea.\nStaff are prompt in getting the meat bbq for you.\nBest of all, nice ventilation system as the restaurant is not smokey compared to other outlets.\nOrdered their Supulae set\n\nOrdered Set B which comprised chicken and pork. Selected kimchi stew as the side which was disappointing : diluted soup with cabbage and eggs with a hint of kimchi taste and red colouring. Steamed egg was plain steamed egg with no garnishes. Half half pancake was too mushy  with flour inside. Standard had dropped significantly since my last visit a few years ago. The sides tasted like they came out of a packet. Liked the finely shredded cabbage with black sesame sauce though. I think the restaurant has room for improvement if it wants to stand out from the heaps of similar options along this street.  Supulae has been around longer than the rest of the Korean bbq restaurants here and it should do better on their dishes. There is certainly fierce competition but Supulae needs to only not stinge on the quality then Ioyal customers like me will come back.\n\n\nOption: 3:\nName: Todamgol Restaurant\nAddress: 27 Tg Pagar Rd, Singapore 088450\nPhone: 6224 7077\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4\nReviews: \n\nWe visited this place for 3-4times. And tried different dishes. The restaurant is ran by Korean. It is authentic Korean cuisine. The atmosphere is chill and cozy. Our favorite food is the spicy chicken feet pot and the beef rib soup.\nThe panchan\ud310\ucc2cthere are also nice and the waiter and waitress are responsive. Just that sometime they get really busy.\nIt would be really lovely to go there for a sip of the hot soup on a rainy and cold morning.\nReally like this place a lot.\n\noverall a popular place with good options of home cooking style Korean food, better to have more than 3people sharing , portion is big for 2 person, you may only get a chance to try 1 or 2 type of food. The pork and chicken dishes are big portion. Chicken feet comes with steam egg and rice balls, it\u2019s a good combination and good to share.\nCame at around 630pm on a Friday evening, it started to get very busy from 7pm.\n\nCame here on a Wednesday night at 7 p.m., and no reservations were needed. I have walked past this restaurant a few times, but I was more familiar with their nostalgic cultural Korean decorations. They moved recently to a new area along the same stretch, and it's so minimalistic now... A lot more space is catered for diners, with rooms for big groups. Side dishes was pretty okay only. Toilet is huge too!\n\n\ud83d\udca7 Water is complimentary\n\nWe ordered:\n\n\ud83d\udc14 Jjimdak ($55)\nBraised chicken in dark sauce, this dish is one of my favourites in korea. And this standard is pretty okay! Huge portion that feeds at least 4 people. Chicken could have been braised longer to have more flavour. The japchae noodles at the bottom soak up a lot of sauce, so it's quite filling, along with potatoes and carrots.\n\nI rate: 3.5/5 \ud83c\udf1f\n\n\ud83c\udf43 Minari Jun ($28)\n1st time trying Minari, and we were surprised how fresh this vegetable pancake tasted. It didn't have a celery scent and tasted rather clean. Quite flat as well. Would like it if it's bigger.\nI rate: 4.5/5 \ud83c\udf1f\n\n\ud83c\udf76 Pine Nut Draught Wine ($28)\nThe way it's served is pretty interesting! In a small vat with a wooden scoop into a shallow bowl. It was a little gassy and had a faint, nutty sweet aftertaste.\n\nI rate: 4/5 \ud83c\udf1f\n\nThis place serves very authentic Korean food. Although traditional bbq was available, no one was having that as the standout are the Korean cooked dishes. It's quite close to the Korean food I had in Korea last year. The standout is the braised short ribs. It's so tender and meat falls off the bone easily. Pair the rice with the braised sauce and it's heavenly. The radishes and carrots were so yummy too. 2nd best was the assorted pancakes. It was like no other I had tried before. There were fish, mushroom, prawns and it's so all very special. It really fills you up too. The place was not very closely packed where you're sitting shoulder to shoulder and tables well spaced apart, unlike some other Korean restaurants here. The restroom are also very clean.\n\nWent for an early dinner and was given a spacious seat for our family of 4. Ordered the barbecued pork belly and beef. They will actually sliced the meat and barbecue the meat for you so that you don\u2019t have to actually do it yourself. Ordered the beef bulgogi for the kids and the kids loved it. Not too many of non spicy options for kids though. Kimchi pancake tasted great while the cold noodles were quite soggy. Overall prices are on the higher side, especially the barbecued meats. Service can be improved, cos we waited quite long for the rice to be ready and there wasn\u2019t anyone to inform us that we have to wait for the rice.\n\n\nOption: 4:\nName: O.BBa BBQ\nAddress: 63 Tg Pagar Rd, Singapore 088484\nPhone: 6222 0840\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u20096:00\u202fAM\nTuesday: Closed\nWednesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u20096:00\u202fAM\nThursday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u20096:00\u202fAM\nFriday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u20096:00\u202fAM\nSaturday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u20096:00\u202fAM\nSunday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u20095:00\u202fAM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.5\nReviews: \n\nAfter a few turns, I decided to try this place because of the reviews. Dun get me wrong, but my experience with the food is just, like I say just ......will I be back.... there's plenty other places to try. The set I ordered was JUST, the side dishes \ud83d\ude14 but the bean paste soup is really good. I have eaten Korean food before the craze. Maybe it's better to  get \u00e0 la carte. The service is tops.\n\nRestaurant That Are Actually Worth Waiting In Line For !!\n\nExcellent service, staff were all very friendly and helpful and the service was fast too. More than anything, the food was super delicious.\n\nA restaurant I really want to recommend to Local And Korean.\n\nMy preferred spot for satisfying my Korean food cravings!\n\nTheir kimchi soup is not only incredibly delicious but also delightfully thick. The steamed egg is a real treat too.\n\nThe best part? The attentive waiter who expertly handles the grilling of all the raw foods, from pork slices to chicken slices, allowing you to relish the meal without constant grill-checking.\n\nThe only challenge is their generous portions; the set meal is quite large for two people, even for a couple like us.\n\nOn busy weekends, expect a decent wait with a long queue, but it moves surprisingly fast. We arrived around 7 pm and waited approximately 30 minutes for dinner.\n\nDespite that, I'll undoubtedly return whenever the Korean BBQ cravings strike!\n\nThe food is good, there are varieties of meat including marinated and non marinated. Server will help to cook the food for you. They provide lots of sides (7 when I counted). Had Set C which was a combination of pork and beef and complimentary steamed egg with roe and choice of soup. Only thing is the waiting time cos it could be 2 hrs and above and dining time was 90mins.\n\nHad dinner at this restaurant and definitely the top 3 Korean BBQ restaurant in Singapore \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\n\nThis gem offers good quality meat which surely justify the money paid! Their pork was tender, fresh and no gamy smell at all. Their banchan were all very delicious except for the fish cake which was too tough and thick.\n\nSteam egg is good, well seasoned and below was charred on point! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb The naengmyeon was icy cold and the broth is flavourful but not too overpowering. And it goes so well with the meat.\n\nThey provide excellent service, staff were all very friendly and helpful and the service was fast too!one thing amazed me most is the staff will keep asking if your side dishes need to be refill which you don\u2019t see it anywhere.\n\nThe atmosphere is pleasant and with Korean staff and their warm welcome, it will bring you to Korea instantly. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\n\n\nOption: 5:\nName: Twins Korean Restaurant\nAddress: 7 Craig Rd, Singapore 089667\nPhone: 6221 5205\nDelivery Available: Information Not Available\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.1\nReviews: \n\nFun place for fried chicken and beers. Loved the ice cream beer (aka frozen foam). Very neat concept. The chicken was great - you can get almost anything deboned which is awesome. I think we liked the cheese the best, but the garlic soy was lovely as well.\n\nI went there on a quiet Monday night, and the place was pretty empty. A perfect spot for a relaxed catch-up.\n\nWe ordered two half chicken dishes - Yangnyeom & Soy Garlic flavour, along with a japchae. The chicken surprised us with its light, crispy batter and tasty sauces. The japchae, on the other hand, was okay and also had a rather small portion size.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend this place for a casual weekday dinner with friends \ud83d\udc4d\n\nTasty chicken and light cooling beer soju. Special ice cream beer. Good place for friends to hangout after work. Not so crowded during weekdays\n\nWe randomly chanced upon this when searching for good Korean food on Google so we decided to come here for dinner. Although we made reservations, it seems like the restaurant is relatively quiet during weekday nights (we came on a Tuesday night) - but nevertheless just make reservations in case things change!\n\nWe ordered a bowl of Jjamppong and got the original fried chicken to share (attached is the menu to see the different options). Portion is decent but the food was SUPER good! Honestly, the chicken batter was perfect and it was neither too oily or salty for our liking. The jjamppong wasn't too spicy or bland - just the right balance too. They even had a decent serving of seafood.\n\nThere was only one service staff member at that time and she was super professional and smiley when taking our orders and paying the bill. The overall vibes was really cool too, with Korean music playing in the background (not too loud so you can have proper conversations without shouting at the top of your voice). All in all, I would 10/10 recommend anyone looking for good authentic Korean food in Tanjong Pagar. It is a short walk from both Outram Park and Tanjong Pagar MRT stations.\n\nOriginal boneless chicken with onion sauce ($24++ = $28) - 2.5 stars\nEnough for one person though I'm probably not a bit eater. But this made me question whether KFC really is just overpriced Kentucky Fried Chicken. The chicken was kind of ordinary, although I imagine it had more meat than you'd find at Kentucky FC (and I haven't been there in years). But the issue was probably the onion sauce, which tasted like fairly artificial and processed mustard. I much preferred the fresh Pico de gallo-like onion sauce at Chir Chir. Would not pay $28 for this again.\n\n======\n\nBoneless chicken with sweet and spicy and rice cakes - 4.5 stars\nThe boneless chicken was juicer than the bone-in chicken surprisingly. My husband, who usually prefers the latter said he would just order the boneless chicken the next time. It was my second time having Korean fried chicken - given that the last time I had something similar was probably KFC popcorn chicken decades ago, I was pleasantly surprised that there was ample meat and not just a bunch of fried batter. I liked this sauce better than the soy garlic one but it was definitely sweet and towards the end I didn't quite enjoy the sweetness. We got the medium and it was larger than we expected.\n\nSoy garlic 6 piece - 4.25 stars\nSweet sauce and could barely taste the garlic.\n\nGood place for Korean fried chicken, but personally I think the sauces are too sweet for me.\n\n\nOption: 6:\nName: Mul Gogi Korean BBQ\nAddress: 48 Tras St, Singapore 078987\nPhone: 6904 9493\nDelivery Available: Information Not Available\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 5:00\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nTuesday: 5:00\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nWednesday: 5:00\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nThursday: 5:00\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nFriday: 5:00\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nSaturday: 12:00\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nSunday: 12:00\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.5\nReviews: \n\nThe Korean BBQ experience was truly authentic, featuring a variety of trays for grilling meat. The assortment of meat flavors and generous portions were impressive. While it might be a bit on the expensive side, the fact that the staff personally cooks for you makes it entirely worthwhile.\n\nThe staff members were not only friendly but also knowledgeable about which options would best suit your taste buds.\n\nWill definitely be coming back again.\n\nTLDR: May return for the beef only\n\nType: Korean BBQ\n\nWaiting Time: 30min at 7pm on a Friday. Food took 10 minutes to arrive from the time we got a table and ordered.\n\nMust Try (\u203c\ufe0f): The meat in BBQ Set D - Ribeye, Boneless Beef Ribs, Beef Short Ribs - very flavourful\n\nGood to Try (\u2757\ufe0f): Bean Paste Stew - decent // Steamed Egg - decent\n\nDon\u2019t Try (\u274c): Cold Noodles - noodles needed another rinse as they were too starchy and the broth was bland // Kimchi Pancake - bland, thin, chewy and greasy\n\nService: Excellent - staff was polite and grilled the meat properly. They also gave us hangover tonic (see last picture), which was a nice touch.\n\nNote: The restaurant can get smoky and the smoke will get absorbed into your clothes and hair.\n\nOrdered BBQ set A with bean paste soup and a bowl of cold noodles. The service staff is very hospitable and polite despite them being super busy during dinner time. Deducting 1 star because the meat has a very smokey flavour after grilling on top of charcoal for a long time. The smokey flavour is not really my thing but idk you might like it. The ban chan selection is also not a lot. On the other hand, I really liked the bean paste soup though, it\u2019s very umami and addictive. The cold noodles are very refreshing, I really liked it\n\nTowards the end and round the corner of the Korean restaurant stretch at Tanjong Pagar, not that easy to find tbh but it was fairly quiet on a weekday evening and meats were of pretty good quality! Seafood pancake and cold noodles were AMAZING. Would come back for sure.\n\nWent there yesterday again with a friend. Since I have a big appetite and just wanna enjoy the food we chose to go on a Wednesday cuz there is like a curfew on weekends, a 90min time limit on Fri-Sun. We ordered the pork set(a generous portion of meat with seafood soup served on a cassette stove, it\u2019s peppery & more flavorful after allowing it to sit for longer. The set also includes eryngii, sesame leaf/lettuce/pickled radish/cucumber/garlic, fish cake, a variety of condiments & the mayo/yakisoba sauce omelette!! I can\u2019t have enough of that), wagyu beef as usual(it melts), and cold noodles (the best!). For someone who doesn\u2019t like rice wine, I was taken by surprise by their premium Soju, it doesn\u2019t have that awful bitter taste or that strong smell present in other rice wine,  rather it has a pleasant taste and fragrant aroma. Not forgetting the fact that I didn\u2019t get a migraine or hangover just goes to show how it\u2019s an alcoholic drink made for everyone, it\u2019s really great for sleep too, NGL I almost dozed off after drinking + the food coma\ud83e\udd74. The only downside is if only I had a second stomach! It\u2019s also really nice to have someone do the cooking for you, the staffs are also very attentive they would ask how you like your meat to be(e.g.medium or well done). To top it off, you get to choose a popsicle from 4 different flavors before you leave & it\u2019s on the house, personally I like the strawberry flavored one, it\u2019s dope!

Me andd my gf had the beef set meal at just 99 and it comes with so much beef and free flowing side dishes. The ambiance of the place was amazing down to their gold plated looking utensils and plates. The service was also very good. Definitely worth visiting!\n\nI've always passed by this restaurant, intrigued by its fancy interior and being a huge fan of Korean BBQ, I finally decided to give it a try for a birthday celebration. Unfortunately, I must admit that the experience left much to be desired in terms of both the food quality and overall value. We spent around $240 for a party of three, ordering the Beef Set, SotBap, and Kimchi Stew.\n\nOur initial disappointment began when we were seated right by the door, subject to a constant noise level that detracted from the dining ambiance. To compound our dissatisfaction, the food arrived at our table at an excruciatingly slow pace. When we were presented with a choice of grilling the meat ourselves or having it done in the kitchen. Regrettably, we opted for the latter, which proved to be a mistake because the result was overcooked beef - dry and vapid.\n\nIn an ironic twist, the Kimchi Stew turned out to be the only item that stood out.\n\nIn addition, surprise cake we brought for our friend took an unusually long time to make its appearance. This extended wait led our friend to catch on to the surprise, spoiling the special moment we had planned.\n\nIt is evident that the service staff were trying their best at service and perhaps they were understaffed. Nonetheless, that can't justify the disappointing quality of the food. All in all, it was a very unsatisfying experience and I definitely wouldn't recommend this restaurant to any of my friends.\n\nFirst time here , restaurant looks amazing and clean! Service is really good! But food quantity is not the surprise me\u2026is good experience,but maybe can more focus on food quality, I have same food in other restaurants and in Korea too.\n\nKorean Cuisine with fine dining but moderate price!\n\nI think this is one of the hidden gem in Tanjung Pagar area and if you love Korean food, MUST TRY.\n\nService is on par and beyond expectation! They might surprise you with mini food presentation \ud83d\ude02\n\nFood is well prepared.\n\nSuggest call to check table and availability.\n\nThey close quite early so dinner do come earlier.\n\nTo me, this is definitely a Michelin star worthy restaurant. From the pumpkin soup in the beginning, to the impressive and delectable array of banchan, the attentive service including the grilling of the meat for the diners - all these way exceeded our expectation of Korean BBQ experience here in Singapore, and at a price that is comparable to other restaurants. The brass cutlery used here accentuate the fine dining experience and feeling of indulging in a grandeur feast.  This would definitely be my goto place for Korean fare henceforth.\n\n\nOption: 8:\nName: SBCD Korean Tofu House\nAddress: 7 Wallich St, B1 - 01 / 02 Guoco Tower, Singapore 078884\nPhone: 6386 6441\nDelivery Available: Information Not Available\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.1\nReviews: \n\nSimply overpriced for the food standard and their service.\n\nWe ordered JabChae, Seafood pancake, Soontofu soup, LA Galbi, and Bulgogi.\n\nJabChae taste good but a bit too sweet.\nSeafood pancake, they use too much flour and not cook enough. Too thick and still sticky inside.\n\nSoontofu taste normal.\nBulgogi is also normal.\nLA Galbi is taste good but too expensive for it.\n\nService also not good. Need so long to get staff\u2019s attention to order. Even when we ask them to top up their side, eventually they didn\u2019t do it.\nPlus they should instruct soontofu comes with rice.\n\nOverall, to be honest, I really don\u2019t understand why Google review is over 4.\nAll dishes are overpriced for the quality.\nThere is a lot of good Korean food with reasonable price.\n\nWith three branches scattered across the island, this restaurant is renowned for its stellar tofu soup. You can take your pick from various proteins like beef, pork, or seafood. While there are alternative dishes like bibimbap or bulgogi for non-tofu enthusiasts, honestly, why would you venture here if not for the soothing allure of tofu soup? It's a must-try, deeply satisfying, and my friends who joined me even confessed that they occasionally sneak in for a solo, heartwarming meal.\n\nBeef short ribs were the highlight of the meal. A bit chewy but not heavily marinated so you can taste the beef itself. Surprisingly, the fried fish appetiser was quite enjoyable. It smelled slightly fishy but tasted nice with its light seasoning. Seafood tofu soup was a bit salty but went well with rice. Pancake was oily and bland.\n\nFamous chain from Korea. I reviewed the Millenia Walk outlet which is for dinner which i love. I came to this outlet for Lunch. Super crazy weekday lunch crowd. I was disappointed with my order of beef offal soup. The whole soup is so thick and chunky. I barely finished it. The price point is too high for a weekday lunch. I rather do dinner. The restaurant has no lack of fans. Always long queue even for weekday lunch.\n\nI have been too all 3 outlets and I personally find that this outlet staff are more friendly. First tip, try to make advance booking. I did via Chope. Very long queue during dinner time. Chope has got good deals too. Their portion is very big. I suggest if you have 2 pax, just order 1 combo and 1 side. The corn tea is very refreshing. After a hearty meal, they give free yakult.

Food was awesome and we love how friendly and attentive our server Mr Shin Young Wook and another staff that grilled our meat for us.\n\nI definitely feel so welcome here and will only come back here for Korean BBQ in the future !\n\nCompliments to all the staff !\n\nEndured more than an hour-long wait but was worth it. Though what I didn't understand about the queue is that we were asked to wait for 15 minutes and then it became more than 30 minutes. I am not sure if the one who manages the queue was tired or what. But so many groups are coming in and and I kept checking the status of my queue and it always says 1 group ahead of us. But every time someone comes in, we are never called so we ended up waiting longer. Minus one for service because of this. I do understand that we were late for around 5 minutes as we didn't here the call for the waitlist but he shouldn't have told us to wait for a certain amount and not be able to deliver it for us.\n\nBut overall, experiencing the wait firsthand, I finally get why there's a line for this spot. Meat was succulent and the rice balls are absolutely explosive in flavour. The must order from their menu. We didn't get to try jjajang coz it was a bit too much for 2 pax already.\n\nThe variety and generous portions of side dishes were plenty to satisfy me, so no need to go overboard with the ordering just like we did. Lesson learned. \ud83d\ude05 I am actually already very contented with just their side dishes.\n\nThe service was also very fast and genuine. You can really feel that the staff are accommodating you depsite the busy schedule. They are very attentive and cooks the food for you very well.\n\nOut of all the Korean restaurants in Singapore I've been to, the staffs are most kindest!! The meat is so fresh and everything from the side dishes that I could refill at any time was perfect \ud83d\ude0b Other than the meat, the food is so delicious!! It's a restaurant that makes me want to go every day \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffb\n\nTotal satisfaction!!! Every item is good, Jajangmyeon, Cheese Seafood Pancake, and BBQ Pork Collar is a must.\nFood is fresh and full of umami. Kudos to the staff for being friendly and helpful. They even grill our pork to perfection and always ask what we need next.\nThe atmosphere is cozy and surprisingly the temperature is cold and comfortable despite it being a Barbecue restaurant.\nLast but not least, the food portion is generous too at the price we're paying, I would say it's affordable.\n\nThe food was delicious.. specially the bbq (Prime beef), it was really darn nice and juicy!!\n\nThe tofu stew was spicy with the right kick for taste bud..\n\nThe flying fish roe with rice was delicious and yummy!!!\n\n\nOption: 10:\nName: MiMi Korean BBQ\nAddress: 2 Peck Seah St, #01-01 Air View Building, Singapore 079305\nPhone: 9114 9510\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:30\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nTuesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:30\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nWednesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:30\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nThursday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:30\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nFriday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:30\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nSaturday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:30\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nSunday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:30\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.6\nReviews: \n\nA good place to have casual Korean BBQ and dishes.\n\nThe Korean pancake is crispy.\nPork belly cut is nice.\n\nAffordable buffet prices starting at $29.50 for weekday and plus $5 on weekends.\n\nThey don't charge GST which is a plus point.\n\nReservation is recommended as the place is fully booked.\n\nThe toilet is wet and has bad ventilation.\nHope the owner can spruce up the toilets so the overall dining experience can improve...\n\nAmazing and value for money korean buffet at around $32 only! The beef short plate and pork belly was extremely nice. Second time back here. Service was really good too. Buffet comes with free flow of side dishes, free flow of steam eggs and also a top up for the cheese option for just $5! Hope prices and standard remains the same! Love this place\n\nHad the buffet for dinner and it was super good! Meats are all thick cuts and super juicy. Marinaded well and not too salty. Staff was very attentive and fast, always helping to change the grill top. Great space and very good ventilation! We look forward to visiting again and trying other food!\n\nWas looking for a Korean barbecue place in Tanjong Pagar and narrowed down on this option out of many others.\n\nArrived at around 8:30PM on a weekday, only 4-5 tables occupied.\n\nStaff is friendly and warm. We decided to go a-la-Carte and ordered spicy chicken, soya chicken and pork belly for our barbecue. We also ordered a kimchi pancake.\n\nSide dishes include radish, kimchi, garlic, coleslaw, chilli, tofu etc. Kimchi was pretty good.\n\nAll items are fresh. Staff helped us in barbecuing the items well. We really liked the spicy chicken, the sauce added a great taste. Meat was soft.\n\nGood place for Korean barbecue cravings.\n\nThis is the place if you are a meat person. We went for the buffet which was value for money. Add $5 per pax for weekends and public holiday. Service was attentive and the lady bosses were friendly too. The buffet offers 7 types of meat. We don\u2019t enjoy the Bulgogi. Go for the beef short plate, pork belly and soya chicken galbi instead. We had 3 rounds and were full. After payment, do help yourselves to complimentary Yakult alike probiotic drinks.\n",

Lobster soup is rich in taste but the serving of the lobster is under expectation. In fact most of the dishes portion is relatively small for that price range.\n\nService experience is also under expectation. We sat at a place with a blind spot and the service staff are not attentive to our request. I have to walk to the counter for help. Suggest to provide some electronic buzzing system if the restaurant has under staff to serve the customer.\n\nCame across this place via Google search.\nSuppose to come here for DimSum. But only available in the afternoon.\nBut we still decided to stay for dinner.\n\nFood is not bad, very well presented. Taste is pretty ok especially the chicken and the laksa prawn.\n\nBut when comes to the service by the restaurant staff, I gotta give them a lower rating. It certainly under expectations.\n\nFirstly, they are not welcoming at all when we were at the counter waiting to be seated.\n\nSecondly, the waiter is not attentive. They have no smile at all (which is important in service line).\nWhen we request for tea or request him to add hot water, he just came and grab the teapot and go off with super monotonous attitude. When we say thank you, the staff don't even response at all (basically like a robot).\n\nTherefore, I don't think we will come back again. The food is ok but definitely not the best compare to the same level restaurant elsewhere. Also the service staff and their attitude didn't impress us despite the restaurant is not busy at all (only 3 tables including our table).\n\nCame for lunch, excellent staff service and quality food. Recommend to come \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\n\nThe food and atmosphere was good but one of the staff had a really bad attitude and kept showing us black face. One other staff was very friendly so I'll rate it as 4 stars. Maybe the first staff had a bad day \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nCosy environment. Great for family gartherings. Dimsum.

Definitely a good one. Not a spice-tolerant person but the fish and soup were really delicious before the rest of the spice mixed in. Then it was too spicy for me. But the food was really good. The drink portion was really big too for a single person. Atmosphere was good too, but my one complaint is that some of the staff members were behind our table talking loudly and laughing, I think while on their break. It felt a bit intruding for my family dinner but it's a small issue as it was only for a short while.\n\nThis place is a great option for enjoying fried fish in town. The initial taste is fantastic, but it can become a bit salty over time.\n\nThe prices are on the higher side too.\n\nIf you're planning to dine with a group of 8 people, be aware that this outlet doesn't have a dedicated large table. They usually merge two smaller tables, which might still feel quite cramped for a party of that size.\n\nLove the location. The fish we ordered is limbo fish with soy sauce based. The sauce however is too thin for our liking. The cucumber cold fish is good.\n\nService wise, is good. Friendly staffs. Their drinks are unique.\nMaybe will come back again to try out their signature flavoured fish. Nice renovation decor.\n\nFood is nice n not too spicy. Service is great, responsive n patient, drinks were served immediate at request for me n my thirsty peers! Nice touch to have tissue pack given at each table too. A good place to chat and dine! We had a great time!\n\nWe dropped by Tanyu@Bugis Junction to celebrate a birthday: our very first visit (even though we are not totally  fish fans).\nSeating and interior decor was comfy and functional. Some guests in the packed house were in highly celebratory mood, some rather loquacious and loud. Generally, the ambience was youthful and energetic.\nIn particular, the attending staff were exemplary in service and interfacing with us: offering helpful and tactful suggestions and ideas (patiently without being presumptuous or pushy) on menu items, side-dishes, satay-style grilled meats, fish options, types of sauces and flavours, accompanying ingredients, preferred spiciness levels etc\nWe ordered the Sauerkraut Grilled Limbo-fish (a specie of the catfish family), instead of the Seabass or Qingjiang fish (also a cat-fish); together with some side-dishes.\nThe grilled fish was thoroughly enjoyable: it was rather juicy, tender and delicious (and, of course, totally fresh), although some parts tasted \"fishy\" and had a few very fine fish bones as well. Caution recommended .\nThe Jumbo Lemon and Lime (Tower) was memorable for us, as it was truly a big jar, able to quench our thirst adequately!\nIf you like to eat fish, then obviously, you'd likely enjoy an outing to Tanyu!\n\n\nOption: 3:\nName: Crystal Jade La Mian Xiao Long Bao\nAddress: 200 Victoria St, B1 04A, Singapore 188021\nPhone: 8333 8978\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 3.6\nReviews: \n\nWe book an appointment for 4 adults and 1 child.  When we arrived, we have informed the staff about our reservation, the waitress didn't  brother to listen properly and showed us the way to the normal rectangular table for 4 adults, as the space is rather small, she told us to put the baby pram  outside the restaurant(we have no idea where to put because the entrance is rather small), at this point of time, we have only 3 adults + 1 child, and waiting for the last person to arrive.\n\nShortly after, when we are still deciding what to eat, the waitress came over to rush us to place order. One of the order, we selected 4x soups that served individually for 1pax, She comment that our 2year old child cannot finish the soup. I told her we have 4 adults, and like to order on behalf of him.\n\nAt the same time, we realised that she only gave us 3 sets of cutleries +1set for our kid. While waiting for our order, I was browsing the promotion offer from the acrylic stand on the table, the waitress wearing a blazer passed by told me that the promotion has expired, not sure why it was still displaying on the table though. The way she speak is as if we can't afford to pay for the food. Some of us are wearing work uniform, and the rest is t-shirt and shorts, I'm not sure if this part of discrimination against consumer or not. We've also requested for a baby chair, and she pointed that the chair is over there, we have to take ourselves.\n\nAt 7.40pm, she called my sister who is the one who make the booking earlier today, she pick up the call and found out that they reserved round table for us and we were at the wrong table.\n\nFurious of the poor attitude, my sister scolded the person over the phone(which turns out to be the same woman wearing the blazer) and we even made sacarstic remarks such as asking them if they think we cannot afford to dine in there?\n\nAfter all the commotion, we agreed to switch to the round table, and the baby chair was automatically placed at the round table. Eventhough they did apologize, my sister has repeatedly mentioned that we made a reservation, but not too sure why this kind of mistake are made. This is a well known and established restaurant, this kind of mistake shouldn't be happening.\n\nAfter all food is served, my niece doesn't like the fried rice, so we order a warm soya bean milk for her. The waiting time is long, we also request for a straw, and we have to ask several times.\n\nAlmost every week, I have the habit of visiting restaurant for a treat to myself or gathering during my off day.\n\nThis is my first time encountering this kind of rude attitude and it is happening in morden day in Singapore.\n\nTo be honest, all these action were uncalled and it ruined the atmosphere of the gathering with my niece.  It is really a horrible experience, this is our first but definitely our last time at the bugis branch.\n\nCame for the Xiao long bao buffet. The staff inside were ok, only the service manager was really really sweet. You have to finish the noodles before you can put in the order for the Xiao long bao. The best part of everything was the cucumber dish.

It's nice for the crispy texture but a little on the salty side.\n\nThe rice in the hotpot is very tasty. I like the texture of the rice, which is like Claypot rice. The peanut is crispy and nice.\n\nThe appetiser is a cold dish that is crunchy and quite tasty.

For some reason the 1st was maybe an outlier that day? Also good was the green beans, vegetable dumplings and hot & sour soup. I\u2019ve changed my previous rating from a 3 to a 4 star. However, I would skip the crab dumpling which lacked flavor.\n\nOlder Review:\nI was disappointed with this place. I've had many soup dumplings before and was looking forward to this Michelin Star reputation. So when I bit into these dumplings only to taste mildly flavored soup, I thought \"what was the point\"? By itself, it doesn't stand out. With the black vinegar and ginger sauce provided it loses out its flavors. The same could be said for the Fish Maw soup. It is so mild that you wonder why such a long title was used? You can't taste the ham, dried scallop, winter melon or really anything else in this soup. The only thing that wasn't disappointing was the chili dumplings. Overall, an average meal with above average prices.\n\n\nOption: 4:\nName: Honguo (Bugis Junction)\nAddress: 200 Victoria Street #B1-06 Bugis Junction, 188021\nPhone: 6884 4717\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 3.8\nReviews: \n\nThis noodle restaurant, a longstanding presence in Bugis Junction, signifies its enduring commitment to quality. The \"cross bridge mi xian\" stands out, offering a delightful mix of ingredients. What sets it apart is the choice: you can either assemble the components in the hot soup yourself or have the kitchen take care of it. This interactive element enhances the overall dining experience, making it a notable option for those exploring the diverse culinary scene at Bugis Junction.\n\nCame here for a sat lunch and the shop was less than half full. Ordered the signature hong guo which can either come  all in one bowl or with the ingredients individually plated. Honestly, it doesnt really make any difference cos u will need to dump everything in. But if u are here for the social media post, go ahead to order it seperately.\n\nTaste wise, the soup was quite salty for me which is probably becos of the shrimp paste (?). I actually prefered the fried rice more which had the wok hey. The cutlet was ok too.\n\nIt will be a nice place for a casual lunch and i honestly may come back again.\n\n\"I have been dining here since 2008 and it has remained one of my favorite places to eat. The Vermicelli Noodles are consistently outstanding, boasting an amazingly soft texture. The ribs were also quite tasty. In the past, they used to accommodate extra noodle requests, but unfortunately, that service is no longer available. However, I'm delighted to see that they have expanded their menu with the addition of many other delectable dishes.\"\n\nI have the 9 dish cross bridge vermicelli set . It\u2019s a very big bowl of soup, the ingredients are in very small plates.\nThe soup is so much that can\u2019t finished.\nOverall a good experience and the staff are very friendly.\n\nLove their cross bridge vermicelli. The price is very reasonable. And I usually just order their vermicelli but not other dishes. So I can\u2019t say much about the taste. But if you like vermicelli, you should not miss Hongguo! I think the restaurant has been here for more than a decade! I remember I first visited it many many years ago\u2026\n\n\nOption: 5:\nName: Yang Guo Fu Mala Tang\u6768\u56fd\u798f\u9ebb\u8fa3\u70eb\nAddress: 201 Victoria St, #01-16 Bugis+, Singapore 188026\nPhone: None\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.2\nReviews: \n\nThe quality of ingredients is high. The beef broth mala soup is quite tasty and the medium spice is not overly spicy. Be sure to ask for extra soup. The dry mala is terrible and flavorless.\n\nPlenty of meats and vegetables selections.\nBeef meat is thin slices but a little over cooked. No other marination.\nThe dory fish slice is big but it has a little fishy taste.\nVegetables and mushrooms are good.\nThe best is all of them are fresh. However, their kitchen will not cut the items into smaller pieces. Some of them can be difficult to chew.\nThe soup booth is good, drinkable but gets thirsty afterwards.\nThe store is bright and air-conditioned.\n\nLocated just infront of Bugis+. This is one of place for you who looking to eat spicy mala. Price by weight regardless meat or vegetable. Recommend not to take so many, as the price could be expensive. Option tomato soup available for those who dont eat spicy. Normal service by staff. Self service Sauce available at sauce corner. Paynow accepted. Disposable apron also available if you are required. Food was not bad. Sometimes could be long queue during peak hour.\n\nTried the bone mala broth. The food quality is good and the soup is very thick and full of flavor. It is not susprising that they are the biggest chain in the world. To me, it is on par with Zhang Liang, which is another famous chain.\n\nSpecial mention: the meat balls are very good and juicy!\n\n$15 for a 400g+ of food. Meat and veg are all the same price.\n\nNo service charge \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb. Pick your own food, go to the counter and do your payment, collect your food at the counter.\n\nOrdered a big mala and a medium mala, taste pretty much the same. Only that one has slightly more oil.\n\nTasty mala soup which I would rate a 7/10. Food however isn\u2019t the best quality. Luncheon meat taste disgusting. Other process food is tasteless.

A bit noisy and slightly unconformable furnishing, but that's pretty much part of the charm. Tried Signature Noodles and Barley Drink, both a good starting point\n\nQQ Noodle House is a decent spot for a quick and affordable meal in the area. The standout feature of this place is their springy and tasty noodles, which come with a range of sauce and noodle options to choose from. However, the portion size is quite small, which might not be enough for some customers.\n\nUnfortunately, the quality of the food has dropped compared to previous years. I tried the dry noodle recently, and it was disappointingly dry, with too little sauce to coat all the layers of noodles. The crispy wanton was still decent, though.\n\nAside from the noodles, they also have side dishes available. However, the dining experience is let down by the dirty and greasy tables, and the utensil tray that was not clean. The restaurant itself is a bit run down, with peeling table tops (as seen in the provided photo).\n\nDuring my visit, I was also given a corner table that was placed too closely together with another table, making it hard to exit. Luckily, I was skinny enough to squeeze through the gaps, but others may find it uncomfortable.\n\nOverall a good option for those looking for a quick and affordable comfort meal, but the drop in food quality and unclean dining environment can be a bit of a letdown.\n\nFood was easy to order via the clear QR code on the table or via the menu. The package sets made it fuss free especially for people who are spoilt with choices. I ordered the Kolo mee, the portion was not a lot for a guy but the chosen side crabmeat soup made up for it.\nSome of the service staff seem to have quite a strong accent that the mandarin might be difficult for some Singaporeans to understand.\nStore set up was neat, tidy, and clean. Gave a simple and minimalist feel of dropping by for a non-extended meal, consume it, and leave.\n\nwanton mee noodle texture is not as q as I've expected, glass noodle has wok smell and tasty but expensive($8), bkt has strong herb taste but the meat is very tough.\n\nHad my dinner here during a Saturday evening. As a Sarawakian, I don't feel the signature noodles is authentic enough. The look is similar but the taste is not up to level. The ingredients inside the dish is also modified to adapt to local Singaporean style I guess. Anyway, worth a try if you really crave for kampua, not much choice in Singapore at this moment.\n\nOverall I think the food still consider nice there as there is quite some crowd in the shop during meal hour.\n\n\nOption: 7:\nName: Fat Bird Chicken Hotpot \u80d6\u80d6\u9e21 \uff08\u9e21\u516c\u7172\uff09\nAddress: 1 Liang Seah St, #01-15/16, Singapore 189022\nPhone: 6337 0612\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:00\u202fAM\nSaturday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:00\u202fAM\nSunday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.2\nReviews: \n\nYa agree with Justin Chong, the chicken pot is j okay, we ordered the mala one, it tastes wuite like mala but tbh its a little too jelat after awhile\n\nTo be fair we did a takeaway so maybe its not so great?

Total was $21.\n\nI did not enjoy the pork belly with garlic unfortunately. The sauce was quite different from what I\u2019m used to tasting- it was watery, and tasted too garlicky without being garlicky (in the right way). I had way tastier renditions of this dish, and I found the portion quite stingy.\n\nThe pork trotter rice was nicer in comparison. It was filling and I liked the various cuts of pork layered on top of the rice.\n\nThe service was good, although I do recommend the shop change the layouts of the tables as two tables located at the front of the shopfront is directly underneath the air curtain. I run warm so I like air con, but even then, it was a bit too much wind blowing down on me and made me feel uncomfortable.\n\n\nOption: 8:\nName: Wing Seong Fatty's Restaurant\nAddress: 175 Bencoolen St, Singapore 189649\nPhone: 6338 1087\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: Closed\nTuesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.4\nReviews: \n\nFirst time here and came without making a reservation on a Saturday evening about  8pm.  The restaurant was full but fortunately we waited for only around 10 minutes.   Was quote sceptical because I saw many foreigners and thought this could be tourist trap.  I was wrong,  the claypot pig liver is super delicious and the braise fish head is so flavourful.  This is indeed a very good Cantonese restaurant.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for Chinese restaurant with amazing food and friendly service, look no further than this hidden gem. I recently had the pleasure of dining at this spot and was blown away by the quality of their dishes.\nThe beef meat teow with wok hey was outstanding. Beef was so tender and portion size was generous, even for the smallest option on the menu.\nNext up was the roasted duck, which was an absolute standout. The skin was perfectly crispy and meat was tender and flavorful.\nFinally, I have to mention the cereal prawn ball, no hassle at all in removing the shell and  flavorful prawns.\nRestaurant was the friendly and welcoming atmosphere.\nIf you\u2019re in the mood for some truly Chinese cuisine, look no further than this spot.\n\nCame here because of the online reviews and  partly we were nearby. The foods are hit and miss. Can order the fried beef kway teow, vegetable and home-made tofu. Will not recommend the Indonesia curry chicken and the roast duck, roast pork and char siew combo.\n\nFood is served quick and they are delicious! Place can be loud sometimes due to the occasional loud talking and laughing by other customers but I would definitely recommend coming here for the food.\n\nWhilst visiting Singapore, my friend took me to lunch at his favourite cantonese restaurant. I can understand why - friendly, warm service and absolutely delicious food served with a smile. The fried rice, sweet and sour pork and special tofu were particularly  notable - all of the plates went back to the kitchen absolutely clean\n\n\nOption: 9:\nName: Chong Qing Grilled Fish Bugis\nAddress: 1 Liang Seah St, #01-05/06, Singapore 189022\nPhone: 6333 9148\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20091:00\u202fAM\nTuesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20091:00\u202fAM\nWednesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20091:00\u202fAM\nThursday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20091:00\u202fAM\nFriday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:00\u202fAM\nSaturday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:00\u202fAM\nSunday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20091:00\u202fAM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.2\nReviews: \n\nFirst time trying Chong Qing and it didn\u2019t disappoint.

Enquired the waiter and he said it was oxidised. The look of it make our appetite die down. We also ordered their paradise iced fruit tea and it tasted very bland, 0% sweetness so we requested for sugar syrup. To our disappointment, they said they do not have sugar syrup. Also disappointed by the service, it was hard to ask for the waiter to refill the soup / serve us the food as there was only 2 staffs serving the upper floor.\n\nTrying out the grilled fish that I heard so much and see publicity.

We went for the 3-course set lunch and were satisfied with the quality of ingredients used, great cooking, and exceptional service provided by Rimo, Charlene, and team. Recommended dishes: Escargots in garlic butter, Lamb chops, Pear Melba.\n\nWe celebrated a birthday here and were delighted with the extra mile taken with the presentation of the desserts. Thanks to this meal, we\u2019ve found another authentic French steakhouse!\n\nI recently dined at \"Les Bouchons Rive Gauche,\" and it was an exquisite culinary experience. The highlight of the evening was their selection of red wine, which beautifully complemented the succulent steak.\n\nTo start, we savored the pan-seared duck liver, a dish that showcased exceptional freshness and a rich, melt-in-your-mouth texture. It was truly unforgettable.\n\nWe also indulged in a delightful off-menu item, the heated Camembert cheese, which emanated a delightful flavor due to its oven preparation. The combination of the gooey cheese and its subtle yet profound taste was a gastronomic delight.\n\nThe main course featured the Black Angus prime rib, which impressed with its perfectly balanced seasoning that enhanced the natural flavor of the beef. It was a prime example of culinary expertise.\n\nTo conclude this magnificent meal, we had the cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e, a dessert that was both light and zesty, providing the perfect sweet note to end our dining experience.\n\nThe ambiance and service at \"Les Bouchons Rive Gauche\" further added to the overall charm of the restaurant. If you're looking for an exceptional dining experience with an emphasis on quality, this is the place to be. I highly recommend it for anyone seeking an unforgettable culinary journey.\n\nwe did encounter a situation at our table. However, it\u2019s important to note that this issue was not related to how the restaurant was run; it was more of an outside factor. Despite this unexpected situation, the restaurant\u2019s staff handled it promptly and professionally, ensuring that it did not affect the overall dining experience. Their commitment to customer satisfaction and their adeptness in addressing unforeseen challenges further demonstrated the restaurant\u2019s dedication to providing a top-notch dining experience.\n\nBest steak we had as a family! Super value for money. So tender and juicy. Super good appetisers. Fantastic service!\n\nGood food, good service and good vibe. The lamb chop was nicely cooked and reminded us of what we had in France. Waitress was of good service. She made sure we were well taken care of.\n\nI had my birthday lunch here and the food was tres d\u00e9licieux! Special mention for the pan seared foie gras and the ribeye steak. Such depth of flavour at a great value, do check out their lunch set promo if you're coming by in the day.\n\nBig thank you to Rimo, Charlene and Jan for the impeccable service and attention to detail :)\n\n\nOption: 2:\nName: Restaurant JAG\nAddress: 41 Robertson Quay, #02-02 STPI Creative Workshop and Gallery, Singapore 238236\nPhone: 6871 8973\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: Closed\nTuesday: 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSunday: Closed\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.8\nReviews: \n\nExcellent services with quality food and fantastic atmosphere. The restaurant only has limited table, definitely need reservations to come here. The place focuses more on a wide range of quality vegetables across the world. Very unique presentation of the dishes! My partner was having the vegetarian option and it was as good as the non vegetarian options. The chef even packed us his hometown cake to bring home for tasting.\nA little high on the cost, but worth the experience!\n\nOne of the most breathtaking food experience I had the chance to enjoy.\n\nAmazing culinary journey. The contemporary symphony of aromas and textures through a vegetarian focus was fresh, exciting and new. Every dish is meticulously crafted to bring a delightful balance of flavors. The wine pairing was on point. Compliments job to the chef.\n\nExcellent service. Attentiveness and professionalism exceeded our expectations.\n\nThe atmosphere was warm, friendly and cosy. We felt welcomed and in optimal conditions to savor our dinner.\n\nWe recommend this restaurant to anyone passionate about food.\n\nBeautiful vegetarian cuisine, beautiful ambience, beautiful service and staff. Just take that leap for tastebud and exquisite ingredients discovery. Presentation of the food, attention to your dining experience made it such a pleasant experience. Do come by each season for different culinary exposure.\n\nChef Jeremy and the team did a fantastic job championing seasonal vegetables. The wine paring was beautifully done for each course to highlight the taste of the food with a great balance.\n\nThe ambience of the restaurant was intimate and lovely but the light was slightly dark. It was a birthday celebration and we had a great time throughout the night.\n\nThe menu was exceptional, a great variation of vegetables and herbs tastefully balanced and beautifully presented. The choice of courses was perfectly matched. The staff was very attentive and friendly. The chef introduced himself to all the guests and was very accommodating. We really enjoyed our dinner at JAG, a highlight in Singapore.\n",

The hummus texture was just right - not an amorphous baby food mush, not too chunky, and very tasty. Lamb kofta was on the salty side for me, but tasty nonetheless and of a good meaty texture. Thoroughly enjoyed both versions of chili blend - the green one and the red one. Warning for regular people: the red one is very spicy. Pita bread was on the flat side, a bit taco-like.\nThe owner is friendly and approachable.\nWill definitely be back!\n\n\nOption: 2:\nName: Pistachio Middle Eastern & Mediterranean Grill\nAddress: 501 Orchard Rd, #02-04/05 Wheelock Place, Singapore 238880\nPhone: 6262 6400\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.4\nReviews: \n\nI came to Singapore few weeks ago and was looking for Mediterranean restaurants. I stumbled upon this gorgeous place 5 minutes away from my hotel. I tried Kebabs on day one and man it was delicious. Atmosphere is great and all servers are friendly, specially three girls Urmi, Wendy and Fina are super nice, they make sure to get you a table quickly, take the order in timely manner and also make valuable suggestions on the menu. They always keep checking if everything is fine and customers are enjoying food. I loved the desert suggestion after eating my dinner. After first day I have been to this place 7-6 times and was always greeted with same service. I highly recommend this restaurant and will go again before I leave Singapore for USA.\n\nWe had the sultan's delight and mussels with garlic cream and cheese toast. The sultan's delight is really enjoyable. We could taste the smokiness from the eggplant puree and the lamb stew is really tender with tomato based sauce. It's tangy and smoky with some crunchiness from the pine nuts. Really enjoyable. But the mussel is pretty standard. It didn't taste really fresh but they're quite generous with the amount. The garlic cheese sauce is ok only.\nService was good and attentive.\n\nExcellent experience with vibrant dining experience. Food has great range of taste to excite the palate. Service is welcoming and top notch, they also gave a complimentary cake.\n\nVisited for my birthday meal with my family as I was craving some Mediterranean food and this place had great reviews. However, the whole experience ended up kinda disappointing - as I had high expectations too on my first visit.\n\nService:\n- It\u2019s a restaurant but I felt like there was not much service per say.\n- It\u2019s a pretty high price point but they don\u2019t serve complimentary water (charged at $3 a pot of hot water, or $11 for Evian water only)\n- Ordering isn\u2019t as fuss free as they try to make it. Online ordering only from mobile app, with just one physical menu at the door. Asked for any extra copies for easier viewing but none available. You also have to pay upfront in mobile order.\n- Feels like I visited a restaurant but received fast food style service.\n\nAtmosphere:\n- Overall atmosphere is okay. Like a typical restaurant\n\nFood:\n- Average, I\u2019ve had much better at other places for a similar price point.\n- Pita bread, spreads and kebab grills were okay.\n- Saffron rice & Briyani rice were disappointing. They use basmati rice which gave a nice texture. However, flavour is so subtle that I could barely taste the difference between the 2.\n\nSummary:\nWould I return? Definitely not! For the price point, the food and service didn\u2019t live up to expectations for a highly rated restaurant. Will continue on my hunt for yummy Mediterranean food!\n\nFirst time at this restaurant, and I can say the dining experience was great.\n\nFood is great and the serving is not bad as well.  I can only say good things about the service of the Staffs.\nThe place is easy to find and the ambience is something to remember.\n\n\nOption: 3:\nName: Blu Kouzina Siglap\nAddress: 907 E Coast Rd, #01-01, Singapore 459107\nPhone: 9710 8303\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.5\nReviews: \n\nVisited for the first time after hearing good reviews from friends. Awesome ambience and child-friendly. Helpful staff who helped us with food orders and wine recommendation. Dips were great, octopus tender and flavourful. Desserts were also delightful. The standout dish was the lamb chops!\n\nHad dinner some time last week and the food was pretty good but it was quite pricey. The waiter asked if we would like sparkling or still water and we thought still meant free tap water, but it turned out to be $10 bottled water. Don\u2019t make the same mistake as we did if you don\u2019t want to splurge on water!\n\nUnfortunately, we found a piece of stainless steel dish sponge in our food which is quite unhygienic and dangerous. The staff were kind enough to take it off our bill but this was a very eventful first experience dining here.\n\nWent to celebrate birthday with a few friends. The food and service were good. Only disappointment is that when we were leaving the place, the wine was actually not finished.  The staff could do better to confirm if we still want it before throwing the bottle away.\n\nI celebrated my birthday at this restaurant today, and it was a fantastic experience. We had been here a few years ago and were still in love with their delicious dips. This time, we ordered two servings of pita, which filled us up completely! We just couldn't resist that warm, fluffy pita bread \ud83e\uded3. After reading some reviews that praised the lamb shank, we took Uncle Bob's recommendation and were not disappointed. The staff was incredibly pleasant, and I want to give a big shoutout to Uncle Bob, Manager Jennifer, and Jay for making our celebration even more special. We'll definitely be coming back! \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf7d\ufe0f\ud83d\ude0a\n\nThe food was fantastic. My favourite dish would be the lamb chops - I've never eaten lamb like this before. It was without the muskiness you typically get from lamb, but it was a clear, smooth lamb flavour.\n\nWe had the dessert platter and I'd say the 'spring roll' is the best. the sweet custard with the thin layer pastry exterior makes it the perfect last bite for the meal.\n\nService was excellent. Special shoutout to Hakim who was very attentive and knowledgeable.\n\nThoroughly enjoyed my experience here!\n\n\nOption: 4:\nName: Alati Divine Greek Cuisine\nAddress: 73 Amoy St, Singapore 069892\nPhone: 6221 6124\nDelivery Available: Information Not Available\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nSunday: Closed\n\nPrice Level: 3 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.4\nReviews: \n\nThe best Greek restaurants we\u2019ve ever been in Singapore.

Authentic Turkish cuisine and we especially love the creamy hummus, chickpea stew and delightful kunefe. Great service as well. Will recommend to visit in a group to try a variety of sides and mains!\n\nEverything is delicious here! Staffs are friendly, the Kunefe is one of the best, and the Karavan kebabs, both beef and lamb, are amazing! \ud83d\ude05 The hot pita bread is also great. In the last 4-5 months, we've visited this place many times, and our friends love it too. Whenever we want to enjoy a meal without worrying about quality and taste, we head straight to this restaurant. \ud83d\ude0b You won't regret giving it a try!\n\nHummus! Good! The lunch set is value for money - comes with a main + drink + soup + bread + dessert all for $20!\nThe pita bread is baked to perfection and the submarine bread looks so amazing! However the price for the submarine bread is a little high. Will probably not order this again the next time.\nThe soup of the day was lentil soup (vegetable soup) its really rich and herby. Very different from what i usually have.\nThe chicken dish is the highlight of the meal. The chicken meat is sooooo soft and tender. The seasoning is on point. Goes really well with the breads. The rice that comes with the dish is really fragrant as well.\nLots of vegetarian options.\nOverall a positive experience and will recommend \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\n\nTotal bill is about $85++\n\nOrdered quite abit for 2 person.  Love the cauliflower salad. Hummus, eggplant dips. As we were celebrating our birthday, the restaurant gave us complimentary tea and a kind of Turkish delight. The staff were attentive and friendly. Will definitely go back for the cauliflower salad and hummus.\n\nThis was my second visit today and my colleagues and I absolutely loved the food! I am usually not a fan of Turkish or Mediterranean food but this place is an exception. After trying the food a few months ago for the first time, I have been wanting to visit them again.\n\nEvery dish was delicious and tasted fresh and   wholesome. The Mezeplate is a good option if you are not sure what to order as it has a bit of everything and you can to try the different dips and appetisers. I enjoyed the hummus, cauliflower salad and eggplant dip very much. Their lentil soup was very good too - comforting and tasty.\n\nFor the mains, we tried two of their lunch set meals -  two rice dishes with the different chicken kebabs which were served with tea, soup and a rice pudding dessert. We also ordered their salmon which was so tender and flavourful. Several colleagues commented that it was the best salmon they had ever tasted!\n\nThe highlight of the meal was their dessert - Kunefe which was absolutely delicious! The taste and texture was so complex and had so much depth! The crispy stringy pastry with the creamy sauce, nuts and ice cream was indeed like what the menu described it to be - \u201ca slice of heaven\u201d!\n\nThis is seriously an underrated restaurant which serves amazing food and I would highly recommend it :)\n\n\nOption: 6:\nName: Alaturka Mediterranean & Turkish Restaurant\nAddress: 15 Bussorah St, Singapore 199436\nPhone: 9434 6026\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.6\nReviews: \n\nI had the pleasure of trying Turkish cuisine for the first time, and it was truly a delightful experience! The standout dish for me was the lamb; it had absolutely no odor and tasted fantastic. The grilled items were a highlight as well, bursting with delicious flavors. The restaurant\u2019s ambiance was beautifully decorated, and the staff was both charming and incredibly helpful, taking the time to explain the dishes to us. While it\u2019s not the cheapest option, the prices are fair for the quality you receive.\n\nOne thing to note, though, is that the platter we ordered was described as \u201cfor two,\u201d but for Asians, it\u2019s considered a generous portion. So, if there are four of you and you\u2019ve already ordered other dishes, I recommend going for the platter for two only; it\u2019s quite substantial. Would recommend to anyone looking for a great dining experience!\n\nFirst time having Turkish food and was really\npleasantly surprised. Their dips and bread was really exceptional. The bread was steaming when it came out it was both crispy and fluffy at the same time. The platter for 2 was also great all the grilled meats was tender and flavourful. Portion was also huge.\n\nVery impressive food & service displayed by the dedicated front staffs and chefs. It\u2019s nice walking in the street after a wine & dine session in the area. The staffs were very attentive, price is reasonable.\n\nVery delicious food with reasonable price.\nMy friend from Turkey said this is the only place with authentic Turkish food. My mom who is super picky about food said their food is good. Their dessert Kunefe is both crispy and creamy.\n\nThe staffs are friendly and knowledgeable. Will visit again.\n\nWent here for a birthday celebration and the attention to detail from their service staff is amazing, didn\u2019t mention to the staff that it was for a birthday celebration, only had a note in the reservation. But they went above and beyond, having candles in the dessert and even giving us props to take pictures with and proceeded to then print out the photo of us to keep!\n\nThe food also matches the service, authentic Turkish cuisine done perfectly, the Hummus was so good we had to order a second portion! I\u2019m not usually a fan of chicken but the chicken that came with the platter blew my mind, so juicy and tender. Then comes dessert, my first time having Kunefe and the only thing I have to say is that I wish I didn\u2019t share it, wanted it all to myself \ud83e\udd23\n\nDefinitely coming back here again!\n\n\nOption: 7:\nName: Le Rida (Mediterranean.

The food worth 2 stars. The meat was pretty hard, the starter was too sour. The dessert was really not able to match our taste. The house wines was tasteless, but the red wine taste better when it pair with the meat. I will strongly recommend you only order the red if you want to have their one for one house wine promo.\nOur bill was $128, you can get a much more better grilled meat platter and better food at other restaurants. :)\n\nLe Rida has a rustic ambience somewhat akin to an old time eating house in a small town. Quaint and homely\nFreshly baked pita bread with lemon chick pea hummus was delicious and filling\nMains of Lebanese lamb kafta kebab had the right balance of flavour and crunchiness.\nWash it all down with 1 for 1 Heineken draft at $17.90\n\nManager Sanjiv was both friendly and helpful in his recommendations and unlike in some establishments, he did not push you to over order.\nDefinitely worth a return visit!\n\nDidn't think the food was thaaaat amazing. Nor was the service. But at least they let us drink outside drinks.\nHOWEVER, i requested for no garnishing on my hummus. When the guy brought it over, there WAS parsley on it. And all he said was \"just pluck it out\". --.--\nSo if i was allergic to that, i should just pluck it out.... nice. The hummus wasn't good either. I've tasted better. Like a friend who went with me commented... it isn't creamy enough. Also, comments about the baklava was that it was too hard... and wasn't good.\n\nAbsolutely loved the food, I am heavily into Mediterranean food. I have tried most of the places around Bugis as well. The food here was so fresh, with perfect taste and presentation. It was completely worth it travelling from East.\nThe service was quick, the portion size was generous . We ordered mezze plateer and tabalu salad. They were scrumptious loved the customised heart shaped Pita bread. Hummus, was so creamy and so were all other dips.\n\nWould strongly recommend.. It has become one of my favourite place..\n\nEnjoyed a lovely evening with family and doggie. Food is nice and the 1 for 1 drinks promo is good too.\nLoved the dips platter and mixed grill with different meats\nThe pita bread is nice and soft and goes well with the hummus.\nGreat thing is that we can have our dog to eat with us....ha,ha, perhaps more like watch us eat. \ud83d\ude06\nStaff is friendly and helpful.

Only comment is the sauce..only tasted most of it towards the end, not evenly distributed but the chicken had a generous chunky serving. Overall, it was delicious and fresh plus it was nicely sealed that there's no veggie peeping on the paper or any sign of a soggy end of the wrap once I got home. Well done and hope more will get to try it too :)\n\nI love the crispy fluffy falafel and chicken shish wrap here. Selvam was awesome at customizing the wraps and making good chat. Super nice and quick dinner!\n\nGood muslim food available. The person who serve Mr. Hanif\n\nFood taste is secondary, the senior guy at shop is super frustrated and mean with possibly new colleague. Almost as if he will start throwing away things, shouting and all infront of customers.\n\nAnd obv in this environment the new guy served us wrong order, and seems bit untrained and unaware of what he\u2019s making.\n\nOverall, never visiting again because of atmosphere and food both.\n\nI recently enjoyed a hummus pita and falafel wrap at Pita Tree, and it was a taste sensation! The hummus was rich and velvety, spreading its creamy goodness over warm pita bread that was the perfect blend of soft and slightly crispy. The falafel in the wrap was a crispy, flavorful delight  a delightful contrast to the smooth hummus. The combination of these two in a single bite was heavenly. Pita Tree truly excels at crafting Mediterranean classics with fresh, quality ingredients. This dish left me craving for more, and I can't wait to return for another flavorful experience. A must-visit for hummus and falafel lovers!

My last visit was quite awhile back. The food, ambience, and service here are very good! Parking is free! Place tends to get crowded and there\u2019s sometimes a queue, so it\u2019s wise to make a reservation before heading down. Had the dips and bread, octopus, sea bass, spinach pastries, and finally, baklava for dessert! Everything was great! Octopus was nice and tasty + tender, sea bass was fresh, all the pastries were warm and the Greek coffee we had to end the meal was pretty good too! Will be back here again to try more food! Hopefully sooner than later! Highly recommended for authentic Greek Mediterranean food! Fantastic experience every visit!\n\nA lovely place for those looking for non pork meals. They don\u2019t qualify as a halal place  as they serve alcohol. But good for Muslim friends. It was my first time here and it\u2019s been a while since I had Greek food. I love the dips option from spicy to mild tasting dips. The fried calamari was great too followed by the medium rare lamb which was tender. Ensure you make a reservation to avoid disappointment. Good place to bring friends.\n\nAlways crowded on weekends such that even booking a table on same day is sometimes not possible.\nI really enjoyed the medium meat platter. grilling was on point  meat was juicy and not dry.\nmoussaka went down way too easily. Greek dip platter was on point flavour wise and the taramasalata was flavourful without tasting too fishy.\nsadly the pita bread is pretty small portioned, I'm not sure how you're expected to finish the dip given with the portions served\nGrilled octopus was also delicious.\n\nService was friendly and efficient.\nDecor isn't very Greek but honestly ambience is great (albeit a bit noisy)\n\nIt's harder to get a table here than the at its closest competitor, and for  good reason.\n\nGood food. Although the beef can be on the dry side, everything else was delicious.\n\nHighly recommend the grilled octopus. It is not chewy at all. For those who don\u2019t like squid or octopus, try to have a bite.\n\nRestaurant is packed on a Friday night and the food arrives pretty quick. Staff are quite alright. Some could use a little refining in politeness.\n\nThere\u2019s complimentary licorice candy. Absolutely love it.\n\nWill visit this place again. But recommend to come here in a bigger group to order a larger variety of dishes.\n\nFirst visit. Reservation was smooth via seven rooms. We chose an outdoor table as the weather was pleasant. The food was delicious. We had the whole oven chicken and chicken yiro wrap with fries. Pesto pasta was good as well. Desserts were amazing too.

Ordered pitta and baba ganush. It tasted good but whether it was made fresh that morning I can\u2019t be sure cause it looked like they were taking precooked pitta out that had been in the fridge although there were fresh dough balls on the counter.\n\nThe best Hummus and Falafel I have tasted thus far!\nThe Hummus is creamy and smooth with generous amount of Tahini and nice Olive oil while the Falafel is filled with Herbs at the right point.\nEven though I had it take-away for supper, the food was still delicious.\nI had Pita and Olive since 100AM days (more than 10years ago) and the Hummus never fails!\nAlthough there was once when I did a take-away during lock-down, the Shawarma was a little over-cooked which the hit and miss is common with the manpower shortage seen at f&b.\nBut happy to have the nicely done Shawarma back again this time!\nThe price is reasonable with the quality provided compared to restaurant prices, not forgetting that the current rental must be way more exp than 100AM days although it is only a kiosk space.\nA satisfied and happy customer\ud83d\ude0b\n\nThe Falafel with Hummus and Pita set was $16, although I agree with many users here suggesting that the portion is small, I do think that with the quality of the food, it might not be sustainable to up the portion without a significant price increase.\n\nThe falafel were nicely warmed, soft and flaky, great if you're having a scratchy throat and avoiding the deep fried variety. It was nicely seasoned and the warming spices hit just the right spot. I love the olive-tomato-salad thing and wish the portion was bigger but I guess with rising food costs, I find the portion reasonable.\n\nThe hummus was really smooth and lemon notes really help to cut through the spices from the falafel. Pita bread had a nice yeasty aroma and was soft and easy to stuff.\n\nMy only complaint was that it was really hard to cut and portion the pita bread with plastic cutleries and plates. It kept running about. The place is also quite squeezy and warm.\n\nI'm a big fan of the Pita Pockets as the ingredients are always tasty and plentiful. I'll often take a tub of fresh Hommous home as well. If you are in the Great World area call in and try this great family business.\n\nWe were greeted by a Shalom!!!\n\nThe recommendations were awesome.\nThe beef was flavourful and delish. The bread was warm and safe and went well with the hummus.\n\nI would definitely come again.\n\nP.S forgot to take pictures at the beginning.\n",

Long Phung offers a spread of delicious Vietnamese dishes at prices that won't break the bank.\n\nEvery dish is packed full of flavour. You'll be left craving for more. And as you're dining, let your cup of Vietnamese coffee slowly drip, and you can enjoy the robust beverage as a perfect finisher to your meal.\n\nSeating space is adequate, but do arrive early if you're looking to dine as the spaces fill up quite fast, especially on weekends.\n\nWe were out in the east and decided to try this place because there were a lot of good reviews. Seems like a pretty traditional Vietnamese menu. Food was good and you can tell it wasn\u2019t seasoned for foreigners\u2026it had very sublet but well balanced flavors. We loved all the sauces and the balance of crunch & soft textures. Our favorite was the fried spring rolls the flaky crust was so good it was addictive. The smoothies left a lot to be desired, they seem to be very skimpy on the fruit. Otherwise I love it that the food is also very light so you don\u2019t feel so stuffed at the end. We didn\u2019t get any noodle soup, maybe next time, but most people seem to have some sort of soup. We would definitely go back. The downside is the location (if you aren\u2019t close) but the price, value and quality are all top notch.\n\nMost of their dishes come with sweet sauce which  I like. Beef was okie, not very tender but their spring roll was good. Their crepe was special, inside got prawn and pork belly. I think they add coconut to the crepe\n\nPaid 23.22 for the meal. Food was decent, served very quickly.\n\nAll seems fresh. My spring rolls may have been sitting a while as all 4 pieces were stocked together. Tough texture for the skin. Ingredients were fine.\n\nOverall more of a good vibe. Maybe skip the ones I have ordered and get a pho or fish. Didn't satisfy my cravings.\n\nAuthentic Vietnamese food. Speedy service. Love the jellyfish salad, grilled squid, and beef stew. Banh Mi bread is exactly the same as those found in Vietnam. Returned twice in less than a week.

We would recommend their chicken wings and grilled pork rice. Service is also quite pleasing.\n\nA fellow foodie introduced me to this Vietnamese restaurant. We tried two type of beef noodle. The classic  beef noodle soup was good in that the broth was tasty. The other special beef noodle was more interesting in that the broth resembled that of Singapore prawn noodle.\nOur favorite dish was the pancake where the meat and crepe is wrapped with lettuce and dipped in a sauce. Somehow the combination turned out to be nice.\nWe also ordered fried chicken wings, spring roll (fresh and fried skin) and chendol.\nOn the whole, the food is authentic and good. Service was also very good.\n\nAnother family favourite joint as we live nearby. Food is always consistently good \ud83d\udc4d.\n\nThe banh mi is actually a \"new\" edition to the menu and the one to try is the Traditional. Plain baguette goes v well with chicken curry which is super yummy!\n\nThe Banh Cuon (Vietnamese version of chee chiong fun) although pricey (in SG) is worth ordering bcoz you won't be able to find it anywhere else. Freshly done, it is chockfulof crunchy bean sprouts, Thai basil and complemented with slices of Vietnamese ham.\n\nThe beef and chicken soup noodles are also to-die-for...try and you won't regret it. Same with the grilled pork chip rice!\n\nVery nice little Vietnamese restaurant. Has a huge menu. We ordered 6 different dishes. All came relatively fast and super fresh. All the staff are Vietnamese and the place had a very authentic vibe.\n\nNice Vietnamese restaurant tucked between old shop houses. The staff were friendly and helped us with our food and ordering. The seafood noodle came with 2 huge prawns. Very flavorful soup. The duck salad was well marinated \u2026. Leaves you wonder how they make their sauces taste so good.

Grilled pork and chicken meats were fragrant and tender...and very flavourful. Service staff are friendly and doing their best despite the manpower shortage. Expect mid-scale cafe price, but the excellent taste of the food is worth it. Portion size is decent too.\n\nWe came on a Saturday afternoon. Love the atmosphere and ambience. A good place to chit chat. Ordered the beef sticks, chicken pho soup, dried pork vemicelli and prawn spring rolls. Can say their vietnamese food is good. Will come again.\n\nFood portion is big for the grill pork noodles that I ordered. The Beef stew is tasty and goes well with the baguette but if less salty will be even better. Staff is very polite\n\nWe ordered the beef banh mi , crab-pork brain soup and Vietnamese spring roll. We particularly liked the spring roll and the coffee. The soup was a little too thick for our liking but the brain had a clean taste. Overall a nice place a quick Vietnamese meal and coffee.\n\nCosy and clean. Very friendly service crew. Ordered spicy hue noodle soup, dried grilled pork noodle & beef wrapped in betel leaves. The food tasted pretty good !

Was surprised to find that they are fully vegetarian. Still didn't disappkint tho. Even my meat loving husband enjoyed his vegan meat burger here.\n\nOrdered their standard chicken bahnmi which was great! The bread was nicely toasted, crunchy yet still soft and nicely balanced with the vegetables.\n\nTheir spring rolls are also really good!!\n\nDefinitely recommend this place.\n\natmosphere was rather quiet when we were there which is nice weekends tend to be slightly busier.\n\nFood is really good though, both the beef and pork options are well marinated. we got the bun cha (well sorta bun cha) which came with spring rolls. the rolls appear to be yam based they were crispy and well done.\n\nserving portions were of good size and would certainly come back again to try other options.\n\nBeen loving their food since before they changed to become a vegetarian restaurant, the quality has stayed the same since their switch. Bread is still so fresh and has a great crunch while being chewy, perfect banh mi bread.\n\nRating the food purely based on the mushroom and tofu vegetarian pho. It's really average and not the most bang for buck at $12 (+$2 for egg) but I went for it as I was craving something soupy. Nevertheless, I'd still be back to have my fill of vegetables and to try other stuff!\n\nAmbience wise, this place is on its way to becoming thich nhat hanh's monastery food hall. The Buddhist mantra playing in the background creates an air of reverence; evoking a sense of decorum. I'd imagine that any noise made in this eatery feels disrespectful.\n\nIt'd be nice if the space was kept secular and casual so people can just have a hearty meal with friends. Cheers!\n\nSandwich Saigon used to serve meat but has recently become fully vegetarian in Feb 2023! Almost everything can be made allium-free, as alliums are usually only added at the end of the dish preparation. Apart from the cheese sandwich, all dishes are vegan by default unless you add-on eggs or cheese. There are more whole-food dishes featuring mushroom and tofu, as well as plant-based alternatives such as 'chicken', 'luncheon meat', 'tuna', etc. Some drinks contain dairy and/or honey, but they also have an oat milk option.\n\nDo note that there is Buddhist chanting/music playing softly in the background at the shop. Apart from this shop at East Coast Road, they also have a cloud kitchen concept at Bistro Bytes within i12k Katong shopping mall a few minutes' walk away.\n\n\nOption: 10:\nName: Hong Win Cafe and Restaurant Pte Ltd\nAddress: 157 Joo Chiat Rd, Singapore 427435\nPhone: 6345 5187\nDelivery Available: Information Not Available\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 3.5\nReviews: \n\nBelow average vietnamese dishes in Singapore.

One of the more popular restaurant along the pathway. Staff are friendly and helpful. Lovely place to be to watch people walk by while enjoying dinner. Parking is limited in the area though.\n\nFood is really great. Had a very nice dinner with family. The street sets the mood for good food.  Food felt authentic and very tasty. We had chicken Mandi, mixed grill and \"pizza\".\n\nPlace also has some good baklava.\n\nParking lot picture below.\n\nWhile initially heading for a different restaurant, at which we were repelled by the pushy staff / promoters, we headed down Arab Street to look for an alternative. Most of the other restaurants also had promoters out which tried to lure us in. The guys at Tabbouleh just let us check the menu first and then we asked for a table. Service generally was ok, we waited a bit to actually order, food did not take a very long time though. The atmosphere actually was quite nice, views on the mosque, night time street impressions with a table outside. The food was delicious, I normally don't like Hummus a lot, but here I liked it. It was well presented as well. In the end I got the feeling that despite the 10% service charge it was expected that we give additional tip, which was a bit strange hence the 3/5 for the service. We did like the tea at the very end which rounded up an otherwise nice dinner experience. Thank you very much.\n\nWe choose the restaurant because of its good reviews and as the staff was not at all intrusive as most of the other places in the area.\nWe shared a mixed appetizers plate, which was alright. Overall good, but also no particular highlights.\nThe iced lemon tea was perfect after an exhausting day.\nA plus was the free mint tea at the end, which we really appreciated.\nThe service could be more attentive, while the food was out quite fast. All in all a rather average experience.\n\nCozy al fresco location with a view of the mosque, serving great Lebanese food. While the kabab meats and lamb mandi could have a bit more salt, the rice was superb. Chicken however was overcooked and became too dry and hard. They also serve great baklava for desert or take-away. We were served also complimentary mint tea at the end of the meal.

The standout dish for me was the lamb; it had absolutely no odor and tasted fantastic. The grilled items were a highlight as well, bursting with delicious flavors. The restaurant\u2019s ambiance was beautifully decorated, and the staff was both charming and incredibly helpful, taking the time to explain the dishes to us. While it\u2019s not the cheapest option, the prices are fair for the quality you receive.\n\nOne thing to note, though, is that the platter we ordered was described as \u201cfor two,\u201d but for Asians, it\u2019s considered a generous portion. So, if there are four of you and you\u2019ve already ordered other dishes, I recommend going for the platter for two only; it\u2019s quite substantial. Would recommend to anyone looking for a great dining experience!\n\nFirst time having Turkish food and was really\npleasantly surprised. Their dips and bread was really exceptional. The bread was steaming when it came out it was both crispy and fluffy at the same time. The platter for 2 was also great all the grilled meats was tender and flavourful. Portion was also huge.\n\nVery impressive food & service displayed by the dedicated front staffs and chefs. It\u2019s nice walking in the street after a wine & dine session in the area. The staffs were very attentive, price is reasonable.\n\nVery delicious food with reasonable price.\nMy friend from Turkey said this is the only place with authentic Turkish food. My mom who is super picky about food said their food is good. Their dessert Kunefe is both crispy and creamy.\n\nThe staffs are friendly and knowledgeable. Will visit again.\n\nWent here for a birthday celebration and the attention to detail from their service staff is amazing, didn\u2019t mention to the staff that it was for a birthday celebration, only had a note in the reservation. But they went above and beyond, having candles in the dessert and even giving us props to take pictures with and proceeded to then print out the photo of us to keep!\n\nThe food also matches the service, authentic Turkish cuisine done perfectly, the Hummus was so good we had to order a second portion! I\u2019m not usually a fan of chicken but the chicken that came with the platter blew my mind, so juicy and tender. Then comes dessert, my first time having Kunefe and the only thing I have to say is that I wish I didn\u2019t share it, wanted it all to myself \ud83e\udd23\n\nDefinitely coming back here again!\n\n\nOption: 6:\nName: Sanobar\nAddress: 20 Baghdad St, Singapore 199659\nPhone: 9780 8033\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20091:00\u202fAM\nTuesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20091:00\u202fAM\nWednesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20091:00\u202fAM\nThursday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20091:00\u202fAM\nFriday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20091:00\u202fAM\nSaturday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20091:00\u202fAM\nSunday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20091:00\u202fAM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.2\nReviews: \n\nFirst time trying Lebanese food and it was really nice with a very good vibe. the ambiance was all set and whole arab street experince was lit. Hummus with bread and apple teas is a myst try dish over here. The price is on the higher side and I would say going in a group pf 5-6 people will be good as we get to try lot of new dishes.\n\nThe food was not too bad. First time having Lebanese food. The chicken was cooked nicely and the basmati rice was seasoned well. The lamb chops were on the drier side. Overall interesting meal. Recommended for group dinners.\n\nSanobar Lebanese Restaurant in Singapore is a hidden culinary gem that whisks diners away to the flavors of Lebanon. The restaurant offers a delectable and authentic Lebanese dining experience, from succulent shawarmas to flavorful falafels and tantalizing baklava desserts.\n\nThe ambiance is warm and inviting, and the friendly staff ensures a delightful dining experience. The menu caters to various dietary preferences and offers a true taste of Middle Eastern cuisine. Staff is so welcoming and friendly! Whether you're a fan of Lebanese food or new to it, Sanobar is a must-visit, I enjoyed the place so much when I visited Singapore in January!\n\nVisited 13 July 2023 humid summer evening.

I ordered chicken wrap. All vegetables and chicken inside were very juicy and tasty. But I think the price is quite expensive considering the portion. Mine was 10 SGD but was not very generous portion. If I consider the location, which is a tourism spot, then maybe the price is reasonable but, still, for locals, I think a bit expensive.\n\nHad their signature lamb chop but was served with Briyani rice. Food taste good here but food portion was a little disappointed. Wasn't very transparent about the cost as the receipt reflected different price from the menu. Wouldn't return to dine here again as it's tad expensive and they charge 10% service charge for a roadside store. \ud83d\ude05\n\nHad a great lunch here. Cheaper than most places nearby and very delicious food.\n\nWe had a delicious lunch at  House of Kebab. The highlight was the hummus- lots of garlic & ideal texture.  The  mixed grill meat and chicken was a little dry but tasty and good flavour.\n\nFood is delicious and service is great. Owner is nice and friendly but will upsell quite heavily. I paid $145 for a satisfying meal for 6 but honestly expected to pay not more than $100. Not that I was misled in anyway, I really wasn't. But would have probably been more value for money for us if we had matched the orders accordingly, I.e. two platters instead a lamb kofta and one platter.\n\nTo be fair, I received 4 glasses of juice for the price of 2. Original price of the juices were rather expensive originally, but works out to a reasonable $2.50 each before taxes which is reasonable and delicious. I paid about $20 for a Hallomi Cheese which was a delicious fried cheese that the children liked very much. I was gifted a Borek which was crispy and well liked by my hubby.\n\nFor Hummus, I paid about $14. Owner was generous and gave me two chickpea hummus and one baba ganoush. I must say that the hummus was nutty, toasty and delicious. Paid about $16 for two of the Pita Breads and also gifted a dessert.\n\nI had high expectations based on the positive reviews and the food and service doesn't disappoint. Would have given five stars if price was more as i originally expected. I still did find my meal value for money though, and I would definitely come back. Thanks for the great food and service and for taking the time to reach out on this. Much appreciated.\n\n\nOption: 8:\nName: Istanbul Turkish & Middle Eastern Cuisine\nAddress: 25 Baghdad St, Singapore 199664\nPhone: 6296 4084\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.6\nReviews: \n\nFriendly staff\nFoods were delicious and well cooked\nFree complementary\nPrice was okay and worth to eat.\n\nIf you are coming Singapore don\u2019t hesitate to visit this restaurant.\n\nFood was really really good, it improved my mood to be even better.

The mixed kebab platter was outstanding; I was trying to control my carbs but I couldn't get enough of the fragrant rice. The hummus was good, although the bread was a bit tough for my liking.

Food is definitely wayyy more expensive than the usual, but the taste makes it not such a bad deal. Apple tea is really nice before eating the food, very refreshing and fragrant but after eating any food it doesn't taste as nice.\n\nPeter, the staff here, was exceptionally polite and gave us a warm welcome. When I needed to store my dessert in the fridge, he was incredibly helpful. Peter also recommended their signature dishes, and we decided to try them.\n\nThe Tajin lamb shank was a delightful surprise, with tender, succulent meat that practically fell off the bone. The flavors were rich and aromatic, making it a standout dish.\n\nThe Meze tabagi was a delightful assortment of Mediterranean appetizers, a true explosion of flavors and textures. It included a variety of dips, fresh vegetables, and savory bites, providing a wonderful contrast of tastes.\n\nFor a refreshing beverage, we ordered the Mango Ayran. It was a perfect balance of sweet and tangy, making it a great complement to our meal.\n\nUnfortunately, as there were only two of us, we couldn't order the traditional dessert Peter recommended. Nevertheless, we thoroughly enjoyed the atmospheric environment, delicious food, and excellent service provided by the staff.\n\n\nOption: 10:\nName: Makdoner Lebanese Restaurant\nAddress: 20 Baghdad St, Singapore 199659\nPhone: 6291 5897\nDelivery Available: Information Not Available\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 3.9\nReviews: \n\nSuper wanted to like this place \u2026 but the service was very slow, I often had to chase down the waiter.

Go here!\n\nAmazing food, ate there twice\n\nSultan Mosque Nakamise Street has a lot of restaurants with a nice atmosphere, so I was a little confused, but a local friend brought me to this restaurant. The appetizer platter is full of Mediterranean cuisine (Lebanese?). For mains, we each ordered lamb chops and skewered beef (I don't know the name). I was so absorbed in chatting that I couldn't eat all the appetizers, but they all tasted authentic. The main meat dishes are simply prepared but delicious. I appreciated the thoughtfulness of pointing two large fans at us. None of the restaurants in Nakamise serve alcohol (for religious reasons), so if you need one, you should either drink before coming to this area, or go to a pub a little further out of this area as there are many pubs. Let's go for a drink.\n",

The salad and food bar had a great variety to choose from and the meat get served direct to the table every few minutes (^^\"). And remember to ask for the pineapple!!!\n\nAll the meat is quite salty, makes you keep drinking water and fill up your stomach fast. Most of the beef like tenderloin and lamb were overcooked and were lacking in flavour.\n\nBooked our reservation for 7pm but had no issues despite us coming earlier at 6.30. Our waiter, even though he was a trainee (some chinese/asian person) was super on the ball when it came to refilling our water and changing our plates.\n\nWhen I accidentally dropped some meat on my white shirt, he immediately dropped whatever he was doing and got me a wet and dry tissue for me to clean off the stain.

Every bite was tender and we enjoyed the service very much. At one point, we even requested the chef for a particular cut, which he very graciously prepared just for our table. The salad bar is very fresh and well prepared. We recommend the ham, pineapples and beef brisket. If you dare to try, get the chicken heart too!\n\nCarnivore started 2 decades ago at Vivo City, relocated to CHIJMES, and just relocated to Robertson Quay.\n\nThe meat or skewers were not what we accustomed to. All the variants of beef on skewers had a very strong gaming beefy taste and either dry or hard. Definitely not tender just hard. The short beef ribs not so hard or tough but strong beefy taste. The chicken heart was okay at 7/10. The home made sausage was dried out, was not tasty at all, a dismal 2/10. The bacon wrapped chicken at 5/10. The chicken thigh better at best a 7/10.\n\nThe best from carver is the skewered barbecued pineapple at 9/10 and butterfish at 8/10.\n\nStrangely the buffet sides were better overall compared to the skewered meats. Minestrone soup 7/10, black beans with sliced sausages 7/10, potato salad 8/10, asparagus salad 7/10, beef stew 6.5/10.\n\nThe assorted chocolate desert was 8/10. The fruit was decent at 7.5/10.\n\nDunno what to say. We are so used to the higher meat qualities when they were at Vivos City. Just wish they were as good as before. They just started operating less than a month since relocating from CHIJMES so maybe they just getting into the groove.\n\nService was good, friendly & attentive. Hardly anyone there during Monday lunch as it was a public holiday, in lieu of Deepavali.\n\nThis is a meat lovers paradise! Every meat they serve is awesome! My faves are the rump cap, chicken thigh and the butterfish! But on the whole food is awesome, and service is great! I especially loved the service from an elderly gentleman. He was attentive to my needs and made sure I got what I wanted. He deserves 100 stars and he makes my day!\n\nMeats were a bit dried but taste still not that bad, salad bar and dessert okay, overall okay\n\nFelt like meat variety for rotation was alot lesser than what was shown on their website.

The meat are cooked to perfection and the servers were so attentive to details and prompt to react. If you are a meat lover, dont miss the experience here!\n\nSome of the items that I really like, (no pictures cause busy eating \ud83d\ude05)\n- Garlic Beef\n- Picanha\n- Duck Breast\n- Chicken and Chicken Heart\n- Sirloin\n- Beef Ribs\n\nAnd and and! The cheese bread and fried banana were awesome toooooo!\n\nDo try them out!\n\nWe brought a toddler with us and it was child friendly. Overall the food were great and fresh. The marination taste really good and was grilled to perfection; the beef was medium rare, good job to the chef! I'm not a fish person but it got me eating second piece, it was delicious and fresh. Our daughter just loves the chips and tomato. Service was attentive and well explained. Good job to Chris and team! Looking forward to visit again!\n\nIt was my anniversary celebration. We had\nlunch, and it was a carnivore's dream come true. The buffet-style service, with servers continuously offering a variety of meats until you signal them to stop, was a delightful experience.\n\nThe meat selection was impressive, and I must say the Picanha, Prime Part of Top beef stole my heart.\nDespite that Picanha that stole my heart, there were some others that I think otherwise. Maybe this is personal preference.\n\nOverall, I found their concept of unlimited, high-quality meat servings are truly enjoyable.\n\nNotes: the bottle provided on the table are chargeable. One is sparkling water, the other is mineral water.\n\nNo complaints whatsoever. It's worth the steap price, from the sides (pictured) to the array of various meats, all cooked to perfection, to the attentive and courteous wait staff.\n\nMy only reccomendarion is to come hungry.\n\nWonderful place for event or company dinner\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb Our team had dinner in Casa Brasilia. We were excited at first for their churrasco concept. Then, it turned out to be a such good decision\ud83d\ude07.

This place do not serve beer tower.\nThe food is great, would love to come again with the big group.\nWe asked one staff to help us to take a photo and after he take 1 photo for us, he took out his phone to take another photo and told us that it is going to post on their Instagram. One of my friend felt not respected, firstly he didn\u2019t ask for our permission, secondly, we don\u2019t know who he is and don\u2019t know what he is going to do with it, and express that he is not comfortable with it, especially he doesn\u2019t like a random person having his photo in other people\u2019s phone. Perhaps, asking for permission might be a good choice.\nBtw, the food and drinks are so good!\nBy the way, I\u2019ve gotten quite a few mosquitoes bite from there.\n\nNice location at the end of a busy street, this bar is open and airy with plenty of seating and a decent range of beers. The cocktails were also impressive and reasonably priced during happy hour. Food was only ok (fairly run-of-the-mill pub-grab and a little too many fried options) but that's ok. The staff were friendly and attentive. Solid choice for a street packed with options.\n\nA great atmosphere and the food is really delicious. Staff super friendly and readily available for next drinks and orders.\n\nA great selection of Western foods.\n\nNice ambience. The food is good and the staff attentive. The corner tables have some mosquitos issues but the staff will provide incense when asked. Highly recommend their lamb stew and lala soup.\n\nAlways one of my favourite places to go to in Holland Village (among the many watering holes there!).

We decided on a mexican fiesta and as such, popped in for a quick fix and to our delightful surprise, we were not at all disappointed.\n\nMy dish was about $19 before GST. It was fried chicken with loads of tomato sauce on it, with cilantro rice and nachos on the side. My friends had nachos and enchiladas. The flavours were good and the cilantro rice was so yummy. They didn\u2019t skimp on the cilantro and the rice was cooked to perfection, every rice with that intense cilantro flavour. My chicken was fried to perfection, and it was juicy and moist. The serving size is generous for what you\u2019re paying.\n\nThe restaurant service was attentive, and I loved that they provided free iced water to patrons. Such should be the standard of more restaurants in Singapore.\n\nThe decor was quaint and cute.\n\nAbsolutely love the Mexican food here especially the Soup with the fresh seafood in it had the nachos with pulled pork which was amazing the enchiladas filled with beef and the set with taco and enchilada with beans on the side I added guacamole as well which was great! Definitely would recommend this! Though service is sometimes quite slow it\u2019s still quite worth while\n\nI don't eat much mexican, but I really enjoyed my dinner here. Was difficult to choose from the menu but thankfully the staff were very helpful with their recommendations.\n\nThe spring roll thingy was amazing, way better than it looks.\nI didn't know nachos can be served like that, the pulled pork one was good but wish there was more meat.\nBeef quesadilla was really good too, altho it looked really flat and sad, but it was actually very flavourful and filling.\nFish tacos tasted quite interesting, I actually couldn't taste the fish at all which is a good thing.\n\nOh and I love the guacamole and tomatoes and salsa ~\n\nThe downside is all the quesadilla/taco/XXX all looked and tasted very similar.\n\nBut yea would come visit again! It tastes quite wholesome!\n\nI am a frequent customer and have been ordering from them for a couple of years. No longer in the future as there was a cockroach wrapped in my burrito. I have reported them to the food agency.\n\nIt\u2019s been many years since I\u2019ve last been here. It\u2019s a long standing establishment and the food did not fail me.\nOrdered the pi\u00f1atas, chimichanga and calamari.

Although the squid ink pasta took 40mins to prepare, you can be sure it is cooked the authentic way cause the flavour is thoroughly infused into all the rice.

Only thing was this menacing crow that was eyeing our food from the tree outside.\n\nWent for dinner on a Saturday - wasn\u2019t too crowded.\nService was great! Really appreciate the staff checking in with us - and when we wanted to look at the menu for desserts, the lady recited the whole list and recommended the lava cake (which we thoroughly enjoyed). When I asked for additional ice for my drink, they gave me a cup with a pair of small tongs!\nFood was okay - nothing to shout about, in my opinion.

My favorite was the meatball pasta, something in the meatball was so addictive, felt like there were exploding flavors of several herbs and nuts in this dish but weren\u2019t overpowering. Everything was tied together perfectly with the sauce and most importantly, pasta was Al Dante. On a side note, the dessert, tiramisu was actually huge and made perfectly. Good to share!\n\nAnd with such good food quality, it was worth every dollar spent. We managed to try a few dishes in one sitting and was a little over being just full. The service was prompt and pleasant so as the environment. Will be returning here for sure!!\n\nFood really nice +, environment is great+, staffs are friendly. Foods are so good to taste. Love the tiramisu.\n\nExcellent thin crust pizza! One Of the better ones I had tasted. Service was good and food came out quickly. Prices are reasonable too.\n\nFood here was AMAZING! Every dish that was recommended to us was so delightful to taste. Highly recommend the mushroom ravioli for starters, the crab pasta, and the pizza (crust was so nicely done) \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\n\nService was great too, they provided 4 wraps for our fajitas instead of the usual 3 as we came as a family of 4. He also shared these amazing recommendations, thank you very much! \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc\u263a\ufe0f will be back!\n\nNice ambience for Mexican & Italian food. Love the beef fajitas and Burrata. Sadly line many establishments these days, they do not serve tap water and only served still water at $7 a bottle.\n\n\nOption: 3:\nName: FOC Sentosa\nAddress: 110 Tanjong Beach Walk, 098943\nPhone: 6100 1102\nDelivery Available: No\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: Closed\nTuesday: Closed\nWednesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 3 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.2\nReviews: \n\nWe celebrated my daughter's birthday yesterday and we had a great time! The staff was accommodating and we felt really well taken care of. The kids enjoyed having a pool to splash in before and after dinner.\nFood was good, we had the mushroom croquetas - this tastes like breaded mushroom soup; crystal bread - which was a hit with the kids, its basically toasted bread with tomato paste; potato churros - another hit with the kids; octopus tentacle - super yummy; beef steak - tender and juicy; red snapper; highlight was the squid ink paella! We also had the iberico paella - that was OK only.\nThe white sangria was a little too watered down. Tasty, but abit like fruit juice.\n\nLove this place and the fact that after so many years, the quality of the food remains high!\n\nUndeniably on the higher price range so it\u2019s a bit of a treat whenever we visit FOC. The food and service does not disappoint. Staff tried to accommodate every request we had, which does really make the whole night more enjoyable.\n\nThis place serves up one of the best Paellas in Singapore! My go to place for squid ink paella! The black paella came with perfectly grilled tender prawns and scallops!\n\nOrdered the grilled prawns which was served on small sizzling skillet filled with soft tender prawns swimming in a pool of fragrant garlic oil. Hmmmm.. I could cut the all the seafood here with my spoon!\n\nOur favourite appetiser was still the saut\u00e9ed cauliflower! It looked like a simple dish until we bite into it! There were so many layers of flavours in this dish! One bite into the crunchy cauliflower, paired with the smoked aubergine pur\u00e9e, spiced mayo, pickled onions and a speck of herbs was just divine.\n\nIf i can give 10 starz i will gladly give them. Their seafood paella was honestly one of the best we ever tasted in SG. The flavour is bursting with every bite and the texture is legit aldente. Their fish n chips and char grilled portobello was also great tasting.\n\nI would like to commend on their service because they had went the extra mile to provide my partner with a complimentary birthday dessert when i casually mentioned to the staff. Really appreciated that gesture which made our day. Thank you\n\nManager graciously gave us a complimentary avocado salad for an ordering mistake which took us by a pleasant surprise.\n\nBy the way the iberico pork paella is REALLY GOOD!\n\nNice beach atmosphere. Great pool. Good food. Pate and ham Croquettes were great! Fried Peppers too! Bread was so so. Had their cocktails. Not fantastic though.\n\n\nOption: 4:\nName: Tapas Club @ VivoCity\nAddress: 1 HarbourFront Walk, #01-98/99 VivoCity, Singapore 098585\nPhone: 9155 4096\nDelivery Available: Information Not Available\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4\nReviews: \n\nWell\u2026 walking out of the restaurant feeling regretful on my choice vs the money spent\u2026\n\nPotato with bravas sauce was terrible. That\u2019s the saddest choice I have made. Always a potato lover and for any potato to taste bad for me, it\u2019s really not a good thing. 1/10\n\nFried squid was just ok n nothing better than ok.\nMy son said \u201cyuck\u201d which was very shocking to me cos he loves his calamari. 5/10\n\nSpanish omelette was quite good and the portion was huge. 7/10\n\nSeafood and chicken Paella was the best out of all the choice and it was delicious.\nDefinitely a 8/10\n\nChurros was equally disappointing. Very tough and hard and the oil used must be stale or used for many times. The churros smell very seafood-ish if u know what I mean.\n\nPaying the amount for the quality. I am definitely not very happy walking out.\n\nWent on a weekday night to celebrate anniversary as wife wanted tapas. We ordered crispy fried squid, mushroom croquettes, potatoes with bravas sauce & aioli, Argentian beef steak, garlic prawns, grilled chorizo & potato puree, Spanish omelette, and prosecco. Food was mostly so-so and the potatoes with bravas sauce was the least nice. Maybe the steak and grilled chorizo in potato puree were the best we ordered. The frozen sangria looks good but we didn't order. Staff was attentive and response fast. Outdoor has a nice view of Sentosa.\n\nSublime tapas with swift service. The Padras peppers, chorizo with potato pur\u00e9e, garlic prawns with toast, fish tacos, and churros with chocolate sauce transported me back to an enjoyable holiday in Barcelona. These were fine Spanish grub and I look forward to trying more dishes such as the paella.\n\nWith a good selection of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages, there\u2019s also a nice grocery shop positioned near the entrance for you to take a taste of Spain home.\n\nOverall the food taste good but the quantity in both our Paella is little (compare to the previous time I ate at Orchard outlet). Mushroom croquet are so good we ordered second serving. The cold cuts, salads and tapas (prawns, chicken wings, squid, potatoes with bravas sauce, eggplant) are good. Seabass can skip, not very tasty.\n\nGreat food! Came here for a company dinner and ordered many small plates. My favourites were the ib\u00e9rico pork as well as the jalape\u00f1os, which was a very interesting dish! The mushroom croquettes was also really nice, and kind of tasted like solidified mushroom soup. All in all, I enjoyed every single dish. I do prefer the squid ink paella over the Valencia paella though, as it was richer in taste.\n",

Very no frills and simple place.\n\nShe had a falafel moussaka, and I had the mexican beef bowl. The moussaka was delicious but I feel like 5 pieces of nacho chips wasn\u2019t enough and mind you this cost $13\u2026..\n\nThe beef bowl was a little dry, could do with some kind of sauce but it was good and we finished both dishes. The churros came freshly fried and was good too, but would have preferred actual choc sauce vs the hershey choc syrup.\n\nOnly gripes; the overly sugary lemongrass drink that was served premade with no ice. Had to ask for ice twice but given few pieces\u2026..  also very weird that we dined in but were served with plastic cutlery when we clearly saw metal cutlery, it was a little strange. It was practically only 2 tables and the lady served my food to the other table\u2026. Could tell she wanted to take it back to serve me but they already started eating it.\n\nI think its a quaint little place but some things need to be improved. At $30 for 2 expected just a little more.\n\nExcellent service. The beef Mexican rice bowl was not bad. With the homemade drink, I spent less than $10. I was there alone at 5 ish and I had the entire place to myself. I don't remember music playing but it sure would be nice to listen to some tunes.\n\nSmall quaint shop located near Tai Seng Mrt, they had a $10 set meal that had a wrap, small hash brown and a lemongrass tea. There was a small side of nacho chips with salsa.\n\nNothing amazing but I guess it was better than nothing coz there wasn\u2019t anything there open before 11am\n\nDropped-off my 10-months old laptop at LENOVO Service Centre at 3 Irving Rd, #01-17 Tai Seng Centre. BITC, Singapore 369522 on Tuesday 18 April 2023,\n\nThus decide to settle my late lunch within the area too.\n\nOne will be spoiled with choices as there are so many small eateries and cafes. I was drawn to  Olive Mediterranean & Middle East which was located across the street at 11 Irving Place #01-14/15, Tai Seng Point, Singapore 369551.\n\nOrdered for myself a Mexican Rice (Celantro & Spinach With Beef) Bowl at S$7.50.\n\nIf you are a small eater, the serving portion is just right. However, definitely a \"No. No.\" for someone who has a heavy duty digestive system, I would recommend that you order some nachos or Quesadillas too.\n\nIn my opinion, the rice is mildy aromatic (I was expecting a more pungent aroma of Celantro and spinach).\n\nI will rate the minced beef topping as \"healthy choice\".  It is relatively quite nice BUT will not leave one any special impression.  It will definitely taste alot better if there is a little more fat (this will enhance the juiciness) and more spices are added.\n\nHowever, if you working in this area, it is a great place to meet up with your colleagues and friends after work.  You can sufficient outdoor sittings surrounded with plants.\n\nStumbled on this place as i happened to be browsing around. Been awhile since i had my tacos and wraps, decided to try this as i noticed they had very high reviews.\n\nHad the beef Quesadilla - loved it as it was simply nice\nChicken Saffron Stew - Soooo tender and nice but soup wasnt as thick as i wanted but thats purely due to my own taste\nHashbrowns - Thumbsup as we all loved it. Hearsay its even better than M's hashbrown but i leave it for u to judge.\n\nService wise was top, very homely feel given by the lady boss and staff. She took her time to guide me through the menu and shared with me what we should order.\nI must say the food takes a pretty long time to come for a quiet Monday Afternoon but i guess Good Food - Time to prepare so no complaints from me on this.\n\nOverall i recommend this place based on the food served + prices. Very nice and they deserves better businesses. should be pretty quiet when its after office hours.\n\nWill be back again :)\n\n\nOption: 2:\nName: Zuzu Kebab\nAddress: 49A Serangoon Garden Way, #01-32, Singapore 555945\nPhone: 9025 0727\nDelivery Available: No\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nFriday: Closed\nSaturday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.3\nReviews: \n\nOpening in March 2022, Zuzu Kebab is a Muslim-owned hawker stall specialising in Turkish kebabs. The chef at the helm of Zuzu Kebab formerly hailed from the Turkish Kebab House, a pop-up stall often seen in Pasar Malams / Night Bazaars around Singapore. Zuzu Kebab tends to attract long hungry queues of diners, thanks to their delicious dishes served in large hearty portions, at wallet-friendly prices.\n.\nAmbience at Zuzu Kebab is shared with the rest of the Serangoon Garden Market & Food Centre hawker stalls. There's ample common seating, with bright lights, and an open, airy, bustling atmosphere. The large and attractive signage of Zuzu Kebab is easy to spot, with people patiently waiting their turn to order.\n.\nService at Zuzu Kebab is friendly but structured. Chef takes a few orders at a time, then makes each order one at a time. This results in fresh, made-to-order, piping hot meals each time, though it also leads to a short queue of up to 15 minutes in waiting time. It's usually a 1 or 2 man show here, and while they demonstrate great product knowledge on the menu, they can be rather brusque during peak periods.\n.\nFood at Zuzu Kebab is Turkish cuisine, with a focus on kebabs. There's a good range of options here, though most folks order the staples. I like that their dishes and meals are healthy and wholesome, not too greasy, and served with plenty of fresh vegetables. Quality is consistently above average, and portions are large for individuals.\n.\nPrices are wallet-friendly but higher than other hawkers, budget about SGD $9 per person.\n\nEnjoyed the burrito & butter rice with chicken. The pita bread with hummus was yummy. Be prepared to queue/wait for your food during peak meal time.\n\nGood quality and value !!! Just need to prepare for long queue and waiting time.\nKunefe is the best I had so far!! Freshly made, rich but not sweet! Must try!!\nThe pita bread are freshly made, for garlic and cheese option, they will bake it upon ordering, it is so good just out from the oven , but be prepared for some waiting time, if you are in a rush, take the salad ,kebabs , original pita.\n\nZUZU IS BACK!! Absolutely tasty and worth the wait. Just look at the char on the chicken. Definitely value for money w the huge portion size. I always come prepared to pack some back for my lunch at work tmr \ud83d\ude0d\n\nGreat Turkish food in serangoon garden hawker centre. The kebabs servings are huge and the meat is very well seasoned and grilled. The hummus is another highlight, smooth creamy and full of spices. It tasted even better with its pita bread whuch is freshly made on the spot and baked.\n\n\nOption: 3:\nName: PLONK\nAddress: 7 Maju Ave, Singapore 556685\nPhone: None\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.1\nReviews: \n\nBeen to Plonk many times over a few years and the consistency of the food, good service staff and quality (& quantity) never fail to impress. Still keeping up the standards. Fish & chips are served in a good proportion. Pizza (thin n nicely done as well) n pork ribs (big portion hor) Crispy wings with a special dipping sauce - not too bad but I thought the wings can be further marinated for people who don't go for the dipping sauce. Fries costs only $5 on Fridays n you get ALOOOT of fries too. Ordered Bolognese n Carbonara (finished before I remember to take photo). The kids absolutely loved it. We loved how much clams we had in the vongole - power la. The staff were also very friendly n kind to hand us spoon n plates for our cake.\n\nBeen awhile since I had a beer at Serangoon Gardens! Plonk serves Little Creatures Pale Ale on tap. It was an enjoyable pint and the St Kinda fish and chips was a great pairing. Great attentive service crew and will be back!\n\nBeen to Plonk many times, usually for their express brunch. The fish and chips was fantastic, crispy and freshly fried fish with a nice thin batter coating. A whole heap of fries absolutely fried to perfection. Paired very nicely with the Little Creatures IPA they have on tap. Very pleasant ambience as well, open air but cool inside. The tart was more on the chocolate side, fudgy and delicious and paired with vanilla ice cream. On other visits i\u2019ve also had their truffle mushroom risotto which is cheesy goodness.\n\nI was around the serangoon area and looking for something new to try. Stumbled upon Plonk with loads of people having a beer in the front and decided to try this place out. The food was great, the place wasn't too crowded, music volume was just nice, but inside was just too dark.\n\nThe food was great and you should not skip on the pizza. Ordered the mushroom truffle, mushrooms are big and chunky, dough was nice and crispy.\n\nKitchen whipped meals are \ud83d\udcaa strong. Very flavourful pizzas. Eggs and burgers are juicy and crisp to lock in the flavours \ud83c\udf54\n\nUnfortunately they\u2019re so popular the kitchen is short handed. You\u2019re gonna have to wait 40mins plus for service. You can tell the waiter and managers are harried from the load too.

My last visit was quite awhile back. The food, ambience, and service here are very good! Parking is free! Place tends to get crowded and there\u2019s sometimes a queue, so it\u2019s wise to make a reservation before heading down. Had the dips and bread, octopus, sea bass, spinach pastries, and finally, baklava for dessert! Everything was great! Octopus was nice and tasty + tender, sea bass was fresh, all the pastries were warm and the Greek coffee we had to end the meal was pretty good too! Will be back here again to try more food! Hopefully sooner than later! Highly recommended for authentic Greek Mediterranean food! Fantastic experience every visit!\n\nA lovely place for those looking for non pork meals. They don\u2019t qualify as a halal place  as they serve alcohol. But good for Muslim friends. It was my first time here and it\u2019s been a while since I had Greek food. I love the dips option from spicy to mild tasting dips. The fried calamari was great too followed by the medium rare lamb which was tender. Ensure you make a reservation to avoid disappointment. Good place to bring friends.\n\nAlways crowded on weekends such that even booking a table on same day is sometimes not possible.\nI really enjoyed the medium meat platter. grilling was on point  meat was juicy and not dry.\nmoussaka went down way too easily. Greek dip platter was on point flavour wise and the taramasalata was flavourful without tasting too fishy.\nsadly the pita bread is pretty small portioned, I'm not sure how you're expected to finish the dip given with the portions served\nGrilled octopus was also delicious.\n\nService was friendly and efficient.\nDecor isn't very Greek but honestly ambience is great (albeit a bit noisy)\n\nIt's harder to get a table here than the at its closest competitor, and for  good reason.\n\nGood food. Although the beef can be on the dry side, everything else was delicious.\n\nHighly recommend the grilled octopus. It is not chewy at all. For those who don\u2019t like squid or octopus, try to have a bite.\n\nRestaurant is packed on a Friday night and the food arrives pretty quick. Staff are quite alright. Some could use a little refining in politeness.\n\nThere\u2019s complimentary licorice candy. Absolutely love it.\n\nWill visit this place again. But recommend to come here in a bigger group to order a larger variety of dishes.\n\nFirst visit. Reservation was smooth via seven rooms. We chose an outdoor table as the weather was pleasant.

I have been here 10 TIMES. The food is always so consistently good. They serve the best salad, octopus, sea bream, lamb chop and even chicken. Their dips and pita bread are also to die for. Service isn't as good as it used to be anymore but oh well.\n\nCelebrated a friend birthday here and the staff was quite helpful. We were introduced to a good spread. Wasn\u2019t expecting the food to be good in this type of cafe but was pleasantly surprised of the meat quality and portion. Slightly on the salty side but acceptable. Overall, would come back again.\n\nLoved having dinner here. Food, service, atmosphere all fantastic. Wayne was a great server who recommended some signature dishes - codfish roe was my fav. Octopus was well cooked and kebab was also unique but perfectly cooked.\n\nCame here multiple times including the one at the old location. Also recommended and brought my friends, colleagues here many times! Loved the food, ambience and service! Just so good! This time my friends and I came here to celebrate birthday and the bar manager treated us to complimentary alcohol and gave a small bottle of olive oil (we also purchased a big one!). Their olive oil tastes so gooooooood! The dessert was complimentary as well. I love the fish, octopus and vegetables the best!\n\nFood is fantastic. Price is reasonable as well, total damage is about $50/pax. (We ordered like 7-8 dishes).\nService is pretty prompt. The ambience is good & cozy for gathering & chit-chatting.\n\n\nOption: 6:\nName: Alati Divine Greek Cuisine\nAddress: 73 Amoy St, Singapore 069892\nPhone: 6221 6124\nDelivery Available: Information Not Available\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nSunday: Closed\n\nPrice Level: 3 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.4\nReviews: \n\nThe best Greek restaurants we\u2019ve ever been in Singapore.

The food did not disappoint and everything was really delicious ans savoury. The chef and waiters service was friendly and attentive. And there was also a free flow of cabbage for us as well.\nOverall a five star recommendation for this place so do come and try!\n\nService is great.\nPlace remains same for a Monday before 6pm .\n\nMiso ramen is still well flavoured and appetising. Helps chase away Monday blues.\nPrices have increased for adding noodles so I opt for a add on of rice instead.\n\nCheers.\n\nWe were very happy with the taste of our food and the service level provided! Big eaters like me rejoice with free flow rice and cabbage!\n\nFamily\u2019s go to dinner place for tonkatsu sets. Love that the rice and cabbage is free flow!\n\nThe tonkatsu is well breaded and fried. Not greasy and still juicy.\n\nRice is properly cooked, always nicely done. Loving the soup that comes as a side with the meal itself. Cabbage is shredded nice and thin, and the dressing is tart and delicious!\n\nOverall a really good experience!\n\nIf you are keen on noodles, the ramen is pretty good as well. Extra serves of noodle and soup can be purchased to top up the meal itself.\n\nOverall, really yummy! Get there early for a table!\n\nOne of my favourite Oyakodons(and store, too!) in Singapore, while I often visit for their Katsus, if I ever crave Oyakodons I often find myself back here. Affordable Authentic Japanese Comfort Food.\n\nThe Oyakodon has half-cooked eggs which lends an extremely smooth texture to the dish. The Mirin is rich but not overbearing. Chicken chunks are tender, eaten with rice, it\u2019s truly something I come back to again and again.\n\nThat said, most dishes here are tasty, so if it\u2019s not your bowl of rice, you can\u2019t really go wrong with the Miso Katsu either(not pictured).\n\n\nOption: 8:\nName: Sun Ray Cafe\nAddress: 79 Brighton Cres, Singapore 559218\nPhone: 8909 8458\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.3\nReviews: \n\nAn affordable pet and dog cafe in the neighbourhood. We came here several times and this time was a special day for us and our precious Stitch who turned 5 years old this year. You could pre order a dog friendly cake few days before your appointment. Our cake is made of pumpkin and fruits so humans could eat it too\n\nFood is not bad for the affordable pricing and we enjoyed it! Service was great and speed of serving the food is considered fast. We enjoyed ourselves a lot and recommend you bring your dog there :)\n\nBetter than average human food for a pet cafe! Prices are very reasonable. The floor is a bit gross though because it's vinyl and some owners don't clean up after their dogs immediately. Not wheelchair-friendly as there are steps at the entrance.\n\nA Paradise for Pet Lovers!\n\nThis is another hidden gem for all pet lovers and foodies alike. From the moment we walked in, we were welcomed with open arms and so was our furball.\n\nThe highlight of our visit was the pet menu, a thoughtful touch that truly sets this place apart. Our pup had a ball choosing from a variety of delicious options and the complimentary water served in bowls was a fantastic gesture to keep him hydrated and happy.\n\nFor the humans, the Chilli Crab Shakshuka and Salmon Hae Bee Hiam Spaghetti were nothing short of amazing. Bursting with flavors, these dishes were a treat for the taste buds. The Chilli Crab Shakshuka had the perfect balance of spiciness and richness, while the Salmon Hae Bee Hiam Spaghetti offered as much punch, if not more.\n\nThe presence of pee pads made our visit stress-free and convenient, ensuring our pets' comfort. The entire atmosphere exuded warmth and welcome for animals, making our experience very lovely.\n\nWe will be back!\n\nWent there twice.\nFirst, the food was really affordable and really good, ordered beef burger, their fish and chip and salmon rice bowl. Quality food!\nSecond, it\u2019s really dog friendly, the mop water etc is readily available, even leash as well.

Comes with a variety of ban chan dishes - ten to be exact. I was personally expecting the meat to be grilled on the table but it was done in the kitchen instead. Pork collar was overcooked and tough to chew. The beef on the hand was done alright. The other main dishes that we ordered were slightly better than the BBQ option than we had.\n\nI reached 630pm and had to queue outside for a while for 25mins. The server was passionate and shared with us what\u2019s the highly recommended dish to go for. Order an oxtail soup and a recommended BBQ. Oxtail soup was okay and lags of umami. The pork belly is overcooked and served on a hot plate that\u2019s not hot. Then I would recommend serving on the plate instead if there isn\u2019t any sizzling effect, why bother? Food for thought. I think probably we picked the wrong dishes? I don\u2019t know\u2026 but I\u2019m sure paying for that price I can get better BBQ meat for sure. Head down and try for yourself, review is base on my personal preference. You might have a different experience than I have.\n\nFood:\npork bokkeum $30\nserving size was generous and it was filled with lots of veg, onions and mushrooms. slight spice gave it a nice kick but doesn\u2019t come with rice. quite a challenge to finish it even if we weren\u2019t full because it got quite jelak\ndolsot bibimbap $20\ncan\u2019t go wrong, really nice and we polished it off\nhaemul pajeon $17\nthere was seafood with every bite of the pancake, they certainly don\u2019t scrimp on the ingredients. personally not a fan of how soft the pancake was though ):\nadditional items:\nsikhye $4\nreally nice and smooth drink, but serving size was a tad small, moreover no complimentary water which is usually a norm in korean joints\nhite beer $17, rice $2\n\n10 side dishes came complimentary but nothing really stood out. some were quite salty as well \ud83d\ude05\noverall not too bad, but nothing that stood out as being really delicious\n\nSuperb Korean food. Great, authentic taste.\n\nLove the japchae - nice texture, flavourful. Oxtail stew is good too. The BBQ platter is fantastic.\n\nThis place reminds me of a joint in Seoul that I used to frequent, esp their bokkeum octopus, which has such a generous amount of octopus compared to other places where there's more veg in the dish.. their side dishes are also good and a hit for my toddlers.\n\n\nOption: 10:\nName: Kebabs Faktory (Ang Mo Kio)\nAddress: 61 Ang Mo Kio Ave 8, #01-05 Jubilee Square, Singapore 569814\nPhone: 6539 9630\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.5\nReviews: \n\nThey have a selection of kebab, burrito, quesdadilla etc. Taste is ok, about slightly average in my opinion.

It was fairly empty (only 1 table occupied). Asked for a table for 2 and sat down. Wanted to order a chendol and a chin chow drink. The server told us we have to order main food. I asked exactly this \u201cwe cant just order a dessert and a drink?\u201d The person replied yes and that he cant take our order if we not ordering food. We got up and left.\nCant believe they turned down customers just because we only wanted dessert and a drink? Horrible service.\n\nThe place is small and tight. Portions are small - even the medium is enough maybe for 2 to 3 people at most, and cost a pretty penny. For 8 persons, total cost came up to S$241.50.\nTaste wise it was ok overall, nothing to shout about.\nHae cho was ok, but tiny.\nAyam buah keluak, at medium size, had only one nut cut into two. The taste was ok. Chicken was tender.\nChap chae was good, but portion was really small and alot of cabbage more than anything else.\nItek was really sour, bit strange but ok. Tender.\nBabi pongteh was really soupy. I'm more used to those that are less watery. But the meat was good.\nFish was not fresh. At 38 bucks, not quite worth it, I felt.\nOtah was small for the ten bucks it cost. Thought it was way overpriced.\nDessert portions were small for the price tag of 7 bucks. So-so only.\n\nOverall, I felt not worth the price tag. Unlikely to go back again.\n\nwow. House of Peranakan has been the highlight of my week! Great food and service, not many Peranakan food in Singapore, and as a Peranakan myself, it brings me back to my childhood days when grandma would cook. Highly recommended!!!! The staff is really helpful esp. this waiter named Duane\n\nUnique, one-of-a-kind environment.  Food depends on taste, but for me was unique, top class, and tastes home made.  I'm honestly a bit puzzled as to why the restaurant isn't rated higher.  Peranakan cuisine is under-rated.\n\nEverything was great! Friendly owners and a very nice family restaurant. Food was fantastic!!! Service was top notch and food recommendation by owner's grandson was\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d definitely coming back again especially when family from KL visits! All in all, food and desserts were amazing. So tasty!

They are good but flavours are very subtle not as flavoursome. General all the dishes were delicious , flavours were towards the mild side. Fresh ingredients and we enjoyed the service and ambience !\n\nI decided to explore the Joo Chiat area and took a bus there and walked around. It's a Monday so it's quiet and relaxing. Just felt a bit hungry and wondered what I could find and this restaurant just popped up!  Very quiet on a Monday and i had the whole place to myself for lunch. I must say prices are high for the food, but I decided to treat myself. Service was good and the food was good. I really like the very special Ayam buah keluak and ngoh hiang. I love the decor and traditional objects all around the restaurant. It's a great authentic dining experience.\n\nCame here after watching Ghib Ojisan eating here on his YouTube channel. Ordered ayam buah keluak, beef rendang, assam sotong, otak otak, nyonya chap chye, blue pea rice, chendol and bo bo cha cha. Rendang was very tender, probably my favourite in this list.\n\nOverall, food was decent but so-so. Can find better peranakan food elsewhere for this price range. Restaurant has a nice ambience though, and wasn\u2019t crowded on a Sunday night for dinner around 6.30pm.\n\nstaff were v friendly and the food was gd \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd\n\nthe best dish we ordered was SAMBAL KANGKONG ! the chilli paste used was very fresh and tastes different from sambal kangkong from other places.\n\nwe also ordered: nogh hiang, ayam buah keluak and hainanese pork chop.\n\nthey also gave a complementary acha dish.\n\nwanted to try their fish but was a bit expensive (about $48).\n\ntotal was abt $25 per person !\n\nWe came here while scouring for Nonya food in this area.  There were several restaurants in the area,  and I decided this based on Google reviews.\n\nReservations needed and recommended too.\n\nThe food is well balanced in both taste and scent,  unlike other places whereby the spices can be very overwhelming. The Sambal KangKong has that homely style cooking,  similar to mom's. Another item worth a mention is the curry chicken,  with that hint of sour in it,  bringing out the life.\n\nFinally,  never leave this place without trying the Chendol,  always leave room for dessert. It's not too sweet,  though heavy on the coconut.\n\nOverall,  service is fast,  speedy in fact.  I guess this is also due to the crowd that never seems to stop coming in,  we came on a Sat evening.\n\nWorth a return visit or as when one craves for Nonya food.\n\n\nOption: 4:\nName: Nyonyas & Gentlemen Restaurant\nAddress: Level 4 @, 25 Marine Parade Rd, Singapore 449536\nPhone: 6241 4850\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 6:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 6:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 6:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 6:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 6:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 6:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 6:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.8\nReviews: \n\nHere are my recommendations from the variety of food available.\n\nAyam Buah Keluak - where chicken meets the rich, earthy flavor of buah keluak nuts, creating an irresistibly complex dish!\n\nLoved the DIY Yong Tau Foo and Rojak. Get to choose your favorite ingredients. My Yong Tau Foo paired perfectly with their rich and flavorful laksa soup.\n\nDon't miss the creamy, custard-like Durian Pengat! A divine treat with that bold durian kick.\n\nI recently had the pleasure of dining at \u201cNyonyas\u201dand I must say, it was an exceptional experience. The standout feature of this establishment is undoubtedly the impeccable staff and their genuine hospitality. From the moment I stepped in, their attentiveness and spontaneous understanding of my needs was evident.\n\nThe menu at \u201cNyonyas\u201dis a testament to their commitment to catering to a diverse clientele. It flawlessly balances an array of international flavors, ensuring there's something to satisfy every palate. Whether you're craving traditional fare or seeking a culinary adventure, this restaurant delivers.\n\nKudos to the team for their dedication to creating an inclusive dining environment that transcends borders. I'm thoroughly impressed and can't wait to return. Keep up the fantastic work, Nyunyas Team! \ud83d\udc4d\n\nwhat a pleasant find in the east (Katong)! Good buffet spread of Nyonya Peranakan food at only S$38.90++, and is daily lunch. I recommend to try their laksa, kueh pie tee , achar & durian pengat - really good. Kuddos to their Chef David, who runs the kitchen & live station (fried carrot cake is good too!) Service staff is good.\n\nPeranakan buffet spread at Katong Village Hotel. Spread is rather huge for the price, but the food taste is so-so. Curry chicken and ponteh chicken rather bland. Salt duck soup very saltish. Nyonya laksa is is still manageable. The only 2 outstanding are the appetiser, which consists of kimchi, achar etc and durian penget.\n\nThere\u2019s a wide variety of food to choose from with a mix of Peranakan food and other cuisines too! There are live stations and diy stations along with their buffet spread which made the experience more fun. I particularly liked the laksa which was very flavourful and the appetising achar too! The staff provided prompt and good service which made the dining experience very enjoyable :)\n\nDisclaimer: Was here for a tasting but I saw how the staff treated other guests similarly as well \u263a\ufe0f\n\n\nOption: 5:\nName: Emmanuel Peranakan Cuisine\nAddress: 84 Marine Parade Central, #01-30, Singapore 440084\nPhone: 9757 4143\nDelivery Available: Information Not Available\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: Closed\nWednesday: Closed\nThursday: Closed\nFriday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 3.9\nReviews: \n\nEmmanuel Stall at Marine Parade Food Centre is an absolute gem! They sell normal rice and dishes but what I always come back for is the nonya blue pea nasi lemak. The chilli packs a punch too.\n\nI normally order fish and vetables with the blue pea nasi lemak.Price is decent for the taste as well. Actually the other dishes go together with white rice is good too. Been a patron of this stall since this is my home ground.\n\nNot only is the food exceptional, but the service is also top-notch. They take great pride in their food, and it truly shows in every dish.\n\nThe ambiance of the food center is bustling, adding to the overall dining experience. It's a great place to enjoy authentic Singaporean cuisine.\n\nEmmanuel Stall at Marine Parade Food Centre is a culinary delight. If you're in the area, don't miss the opportunity to savor their delicious offerings.\n\nDo take note they are off on Tue to Thurs.Also blue pea nasi lemak only avail on Fri to Sun.\n\nI\u2019ve always wanted to try the Nonya Nasi Lemak at Emmanuel Peranakan, which is one of the more popular stalls at 84 Marine Parade Central Hawker Centre.\n\nNo luck this time either, so I went with their regular Nasi lemak. Took fish fillet, chicken, begedel, tofu and fried egg.\n\nRice is very ok, not flavourful. I liked the begedel and the chicken. Fish is well cooked. The egg and tofu weren\u2019t good - quite bland and didn\u2019t seem fresh.\n\nFor $8.5, it\u2019s on the more expensive side too.\n\nLOVE their sayur lodeh!! This dish of theirs hasn\u2019t been getting the attention it deserves - it\u2019s creamy and strong on the coconut milk - probably one of the best I\u2019ve eaten!\n\nTheir blue pea coconut rice is pretty interesting too: it kinda has the texture/flavour of the glutinous rice you find at the bottom of kueh salat haha and so it\u2019s stickier then usual and has a mild sweet fragrance to it.\n\nWould definitely dabao my lunches from here if I stay around the area. It\u2019s somewhat pricey but well, it does taste better than the other mixed veg rice options out there!\n\nMy perennial favorite hawker stall. The menu is wide. My favorites will be fried chicken wings, cod fish batter, bombs, fish otah. The curry gravy is heavenly. This is a place whereby you can have a decent meal at a decent price. My only grouse is that they should open more during the week.\n\nFriendly shop owner and reasonably priced. The Nyonya nasi lemak is a nice twist of the usual one with excellent chicken rendang. However, the sambal chilli isn\u2019t super spicy.\n\n\nOption: 6:\nName: Chilli Padi Nonya Restaurant\nAddress: 11 Joo Chiat Pl, #01-03, Singapore 427744\nPhone: 6275 1002\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.1\nReviews: \n\nOverall food was abit disappointing, more on the salty side.

Opposite was an open air parking, so no concern.\n\nGreat peranakan cuisine by far in the East side! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d love their assam fish & itik sio dishes, portions were generous too for a small serving. I have to say their dishes served there alludes warm & comforting home cooked food.\n\nThe food was excellent - well executed, good ingredients, served piping hot and fresh. Quick too.\n\nWe came as a family of four and ordered 7 dishes + 2 desserts. That was entirely too much food as the portions are generous, we could probably do with 1-2 dishes less.\n\nOrder consisted of:\n- Sambal squid\n- Laksa Goreng\n- Honey Pork Ribs\n- Fried chicken wings\n- Meatball soup\n- Egg & shrimp fried rice\n- Jackfruit curry\n\nDesserts were delicious also, and were portioned for individual consumption.\n\nOverall dining environment is pleasant - clean & comfortable. Service was quick, though staff could be slightly more attentive.\n\nI\u2019m already looking forward to our next visit \u2665\ufe0f\n\nI find their Nyonya food is nice overall, but a bit pricey. Portion is pretty small given the price, maybe due to inflation..\n\nPassed by a few times and always wanted to try it. Last week decide to eat this impromptu since we are around.\n\nIf u coming big groups it would be better to reserve in advance as they have to turn away groups due to no seating available.\n\nWe order all small portion of Babi ponteh, chap Chye, otah and kepeting soup.\n\nLove the Babi ponteh, chap Chye and soup. Good stuff with nice portion.\n\nOtah is disappointing. Taste not so heavy, nothing to shout about.\n\nOverall will come back again.

The dishes are more fusion-modern and bar-like. Food is generally appealing to taste buds, staff comes across as friendly, what I really love is the interior aesthetics and vibes.\n\nCertainly interesting for an experience, but perhaps not a return visit, and the prices tend to be a little high.\n\nService excellence goes to Marivel and Aeron. We had a great dining experience because of them.\n\nFood was great too! Kudos to the Chef!!!\n\nI couldn't say anything bad for the ambience of the restaurant as it bring more effect to the experience.\n\nHere for the four-hands collaboration and got to try dishes of very different cuisines. Very friendly staff and delicious food! Weekend lunch seems slightly crowded do make a booking if you can! There's a beautiful outdoor area that is pet-friendly!\n\nNice cosy Asian fusion restaurant in the heart of Katong with stunning casual interiors. We came on a weekday evening, and only 3-4 tables were occupied.\n\nWe had red wine and decided to have it along with the following :\n\n1) Chilli Crab Cake - Nice crispy croquettes that pairs well with the chilli crab sauce.\n\n2) Rendang Lasagna - Nice rendang sauce, that is not too fiery. Mix it well with the cheesy lasagna and you have a winner.\n\n3) Salmon main served on a bed of mash potato, some noodles and veggies.\n\nAs a guest of Hotel Indigo, we enjoyed their breakfast buffet and room service. The breakfast was included with our room rate so we took advantage and the staff was helpful to point out the vegan options and made us a veggie currie and roti to go with the buffet, we were full and taken care of. The fruit was a bit bland and the cappuccino was a bit bitter, but overall good variety for breakfast and we were full for hours.\n\nThe room service came in clutch after being exhausted after a long day of walking and shopping. We ordered the Assam Curry Seabass, the Chap Chae, Sauteed veggies, and jasmine rice - we didn\u2019t venture into the fusion dishes and kept it simple. Everything was flavorful, especially the Sea Bass, and it arrived quickly and piping hot, totally satisfying!\n\n\nOption: 8:\nName: Kim Choo Kueh Chang (Katong)\nAddress: 111 E Coast Rd, #109, Singapore 428801\nPhone: 6741 2125\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Information Not Available\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.1\nReviews: \n\nA must buy whenever I\u2019m around that area. The shop is very peranakan-ly done up. They sell a wide variety of traditional Nyonya Kuehs, Nyonya bak zhang(Dumplings), cookies and biscuits. They have mini Nyonya bak zhang too. I love the Nyonya and Salty ones!! Mini ones at $1.50, regular ones at $4.50. Fillings gao gao. Support local, you can even use Kris+, by Singapore airlines to make payment \ud83d\ude02\n\nCraving for Nonya Kueh, this is one of stalls is recommended online. But the taste was not up to my expectations.\n\nDuring Covid, I ordered the Bak Zhang via delivery. The glutinous rice was undercooked, so the dumpling were unpalatable. I do not have this issue when I buy the Bak Zhang from the shop. I like to eat Kim Choo Bak Zhang.\n\nWas gifted this by a friend and when I know it\u2019s from Kim Choo, you enjoy every moment because you know there\u2019s a bit of heritage, history, heirloom you are experiencing.\n\nThe glutinous rice layer breaks apart softly to reveal the filling with anticipation. One mouthful and you experience an alternating taste of sweet and savoury of the chinese five spice powder and lean pork.\n\nThere will be newer flavours; more exotic proteins; colours - and yes that should be the way.\n\nBut I take comfort that there is a homely version we can all return to.\n\n\u2018Kim\u2019 me the zhang cos I \u2018Choo\u2019 the original anytime.\n\nHaving bought from KCKC for years, it\u2019s generally has been ok to good but never quite hitting the 5 stars mark. Perhaps it\u2019s because they spread their products to include obvious 3rd party suppliers.

Went for the clay pot rice which was ok. My wife went for ban mian as mee hoon kway also sold out..Shouldn't such places cater for enough items if they want to do business... A go to place if you want a quick and fuss free meal.\n\nMy personal review, Malaysia Chiak stall at Singpost generally offers Penang fried kuey teow, a popular Malaysian dish. The overall experience at the stall may vary, but based on customer feedback, the taste and quality of their Penang fried kuey teow is usually average. It's always best to try it for yourself and form your own opinion based on your personal taste preferences.\n\nOverall I feel it\u2019s extremely value for money at $5.50. You get claypot chicken rice with a decent amount of chicken. The rice has a good char and there are tiny bits of salted fish. I think many people give flak about the minimal service but the price reflects the service. It\u2019s one of the cheapest full meals you get in the mall anyways. Not the best claypot rice in SG but definitely above average.\n\nChilli is definitely very good tho. It\u2019s like chicken rice chili but spicier.\n\nUsed to be good when it first started. Food quality and service have deteriorated over time. Recently did take away and the queue system was horrible, its disorganised and staffs are angsty with the need to order and cook... Ended up they did not separate the noodle and it was all soggy...there goes my lunch\n\n$5 Asam Laksa, pretty good taste, will come here again\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udcaf\n\n\nOption: 2:\nName: Geylang Serai Market and Food Centre\nAddress: 1 Geylang Serai, Singapore 402001\nPhone: None\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 6:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 6:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: Open 24 hours\nThursday: 6:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 6:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 6:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 6:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.3\nReviews: \n\nLarge variety of halal food. Great choices with authentic Muslim cuisine. Out of curiosity, tried the dry lontong which is quite good, something different. Reasonably priced.\n\nIconic market in the East... has 2 levels comprising the market and sundry stalls on the Ground level  offering a myriad  of grocery and  market items,  and Hawker dining and retail stalls offering apparel and household items on the Second level. Very crowded especially on weekends. Time for a major renovation to the market area and hawker dining area as it's very congested. A few hawker stalls on the 2nd level are \"Legacy Hawkers\" having existed in the old Geylang Serai Market 50 years ago or more.\n\nYesterday at Geylang Serai, saw charming  44 to 60 Changi Road, mixed commercial and residential shophouse enclave with a post-World War charm. Time seems to stand still here, offering a serene escape from the bustling cityscape. The slow pace of life allows visitors to immerse themselves in the traditional Malay culture and food that permeates the area. From the tantalizing aromas of Malay cuisine to the enchanting sounds of traditional music, Geylang Serai offers a nostalgic retreat, capturing the essence of a bygone era.\n\nAt Geylang Market, you can get almost everything down here. Now under this one stop roof, you can get food, marketing groceries, apparel, fruits & authentic traditional jamu also. Do spent time to wonder around this market be it at level 1 & 2.\n\nClean, spacious and airy (thanks to the high ceiling) hawker centre with many food stalls. Good for locals and tourists alike.\n\n\nOption: 3:\nName: Leong Kee (Klang) Bak Kut Teh\nAddress: 251 Geylang Rd, Singapore 389309\nPhone: 8022 8888\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 1 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 3.9\nReviews: \n\nThis malaysia styled bkt is the kind that I prefer, rather than Singapore's peppery kind. Ordered the mix soup which was not overpowering with herbs. Mixed intestines and parts were generous enough, and I like that the ribs are of smaller sizes that just falls off the bone and easy to eat. Despite eating at peak lunch hours, I hardly perspired. Price is reasonable and they accept visa which is a plus. Will try the dry version in the next visit\n\nOne of the best bkt!!! Love the soup and the chilli with garlic, so malaysia style. They allow refill of soup only once! The green vegetables so sweet and crunchy.\nThey have other food like frog porridge, small side dishes if you don\u2019t like the ribs.\n\nFirst time trying Malaysian style BKT, the herbal soup tastes quite different from Singaporean style. Both mutton and pork are delicious, port knuckle also soft n tender. Highly recommend the rice noodle which goes with the herbal soup very well\n\nnice Bak Kut teh with herbal flavour.\nThe mutton soup is also good, mutton meet is very tender.\ncrispy intestine is very unique with the spring onion inside. good texture.\nFriendly staff.\n\nHerbal style Bah Ku Teh (pork ribs and organ soup). Youtiao are soggy. We tried signature bah ku teh soup and dry versions and they are nice. We didn\u2019t enjoy the organs. You can also have frog dishes with porridge. A bit pricier in my view.

We were a bit confused initially as there were 2 entrances/exits. Recommended to split up such that some look for seats and some queue to order as the queue was rather long. Food wise, it is definitely worth the trip down. It was affordable, delicious and the service was great despite the crowd. There were 2 staff at the cashier who will help you to bring the food to your seats. We will definitely return to try other dishes on the menu!\n\nIt may seem daunting but here's what you should do when you come here:\n1) Find a table to chope\n2) Queue to order food\n3) Decide whether you want to order the different dishes to be eaten separately (medium or large size) or individually (on the 1 plate for 1 person).\n4) Share you order verbally with the staff who will assist to prepare your order\n5) Carry your plate to the cashier station nearby (note: if you need help to carry all the separate dishes, you can inform the staff the table number)\n6) Pay for your food & drinks\n7) Head to the drinks station to inform the staff to prepare your paid drinks and/or grab the canned/bottles drinks from the chiller.\n\nPersonally, today I ordered rice with terung balado, rendang daging, urap, bagedil & kuah lemak cili padi. It was a great meal for only $9.6. The beef rendang was sooo tender. The terung balado was cooked perfectly and it wasn't too oily. The urap was fresh. Bagedil was good as always. Lastly the lemak cili padi was flavourful.\n\nAfter the meal, I also grabbed some traditional Malay kuih for dessert, which costs $1.1 per slice.\n\nOften crowded. Today I went first thing in morning oh mine the nasi is 5 stars. I know breakfast i heavy\u2026 they have the best beef rendang,  Teh Tarik is not too sweet and polite staffs. I will definitely visit again soon!!\n\nSnaking long queues for the food with a little madness for weekend ordering, ample seating on 2nd floor. Had the tauhu telur, sotong, Ayam baker, sambal goreng. Hits all the right spots for comfort food for Singaporeans. Efficient service.\n\nThe Nasi Sambal Goreng set and Ayam Goreng rocks! Nasi Padang don\u2019t get much better than this in my opinion. Every dish served was delicious and flavorful. Lovely sambal belacan. Overall shiok. But the Goreng Pisang dough too thick and hard not delicate crispy.\n\n\nOption: 6:\nName: Penang Seafood Restaurant\nAddress: 32 Aljunied Rd, Singapore 389817\nPhone: 6841 3002\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nTuesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nWednesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nThursday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nFriday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nSaturday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nSunday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.1\nReviews: \n\nFood was served promptly despite us ordering quite a variety of food. There is a crab promotion that is going on. However,\nIt\u2019s kind of obvious that the crabs are not really that fresh, hence the pricing. Other dishes were quite tasty and value of money. The Kai lan vegetables were very tasty, a must order dish in my opinion. Barley tasted too sweet.\n\nIt is ideally situated close to the Aljunied MRT. You can choose between outdoor and air-conditioned sitting.\n\nOn various days, there are special promotions. They had $15 soon hock fish and $45 volcano chicken on Monday and Tuesday, respectively. For specials, give the restaurant a call before you visit.\n\nIt's a manual reservation, and you should ask the restaurant to text you a confirmation in case they accidentally forget your booking\n\nA good location for gatherings of friends and family.\n\nFood was generally good. The salted egg squid was excellent -- squid cooked to perfection and we actually tasted the salted egg! The pork belly was also very good -- flavorful and crispy-tender. Wasn't a fan of the crispy noodles, though. If you order that, ask if you can have the sauce separate so the noodles stay crispy. Also, one of the waiters threw a tantrum while we were there.\n\nI brought my wife for a good meal in Singapore and notice this simple restaurant along the street when I drive . Penang Seafood ...and we drop by for the seafood ..to our suprise that there had been a promotion to the crab . Price so worth for it. At $68 for 2 crabs.  Simply look at the size of the crab.....and it just so delicious \ud83e\udd24\n\nAll the dishes we picked were really good. Especially the spicy bee Hoon and baby squid garlic. They only take reservations for 6 pax and above. For small group walk-ins, come earlier at 6pm. Wait staff are friendly. Open-air Carpark opposite MRT and walk over.

Being a nasi lemak lover, the nasi lemak appealed to me immediately. Not only that it looks good, it taste even better - warm and fragrant coconut infused rice, fluffy fried egg, very crispy ikan bilis, and fried chicken wings that is aromatic and crispy. The chilli is perfect which is both sweet and spicy. It\u2019s so satisfying.\n\nSedap! One of the few authentic Malay cuisine stalls in this market selling Malay Kueh & traditional menu, like Mee Soto, Mee Siam, Lotong & etc. Serving breakfast & early lunch only. Irregular off day.

Their epok epok are damn shiok. Jack fruit fritters also shiok. Same quality but cheaper than their T3 branch.\n\nThere is a fantastic ayam penyet here, probably one of the best I've ever had. The chicken is moist and crunchy, and the sambal is extremely flavorful.\n\nThere is also a putu piring stall that is very much worth queuing for!\n\nI have no issue with the food choices here but the chairs are not good for big sized people. Too soft that the moment I sit, I can feel the legs start to spread. Sometimes I have to put an extra chair to make it sturdy. Can the management change the chairs, please?\n\nWhenever I am within the Geylang Serai area, Mr. Teh Tarik is one of my favorite places to go.\n\nWe went there to get our Hokkien mee and fried Kway Teow for lunch. It is near the entrance just beside the pisang goreng stall.\n\nAs always, the 2 dishes we ordered are Hokkien mee and fried kway teow. Ironically, although the menu is Chinese but the cook is of Indian heritage and he cooks it perfectly and fast too. You don't have to wait long to get your food.\n\nThe Hokkien mee was flavourful and not too soggy. Fresh prawns and ingredients. The Fried Kway Teow with clams is spot on too. The \"char\" taste is present with the right amount of sweet dark sauce.\n\nThen coupled with teh tarik to end your meal is so blissfully satisfying. Give it a try if you are nearby.\n\nWarung Syuhadah nasi lemak and nasi rawon taste wasn't nice. All 4 of my family agreed. Chicken was so dry and hard.

Authentic Indonesian food by three young Indonesian sisters who learnt the cuisine from their mom.  Their focus is on delivering quality creative and flavourful Indonesian dishes.  Portion is quite good.  Nice simple cosy cafe in the heartland with limited seating capacity.  Good to make reservations during peak time.  Hope to try more dishes next time!\n\nVery authentic Indonesian food.\n\nI ordered the oxtail soup and the grilled chicken.\n\nThe oxtail was so fall off the bone tender and bustling with amazing flavours.\n\nThe grilled chicken was very well grilled with a nice caramelized finish.\n\nLoved the chilli paste that came with the dishes. Rustic that comes with a punch.\n\nWill definitely be back for my Indonesian food fix!\n\nKeep up the good work!\n\nWent here on a Monday afternoon. Restaurant was very quiet. We ordered fried oxtail with rice, fried chicken with rice, corn fritters, ginger drink and rose drink (bandung). Oxtail was well-cooked but tasted a bit salty. Fried chicken was nicely cooked. I liked their new item, the corn fritters. Ginger drink was nice but could have been more flavourful. We liked the ambience but would have liked items to be more affordable. Place was also very stylish and posh looking but our cutlery kept making loud noises as we ate. Nice place to go once in a while.\n\nThis is my first time trying fried oxtail, I liked the juiciness of meat with a hint of salt. The traditional oxtail soup feels healthy without the overwhelming strong flavour compared to the others that I tried.\nA must-try is their signature ginger drink! Not spicy and smells so fragrant!!!\n\nI enjoyed the quiet ambience and the pleasant service. Gonna bring my whole family here the next time!\n\nGreat location with a multi storey carpark just beside the restaurant. Staff are very friendly and great with recommendations. Food comes freshly prepared and the sauce on the chicken was very flavorful and the soups they gave with each dish are also worthy as dishes themselves. They have quite a few oxtail options and those are definitely worth a try also.\n\n\nOption: 3:\nName: Tambuah Mas Indonesian Restaurant\nAddress: 1 Kim Seng Promenade, B1-110/111, Singapore 237994\nPhone: 6733 3333\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4\nReviews: \n\nQuite a wide range of dishes on the menu. Rendang was lean, and hence tougher than expected  though the taste was great. Gado Gado and tahu telur were pleasant, though the peanuts used in Gado Gado wasn't the most fresh tasting. Chicken satay was tender and not overgrilled, peanut sauce was good. Ikan pepes was nicely done. The yellow rice was fluffy, with long grains separating nicely. Overall, they seemed a bit short of staff. Sambal was good.\n\nFood was moderate. The food wasn\u2019t serve hot and the taste was okay. Felt really bloated after eating, immediately I knew food was prepared way earlier and not freshly cooked and serve. I have very sensitive gastric. To go back or not? Nah.\n\nThis is not the first time we dine at Tambuah Mas.  The food is good, quite authentic.  Service is not the best, probably due to shortage of staff and poor training.\n\nAuthentic Indonesian dishes, rich in flavour. The Tauhu Teloh is one of the best in town.\n\nThe experience from making reservation to dining was excellent. They were accommodating to our big group and the service during the dining pleasant. Food was good as usual. Highlight is the deep fried fish which was fresh and crispy. The beef rendang was a bit dry compared to what I had at the Tanglin Shopping Centre branch. But overall the food and service did not disappoint and we all enjoyed our dinner.\n\n\nOption: 4:\nName: Gading Street Food - 313@Somerset\nAddress: 313 Orchard Rd, B3-10A, 313@Somerset 238895\nPhone: 9838 3267\nDelivery Available: No\nDine-In Available: Information Not Available\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.3\nReviews: \n\nA gem that located at 2nd floor of Lucky Plaza. It's Indonesian kind of stall (depot makan). Couple times we tried their food and we found that their ayam geprek with sambal bali / matah is the must have item when you're here. The price was justify the taste and amount of the food.\n\nTheir fried boneless chicken was nice, the fragant rice and everything was in generous portion. We tried their other sambal but nothing can beat their sambal bali, the rice vermicelli toward hot & strong white pepper-y smell and taste.\n\nOne of the same staffs couple times looked so unfriendly, maybe too tired after working long hour but wore a mask still couldn't hide the look. Since the person's working in service industry he needs to spread the joy, welcoming spirit and friendliness.\n\nSince their sweet martabak is really sought after, it's better for you to order the sweet martabak in advance as they have a limited slot in a day.\n\nThey have launched a new menu in their new outlet and boy it was so good!\n\nI tried the Soto Betawi, which is a hearty beef soup simmered in a coconut milk based broth. Its light on the palate, not thick and the umami, they nailed it!\n\nOne of my new favorite Indonesian food eatery! I was so glad when I found out that I could order via whatsapp and arranged my own courier because I stay in the east and rarely got the chance to go Orchard. Tried almost everything in their menu and none was ever disappointing.\n\nMy favorites are soto betawi, ayam geprek, batagor and tempe bacem. My hubby and I are tempeh (soybean cake) lovers, so we love to try tempeh dishes every chance we got, and we never find tempeh bacem (seasoned tempeh) anymore in Singapore after the last eatery that had it closed down long ago. We were elated that Gading have it, and it was very very delicious! Sadly it was unavailable this time around, but it definitely become our must order dish. The ayam geprek is tender, generous portion and great with any kind of sambal, have tried the sambal mercon, kemangi and bali - all were amazingly good with different levels of spiciness. The soto betawi soup is so rich I always finish it till the last drop. And the batagor taste authentic and very nice, just that the portion is a bit small for its price.\n\nTried the martabak in two separate occasions, black charcoal (chocolate and cheese with charcoal dough) and classic (chocolate, cheese, peanuts). Had the classic one with add-on wijsman dutch butter at additional $4 and no peanuts. Both were amazing! Adding wijsman butter just made it even more delicious, the extra cost was a tad pricey though, maybe I\u2019d say it\u2019s worth it if it were $3 price point.\n\nOverall, Gading offers great Indonesian food that I will definitely love to order again and again.\n\nI was walking around 313@somerset when I saw this little shop at the basement. I was quite excited to see they are selling martabak (basically Indonesian version of pancake/min Jiang kueh that is more decadent and unhealthy). My normal go-to for martabak is pancake boss at Bugis so decided to give this one a try.\n\nI ordered the original and top up $4 for wijsman butter. Total damage is $19.90. A bit on the pricy side when compared to pancake boss. The martabak can easily feed 2-3 people (better to share due to high calories).\n\nThe martabak is delicious, sweet and a little salty from the cheese. They use good quality chocolate rice (much better than the one used by pancake boss).\n\nNice to see more martabak shops in SG (there is another martabak shop in ION Orchard but I have not tried it).\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this shop for your martabak fix.\n\nGive it 5 stars as the main course were so delicious. The ikan Bakar is nicely done with the kicap manis sauce. Ayam penyet is soft and tasty. Thank for serving us diff sambal as requested. We also ordered original martabak in advanced but the filling still abit bland.\n\n\nOption: 5:\nName: Warung Ijo\nAddress: 601 MacPherson Rd, #01-61 Grantral Mall Tai Seng, Singapore 368242\nPhone: 8857 8600\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: Closed\nTuesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:30\u202fPM, 4:30\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:30\u202fPM, 4:30\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.6\nReviews: \n\nSambal Petai King is to die for, it's so good you can just eat with plain white rice. Char Kway Teow is a chef's kiss, I'm not exaggerating, try it for yourself. Sambal fish is so-so,abit sweet ,not to my liking . Nasi Padang also not bad, consist of what I think is vegetarian chicken rendang,soy tofu,vege lemak lodeh and sambal egg belado.Orh luak with oyster mushroom is also good, not oily at all , taste on point , actually better than the real thing.Bak mie is tasty,noodle springy,mock shredded chicken is unnecessary,the fried wonton is good though,I settle with level 1 spiciness which to me is pretty hot. Satay is so-so,don't really taste like the real thing, tasted like regular deep fried mock meat, satay sauce can't mask save it either.\nService is super fast, 5 different person served us, all are very warm, friendly and are always smiling. Even though we came just 30 mins before their break time which is at 3pm.We feel welcomed!\n\nWe have never tasted Indonesian vegetarian, find the dishes not bad but nothing special. We ordered the Rendang fried rice, sanbal sweet potato leaves, otahs and gardo gardo. Find it pricey n felt the portion were not justified, especially the gardo gardo.\n\nMy first on an Indonesian take of vegetarian fare, as strongly insisted by the friend as a counter-proposal to my initial spot for vegetarian food. Small and cozy restaurant along the ground floor close to the entrance. Great spread of Indonesian food in vegetarian version if you are game for it.\n\nPlace is cooling, sheltered, and very accessible from the MRT.\n\nI had a wonderful experience at Warong Ijo!\n\nThis new outlet is located conveniently near the MRT making it more accessible.\n\nThe vegetarian dishes they offer are simply amazing \u2013 full of flavor and beautifully presented. The friendly staff made my visit even more enjoyable. It's not often you find a place that caters so well to vegetarians while providing top-notch service. I highly recommend trying their delicious dishes and soaking in the welcoming atmosphere.\n\nVery happy to come across this vegetarian restaurant!\n\nAll the dishes we had were full of flavors yet not too salty. I particularly like Orh Luak (oyster mushroom omelette), Lumpiah Goreng (spring rolls), and stir fried spinach.\n\nRendang lion mane mushroom was quite spicy and oily.\n\nSaturday dinner was very busy.

Food turned out DELICIOUS and surprisingly even the teh bing is yummy. Highly recommend this place to everyone! I only have two points for improvement to raise. The tahu telor was super salty. Skip this dish please. Also, unsure why the lighting was crazy dim. I could barely see what I was eating. Please turn up the lights! It didnt help the ambience, trust me. But overall, a wonderful meal.\n\nTasted wee bit on the sweet side otherwise ok.  Quality if rice bit too broken.  Lopez not bad teh tarik too dilute.  Pricing ok.\n\nLove the chicken rendang and sambal brinjal. The chicken rendang is rich in flavour and will give you the mmmmm factor!!  Beef rendang is also a favourite here though, I didn't order it.  For drinks, just order the teh botol.\n\nThe perks of eating here are no queues to wait in, and a fairly comfortable seating atmosphere, however, the food isn\u2019t as good as the ones on north bridge rd. The gravies and dishes fall short of a real oomph and flavor. Ok for a quick meal if in the area but I\u2019d rather opt for the real deal elsewhere.\n\n\nOption: 7:\nName: Bumbu Restaurant\nAddress: 44 Kandahar St, Singapore 198897\nPhone: 6392 8628\nDelivery Available: Information Not Available\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: Closed\nTuesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.4\nReviews: \n\nI like Bumbu restaurant\u2019s interior design, is unique and Peranakan decorating. Foods are nice and mouthwatering. I would recommend chili prawns, the gravy is flavourful. I will definitely come back to try other dishes! This place is suitable for company, family and friends gathering, why not?? There have set up the beautiful partition so it gives us privacy when dining.\n\nI recently had the pleasure of dining at Bumbu Restaurant in the Arab/Muslim neighborhood of Singapore, and it was a unique experience. The restaurant\u2019s decor is a refreshing blend of Thai and Indonesian antiques, which added a distinctive touch to the ambiance.\n\nThe food at Bumbu is a fusion of Thai and Indonesian flavors, which made for an interesting culinary journey. I ordered the Tom Kha soup, which was incredibly flavorful and packed with chicken. I also tried the Thai-style chili basil, although it was a bit on the salty side. The olive fried rice was a delightful addition to the meal.\n\nOne of the standout aspects of Bumbu was their excellent service. The staff was friendly and attentive, which enhanced the overall dining experience.\n\nIn conclusion, Bumbu Restaurant is definitely worth a visit if you\u2019re looking for a unique blend of Thai and Indonesian flavors in a beautifully decorated setting. I had a great time, and I believe you will too!\n\nHad a great experience here this evening! First time here and was impressed with the service and food quality. While the portions seemed a bit small, it allowed for us to order more variety! We tried the chicken buah keluak (love the spoons that came with the dish to help with the nut!), signature rendang, chap Chye, prawn egg, fish maw soup, and ended off with chendol! Everything tasted very authentic! We really enjoyed the sambal belachan too, which was complimentary! Will be back again to try more dishes in future! Service was excellent, and the interior was beautiful!\n\nDelicious Indonesian-Thai food in a beautiful IG-worthy restaurant! We enjoyed the dining experience here.\n\nNot much food pictures because too tasty and hungry to eat immediately. \ud83d\ude02\nJokes aside I appreciate their innovation and effort to making their dishes as they planned to taste as possible. I would say their dishes has many influences from Chinese, Malaysia, Indonesia, even Thailand. Very innovative.

Turns out, it's surprisingly good!\n\nThe Tahu Telor is a must-try for all! It's so difficult to get this dish nowadays at your neighbourhood hawker as it's quite labour intensive to make. Soft tofu cubes are deliciously coated in a big mound of egg, the tastiest parts being the flossy burnt ends. Add in a generous heaping of beansprouts, julienned cucumbers and carrots in tangy kicap Manis sauce. The peanut gravy was served separately, so that you can control the amount of sauce/ sweetness you want in your dish. We usually cannot finish a Tauhu Telor but as this didn't feel as oily and heavy, finishing it was a breeze. There wasn't a lot of oil leftover on the plate either.\n\nThe Sour Vegetable Soup is good as an appetizer or palate cleanser between heavy dishes. Cabbages, long beans, turnips and peanuts were simmered in a sweet-sour broth with flavours of tamarind, galangal, turmeric and shallots. It was refreshing but I found the peanuts undercooked and rather crunchy. Not sure whether I love or hate nuts done as such.\n\nThe Fried Pomfret was quite basic, it was lightly battered in some turmeric cornstarch and served with Spice Level 5 Fiery Chili. This dark coloured Chili gives quite a good punch unblocking my blocked nose but it was not strong enough to mask the fishiness of the fish. I felt that the pomfret was not super fresh as I could taste some staleness near its belly portion.\n\nLastly, we had the Mozzarella Smashed Chicken cutlet. The chicken meat was really tender and not dry at all, the bits of flour coating hanging on it was flavourfully soaked with mozzarella cheese, which was thrown atop the chicken and lightly torched before serving. We chose a Level 1 Sweet Chili to be served with it. This Chili is great for beginning spice eaters as it's super smooth and sweet with an oniony taste.\n\nThe smashed fried duck really came off easily when poked with a fork, we tried the Level 3 Shrimp Paste chili with it and the pairing turned out heavenly. I found the Level 3 chili a little sweeter than expected but it was well received by the others.\n\nThe Honey Marinated Beef Ribs were also thoroughly pre-simmered to achieve tenderness, although meat grain was slightly stringy and tough, the sweet kicap manis marinade made the dish whets up a good appetite and made it easier to swallow. The Level 2 Green Chili was one of the least sweet chili, with aromatic notes of coriander and green pepper.\n\nThe Teh Tarik Kosong Ice is really rich and good. It was full bodied with vanilla notes with a rich, milky mouthfeel.\nIt's a nice place to overindulge and grab a deep fried dinner. Cleanliness of the place could be improved. There were strands of hair and bits of batter on the benches we chose.\n\nWill revisit to try more dishes!\n\nTotal damage: $37-42 for 3 pax\n\nYummy Indonesian food.  Surprisingly good.  The chilli has up to 7 levels to be selected.\n\nWe ordered Ayam Bakar Taliwang Kampung (S$14.50), Iga Bakar (beef) (S$14.50), and Tahu Telor (S$8.50).  We opted for level 3 chilli which was spicy and good enough for our liking.\n\nWill definitely return for other food.\n\nUpdate as of 28 Oct 2022:\nTried the fried chicken, gado gado and my favourite tahu telor.  The chicken was nice.  As for the gado gado, it was just ok as it had the same gravy/sauce as tahu telor.\n\nPortion abit small but the taste is cook. Chicken are nicely fried and tender. Chilli Aso shiok but quite spicy\n\nRecommend to try!\n\nThere's a good spread of Indonesian dishes. The food was good. The asam rebus soup tasted good but could be better if they also use belinjau nuts and leaves (but I know it's not easy to find in Singapore). The tahu telor was also good but could be improved by having more tahu to attain a good balance between the tahu & telor. The grilled chicken was okay although the meat was a little dry; could be a bit more juicy and moist and tasted better if fresh chicken was used instead of frozen chicken. The fish (tilapia and pomfret) dishes were my favourite. The fish meat was juicy and tender whilst the exterior was crispy and well prepared. I will visit again and will want to try their equivalent of beef bakso and other dishes also. Well done guys!\n\nA little too pricey. $10.30 for 1 ayam penyet (takeaway). Rice was also charged. Taste of the food was not great. I will stick to the good old ayam penyet ria or president in the future.\n\n\nOption: 9:\nName: Rumah Makan Minang Pte Ltd - Kandahar Street\nAddress: 18 & 18A Kandahar Street, 198884\nPhone: 6977 7064\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20097:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20097:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20097:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20097:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20097:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20097:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20097:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.3\nReviews: \n\nCame all the way from KL for a work trip and stopped by this resto for a good lunch.\n\nThe food is tasty, we took a few lauk lauk with rice. The tauhu goreng was good, and it deserves another repetition the next time I stop by Singapore.\n\nFood portion is good. Could be a lot if you\u2019re not a big eater. But still worth it and your tummy will thank you \ud83e\udd23\n\nThey have outdoor seatings as well as air conditioned area upstairs. You have to order at the counter first. It could be quite busy during lunch hour, but worth the wait for the food !\n\nSpoiled by choices, vast selection of mains and side dishes on display. Tried a handful of dishes and most of them are fragrant and tasty. Their vegetable side dishes were also well executed. Kind of slightly salty for me.\n\nHowever, prices here are at a premium, especially with the limiting portion served. Good authentic nasi padang with their main customers observed as tourist during my visit. Not a meal to be enjoyed daily at this price point. And especially during lunch time, the hot weather is a push away factor for me to revisit.\n\nRumah Makan Minang Pte Ltd is one of the best Malay food restaurants I have ever been to. This hidden gem located on Kandahar Street serves authentic nasi Padang that is so tasty, you will be dreaming about it for days after. The menu offers a lot of selection, but be prepared to wait in line as the dishes can run out quickly.\n\nThe restaurant's atmosphere is cozy and welcoming, and the staff members are friendly and accommodating. I highly recommend trying their Rendang and Soto Ayam, which are so flavorful and cooked to perfection. The dishes are served fresh and hot, and the portions are generous.\n\nThe only downside is that the restaurant is quite popular and sometimes can be crowded, so I suggest getting there early or being prepared to wait in line. Overall, if you're looking for authentic Malay food that is both delicious and affordable, Rumah Makan Minang Pte Ltd is the place for you.\n\nI came here a few times and the queue really speaks for how popular this place is. The fun starts with queuing and ordering the food. It\u2019s also good to come here in a bigger group, so you get to savour the various dishes. My favourite is the tender beef rendang and the tauhu telur. Their best part is that there is an air-conditioned seating area on level 2 that is accessible by a staircase at the side.\n\nI've eaten malay cooking for aeons; the taste and flavours of each kind of dish are ingrained in my DNA. Sadly, for such a popular name as Minang, the food is poor in taste and very pricy. For the lunch I had, it cost me $45 sgd.\nThere are many small stalls in foodcourt that can rival this restaurant.\nThe taste is just not up to standard, lack of salt, flavour and richness of Malay cooking. If its about healthy living, there are alternatives that they can add to maintain the standard. Like KFC, McD, they remain consistent throughout the eras... if these big names can do it, so can they.\n\n\nOption: 10:\nName: Ayam Penyet President\nAddress: 1 Stadium Pl, #01 - 23, Singapore 397638\nPhone: None\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 3.9\nReviews: \n\nl I must say, this place is one of the best spots to savor a delicious plate of Ayam Penyet. I tend to opt for their BBQ chicken over the fried version, simply due to personal preference. While their service might come across as blunt, it's undeniably efficient. And let me tell you, their fried tofu is a must-try; it's a personal favorite of mine. The self-serving free flow of soup is a major plus. Price-wise, it's a bit on the higher side, typically exceeding $15. All in all, if you're in the area, it's definitely a great choice to relish some Ayam Penyet!\n\nSurprise, surprise, we didn't expect much at all, thinking it was just another average restaurants, we were so delighted we had one of our most memorable dining experiences.\nThe grilled chicken, satays, beef rendang, were cooked to perfection! This was the closest thing to eating in Jakarta. The price is reasonable too, this will be our favorite to eat when we crave Indonesian food.\n\nGood food. Self serve soup. Good variety of options to choose from. Fairly good portion side. The grill beef feels quite dry for me but the rest was good. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f good serve fairly quickly.\nHave good seatings for group. Maybe just me but it\u2019s was a bit warm inside the restaurant. Not a bad feed but I expected better? Reasonable price for the location.\n\nThe fried chicken and beef rendang were delicious ( with ooomph!).  Gado gado was ok but the tahu telor can definitely be improved, perhaps because it was reheated and not freshly prepared.\n\nYummy Ayam Penyet and other Is Indonesian dishes at affordable prices.\n\nThe chicken was succulent and crispy without being greasy. The accompanying tofu and tempeh were very good too. Tofu was soft on the inside and tempeh was crispy. The catfish was very generously sized. Overall, I would say the portions were generous.\n\nOnly dish that was a a bit of a letdown was the kangkong which was a little soggy. Still, we will return for other dishes.\n",

Food available suits even my picky nephews \ud83d\ude05\n\nWe always order the curries and toufu, and pastas for kids. \ud83d\ude0b\n\nShiok!!!! Impressive food place. As an Indian vegetarian, I enjoyed every bit of it. The food order can be altered even to suit vegans. Don\u2019t miss this place must try place for everyone locals as well as tourist, don\u2019t forget to try Singapore delight food Laksa.\n\nThe restaurant is located just opposite the Beauty World MRT station. We had lunch (3pax) on a Saturday and it wasn't too crowded. Service was prompt and polite, prices were reasonable. We loved all the dishes (bitter gourd in black bean sauce, fried egg & tomatoes, steamed tofu) except for the deep-fried sweet and sour mushroom, which wasn't exceptional (more chewy than crispy). They have a good selection of infused rice and serve different hot and cold beverages (including BBT). Recommended!\n\nwas there at 9.15pm, we know your last order 9.30pm and the cafe has no crowd.\n\nHmmm perhaps your boss earn enough for today and you suggested us to take away instead?\n\nQuite disappointed and decided to travel else where to fill our hungry tummy instead.\n\nI will reconsider whether will want to visit your place again if given the choice.\n\nNice vegetarian food! The Nasi Lemak has a nice flavour on the rice, though not overly done, chilli goes with this dish in my opinion. The ngoh hiang is a bit hard but the taste make up for it. If you don't like too hard stuff, maybe you want to skip this dish. Toufu has a great mixed of sauces. Claypot rice looks better than the taste though, so I'll skip this next time, as I'm one with heavy taste. Cereal \"prawn\" is very well done, such that I can just go with cereal and rice if need to. Overall, this place has enough dishes and set meal to cater to most, so I'll not take any stars off, especially the ambience and service is well above average.\n\n\nOption: 2:\nName: Vegetarian Food\nAddress: 51 Upper Bukit Timah Rd, Singapore 588172\nPhone: None\nDelivery Available: Information Not Available\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20098:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20098:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20098:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20098:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20098:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20098:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20098:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 0\nReviews: \n\n\nOption: 3:\nName: Original Sin Restaurant\nAddress: 01-62 Jln Merah Saga, Chip Bee Gardens, Blk 43, Singapore 278115\nPhone: 6475 5605\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:45\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:45\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:45\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:45\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:45\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:45\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:45\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 3 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.3\nReviews: \n\nGreat food, since many years ago.

We really enjoyed the meal, the ingredients were good quality and food was prepared with care. However, did feel the halloumi was a bit too salty.

Didn\u2019t really enjoy the rose though.\n\nService - prompt service and the staff were polite and friendly\n\nWould definitely return again.\n\nYou won't believe how rare it is to have a Mediterranean vegetarian place that has so many allium free options, including the Pizzas. Glad to see original sin survive the pandemic when many didn't.\n\nThe Moussaka and Mediterranean pizza were good, though a little too salty but that's probably just me. Nice ambience for a date with friends or the significant other, especially over a good conversation. You pay for the quality. Enjoy!\n\nWonderful and classy vegetarian restaurant.

Tea soup is basil based and kind of resembles Thai green curry in taste minus the coconut milk.\n\nAll the ingredients they used are very fresh and tasted delicious as a whole. The tea soup might seem little at first but the amount given is just right.\n\nLooking forward to trying the Bee Hoon set next time!\n\nDo come support the lesser known dishes in Singapore!\n\nFirst time trying leicha, was curious about how the tea would taste. Opted for kosong set and was amazed how FULL i was 60% into my bowl. I enjoyed all the crunch factors from celery (i think), beans, peanuts (the best imo). The tofu was soft and yummy.  The portion is really generous.\n\nThe tea...is not what i was expecting. It's like an acquired taste for me, i cant say i like it when i first tried. It's more of getting used to that taste. Would continue trying leicha elsewhere to compare how different/similar it can be.\n\nOverall the whole bowl has a light taste, not too heavy nor salty. Enjoyed my meal!\n\nUsually takeaway, but the thunder tea will be better if thicker and more cencentrated. Can't even ask for me to go with the rice, the amount is not enough to complement the rice and veg.\n\nVery good taste amongst the rest I have tried. Good find if you want something healthy from this hawker centre. Something nutty yet Asian in flavour.\n\nSo yummy and wholesome. A bit pricey but worth it. Balanced flavours with generous portions of veggie and taukwa, complete with beans (more protein!) and crunchy peanuts~ requested for thunder tea paste since this was a takeaway, and I added my own water to it. On the saltier side, though I guess this is common, so I added more water to balance out the taste a bit. Still very tasty though.

The food worth 2 stars. The meat was pretty hard, the starter was too sour. The dessert was really not able to match our taste. The house wines was tasteless, but the red wine taste better when it pair with the meat. I will strongly recommend you only order the red if you want to have their one for one house wine promo.\nOur bill was $128, you can get a much more better grilled meat platter and better food at other restaurants. :)\n\nLe Rida has a rustic ambience somewhat akin to an old time eating house in a small town. Quaint and homely\nFreshly baked pita bread with lemon chick pea hummus was delicious and filling\nMains of Lebanese lamb kafta kebab had the right balance of flavour and crunchiness.\nWash it all down with 1 for 1 Heineken draft at $17.90\n\nManager Sanjiv was both friendly and helpful in his recommendations and unlike in some establishments, he did not push you to over order.\nDefinitely worth a return visit!\n\nDidn't think the food was thaaaat amazing. Nor was the service. But at least they let us drink outside drinks.\nHOWEVER, i requested for no garnishing on my hummus. When the guy brought it over, there WAS parsley on it. And all he said was \"just pluck it out\". --.--\nSo if i was allergic to that, i should just pluck it out.... nice. The hummus wasn't good either. I've tasted better. Like a friend who went with me commented... it isn't creamy enough. Also, comments about the baklava was that it was too hard... and wasn't good.\n\nAbsolutely loved the food, I am heavily into Mediterranean food. I have tried most of the places around Bugis as well. The food here was so fresh, with perfect taste and presentation. It was completely worth it travelling from East.\nThe service was quick, the portion size was generous . We ordered mezze plateer and tabalu salad. They were scrumptious loved the customised heart shaped Pita bread. Hummus, was so creamy and so were all other dips.\n\nWould strongly recommend.. It has become one of my favourite place..\n\nEnjoyed a lovely evening with family and doggie. Food is nice and the 1 for 1 drinks promo is good too.\nLoved the dips platter and mixed grill with different meats\nThe pita bread is nice and soft and goes well with the hummus.\nGreat thing is that we can have our dog to eat with us....ha,ha, perhaps more like watch us eat. \ud83d\ude06\nStaff is friendly and helpful.

It tasted okay but maybe \u201ccoconut chocolate\u201d would be a more realistic name? The burger tasted great but the sweet potato portion was very very little:( and was a tad bit dry wish it came with sauce or something. I probably would come back again even though it\u2019s a bit expensive but normal cafe price haha. Probably will wanna try other raw cakes but the tiramisu just didn\u2019t cut it..\n\nGreat place if you need to do some work.  Wifi is available, and it's not very noisy.  Only 2 tables have a power point nearby that I can see though.\n\nWe went on a Sunday morning, foodwise there's many vegan options. Not very familiar with vegan and gluten free but I felt the food were very gentle to the palate unlike ur usual hawker fare.\n\nAtmosphere were great, staff services is great an not too crowded. I would think its a great experience and food combination is well thought out.\n\nLacks generosity!! I\u2019ve been 4 times to the living cafe & each time I came back feeling dissatisfied & hungry. Not because I can\u2019t order another main dish but it doesn\u2019t make sense - what\u2019s the point? The menu is great but the portions are restricted. We ordered for 2 people, vegan wrap, veggie delight pizza (barely any vegetables) & some deserts. Ask for the sauce & you are asked to pay $3 on top. I prefer to be charged on the dish & I\u2019m happy to pay $25 instead of $20 but serve me a well thought wholesome plate please.\nI think there\u2019s a misconception that Vegan people don\u2019t need much food despite paying more for their dishes.\nMost of the deserts contain honey, so they are out of bounds for vegans.\nHopefully some heart is put in to this great place to make it feel more warm \ud83c\udf40\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\n\nFood was pretty good but the cappuccino with soy milk and beer root latte with oat milk were terrible. Prices were OK for the high quality ingredients but service was almost nonexistent other than putting food on my table (ordering and payment was done online and no drinking water was provided). Cafe was rather cosy but not good for gathering as customers have to leave after just 1h 15 min (despite it being half full on a Sunday during brunch time). Also, you HAVE TO provide both mobile number and email address for ordering, which is an involuntary release of private data just for a meal. \ud83d\ude05\n\n\nOption: 10:\nName: Guan Yin Vegetarian\nAddress: 144 Upper Bukit Timah Rd, #04-41, Singapore 588177\nPhone: None\nDelivery Available: Information Not Available\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20094:45\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20094:45\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20094:45\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20094:45\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20094:45\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20094:45\u202fPM\nSunday: Closed\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.4\nReviews: \n\nRice was basic.

Nice ambience next to the beach with comfortable sea breeze. As for the food, black pepper crab was fine. Fried yam with scallop didn't taste freshly fried which was disappointing compared to what i tasted previously at the Ion outlet. Hor fun was decent. Mocha pork rib was the highlight here with the pork rib crisp on the outside and the meat tender plus a strong coffee flavour.

The chilli crab could be a tad spicier. I hope they didn\u2019t tone down the spice level for the many tourists who dine there. Their mocha pork ribs was super delish and tender. Everything was tasty!\n\nExcellent tasty chilli crab, the flavour is very good and delicious, not too spicy. Other dishes are really worth to try too.

Overall the food is awesome but somehow we don\u2019t seem to enjoy the Canada crab.. the service is also top class as they are friendly and serve us well. Keep it up!\n\nCame here because there\u2019s a queue for Jumbo beside this restaurant. Decided to give it a try as this place\u2019s quite busy too. We were ushered to a table but then it\u2019s hard to get the servers\u2019 attention when we were about to make orders.\n\nWe ordered the Canadian chili crab as recommended by the server and it didn\u2019t disappoint. The crab was huge and fleshy where I craved for more of it as the chili sauce was so good. We even ordered mantou buns to dip in the sauce and it\u2019s delicious.\n\nThe steamed fish was delicious as the flesh was soft and flavorsome. The razor clams with minced meats and vermicelli were fresh and flavorful. I liked the noodles with oysters too especially the crispy bits of the topping.\n\nI had a fantastic experience at this restaurant! The food was absolutely superb, and the service was top-notch. During my visit for lunch, I had the pleasure of trying both the chili and pepper crab dishes. The crab meat was incredibly fresh, and the dark pepper sauce was a standout\u2014it paired perfectly with the crab. To end on a sweet note, I indulged in the mango coconut dessert, which was not only beautifully presented but also impressively layered. I highly recommend this place for an unforgettable dining experience!\n\nI've been here twice, and both times are good. Food is tasty, especially love the Irish duck and white pepper crab. The staff are friendly but not attentive as it seems like they are very short-handed. Overall, the experience is enjoyable, and I will be back.\n\nNo matter how tight is your schedule in your Singapore visit, you have to try the crab plate in Long Beach UDMC. UDMC is rightfully famous for its delicious black pepper crab, the plate that I ordered there. The crab is cooked tender, and the sauce is incredible. This was my first time eating a crab and I am definitely not disappointed.\n\nI should warn my European friends that the price rates are quite high in this restaurant, the prices are excluding tax (US style) and no service in the restaurant is free (even tissues).\n\nI recommend Long Beach UDMC for visiting once but only once\n\n\nOption: 3:\nName: Lagoon BBQ Seafood\nAddress: 396 E Coast Rd, #394 396, Singapore 428994\nPhone: 6246 4838\nDelivery Available: Information Not Available\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: Closed\nThursday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4\nReviews: \n\nGrub \ud83c\udf5b\ud83c\udf5b\ud83c\udf5b\ud83c\udf5b\nDricka \ud83c\udf7b \ud83c\udf7b \ud83c\udf7b\nPrice \ud83d\udd2a \ud83d\udd2a\nVibes \ud83c\udfee \ud83c\udfee \ud83c\udfee\nService \ud83d\ude47 \ud83d\ude47 \ud83d\ude47 \ud83d\ude47 \ud83d\ude47\nParking \ud83c\udd7f \ud83c\udd7f \ud83c\udd7f \ud83c\udd7f\nOverall \ud83c\udfc6 \ud83c\udfc6 \ud83c\udfc6 \ud83c\udfc6\n\nSze-Char with highball \ud83e\udd43, beer or stout from tap.

It was really very good, firm to chew, crispy and delicious. Very addictive. Sambal stingray was fresh, meat was tender. Sambal was spicy enough too. Definitely worth a try!\n\nWe used to love the BBQ stingray from this stall. This time round, we ordered the stingray $20 and blood cockles $8. The cockles didn\u2019t taste fresh. The stingray also didn\u2019t taste as good and fresh as before. My friend and I who ate the cockles had  diarrhea the next day. I don\u2019t recommend this stall anymore.\n\nFirst time trying the food from this stall, usually we have a specific stall that we always go to but decided to give other stall a try this time round.  Quite surprised that they are Halal certified, so its Muslim friendly. Menu is pretty extensive, can cater to different tastebud. Like most stalls over here, they have bbq seafood as well.\n\nOrdered 3 dishes, sambal stingray, Kailan in oyster sauce and an onion Omelette. Food took about 15mins to 20mins to be ready. Taste wise, not bad but there is room for improvement. One thing I didn't really like was that the food was already cold when served. My guess, was due to waiting for all the dishes to ready and served together and as a result the food turn cold.\n\nOverall, food was acceptable. Not really sure if i would return though.\n\nCockles stank of mud. Inedible. Will not recommend. Hoping we will not fall sick tonight!!\n\nSuper yummy mee goreng and loaded with flavour!

Salted egg Sotong is crispy and nicely flavoured! Would come back to try other dishes.\n\nTasty pepper crab. Live fresh crab and good size. Reasonable price with very good service. Highly recommended to seafood lovers.\n\nThe only place I go to for seafood, it\u2019s always consistent and reasonably priced. Would recommend their cereal prawn, black pepper crab and steamed fish. No regrets, only regret over ordering and not being able to finish all the good food.\n\nMy go to stall when I am at east coast and have craving for some seafood. One of my favorite dish from there is the bbq stingray. The sambal chilli is very good - spicy and have a good aroma. Stingray is fresh and generous! The okra goes very well with the sambal also!

Supposedly creator of chili crab. Tried both kind of chili crab with and without eggs, it was different and nice not so ketchup taste n less starchy. We had the fried fish with Thai mango sauce, good! Crispy US duck was good, tender n skin was crispy.\n\nSuperb dinner and seafood experience with the work team. Everything was done excellently. Deep fried baby squid, duck, Cereal prawns, fish and crabs. Amazing. Will want to come back again with family.\n\n16 Jul 2023: back here to celebrate mum BD. Nice food, firm meaty crabs and excellent service. Tried the curry fish head as it was birthday girl's favourite.\n\nI love the old school vibes here! Traditional Chinese restaurant set in the 80s! This place has been around since 1956, and the food is great! Service is also good! Love the chilli crab here and they are apparently the creators of this iconic dish! We had Buddha jump over the wall soup, baby kailan, chilli crab with mantou, and a fried mee sua. What a memorable and amazing experience! Will definitely be back again soon! We also got to say hi and bye to the friendly founder and owner on our way out!\n\nNice food n great service. The boss is always friendly n welcoming. My gal loves the Chili Crab n it\u2019s always a must have dish on the table for her when she goes to Roland Restaurant.\n\nOne of the old school Chinese restaurants that the entire extended family goes to over the years during special occasions. Has nice Tim sum and Chinese cuisine. 5 stars for sentimental value and nostalgia. Good to know that the restaurant is still around after all these years.\n\nFamily had a 10 course meal to celebrate a few birthdays.\n\nCold dish was so so. Would prefer sliced lobster with mayonnaise to lobster balls among other things.\nLotus paste bun was ok, but it is always fun to have it styled as longevity peaches which are linked to Chinese mythical stories.\nBuddha jumps over the wall was nice, but every individual soup pot ingredients are non-uniform.

Crispy! \ud83d\ude0b\nRazor/Bamboo clams were delicious.\nAsparagus was decent.\nDrunken prawns were ok.\nChilli crab is the signature dish with fried Mantou buns which are a childhood favourite. \ud83e\udd29\nSteamed pomfret was good.\nUS duck was yummy.\n\n\nOption: 9:\nName: Lai Huat Signatures\nAddress: 17 Upper E Coast Rd, Singapore 455208\nPhone: 6448 9077\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.1\nReviews: \n\nYummy food and the price is not too expensive. Love the deep fried fish with sambal chilli, super crispy! Hor fun has good wok hei too.\n\nHad lunch - boss mee sua, coffee ribs, prawn rolls, fish maw soup, crispy sotong, cai Po tofu. Pretty standard zhi char food. Good quality and tasty. Best dish would be the crispy sotong. Boss mee sua below average.\n\n$50 for grouper hotpot with 8 slices of fish filet and lots of fish parts in the soup. Really nice. When I was there, I think every table ordered this so a must have. $12 for the prawn paste chicken. Nice with the soup if you like meat. Best thing is no corkage charge for wine lovers with dinner. Bad thing is 10% service charge on bill. You need to tell the helpers 2-3 times to do something. Like..can i have a soup-base refill. Can I order now? So the service charge is really not for service but to pay the staff, which is fine but when it is added automatically onto your bill for ok service, you feel somewhat disappointed. Nevertheless, the food is good and people/staff is quite nice. Overall, I will be a repeat customer.\n\nWe were taken to this restaurant by our Singaporean friend on a weekend trip. The food and atmosphere were great, and the price was reasonable. The signature chilli fish tasted amazing. The service was outstanding - friendly waiters. The restaurant is about 20 minutes drive from the city centre.\n\nLoved the red grouper fish steamboat. Tasty broth with deep fried yam, spinach and cabbage with fresh slices of grouper fish.  Sambal kangkong was good, balanced flavour of spiciness, and saltiness from the haebee.\n\n\nOption: 10:\nName: Hua Yu Wee Seafood Restaurant\nAddress: 462 Upper E Coast Rd, Singapore 466508\nPhone: 6442 9313\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.4\nReviews: \n\nOur very regular dining place.

Make sure you reserve your table as no way to get a table if you walk-in.\n\nManaged to do a last minute booking, place was crowded, got a table in the air con section, was a bit noisy\u2026overall the food was nice, special mention was the drunken prawns, prawns were fresh and big.. crunchy and juicy..\n\nOne of the better seafood restaurants that you can get in the east in a very traditional setting. Food is fresh even for takeaway. There is a discount off the price on the menu for takeaway as the prices in the menu seems to include service charge. By the way, the yam paste is not too bad!\n\nA hidden gem of a restaurant. This place screams tradition and serves up classic Singaporean Chinese dishes in the most authentic and old school way you can think of. Everything is amazing but be sure to try to the chilli crab, roast chicken, hor fun and yam paste dessert. Free valet parking is included.\n\nVisited this seafood restaurant with friends and family during my stay in Singapore. The food was absolutely delicious with their speciality being the \u201cchili crab\u201d I also managed to try their coffee ribs which were absolutely divine. The silver fish fried rice was definitely worth trying which is a type of salt fish mixed in with the rice. The Hor Fun was also great, so from a good perspective it was all exceptional. The seating is set outside with large tables and although it did feel kind of warm there were plenty of fans to help combat the heat.\n",

Genuinely impressed at how smooth everything was. Food (chicken wings and steak) were spot on too.

Large food menu for dinner (starting at 4pm). Large drink menu too with many options for tap and bottle beer, wine, cocktails.\n\nFood was delicious, well priced with decent size portions. Scallops and Beef Wellington were my top picks however If I'd gone again a steak was next on the hit list. Looking for a warm and cosy venue on a cold night?

The food was incredibly delicious, and the atmosphere was very inviting. However, the service left much to be desired; they weren't particularly friendly or attentive. Don't miss out on their amazing bread!\n\nThis was really disappointing! First, the owner asked if we want sparkling water. We asked for tap water. We were given bottled water and charged $5. We thought it was law that drinkable water is free, or at least cheap. Second, we were given a small table next to the door which had freezing air flowing in. I politely checked if we could change a table as there were three free ones. The owner almost yelled \u201cno\u201d and walked away. The other tables would have been good. Third, the seafood pasta I ordered was awful! It tasted no flavor, the white sauce was just cream, no garlic or wine or oil, and I found heaps of celery in it. It\u2019s just weird. The pizza had lots of fresh toppings but needed seasoning. We paid $105 for a beer, a juice, a water, a pasta and a small pizza and we opted not to tip.\n\nYeah that famous garlic bread is famous for a reason, so delicious! They have half portion options for their food which is so great! Also fun to add to the chalk walls in the bathrooms\n\nGood hearty food in a rustic old style farmhouse. We had the portofino pizza (highly recommended), spaghetti bolognese (a classic done well) and the spaghetti with chicken livers (delicious). Portions were decent sized and good enough to share. Prices are on the high end but that's pretty much what to expect when in Queenstown.\n\nThey don't take reservations, so just show up early and put your name down for a table. Service is efficient and food is out pretty quickly.\n\nThey \u201csurprised\u201d us by adding celery to our Her Majesty\u2019s Pleasure pizza?? It was disgusting and not anywhere on the menu or list of ingredients. They need to tell customers before adding random ingredients to their order \u2014 especially with pizza that has specific listed toppings so you can customize.\n\nThe bolognese sauce on our second pizza still had whole bay leaves still in it, which are inedible.\n\nAlso, this is the only restaurant we\u2019ve visited in Queenstown that makes you to pay $12 for water instead of offering free boiled tap water.\n\n\nOption: 4:\nName: Botswana Butchery\nAddress: 17 Marine Parade, Queenstown 9300, New Zealand\nPhone: 03 442 6994\nDelivery Available: No\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 12:00\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nTuesday: 12:00\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nWednesday: 12:00\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nThursday: 12:00\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nFriday: 12:00\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nSaturday: 12:00\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nSunday: 12:00\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\n\nPrice Level: 3 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.6\nReviews: \n\nCame here about 2 times.\n\nAbsolutely loved our dining experience here.

We even got a complimentary dessert which made our day! Was seeking a quality steak all week long and I finally found it! This is the place to go to for sure!!!\n\nHighly recommend Botswana. Service was great and the food was amazing. We had the crispy squid, lamb loin, t-bone steak and eye fillet with sides and they were superb and the pudding for dessert was delish.\n\nGreat dining experience on a cold, snowy day. Beautifully cooked whole NZ lamb shoulder served with absolutely perfect duck fat potatoes - crispy on the outside, soft in the middle and hot. We ordered the seasonal vegetables which was asparagus with hollandaise sauce; again, very tasty. The slow cooked lamb was served on a warmed plate accompanied by a nice jus and mint jelly on the side. Able to carve it with a spoon - cooked to perfection. Staff were great, the experience exceeded our expectations.\n\nThe truth is, I had no idea what I was getting myself into. My best friend booked this restaurant, a couple of months ago.\nMy God, the food, the food, the food! we had a great selection of entrees (the octopus is to die for). For mains, I had the Wagyu, medium and it was phenomenally cooked. For dessert, I had the pudding, and I could taste the apricots. In terms of atmosphere, it felt like I was in France. Very rustic, very old school, but felt like I was a king, if you have an opportunity to eat here, do it!\n\n\nOption: 5:\nName: Lombardi Restaurant\nAddress: 10/18 Brunswick Street, Queenstown 9300, New Zealand\nPhone: 03 442 4990\nDelivery Available: No\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 7:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 7:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 7:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 7:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 7:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 7:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 7:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.3\nReviews: \n\nWe recently dined at Lombardi in Queenstown and had a truly delightful experience. The variety of dishes we tried left us thoroughly satisfied. We savored the mouthwatering medium rare beef, the succulent confit duck, and the flavorful salt and pepper calamari. The catch of the day was unfortunately not up to par, but the attentive staff promptly resolved the issue when we had to send it back.\n\nTo accompany our main courses, we indulged in the delectable polenta fries, which, while a bit lackluster in taste for our liking, were still enjoyable. The Caesar salad provided a refreshing and tangy addition to our meal.\n\nFor dessert, we were treated to the heavenly trio sorbet and the classic cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e. Both desserts were prepared with finesse and left us longing for more. What made our dining experience truly memorable was the personalized dessert arranged for my dad by the kind and attentive staff. It truly showed their commitment to providing exceptional service.\n\nOver the years, Lombardi has received numerous awards for its outstanding culinary offerings and impeccable service. The restaurant has consistently been recognized for its commitment to quality, earning accolades that showcase their dedication to excellence.\n\nIn conclusion, Lombardi in Queenstown is a must-visit for anyone seeking a memorable dining experience. From the mouthwatering beef and amazing duck to the flavorful calamari, the restaurant's menu boasts a range of delightful options. Though a couple of dishes fell short of expectations, the exceptional service and attention to detail more than made up for it. Lombardi's well-deserved accolades reflect their commitment to providing a remarkable dining experience.\n\nCelebrate my birthday here last march.

It also had a nice cosy & fancy restaurant feel to it during the dinner service.\n\nThe service by Kyle was fantastic, friendly & attentive.\n\nWe ordered:\n- the soup of the day (pumpkin) \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc\n- seared scallops with octopus \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc\n- fish of the day \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc\n- bakes lasagne \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc\n\nStandout dish was the baked lasagne for me & would fly back here just for that (& the views)! Having said that all the dishes were fantastic & well flavoured.\n\nThey also had daily specials & happy hour. The mulled wine was tasty as well!\n\nKeep up the good work!\n\n\nOption: 6:\nName: Flame Bar & Grill\nAddress: 88 Beach Street, Queenstown 9300, New Zealand\nPhone: 027 349 4469\nDelivery Available: No\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.5\nReviews: \n\nIt\u2019s a nice place to have a meal. Decent view of the wharf through the windows. Free clean filtered water (some venues don\u2019t have this). The steak and ribs were nice (ribs especially were good value). The lamb was nice but slightly over cooked. I recommend this place and would try it again.\n\nWe love this place so much we went twice! Lovely views here too. Order the steak. Medium rare.  Lamb skewer. The yummy flavoured chips! And the tiramisu brownie! I\u2019d love to return here one day\u2026\n\nWent for dinner on a Monday night. Service was excellent although we always are early eaters.\n\nGreat selection of meats and meals (vegetarians need not attend). We had a meat share platter. The ribs were delicious,  the chicken was moist and cooked so well, the sausage had a nice kick and steak was tasty.\n\nI was also impressed at the drinks options, I do enjoy a bourbon and there was a great selection.  Also similar section for Whiskys.\n\nCouldn't fit in dessert (even with the nice selection they had) but thought finish it off with an Espresso Martini.\n\nHighly recommend Flame if you are in Queenstown.\n\nHad a late lunch here after getting off the old steam boat. Loved the atmosphere, staff were super friendly, good local beer, restrooms were clean. Food was alright, maybe 3.5 stars. Our ribs were decent, maybe needs a little spicier smokier bbq sauce for more oomph (we asked for hot sauce and at least they had that), the coleslaw was lacking sauce and flavor, very bland, chips were good. The rump steak was good, but the burger was not, dry and kinda sad. Generous portions though. We would probably go back to try some different dishes next time at dinner time as they have more options, and for the friendly staff and atmosphere.\n\nDidn't have reservation but was seated within 10 mins. This was on a Monday, around 9:30PM. Place was still packed. Somebody took my order right away. Had my starter and waited for almost 20mins for my main. They were busy so I guess it was understandable. Food was great in general.I would say they have one of the best ribs I have ever tasted here in NZ. Chicken was moist and flavourful but the Mozambique Prawn was a bit mediocre and underwhelming. And their chips! I am not a fan of chips but theirs were delicious. I actually finished a serving of chips for once. Serving was huge. Don't worry if you can't finish your meal. You can ask for a takeaway container so you can just bring home your leftover. Lunch sorted! I would still recommend this place to people wanting a decent meal while in Queenstown. They also open til late so if you are arriving late in Queenstown and you want to have a good meal before heading to your accommodation, head to this place.\n\n\nOption: 7:\nName: Jervois Steak House\nAddress: 8 Duke Street, Queenstown 9300, New Zealand\nPhone: 03 442 6263\nDelivery Available: No\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 4 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.6\nReviews: \n\nWas hosted very well by our server Joseph! He was friendly and well spoken. Atmosphere was great. Ordered the market fish alongside a scotch fillet and both was excellent. Not to mention their scotched carrot which was so amazing. Overall highly recommended to try their steaks!\n\nWe had fabolous night dine in here, atmosphere is decent. They have good table service and acknowledge us so well for the menu, it's worth to have a wonderful night here. The food is unique and well-served.\nThe first floor you can have bar drinking with friends. Second floor are the restaurant part. Also they have nice dessert menu after having steak feasting.\n\nNo doubt about it, this place is seriously amazing! Just let the chef work their magic and enjoy the deliciousness. The staff here are super friendly. It's hands down the best spot for steak in Queenstown, my favorite restaurant in town.\n\nThanks so much for our wonderful experience and divine food.\nBoth our maitre D, and fabulous French waiter Charles were so professional and they ensured we had all we needed constantly, to make the night be a smooth seamless banquet of courses,\nalong with the other staff.  Sincere thanks to the chefs we didn't meet.  Food we wont forget!\nBeautiful surroundings, best wines and lovely comfortable d\u00e9cor.\n\nAbsolutely the best steak I\u2019ve ever had. Just trust the chef to cook the meat how it\u2019s best done and enjoy. The staff are super friendly and knowledgeable of all the different cuts of steak. This is definitely the best steak place in Queenstown and probably my favorite restaurant in the town. For a side, get the truffle Mac n cheese too \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb\n\n\nOption: 8:\nName: Public Kitchen and Bar\nAddress: Steamer Wharf/Beach, Queenstown 9300, New Zealand\nPhone: 03 442 5969\nDelivery Available: No\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.6\nReviews: \n\nHad dinner here for our last night in Queenstown. Food was amazing & our waiter was super on to it! We went with the Trust the Chef option and i was surprised, almost everything that came to the table was something I wouldn\u2019t have ordered but I enjoyed it so much especially the vegetarian options. They had live music playing when we arrived and it really just added to the great vibes of the place. Would definitely be back next time im in Queenstown.\n\nFood was promptly prepared, well presented and tasty, which is amazing considering they were really busy. Bread was a generous amount. Staff were attentive.\n\nPublic Kitchen and Bar is the best restaurant I ate at in New Zealand. Food was incredible! We ordered the \u201cTrust the Chef\u201d option which I highly recommend. I loved every dish. The grilled squid with pineapple salsa was incredible and fork tender. I\u2019ve never had better. The pork belly had the most amazing flavor and was cooked perfectly. For dessert was a delicious traditional pavlova and a coconut cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e which were both incredible. Great location, ambiance and staff! They even played some of my favorite songs!\n\nHad a birthday meal here. They welcomed us with a birthday card on the table, which was a lovely touch. We had a range of dishes for 3 adults and 2 kids. couldn't fault any, salmon was lovely, pork belly delicious, even the kids pasta was made with love, not just thrown on a plate as an afterthought. The service was warm and friendly and most importantly, knowledgeable about the food and beverage offerings. There was live music playing which was noticeable and enjoyable but not too loud as to disrupt conversation. Nice vibe with the booths and big middle table. Great views from some seats, though we prefer the booth tables. They even assisted with a birthday candle in the desserts.\nThanks, it's not our first time here and won't be the last.\n\nAbsolute delight. We came for just a mulled wine, saw others meals so decided to order \u2018trust the chef\u2019 three courses. Each meal was very tasty, we were both so full. I enjoyed the blanket that was on offer on the deck too.

The soup base was intense like the French ones but the French were too salty. This one was just right. One thing it can improve, more cheese.\n\nLegendary seafood chowder - The name itself was a gimmick. I've had way better chowder from many many places. This was probably one of the more average one. Not saying it's not tasty, but the amount of cream, the thickness, and from all the seafood ingredients, you want to have a balanced but also strong enough to taste the presence of them.  Not impressed.\n\nBeef bourguignon - Average.  The beef were fine but the sauce overwhelmed by red wine, you want to have red wine to compliment the flavor of the beef not the other way around. This one I couldn't taste the flavor of the beef but just wine.  The pasta was Al dente\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc.\n\nSirloin steak - Great quality. The beef is tender, tasty. The thickness of the steak actually became an issue.  The grill steak I had in America is not big by volume but thick as texture.  I also preferred stronger grill taste.  Normally, you need a very strong grill to char it, locked in the juice and then it'll crisp up on the outside then lower it to grill it to medium rare. Or you can sous vide it to perfect temperature and charred it with strong flame grill.  This steak was not grill to crisp, in fact, it was warm when it was served.  The peppercorn sauce also underwhelmed.  I had to add fresh ground pepper to spike up the flavor.\n\nThis is a fine dine restaurant, I expected more from it. Otherwise, it's still quality cooking and it's not fair to compare to Michelin stars restaurants.\n\nOne of the best restaurants I have been to! Could not fault the food, service or ambience. Beautiful decor and very attentive and personable staff. Daniel was fantastic! A must visit when in Queenstown.\n\nWow, what an amazing restaurant! The food was of exceptionally high quality, and the service was outstandingly friendly and helpful. Our waiter went above and beyond to assist us in choosing dishes and even took a beautiful sunset photo of us outside the restaurant. The meal itself was simply superb; we had the steak and ordered a dessert of cake and cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e.\n\nThis restaurant is amazing! The food is top-notch, and the service is super friendly. Our waiter helped us choose dishes and even took a great photo of us.

Understandable although New Zealand has excellent wines in its own right. BUT wines - be red or white - are served at room temperature. Sorry, I couldn't drink my white wine. My wife ordered ice cubes... to improve the situation somewhat. I will never ever order wine in a restaurant in New Zealand - this restaurant killed it completely by serving white wine at this temperature...\nFood was okay.\n\nExemplary authentic italian food with delicious handmade pasta, love the angus beef ravioli! Staff very attentive too, prices reasonable too around $24 for a pasta. Garlic bread will be better if there is more garlic, but bread is handmade and still good\n\nGreat service and atmosphere, awesome pizza. The only issue is the carbonara, the egg was added when the dish was too hot, so in turn i ended up with scrambled egg through the dish. Easy mistake for a novice. But overall a good experience.\n\nWas super excited to try this place!\nAfter a long day out adventuring Queenstown, we decided to order in. I was hyped for some authentic Italian as advertised but what we ordered was not that.\n\nThe gnocchi sauce tasted like it had been poured out of a tin from the supermarket and was topped with tasty cheese. The margarita pizza tasted like domino\u2019s. Both meals were cold when they arrived and the delivery took 45 minutes longer than it said on the app.\n\nFor the price I paid ($62) I was expecting authentic Italian. Would not recommend if that is what you\u2019re expecting.\n\nOH EMM GEE.......HANDS DOWN - BEST ITALIAN FOOD IVE TASTED in a long time!!  The flavours were absolutely delicious as was my Aperol Spritz!  Amazing service just made this whole experience FANTASTIC!!

Used the voucher found on Chope where we got a main and a drink for $8.99. It was absolute value-for-money!\n\nThe main dishes were generally okay, with quite small portions. However, they were nothing much to write home about. The drinks and sides were the stars of the show, and I would definitely be back especially for the fried chicken.\n\nHowever\u2026 the desserts here were really expensive, costing as much as a main dish. If you are craving Taiwanese desserts, you\u2019re better off going to another place like Nine Fresh.\n\nVery nice Taiwanese food bistro if you miss Taiwan food! The braised pork belly rice is very flavorful, oyster egg omelette is differently made compare to sg style, and the egg crepe roll is also very crispy.\n\nVery satisfying meal indeed. I had a very joyous dining experience! My family and I enjoyed the food very much \ud83d\ude04\n\nThis time I ordered something new like Fried Chicken with Cheese, and all my family members love it so much!\nLove their meesua too, but I ran out of it yesterday. So I ordered their pork belly rice and udon, scallion oil chicken rice and as usual, the food at 8 Degree always satisfies my craving for Taiwanese food!\n\nTheir Bubble tea also spoil me with their choices.. all yummyy!\n\nTry them out! Super recommended!\n\nFood was pretty good! Reasonably priced too. Shop is simple but service was good and Aircon always nice in Singapore. Recommend you try their eggroll with floss. Somewhat like a crepe/fresh popiah roll.\n\nAlso recommend trying the sesame cold noodles paired with a fried chicken with cheese.\n\nPork rice was also nice, not too sweet, hardboiled egg was also very good quality and with their spicy chili dip. Very good!\n\nOh I also really liked their bubble tea. Even at zero percent sugar it was good. The pearls here are really chewy soft and can tell it's made fresh.\n\nWill be back to try other dishes when I'm in the area again.\n\nTasty Taiwanese food at affordable rates. I had the scallion oil chicken rice and the portion size was decent and chicken was very succulent. Pearl milk boba tea was really nice too.

It's an authentic Taiwanese Zi Char place serving all the classic local Taiwanese stir fry dishes!! We felt like we were taken back to Taiwan as soon as we walked in. Super popular amongst the Taiwanese expats in town and always full at night even on weekdays - better to make reservations in advance!\n\nWould recommend to taiwan style zir char aka \u70ed\u7092, if lunch kinda pricy and slow.\n\nWe are 1st in the Q, but it took bosses 15 minutes to serve. So, for those who only have 1 hour lunch time, kinda rush. Imagine a 15-minute round trip to the office, 20 minutes to serve, 5-10mins to order, you left 15 minutes to chunk in and 5 minutes to settle the bill. Hahhaa.. we ladies still need time to touch up makeup.\n\nThe male boss is kinda friendly, we are here 10 minutes earlier, as the open only at 12pm. He is nice and brings us to the table and has a small chat with us. The lady boss is not chatty and kinda charcoal face (maybe bad mood that day)\n\nEnvironment wise, kinda chill place to drink and eat, suitable after work come with friend or colleague. They have 1 private room, so they should be able to fit in 8-10pax (I guess, better call in and confirm, not sure if have minimum spend as the lady not answering my small talk)\n\nThe food is average, I only tried a few, and hence, I can't comment much. Maybe you can find 1 fine day and try more.\n\nRather quite day for them, only 3 tables from 1150 am to 1 pm, maybe their crowd from evening/dinner.\n\nReally loved the \u5364\u8089\u996d, felt that it was really authentic and affordable. As for the other dishes they weren't particularly spectacular except the deep fried oysters but it was not bad to say the least. I enjoyed the varying types of tea they offered.\n\nThe food was generally served quickly, and the place itself was quite vibey. Felt a little like stepping into Taiwan.\n\nThe crispy fried oyster was delicious. The oysters were big and juicy, and fried so crispy that it wasn\u2019t oily at all. The fried rice with shredded pork was also fragrant and seasoned just right. One gripe is that the pork was a bit fatty (personal preference though).\n\nWide variety of food to choose from that we ordered too much. All tasted quite authentic Taiwanese.

The cheese foam tea is excellent while the fried mushroom a bit oily and not very seasoned.\nService okay, staff quite relaxed and atmosphere good.\nOverall, a good restaurant. And it will permanently close soon.\n\nBraised pork rice has a nice taste but very small bowl.  Oyster mee sua was quite nice. Shredded chicken is available at top up.\n\nWe also had the garlic beef $26 after tax.. Had multiple pieces too chewy.. Personally find it overcooked and not much taste for me.\n\n2 pax : mee sua x 1, braised pork rice x 1, garlic beef x 1, aiyu jelly x 1, 1 plain rice total paid  $23 pax after svc charge & Gst.. \u5403\u4e0d\u5305 \ud83d\ude02\n\nNearest public car park is J0100 very walkable.\n\nLovely corner shop along Pasir Panjang Road with quaint, yet homely decor. Being in an industrial area, it was relatively quiet during a weekday dinner.\n\nFood was very tasty and the flavours were reminiscent of Taipei street food.\n\nOne inconvenience is the ordering system as you are unable to see the available variations (e.g. hot/cold drinks selection) unless you order one and check if the variation is available. Could use some improvement if you need to cut on waiting staff.\n\nMy favourite place for Taiwanese lu rou fan, it's the best in SG. Do order the onsen eggs as well, perfectly done with marinated and soft yolk. The Mee Sua is not bad too but the vegetable dish is overcooked and too soft for me. Best of all, prices are very reasonable. Take note that portions are small hence the name for big eaters.\nIt's a small restaurant so go early to avoid queues. Service is fast though.\nIt is the only restaurant I know where you not only order using your phone but pay also.\n\nReally delicious and cute train themed place!\n\nTheir braised pork rice \u5364\u8089\u996d tastes really fragrant! Delicate pieces of pork meat and fats paired with soft rice, toppen with their braised sauce. Each bite is delicious! Sadly the bowl is a little small and doesn't come with an egg or other sides.\n\nThe chicken is also yummy! Salty from their shallots, paired with fluffy rice tastes good!\n\nI got their oreo coconut milk drink for $5 which was decent but a little pricey. Plenty of oreo bits in their fresh coconut milk. Their taro drink is also chewy but on the very milky side.\n\nWould love to come here again!\n\n\nOption: 5:\nName: WANt Food Chinatown \u604b\u604b\u6e7e\u5473 Taiwanese Delights\nAddress: 153 South Bridge Road, Besides Footbridge \u6a4b\u5357\u8def\u5929\u6a4b\u65c1, 22 Cross St, registered, 048421\nPhone: 9396 9800\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nSunday: Closed\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.3\nReviews: \n\nThere's a home cooked taste to the food. I ordered the \u5364\u8089\u996d\u4fbf\u5f53 (pork bento). It was light on oil and salt, which I like and is healthier. Serving size is just about right for an adult male. It seems to be managed by Taiwanese so the food should be authentic. The place is small but cozy and decorated with old school nostalgic household items. It's a good place for a quiet lunch. Overall a thumbs up and would visit again.\n\nHas the lu rou fan set which taste good on it's only, the mushroom tempura is well seasoned too. Egg is old school hard boil though, so nothing too exciting there. Oh ya chili is really good and goes well.\n\nThe salt crispy chicken is very underwhelming, feels like very poor chicken quality. Milk tea is ok, the pearl feels a bit dry.\n\nHonestly price point is steep for comfort food.\n\nWe ordered the braised pork belly rice set, intestine mee sua, and egg pancake with cheese and pork floss. The taste was very homely and generally good, though I wished that the flavours were stronger. Perhaps it's just my personal preference, but I would have loved a bit more of the oiliness that those at a street stall in the night market would have, which makes it a little more authentic.\n\nWe still enjoyed our time there, and the decor was also very nostalgic, with typewriters and cassette tapes!\n\nA good place to have some Taiwanese food! We ordered braised pork rice, mee sua with braised intestines & oysters, fried chicken and fried king mushroom! All rice and mee sua were good. The fried chicken was succulent and the fried mushroom was really moist and juicy inside!

The taste is good but the portions are super small. $5.40 is definitely not enough, can easily down 3 bowls.\n\nWould prefer there is more meat given. What to do?\n\nAttendance saw me standing there, rather than attending my order they were chatting. Probably wanted to form a queue to take the order all at a time.\n\nWell executed Taiwanese street food. Fried chicken and honey grilled chicken were crispy on the outside , juicy on the inside. Good selection on the menu and the crispy mushroom was a little too hard and chunky for my liking\u2026 I was hoping for some plum powder to go with. The \u5364\u8089\u996d was just okay for me.. too little sauce, rice was not soft enough and overall I think I have had better.

As a part of memories in my SG days, usually I'll visit it if I passerby. Although the atmosphere and food as good as always, but experience this time is totally makes me yucks.\n\nDuring I'm going to collect my order as Teriyaki Chicken bento, a male staff with a Ah Beng bag blocked the entry, I tried to go out after collection but failed due to the order fall to the floor accidentally.\n\nFine I'm not blaming to anyone since I need to take my responsibilities being wrong estimation during go out, but what really make frustrated is the attitude of the male staff with bag \u2014\u2014 keep blocking the way, not taking any action but only with words which irresponsible \"not my business ah!\" Luckily the senior lady (maybe is supervisor since I saw her from 2021) and a male staff with Chinese tone helped me to prepare new order, kudos and great thanks to them\ud83d\ude4fIf without them I might provide a lower rating \ud83d\ude24\n\nThis worse experience just a feedback about your staff attitude. I would like to said honestly, safety precautions required to make since the entry is small till inconvenience to pass it (at least keep the SMALL entry convenience to pass over, especially peak period to prevent any accident\u2014\u2014maybe next time another accident which is more serious caused?). Besides that kindly train your staff from service perspective, I don't want to see another Taiwanese Cuisine shop which I like falls after the collapse wave during COVID-19, due to bad attitude from it's staff.\ud83e\udee4 (And also it's hard to find Taiwanese Cuisine such affordable+tasty in nowadays!\ud83d\ude2d)\n\n\nOption: 7:\nName: Enjoy Xia Hokkien Mee Kitchen\nAddress: 383 Jln Besar, Kam Leng Hotel, Singapore 209001\nPhone: 9299 1601\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.3\nReviews: \n\nI recently dined at Enjoy Xia Hokkien Mee. Our experience during lunch hour was somewhat disappointing. Surprisingly, there was no lunch crowd, but that didn't necessarily translate into a great dining experience.\n\nThe food was just average, lacking the depth of flavor we expected, and it leaned towards the pricier side, making it hard to justify the cost.\n\nWe attempted to use deals via Burpple, but unfortunately, the staff's unfriendly response left us quite disappointed with their attitude and service.\n\nOn a positive note, the restaurant had an alright atmosphere with a nice design, but it didn't make up for the underwhelming food and staff interaction.\n\nMy friend and I ordered the Hokkien mee, crispy hor fun and prawn cakes. The Hokkien mee was flavourful and satisfying, and the crispy hor fun was surprisingly good but might be a bit jelak. The prawns were a bit powdery and tough though. I didnt enjoy the prawn cakes as it tasted a bit weird.\n\nWhen we were checking out, they offered a 10% discount in exchange for a Google Review. They didn\u2019t specify if it had to be a 5 star review tho, so take it as you will.\n\nHokkien prawn noodles tastes really good in my opinion but really too oily from the roasted pork & lard added I believe. I\u2019m certain that the amount of oil can be halved at least. Other than that, prawns are fresh & huge. Place is IG friendly. Service is ok.\n\nMai hiam buay pai.  I love their man tou, Hokkien mee slightly above average for me but lots of ingredients which justify their price. Pork cheek also not bad. Second time patronised this restaurant because we wanna try their Hokkien mee. I will not return again for their Hokkien mee but other dishes, why not?\n\nPretty average food. Nothing much to wow about. Need to reserve early for seats, walk in will be taking a risk. Maybe is the hype from influencer that\u2019s causes everyone to come. Prawn noodle above average but for selling price not much worth it because of the big prawn that\u2019s all. Stingray was kind of disappointed due to was deep fried first, kind of wasted to execute this way. Overall not worth the price paying for.\n\n\nOption: 8:\nName: Abundance (Redhill)\nAddress: 63A Lengkok Bahru, #01-378, Singapore 151063\nPhone: 8032 1880\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 4:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 4:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 4:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 4:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.3\nReviews: \n\nI recently had the pleasure of savoring the exquisite flavors of Taiwanese cuisine at Abundance, and I must say it was an absolute delight for my taste buds. The attention to authenticity in every dish is commendable, transporting me straight to the vibrant streets of Taiwan.\n\nFrom the first bite to the last, the dishes showcased a perfect balance of savory and aromatic spices. The culinary expertise is evident in every detail, from the impeccable presentation to the rich, complex flavors that left me craving more.\n\nThe menu at Abundance reflects a true passion for Taiwanese food, offering a diverse array of options that cater to every palate. The friendly and attentive staff added to the overall enjoyable dining experience, making me feel welcomed and ensuring that each dish was a memorable journey.\n\nIf you're a fan of Taiwanese cuisine or just eager to embark on a flavorful adventure, Abundance is a must-visit. My taste buds thank me, and yours will too!\n\nFood:\nFood was really great with creative choice from the restaurant. Taste was really good. Dessert (ice cream roll) is a must-try for me. Interesting cocktails, craft beers, and drinks.\n\nService:\nThe reservation was at 7pm but the seat was not ready within 15 mins (understandable as it was a large group but could be improved).\nBrought a cake for celebration. When I asked for the cake, I was expecting the cake to be served by the staff but I was given the cake and served it myself instead. (Service charge was in the bill, so customer would expect better service)\n\nAtmosphere:\nAmbience was great but could get noisy in peak hours. I could not hear clearly what my friend was saying who sit two seat away from me (maybe could improve on sound absorption?)\n\nLovely place for some novelty Taiwanese cuisine! We had the chicken and the prawn buns. O thought the dressing that came with the chicken bun was too wet for my liking, but the chicken was well fried and crispy. The prawn patty was quite nice too! Truffle fries is a pass. The sauce for the dumplings was a touch too heavy for my liking, though the addition of lard is a nice plus. Finally, the dessert is really good in my opinion, because I'm a bit of a weirdo and I like coriander ad peanut with ice cream. It makes sense to me, but I get it's not everyone's thing. Shout out to the staff who checked how many pieces I wanted the ice cream cut into. She had considered that I was there in a family of three, and that I might not have wanted the default sliced in two. Will definitely recommend, and also come back!\n\nThe atmosphere was rather cramped and basic, but the food made up for it. Nestled at the block near the MSCP, this place is a treat. The balsamic fries were an interesting find. The gua bao was a hit. Kids also loved the beef noodles. The salted egg prawn gua bao was nicely done. One dish I didn't like the fish paste chicken... a bit overpowered by the fish paste. Lack of kids' utensils and plates make this place slightly kid unfriendly, although high chairs are available. It's a simple fix that the management should look into. The meal was rounded off with their black sesame ice cream popiah and the peanut with coriander ice cream popiah. The latter is a definite must try!! It was so good we forgot to take a photo of it. Price wise, the food is not cheap, but the innovative menu is a treat! Was crowded on a Sunday evening, and I recommend booking ahead.\n\nBeen wanting to try this for a while and totally meet our expectation! We came around 12pm for lunch on Sunday and was seated directly. Ordered the food via QR code, very fast and easy. Nice and cozy place, felt very homey. The food was served very quick aside from the ice cream.\n\nAll the foods were cooked perfectly with great quality. The Gua Bao was especially extraordinary; explosion of flavors with great texture. We really liked the Prawn Toast as well. The Red Hot Chili Dumpling Noodle was thick and chewy as how I like it; the dumplings were very nice. The XO Fried Rice wasn't very special, but tasted good.\n\nOverall very satisfied with the food and experience, although the price is at the higher end :)\n\n\nOption: 9:\nName: Wanted T Plus\nAddress: 1 Jurong West Central 2, #03-40, Singapore 648886\nPhone: 6908 7037\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Information Not Available\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 3.8\nReviews: \n\nBraised Pork Belly rice was good but the complimentary milk tea meh!\n\nWe tried:\n- Signature Honey Chicken Chop Bento ($6.80)\n- Braised Pork Belly Rice ($5.80)\n- Oyster Mianxian ($5.50)\n- Chicken Bites sides in sesame & honey ($5.50/set)\n- Summer Peach (peach oolong, strawberry boba & aloe vera) ($5)\n- Toffee Milk Tea (caramel milk tea, brown sugar pearls, agar balls) ($5)\n\nAll bentos also comes with half a braised egg & pickled vegetables that go so well with the meats & QQ fluffy rice!

When I came here with my friends, we all left sorely disappointed.\n\nThe beef noodles wasn\u2019t great. It\u2019s hard to explain but it just wasn\u2019t good. Lacking in flavour and basically just salty. The chicken wings that came with the set although well fried, the meat wasn\u2019t moist and you could tell that it\u2019s a cheap frozen wing.\n\nThe indoor portion of the restaurant also had a rather bad smell, but at least we could choose to sit outside.\n\nWill definitely not be back here or to even try other branches.\n\nBlanco Court Beef Noodle is a beloved establishment in Singapore, renowned for its delectable bowls of beef noodles. As you step inside the unassuming eatery, you are immediately greeted by the rich aroma of simmering spices and savory broth, setting the stage for a culinary experience that is nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nThe star of the show at Blanco Court Beef Noodle is, of course, the beef noodle soup. The broth is the heart and soul of this dish, and Blanco Court does not disappoint.\n\nReally a delicious bowl of beef noodles, with tender beef slice, smooth noodles that mixed very well with the gravy, spicy tangy chilli sauce to mix with the noodles, beef, gravy. Soup is delicious too. Only thing is that the portion slightly small at $9.90...but as we know..inflation...inflation.\n\nGreedy me bought the Large Superior Bowl cause I wanted it all!\n\nThe portion was huge and the ingredients were all clean & fresh.\n\nSlightly Salty for the dry sauce, I used the like and chilli paste to reduce it.\n\nThe soup was flavorful. I asked for a refill & they gave me a bowl.\n\nComfort food especially on a rainy day. Dinner Queue was reasonable as Thai Food was crowded.\n\nThe best beef noodle I've tasted. Ordered the superior beef noodles and the beef slices, tendon, and balls are all superb. The sauce was initially starchy but turned more fluid as I ate.\n",

Loved the onion soup, borscht soup. The steak on iron pan was really delicious and super well seasoned! Didn\u2019t expect it to taste that good. The tomato fish was sadly a miss for me! But the Irish coffee was delicious!!! Even my partner who is a super non-alcoholic person loved it and love the cream the whole presentation. What a gem of a place! Lovely!\n\nA meal starts with a soft warm bread with butter. Lamb shashlik and cherry jubilee are still good as ever!\nUnfortunately not so much on the borscht soup. Although tasting good as before, the Borscht soup was lacking in ingredients, very little cabbage and 1 piece of beef inside. Not worth the price.\n\nthe interior really brings you to a whole new place after walking up escalators of a seemingly abandoned and pretty run down building.\nwe had borshch soup which was really hearty and good we both loved it - must try when you\u2019re here! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\nthe upside down crab was also really good (tip: add salted butter onto the toast before adding the crab meat on top - the slight saltiness does a huge difference). We loved it though should have finished it while hot/warm because once cold, got a bit too jelat.\nI had the fish en papillotte which was not bad (not much special) and the fish was SUPER SOFT but probably better for sharing; got a little boring after a while. He had oxtail stew which had a little too much fats, it got too jelat after a while too so better for sharing too.\nWe ended off with the waitress recommended cherry jubilee but we both found it very underwhelming so we had say no harm passing!\nOverall a nice dining experience as the staff were really nice and attentive \u263a\ufe0f\n\nSet above Far East Shopping Centre on the 6th floor, Shashlik Restaurant is one of those establishments that blends fond memories with consistently pleasing meals. The journey through the aisle of shops from way back yonder, with its varied mix of some newer ones, together with that single-file escalator, makes a sweet start to a culinary venture that feels like a warm embrace of the past.\n\nThe ambience while plain is rather pleasant, with wooden furnishing making a calm statement where food takes the lead. The wait staff were a mix of the young and elderly, who infused our experience with a lovely blend of professionalism and genuine warmth. Adding to that, their friendly banter invites diners into a space that feels both upscale and homely.\n\nThe Borshch soup, a creamy treat made even better with sour cream is always a personal favourite. The Tenderloin Shashlik while looking rather plain on a sizzling plate, gave bursts of exceptional flavours, complemented with a simple side salad. My companion opted for the Impossible Meat Balls with Pesto Pappardelle Pasta, while the other ordered the Chicken Thigh Shashlik. The obligatory order of fries was, as always, a welcome addition. The rice ball was not what we expected with its crispy texture, but pleasant nonetheless.\n\nThe pricing is slightly above average, but it does find some justification in the consistent quality of food and service.\n\nShashlik Restaurant positions itself with its intriguing blend of Russian and Hainanese cuisine, stemming from an even more interesting history. The cuisine, varied yet harmoniously blended, is not merely a meal but an essential culinary adventure, offering a unique and memorable palette of flavours.\n\nOver the decades, Shashlik Restaurant is a testament of time-tested culinary delight. It stands as a resounding recommendation for those seeking a culinary journey that offers both unique flavours and a dash of nostalgia.\n\nAlways satisfied at the restaurant.\n\nLocation,  it's not really within the Orchard belt so it's great not to be in the traffic! There's an open air car park nearby.  Taxi drop off is next to the building.\n\nFood is really yummy and of good quality.  The bun served is super good! Hot,  soft and tasty!\n\nAmbience is good.  Keep a very cosy,  yet comfortable and exclusive feel.\n\nVery welcoming staff.  All are friendly,  approachable and polite,  and with a good sense of humour.  And they all prepare you for your photography or video time knowing one would like to do some picture or video taking.\n\nPrice wise,  generally it's good reasonable for the venue,  Ambience,  quality and service.\n\nEnjoy the time there for celebrations!\n\n\nOption: 2:\nName: Kapitan.sg | Best Slavic Cuisine - Maxwell Chambers\nAddress: 32 Maxwell Rd, #01-05 Maxwell Chambers, Singapore 069115\nPhone: 8875 7033\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.3\nReviews: \n\nwe made a reservation and were promptly served upon arrival.\n\nfood took a bit of time to arrive, noting they were all served hot and fresh.\n\nfood was nice and interesting, dumplings is their hit menu item here. I find the skin a bit thicker than the Asian dumplings, nevertheless they are flavourful. They have a variety of flavours for their dumplings.\n\ngood service and easy to order system.\n\nFun place to dine. Dumplings and cocktails are ace and service is awesome. Some food misses the mark. Will be back to try their extensive and interesting menu! More details below:\n\nFood:\n- Assorted dumplings are worth the try! Had lots of fun with the flavours and having them with the salsa and the sour cream\n- Cocktails came with fried dumplings, I loved how they were salted, super great bar snack.\n- Enjoyed the unique cold summer soup too!\n- Some of the mains were a tad salty (chicken patty and mash) but really homey and warming and all came with veggies\n- All food arrived in order so we had a cohesive meal\n\nService:\n- The staff came to give recommendations and talked to us about the dumplings, very attentive.\n\nAtmosphere:\n- Quiet, peaceful, a great place to go for a date!\n- Decor also very interesting and rustic\n\nFirst time trying Russian food, I must say that the food, particularly the dumplings are very delicious, they are very filling. This is one of the foods I highly recommend, the service are excellent too, the staff would give recommendations and explain the food when it\u2019s being served, thirdly, the restaurant is decorated with many Soviet era items such as Soviet newspapers, posters with Cyrillic text and even a Soviet Army ceremonial trumpet. Overall, good experience, food and service. 10/10.\n\nThe interior is inviting for a relaxed meal, and the staff is friendly and accommodating. The set lunch appears to offer a variety of fusion and Ukrainian broths, along with pasta featuring a selection of 6 different dumpling flavors. A great option for a chill lunch or dinner during the week.\n\nI actually visited here a few years ago to try their \u2018angmoh\u2019 dumplings before they rebranded and found them rather interesting as compared to the usual Chinese dumplings. Glad that I\u2019m able to try more dishes this round\n\nWhat we had\n\ud83e\udd5f Angmoh Dumplings Combo, $17.90\n8 flavours in total. Salmon, minty ram, black bull, wild hog, golden hen, siberian (beef & pork), paneer and potato. The dumpling skin is thicker than the Chinese style. Fillings-wise, I enjoyed the potato and chicken\n\n\ud83c\udf44 Cheburek, $22.90\nFried pastry with a choice of fillings. We picked cheese & white mushrooms. The pastry is crispy and filled with cheesy and juicy shroomy goodness\n\n\ud83d\udc1f Draniki (Rosti), $24.90\nFried rosti served with smoked salmon. The rosti here is more similar to hashbrowns in terms of texture and not the usual crispy grated potatoes texture that I\u2019m used to but it\u2019s definitely more flavourful and well seasoned imo\n\n\ud83c\udf70 Medovik, $12.90\nMulti layered Slavic honey cake that is great for those with sweet tooth \ud83d\ude1c\n\n\ud83e\udd43 Shots, $10/shot (inhouse infused vodka)\n\ud83c\udf36\ufe0f Ukrainian Red Chilli Pepper\nSounds scary but it\u2019s actually not that bad..

Stay nearby but have never been to this gem. Will definitely come back again.\n\nWe went there after our dinner for some desserts and was rejected by an old man ( guess he is the owner). He was very rude to us and told us their shop is not a dessert shop! But why did their menu.have desserts??? Just because we didn't have dinner at their restaurant!!! Will never go there for any meals. As a service line, he shouldn't be rejecting us even though we did not have our dinner.\n\nTrue-blue authentic old-fashioned Peranakan home cooking at old-fashioned prices. Try everything, the flavours and portions will be more than satisfying. The owner serves you rice from a traditional bakul. Decor is outdated, but that's part of the charm. Sadly, it is hidden behind extensive construction at Novena and custom is definitely affected.\n\nOn 28.8.22 ,7.30pm, we reserved a table of 10 for my eldest son birthday.This is the first time we went to this cuisine to eat.All the dishes we ordered are very delicious to eat .The lemon tea & chendol are very nice. The boss jeffery is a very humble man which my father praise him for his work talent & the way he served customers warmly.

I have never been to a Moldovan restaurant before and decided to check it out. The menu is small with a variety of options. The food was very good but certain dishes can be pricey.

Good service, good atmosphere. I would recommend it.\n\nGreat food, good atmosphere, good service, good beer and wine selection.\n\nI started with the chicken and mushroom crepe appetizer, which was delicious.

I really enjoyed the meal. We ordered a borscht which comes with a pirozhok, which is like a savory puff pastry with meat inside (although they have a vegetable option as well). Both were really well flavored and the pastry was very crispy and fluffy, a rare find in the pastry world. We also ordered the smoked salmon blinis, which were very good. Blinis are not your typical crepes, they are slightly heavier and chewier, which is very satisfying with the sour cream and salmon.

From the moment I stepped through the doors, I was transported to a bygone era, a time of elegance, sophistication, and culinary delights. Allow me to share my delightful journey at this charming establishment.\n\nThe first thing that caught my attention was the enchanting kitchen atmosphere. It exuded a nostalgic aura, taking me back to the days of grand dining halls and lavish banquets. The attention to detail was impeccable, with vintage decor, elegant chandeliers casting a soft glow, and beautifully set tables that evoked a sense of timeless elegance. The lady owner's touch was evident in every corner, creating a warm and inviting ambiance that was both cozy and refined.\n\nThe menu, oh, the menu! It was a culinary masterpiece, offering a selection of Russian fare that was truly a feast for the senses. Each dish was meticulously crafted, showcasing the rich flavors and traditional techniques of Russian cuisine. From the hearty borscht and tender beef stroganoff to the delicate pelmeni and indulgent caviar, every bite was a revelation. The infusion of vodka with various flavors added a unique twist to the dining experience, providing a perfect complement to the sumptuous dishes.\n\nTo further elevate the atmosphere, a talented pianist graced the establishment with their melodic tunes. The classical music filled the air, intertwining with the clinking of glasses and the laughter of delighted patrons, creating an atmosphere of enchantment and refinement. It was a true symphony of culinary delights and soul-stirring melodies.\n\nBut what truly sets this establishment apart is the personal touch of the lady owner. Her passion for hospitality and her commitment to creating an unforgettable experience for her guests shone through in every aspect of the evening. She effortlessly made everyone feel like a welcomed guest in her own home, ensuring that every need was met with grace and warmth.\n\nIn conclusion, my visit to this establishment was nothing short of magical. The kitchen atmosphere, with its nostalgic charm and elegant setting, took me on a journey back in time. The Russian fare, infused vodkas, and live piano music added layers of delight to an already exceptional experience. To the lady owner, I extend my heartfelt gratitude for creating such a haven of beauty, taste, and hospitality.\n\nIf you're seeking a dining experience that transports you to a world of elegance and grace, I wholeheartedly recommend paying a visit to this extraordinary establishment. Prepare to be enchanted, indulge in exquisite cuisine, and let the melodies of the pianist sweep you away. You won't be disappointed.\n\nOnce again, my sincere thanks to the lady owner for curating such a memorable and beautiful experience.\n\nVisited: July 2023\n\nAuthentic Eastern European cuisines served in a rustic vibe.\n\nMy friend and I came here a while ago to try authentic Russian fares. As expected, we were the only English-speaking group at the restaurant, but our server was very welcoming and accommodating. It seemed like there were several groups coming in to celebrate special occasions, and we were fortunate to enjoy live piano throughout the evening.\n\nWe shared a couple of apps and a soup, and I had the sturgeon tzar with Russian kasha for the entr\u00e9e. Served with a side of sour cream, both the blintze and the pirozhok were good, but the latter pulled ahead as a winner. Wrapped in a crispy baked pastry, the meat pirozhok was very flavorful, and I especially liked pairing it with the traditional beet-based soup - borscht. Sturgeon was also a nice surprise, and I liked that its texture was a bit similar to that of cod.\n\nOverall, our experience at Cafe St.Petersburg was definitely far from typical dining experience in Boston. Nevertheless, we really liked the feeling of being transported to a local restaurant in a small Eastern European country, and I would highly recommend giving them a try.\n\nVery yummy soups they have , pretty nice and polite waitress , adequate prices .

Friday because October calls for German food. I love German food and there aren\u2019t a lot of German restaurants around. I\u2019ve been there before, but this was a wonderful visit. We started with the pretzel, big soft and covered with course salt. It comes with a very nice horseradish mustard, spicy but not overwhelming. For an up charge you can also get beer cheese, but I greatly prefer the mustard.\n\nThey were celebrating Oktoberfest, but I\u2019m not much of a beer drinker, so I started with a cocktail. They have a variation on a Negroni called Czech Yourself, made with Czech fernet, gin, and Campari. Although I\u2019m mostly Irish-German, I do have some Czech ancestry and as you well know I\u2019m a gin guy, so I had to try it. Very nice, I actually preferred it it to the traditional Negroni. After that I had a couple glasses of Austrian Gr\u00fcner Veltliner. I\u2019m not Austrian.\n\nFor dinner we split the Sp\u00e4tzle and the Schnitzel. The sp\u00e4tzle is larger than I\u2019m used to but nicely browned and served with spinach and onions. You can add a sausage to it if you like. We added a bratwurst. This dish is delicious but huge. I took some home, and it heats up nicely in a frying pan the next day.The schnitzel was also excellent. It is topped with a mushroom cream sauce and served with warm, bacony potato salad. I would get both of these dishes again with no hesitation. I\u2019d even get the sp\u00e4tzle to go because it reheats so well.\n\nFor dessert, we had the Apflestrudel, apples and golden raisins stuffed into a pastry and topped with buttermilk whipped cream. With it, I had a shot of J\u00e4egermeister, which I didn\u2019t shoot, I sipped.\n\nThe staff was dressed in traditional German attire and the small space was decorated for Oktoberfest. There aren\u2019t many seats and it\u2019s crowded, but definitely charming. The service was very friendly and the atmosphere was casual.  It was a relaxing feast. Union Square is about the worst place to park, but once you find a spot everything is great! I\u2019m excited to go back to try the sauerbraten and of course more of their haus sausages.\n\nAlways a blast during Oktoberfest! Don't forget it's there the rest of the year. Perfect to stop by and satiate your want for a soft pretzel.\n\nVery classy and authentic German gastropub in Summerville. Plenty of parking spaces, friendly and warm ambience! Food was amazing and priced reasonably!\n\nFun German pub with welcoming vibe. The burgers and wurst got high marks from our crew. The wait staff was flexible and fun.\n\nDon\u2019t skip the pretzel! Food is awesomely German (duh!) and so is the beer. Be brave and get the Liter.\n\n\nOption: 5:\nName: Trinktisch\nAddress: 87 Leonard St, Belmont, MA 02478, United States\nPhone: (617) 484-2337\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: Closed\nTuesday: 4:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 4:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 4:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 4:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.5\nReviews: \n\nThere is something nice and family about this place. My 7 and 10 year old grandkids love it, hot dogs and root beer, interesting German type food for grown ups and great big beer selection. It's in a basement, lots of benches and picnic tables. We keep going back.\n\nThe laid-back vibe, surprisingly decent food, and great beer selection makes up for the dingy basement feel. They did a great job of making full use of the outdoor space, so that should definitely be your first option if the weather is good. The restaurant should check that all the table umbrellas are fastened - ours was missing the tightening knob and it almost hit us when a big gust of wind blew. I love how they have a truly unique brew shop right next to the dining area.\nThe staff was very accommodating and as sweet as can be.\nThe food was very good. Salads were fresh, the pretzels were soft and warm, and the deviled eggs were top notch. The chicken curry chicken salad was a massive bowl of just chicken, and it was definitely tasty, but all the chicken we had was a little rubbery.\nThis is truly a unique spot and is a great place to chill, grab a bite and drink a few brews.\n\nIt\u2019s always great to come here, drink great beers - both local and international, enjoy tasty food, and enjoy the company of others - everyone is just so thoughtful here, from the staff to other guests.\n100% a worthwhile stop if you\u2019re looking for a tasty brew (three different ounce serving options), food, and/or a family-friendly spot.\n\nGreat beer selection, nice outdoor tables (with view of parking lot...), decent German food. A good option in Belmont Centre [sic].\nSchnitzel was decent. Knockwurst and sweet mustard were good. Warm potato salad was a bit too vinegary for my taste, and didn't have enough bacon grease (but others will like that!).\nFriendly and efficient service.\n\nStopped by for dinner when visiting family in town, we must've stayed 3 hours and ordered the whole damn menu... Outstanding & unique dishes, everything was tasty. Plenty of perfect pairings with beer & sausages.\n\nStaff was knowledgeable and very helpful. Can't recommend this place enough. We'll definitely be back the next time we're in town!\n\nLoved the contactless menu & ordering as well. Such an efficient system that I wish more places used.\n\n\nOption: 6:\nName: The Capital Grille\nAddress: 250 Boylston St, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467, United States\nPhone: (617) 928-1400\nDelivery Available: No\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 4:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 4:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 4 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.5\nReviews: \n\nIf you want a juicy flavorful steak I suggest going elsewhere. Came here for my birthday the other day. Service was great and I was so excited about the food until I actually tried my dish. I ordered the seared tenderloin with butter poached lobster. It was the most flavorless steak and lobster I've ever had. Literally, every other steakhouse I've tried was better than this, and this is the 4th stop. The only downside to my birthday was the steak. The fries and dessert were good but for it being a fine dining steakhouse... highly disappointed.\n\nWe recently dined at The Capital Grille to mark a birthday, and our experience was truly wonderful. The waiter was friendly and knowledgeable. The food was superb, although the drinks could have been a bit improved. Nevertheless, we all had an immensely enjoyable time. The ambiance contributed to a fantastic birthday celebration, and the special birthday plate they presented added to the overall experience.\n\nChestnut Hill location. Fabulous restaurant for a special event. Just celebrated a birthday there. The cocktails are great. Try the Double Oaked and Rye Manhattan. One of the best Manhattans I have ever had. The tuna tartare appetizer was great. Beautiful presentation and great flavor. The bone in rib-eye was delicious. And the service is superb. Ask for Miranda-she is terrific!\n\nWe celebrated my birthday last night in Chedtut Hill, MA and it was outstanding. My dirty martini was just right! The tuna tartare was delicious! And my filet mignon was perfect. Miranda took great care of us and made sure it was a special night. Can\u2019t wait to go back soon!\n\nFirst time visiting TCG and I must admit, it was FABULOUS. First, the manager Jeff runs a smooth ship.  His staff are just an amazing group of people.  Feel free to ask for him, he is the real deal.  Had a minor hiccup and Jeff made it right without us even saying a single word. That\u2026is truly superior customer service at its best.\n\nMy waiter Patrick and his co-worker Jose were simply nothing short of remarkable.  I mean, you want a great dining experience, ask for one of these guys, I mean\u2026they WOWED me.  The food was absolutely amazing and the passion fruit mojito was excellent.  The bone-in ribeye\u2026..just O.M.G! The place felt like you were in a law firm.  They do offer valet parking at the front door and the bathrooms were very nice and clean.  Plenty of parking and dress appropriately. Don\u2019t wear t-shirts and your grandfather\u2019s overalls, dress nice, it\u2019s a nice and classy place that your significant other will truly enjoy.\n\nSo, amazing dining experience and would I return?

The Greek salad is always delicious and fresh especially with the grilled chicken breast on top. The pita on the side is always freshly made and delicious. The Greek lemon chicken soup and homemade gazpacho are also favorites.\n\nA deli with huge salads and sandwiches. They did not have table service, but lots of booths and tables were available. Most of the items on the menu are big enough to serve for two. I took home half of my Cobb salad. Wife took home half of her corned beef sandwich. Onion rings were enough for two, and were very good. We did not try any of the dinner items on the menu.\n\nOrdered a \u201clamb\u201d gyro and I\u2019m almost positive it was actually just beef chunk\u2026. The gyro tasted okay but it was tough to believe anything about the meat was actually lamb. Walked in and it was empty (given, it was a Monday at 6:30pm), the lighting was dark, could barely see into the display shelves at the counter. Just a lot of work that needs to be done here before I\u2019d consider going back.\n\nEverything turned out perfect! I worked with Sean to cater my party. He gave me great suggestions for the menu and the amount. Everything was ready for pick up  at the time we agreed with clear instructions for reheating. The food was delicious, and we all enjoyed without stress. We especially loved the hummus, pita, tzatziki, the pie, kebab and the beet salad. Thank you Sean and Putterham Grille!\n\nA nice selection of sandwiches, salads and deserts. I went there for Lunch and it wasn't crowded, there quite a few tables were taken. We had the Mezza platter which was enough for several people to share. The decor is pleasant so are the wait staff. The food was very good, and the portions are ample. Prices are reasonable.

The patio is an absolute gem, one of the best in greater Boston. Can\u2019t say enough good things and highly recommend giving Devlin\u2019s a try!\n\nIt's one of my favorite spots. The food is always consistent. I got the plantain tacos. They weren't bad! The steak ones were better though. The sticky toffee pudding dessert was amazing. The service is always great. Don't miss trying this place out.\n\nGreat pun food and salads. Bloody Mary was just average but good none the less. Private outdoor patio area (well away from the street) with it's own bar is a perfect place to get together after work. They have a varied brunch menu as well. Worth the trip?\n\nSteak tips the right size for medium-rare were perfect, as was the grilled brussel sprouts and lobster casserole...in a comfy classic atmosphere backed by attentive wait and generous barkeep services. Made our multi-cultural trio feel relaxed and focused on each other's conversations. \u2705\u2705\ud83c\udf89\n\nQuickly became my favorite outdoor patio dining experience.

Somehow I never made my way over here and now I wish I had gone sooner! With so few neighborhood bars in the area, I'm so glad that I not only found one, but a great one. It looks like there is. Trivia night on Tues which I will def check out!\nThe atmosphere is bright and cheery despite a little sticky menu grime. While you wait they give you the most buttery salty movie theater popcorn to munch on. The food was very good. I recommend the surprisingly good clam strip roll and the burgers are juicy and delish. Gluten free rolls are available too.\nThe service here is stand out. The wait staff is genuinely friendly and they truly offer great service.\nI wouldn't come here to impress visiting in town family, but for those more frequent times where you want a comfortable friendly neighborhood spot where you can watch the game, enjoy a cold beer, and eat some comfort food, this is your place.\n\nEverything is great at this place food is amazing can't go wrong with anything here to eat. But a must try is the wings they are so big and juicy. I couldn't pick a sauce or flavor so I got plain bone-in and got sauces on the side. It is a home feeling kinda place not so updated but worth eating here. Don't miss out on a wonderful experience people. I been there two times already bringing more people each time I go.\n\nInteresting rustic pub feel.  The wait staff was on target. The menu consists of sandwiches, apps and a couple of entrees. The food was pretty good.  Basic food with reasonable costs.\n\ni have to say that this place has the best onion rings! i have had many dishes here but almost always get onion rings. this visit i got the smoke house burger and my partner had the ultimate chicken sandwich which i have had before. everything had a great flavor and was cooked to order. the staff was attentive and very polite. will definitely be going back.\n\nWe go there all the time! Love this place! Great food, great atmosphere. Great bartenders and servers. NEVER a problem. Unfortunately..  last 2 visits we got chicken wings which are usually perfect. Got Teriyaki a  thin sauce so we could see the freezer burn on our wings. It was disgusting. At home if you grab something out of the freezer and see freezer burn you throw it out as to not serve it to your family and friends. Disappointed in the cooks, as how would the owners know? They rely on there cooks to serve to their Guests quality food.  Cooks if you won\u2019t eat it throw it away! Owners talk to the kitchen! Are  you aware of it what\u2019s going on?

The skin was crispy but a bit too hard. As for the meat some parts were juicy but some were too dry and hard. The accompanying vege also seemed a bit sad..\n\nEaten here twice - once in the evening and this time during lunch. The grilled pork belly is very juicy and slightly crispy on the outside, and has that awesome bbq aroma. I would love to eat that chilli but I did not as I would definitely break out in sweat. It\u2019s so satisfying just eating the pork belly and rice.\n\nWe had a Lechon dish ( roasted pork with rice) quite nice, but another time we try the a potion without rice, it was too many fat inside. We always eat in the timbre near expo. I guess should tell the staff give us the less fat one \ud83d\ude01. Their sauce is yummy with the meat\n\nDisgusting attitude from the large Chinese woman serving. I have bought Filipino food from here several times yet have never encountered the type of attitude I just received from this so-called server. I approached the counter and in my friendliest voice I asked \"Hello, do you have lechon?\" The woman totally ignored me and refused to answer me even though I asked three times. Eventually she snapped and shouted \"Yeah, I know you want lechon.\" I asked her if they had it (they often sell out) and again she refused to answer me. I will not give my money to support someone with such a disgusting and hostile attitude so I spent my $40 at the Thai stall next door where I received friendly service. Will not go back to this stall while this disgusting woman who doesn't understand customer service works there.\n\nI believe that this is the Filipino version of roasted pork rice. The meat is tender and skin is crispy. Soup that came with it was a tad salty but it blended well with the set.\nThe restaurant is located in Timbre+, a cool looking conversion from the typical JTC factory canteen.\n\n\nOption: 2:\nName: Gerry's Grill Singapore@Orchard\nAddress: Cuppage Road Starhub Centre, 229469 No. 51, 229469\nPhone: None\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: Closed\nTuesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4\nReviews: \n\n5-star service with average dishes.  This may be the first restaurant that my eldest specifically asked if I was going to provide feedback because he loved the service so much.  I have to concur, the staff at Gerry\u2019s certainly made us feel right at home.  The dishes however were average at best, reminiscent of what I\u2019ve had elsewhere, but definitely on the pricey side and seemingly confused as to what customer palates they are catering for.  The sisig and grilled squid are worth a try.  We\u2019ll be back given it\u2019s family friendly and a convenient option when we have a craving for Filipino food.\n\nNever had Filipino food before, and was pleasantly surprised by the fare at Gerry's Grill. The restaurant has a friendly family restaurant vibe, and the service is good.\n\nRecommended dishes include the mackerel with grilled pork, and the Halo Halo dessert.\n\nBe careful of over ordering as portions tend to be very generous as well. Will come back again.\n\nStandard dropped :( I last ate this in 2019 and it was so so good. But in my recent visit in Oct 2023, it didnt taste as good as before.\n\nPork sisig was a total let down. I remember this place has my fav sisig but this time, it just tasted off. Very charred and lacking in flavour.\n\nAdobo was okay but veryyy salty.\n\nLumpia used to be very good too. Now, just average.\n\nPerfect place to go to in Singapore if you want quality Filipino food to satisfy your cravings! Service is quite fast. Place is clean and cool. Staff are friendly. Food is delicious. Very much happy and will visit again \ud83d\ude0a\n\nTried this Filipino restaurant as a reco from a Filipino friend. Food was ok, a bit pricy and quality is mediocre. We tried a bunch of dishes because it was out first time. Each dish is about $17 (nice portions tho). The grilled and roasted pork were the best. The yellow noodle dish (can\u2019t remember the name) was really weird but strangely addictive. Everything is a bit oily so be prepared. The place is very quiet (we went for a late lunch) so no issues to get a table. Overall a so so experience\u2026it felt like being in the Philippines which was the objective.\n\n\nOption: 3:\nName: Lutong Pinoy Restaurant\nAddress: 304 Orchard Rd, #B1-16 Lucky Plaza, Singapore 238863\nPhone: 6887 4481\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20098:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20098:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20098:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20098:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20098:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20098:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20098:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 2.6\nReviews: \n\nPaid $48 for this at LECHON PINOY. Not coming back.\n\nOrdered Lechon Sisig which WASN'T SIZZLING, it was warm but NOT HOT. Flavour was more towards (shredded) Lechon than a sisig fusion, lacked basic sisig ingredients like onion, soy sauce and egg.\n\nOrdered Laing and Bopis too. While I couldn't complain on the flavours, they were ala carte portions and of course priced as one dish. I asked if there's a side dish option so I could order more, but was told they don't. In the end, me and my company had too much leftovers.\n\nThis is a crook place. Twice I ate there, they charged crazy prices. I thought I wanted to try filipino food but never at this place again. A small bowl of beef lungs, he charged $7.50 & it stank and tasted bad. the same for a bowl of vegetables takeaway..$7.50 too!! What a rip off! \ud83e\udd2c\ud83e\udd2c\ud83e\udd2c\n\nAVOID AT ALL COST!!! robbery at broad daylight. pretty expensive for a filipino food. which is not that extra ordinary when it comes to taste. $25 for lunch.\n\nI had the Lechon in Lechon Pinoy (i believe they are the same owner with Lutong Pinoy). The Lechon was perfect - moist interior and crispy exterior\n\nThe beef soup is very nice. Broth is very tasty and the meat so tender. $14 for 2 bowls of rice and soup with big chunks of meat.\n\n\nOption: 4:\nName: Yakiniku Like (The Clementi Mall)\nAddress: 3155 Commonwealth Ave W, #05-35/36/37, Singapore 129588\nPhone: 6974 9956\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.3\nReviews: \n\nLocated on the 4th level of The Clementi Mall, head to green MRT line and alight at Clementi station and take the exit towards the mall. Head up to the 4th floor and they are located beside Wing Stop.\n\nThe concept of this restaurant is interesting as they are not halal and serves premium pork, chicken and beef, even Wagyu for a personalized BBQ. Restaurant occupancy is about 40 to 60 pax and dining is allowed for 60 minutes. A QR code will be provided by the staff when they show you to your seat which will be used to browse their menu and order food. Staff are friendly and trying their best to serve you as fast as they can.\n\nThe meat they serve is acceptable and with the price of their value meals, it's really value for money. I would recommend paying a little more for the extra portion. Each value meal comes with a small bowl of kimchi and a variety of sauces on your table. Beef lovers might just love it here as you can grill your meat to your liking. Chicken would not be as easy as they use the thigh meat and when sliced, there are many small pieces which could drop into the grill. I have the say the pork is great and with the option to add on pork jowl, you have to come try it for yourself.\n\nOverall a must try for Yakiniku lovers that aren't looking for a buffet setup but just for a quick BBQ fix at an affordable price. I have snapped their QR code for you to take a queue number while you're heading down as the queue is longer during peak hours thus won't need to waste too much time.\n\nYakiniku Like\u2019s beef is the freshest amongst All the Yakiniku and they have many side dishes when you order set with even choice of rice quantity. The only con is that when 2 pax are dining, have to share a table with 2 other pax. Happened to share with a man who was coughing throughout our meal, very unhygienic.\nMaybe Yakiniku can consider putting a movable screen in between groups of customers  to avoid the spread of viruses.\n\nFood is as usual nice. However I still feel they should extend the eating time to more than 50 min.\n\nMy daughter and I were on the way to JEM for Yakiniku-GO, when this place popped up searching through Google maps. Attracted by the Taiyaki Mochi, we decided to try. It\u2019s almost, but not as good - sauces, smaller heating bbq area, less spacious. The one plus is the Taiyaki Mochi - was a real treat, but possible to buy frozen options online to do at home. So bottom line, still prefer our original place for Yakiniku.\n\nOverall a pleasant dining experience! Second time visiting this outlet. Restaurant environment is clean and the design of the grill makes it non-smoky and greasy when grilling meat. Restaurant staff are friendly and helpful too, they were quick and sincere in rectifying the mistake when one of the staff sent me the wrong kind of meat. And I think the quality of the meat cuts is pretty good for the price point! Nice kimchi side dish too.\n\n\nOption: 5:\nName: Mamitas' Kitchen Singapore\nAddress: 304 Orchard Rd, #02-60 Lucky Plaza, Singapore 238863\nPhone: 9657 9557\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: Closed\nTuesday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20097:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20097:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20097:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20097:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20097:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20097:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 3.6\nReviews: \n\nI'm glad to visited there ! Filipino cuisine is known for its variety of flavors, textures and colors. From the flavorful adobo to the soup. there's something for everyone. I'm sure you found plenty of delicious dishes to enjoy.\n\nI had an incredibly disappointing experience at this restaurant. Not only was the food served to me raw, but the owner's aggressive and confrontational attitude towards my complaint was truly unacceptable. As a customer, I expected to be treated with respect and professionalism. I strongly advise others to be cautious when considering dining here, as my encounter left me feeling both unsafe and unsatisfied\n\nGreat Comfort foods here!!!\nShout out to Mamita's Kitchen\n:) Mapa meat or veggie ulam, panalo\n\nHelped my Filipino colleagues to buy their lunch from here and they were nothing but utterly RUDE! requested for vinegar, patis with chili padi and they commented \"so many requests a!\" When I reach our ofc and open the orders, they ended up not giving the requested vinegar.

It's a rustic Pinoy place serving the familiar Philippines fair. If you really like strong tasting food, then this is the place to visit. Bulalo soup is SGD20 per bowl, and it's large enough for 2 pax. They serve desserts herr as well if you are game for it.\n\nTosilog is actually a combination of the different components of the meal - Tocino (cured pork), Sinangang (garlic fried rice), and Itlog (egg). The cured pork was so thick and flavourful, almost like a version of charsiu with sweetness to it, but might be somewhat tough for some. The Sinangang was the star of the show though, so fragrant and aromatic and paired so well with the meat and egg. The soup was sour (in a good way) and helped to cut through the oiliness. Overall, enjoyed this Tosilog Set ($7.50).\n\nHad the Maja Blanca ($2.30 per pc) too. Also called Coconut Pudding, this is made from coconut milk, cornstarch, and sugar. Corn kernels are also added to give added sweetness and crunch. Thick and creamy, this was similar to the Nyonya kueh of my childhood. The toasted coconut flakes at the side also paired so well with the pudding. Delicious!\n\nFilipino caifan with a large variety of dishes to choose from. Saw many filipinos choosing the fried bangus fish and took it. Was disappointed as it was cold and tasted like mackerel with a slight sour taste not worth the price of 9.50. The kare kare fared better. It was thick and rich in peanut flavour and came with soft stewed vegetables and chunky pork belly\n\nFeels very homely! I love coming to this place once in a while to try out the different dishes. Yesterday I had some sisig and other side dishes, it was delicious!\n\nPrice is still general.\n\nFood is ok, just that it is not very hot as it turn cold very fast due to the great aircond despite of helping us to microwave it.\n\nWill go try out other dishes there.  :)\n\n\nOption: 7:\nName: Inasal Restaurant\nAddress: 304 Orchard Road, #04-49/50/51, Lucky Plaza, 238863\nPhone: 8722 5433\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20098:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20098:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20098:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20098:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20098:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20098:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20098:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 3.3\nReviews: \n\nFirst time in this place and it's quite interesting as the first thing that hits you are all the Filipino breads, fried snacks and desserts and the front. Enter from the right through a small corridor to reach the restaurant. Self service so you order can get you food order disc and sit and wait.\nItems like pan de sal, kutschinta and flan are showcased at front with wafts of freshly baked bread enticing you to buy buy buy.\nIn the restaurant a simple menu awaits but a very tempting one as the grilled chicken and pork belly were excellent.\nThe presentation was simple with just one bowl of rice. You would need to order vegetables separately if you wanted a balanced meal.\n\nThis is just a regular butter cheese bread which is selling in a Philippines Bakery & Restaurant in Lucky Plaza, Singapore. Though it\u2019s fluffy and buttery, no other things stands out for these. Probably can give other items a try next time.\n\nOverpriced And Disappointing.  This restaurant serves classic Filipino dishes and priced a bit higher than other Filipino restaurants in Lucky Plaza so I thought its going to have at least good quality.  Boy was I wrong.. I ordered pork kare kare and its tasteless and is not as creamy as its suppose to be.  The meat is also very bland.  The bagoong saved the whole dish.  Order also took a bit longer than usual and its not crowded at all.  The dining area is poorly lit and looks like an abandoned warehouse.  Service also not great.  Never coming back.\n\nOrdered lechon kawali because it was recommended by my my friends. It was ok, but i think lechon in the food court b1 would probably be the better choice. It\u2019s slightly harder and quite pricier compared to the option mentioned. The good thing about inasal is that it also offers desserts and breads from the philippines which taste really good, will probably go back for those and maybe try some other dishes also. Another thing to add is that it\u2019s not as busy as other restaurants during the weekends when others are fully packed.\n\nDelightful Filipino restaurant no shrinkflation here beef bone soup is rich with taste of marrow and more meat than we can chew. Dont miss out their Liempo, nicely marinated and reminiscent of street side grilled meat.\n\n\nOption: 8:\nName: Lechon Republic Singapore\nAddress: 275 Thomson Rd, #01-09 NOVENA REGENCY, Singapore 307645\nPhone: None\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: Closed\nTuesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20098:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20098:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20098:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20098:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20098:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20098:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.4\nReviews: \n\nThe Lechon $12.50 set is good. Very crispy skin. Goes very well with the sauce. On the other hand, the sizzling hot plate (Lechon sisig) $12.50 set is too salty. Just get the normal Lechon.\n\nAlways curious about Filipino food and their famous Lechon so gave this restaurant a try.\n\nThe Lechon has crispy skin and quite juicy. Overall flavor of the various dishes is more muted and tend towards a more thicker starchy type of sauce. Not so to my taste buds. If you like more subdued flavor and thick sauce then I think this restaurant is for you :).\n\nThe dishes that we enjoy the most are Lechon Sisig Meal ($12.8 comes with 1 drink) (grilled pieces of Lechon that is quite fragrant and has nice crunchy pieces) and Chopped Lechon Meal ($12.8 comes with 1 drink).\n\nTheir signature roasted chopped Lechon is a must-try. Crispy skin, soft tender juicy meat paired with the house made sauce. Next to try is the Mango salad and Sisig.\n\nThe Lechon skin was really crispy, and the best part is the tender and juicy meat under the skin!! Will definitely be back to order a half kilo slab of that. The lunch queue starts around 12:30p on a Sunday, so need to get there early.\n\nProbably the best Lumpia you can find in Singapore! The Lechon have some crispy skin that can hear the sound even when you are sitting opposite! The chicharon has a very unique taste as well! The soup sinigang taste very similar to what you get in Philippines. Highly recommended\n\n\nOption: 9:\nName: Dajie Makan Place\nAddress: 354 Clementi Ave 2, #01-253, Singapore 120354\nPhone: 6774 2030\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 1 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.5\nReviews: \n\nNot crowded with people during Sat lunchtime, no flies, even thought outdoors, not hot.

Today, I decided to try something new other than the usual prata order. Ordered Briyani, and it came with a huge \"mountain\" of rice, and instead of chicken on the rice,  the chicken was served in a separate bowl and was soaked with curry to the brim of the bowl. It is heavenly for curry lovers. Recommended.\n\nNice place to have lunch, dinner or even supper. The food is rather good and the beverages like teh tarik and masala tea are delicious and not overly sweet.\nThe staff are a mixed bag. Not really good with customer service except for a young chap (either Malay or Filipino, not too sure) who is really pleasant.\nAmbience is reasonable for the category and price it charges.\nThe range of food is wide though it does not have the some of the offerings from Evans Road. They are nice enough to put the papadam in a basket for us.\n\nKosong prata was crispy and good. Chicken murtabak had bones bits so that's quite bad even though overall taste was decent. Tea drinks were alright. Burger was ok. Service was decent.\n\nWould still prefer springleaf overall but can't deny that this is more affordable\n\nScoody Dooby Doo Hotdog was very good. However 2nd order was incorrect (wrong dish came) and undercooked. 5 stars for the Hotdog, would eat again.\n\nStop eating from here a few years back. Back then, the food was not as good as before and the cost went up. Heard there was a change of boss. Decided to give it a try again. Cost consider ok. Luckily the food standard is good again. Love the fish curry n chicken marsala.\n",

Starting from the hummus, absolutely generous and delicious portions. Perfect appetizer.\n\nThe butter rice with kebab was crazy delicious, we literally scraped the plate clean from the rice and the greek yogurt like substance in the centre.\n\nPizza was crispy and fragrant at the same time, the tomato sauce parts was absolutely amazing.\n\nStrawberry drink was okay!!! Not super special but nice!\n\nIn the middle of Arab street you find this restaurant. We were welcomed\u00a0by a real Turkish guy. Very friendly and he could advise us what was the best to order. We sat outside, along\u00a0the street. Within 15 min the table was full with all kinds of grilled meat. Real Turkish flavors and a nice apple tea were enough to make my day complete. Eating here, and watching the people pass by is a big joy.\n\nParking in this area is very hard, as you can understand.\n\nHad a great dinner here today. My friend saw this online with high rating stars so we just stopped by after work.  And yes, the food is delicious, the atmosphere is awesome, love the music too.\nSo if your family or friends are outgoing and friendly, this is the right place for you to gather together and laugh together and dance together !\n\nCuisine is new to me as a traveller. Trying the dish with my arab friends and the chef being a wonderful host in telling us about the different food added to the stellar experience of dining here. Service was awesome. Food was a good blend of flavors.\n\nJust returning home from an amazing service and hospitality from Cappadocia.\nChef Ahmed Hagras went out of his way to arrange a very sweet surprise for my husband's birthday at my request.\nThe whole staff sang happy birthday for him with a special kunafe.\n\nThe food itself is finger licking good, no doubt.

The quality of the ingredients was evident in every bite, and the presentation was a feast for the eyes.\n\nThe staff at Derwish are not only knowledgeable about the menu but also passionate about ensuring a memorable dining experience. Their attentiveness and friendly demeanor added to the overall positive atmosphere.\n\nHad a delightful dining experience at Derwish Turkish! The mixed kebab platter was outstanding; I was trying to control my carbs but I couldn't get enough of the fragrant rice. The hummus was good, although the bread was a bit tough for my liking. However, what truly stood out was the exceptional service. The staff was incredibly friendly and always had a smile on their faces, which added to the overall splendid experience. Looking forward to visiting again!\n\nEverytime I have a loved one visiting Singapore, I always take them here. I always come back here for the food and service. The food is great - big serving and authentic and I love their Bunefe!! \u2665\ufe0f The service is top notch, leaving us satisfied every single time. Will surely be back with other loved ones who are about to visit. \ud83e\udd70\n\nGreat food and service. Food is definitely wayyy more expensive than the usual, but the taste makes it not such a bad deal. Apple tea is really nice before eating the food, very refreshing and fragrant but after eating any food it doesn't taste as nice.\n\nPeter, the staff here, was exceptionally polite and gave us a warm welcome. When I needed to store my dessert in the fridge, he was incredibly helpful. Peter also recommended their signature dishes, and we decided to try them.\n\nThe Tajin lamb shank was a delightful surprise, with tender, succulent meat that practically fell off the bone. The flavors were rich and aromatic, making it a standout dish.\n\nThe Meze tabagi was a delightful assortment of Mediterranean appetizers, a true explosion of flavors and textures. It included a variety of dips, fresh vegetables, and savory bites, providing a wonderful contrast of tastes.\n\nFor a refreshing beverage, we ordered the Mango Ayran. It was a perfect balance of sweet and tangy, making it a great complement to our meal.\n\nUnfortunately, as there were only two of us, we couldn't order the traditional dessert Peter recommended. Nevertheless, we thoroughly enjoyed the atmospheric environment, delicious food, and excellent service provided by the staff.\n\n\nOption: 3:\nName: Alaturka Mediterranean & Turkish Restaurant\nAddress: 15 Bussorah St, Singapore 199436\nPhone: 9434 6026\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.6\nReviews: \n\nI had the pleasure of trying Turkish cuisine for the first time, and it was truly a delightful experience! The standout dish for me was the lamb; it had absolutely no odor and tasted fantastic. The grilled items were a highlight as well, bursting with delicious flavors. The restaurant\u2019s ambiance was beautifully decorated, and the staff was both charming and incredibly helpful, taking the time to explain the dishes to us. While it\u2019s not the cheapest option, the prices are fair for the quality you receive.\n\nOne thing to note, though, is that the platter we ordered was described as \u201cfor two,\u201d but for Asians, it\u2019s considered a generous portion. So, if there are four of you and you\u2019ve already ordered other dishes, I recommend going for the platter for two only; it\u2019s quite substantial. Would recommend to anyone looking for a great dining experience!\n\nFirst time having Turkish food and was really\npleasantly surprised. Their dips and bread was really exceptional. The bread was steaming when it came out it was both crispy and fluffy at the same time. The platter for 2 was also great all the grilled meats was tender and flavourful. Portion was also huge.\n\nVery impressive food & service displayed by the dedicated front staffs and chefs. It\u2019s nice walking in the street after a wine & dine session in the area. The staffs were very attentive, price is reasonable.\n\nVery delicious food with reasonable price.\nMy friend from Turkey said this is the only place with authentic Turkish food. My mom who is super picky about food said their food is good. Their dessert Kunefe is both crispy and creamy.\n\nThe staffs are friendly and knowledgeable. Will visit again.\n\nWent here for a birthday celebration and the attention to detail from their service staff is amazing, didn\u2019t mention to the staff that it was for a birthday celebration, only had a note in the reservation. But they went above and beyond, having candles in the dessert and even giving us props to take pictures with and proceeded to then print out the photo of us to keep!\n\nThe food also matches the service, authentic Turkish cuisine done perfectly, the Hummus was so good we had to order a second portion! I\u2019m not usually a fan of chicken but the chicken that came with the platter blew my mind, so juicy and tender. Then comes dessert, my first time having Kunefe and the only thing I have to say is that I wish I didn\u2019t share it, wanted it all to myself \ud83e\udd23\n\nDefinitely coming back here again!\n\n\nOption: 4:\nName: Kebab Station\nAddress: 920 #01-02 ECP, Parkland Green, Singapore 449875\nPhone: 9697 8227\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 3.9\nReviews: \n\nThis is the most awesome place in all of Singapore! Huge veranda overlooking the park, delicious Turkish food! Super hospitable staff! Everything is always delicious, fresh, you can only enjoy food and views with such pleasure here! I would never have thought that there were such wonderful places in this city!\n\nI ordered the baked cheese rice with chicken and it was pretty good, adequate cream sauce with the rice, the chicken was tasty & the melted cheese made it all better overall. Although I would say that the portion is slightly small, but perfect for one person. The other dish was kebab chicken rice - the shredded chicken was really good and the rice had a delicious buttery taste too. It came with some salad on the side, although without salad sauce, when paired with the chicken and rice it was a good meal :) The drinks prices were too high though, does not seem worth it.\n\nAwesome food - awesome people - great location!\nTrue Turkish hospitality!\nOur favourites are\n-the Turkish tea\n- Adana kebab\n- Lahmacun (bread with Lamb meat )\n- Ekmek (Bread)\n- Lavash (Turkish Bread)\n\nPricing is a bargain compared to other Turkish Restaurants in Arab Street.\nFor us it\u2019s our everyday go to!\n\nFood is a little towards dry but fragrant and taste is acceptable. Service is not so fantastic, 2 people sharing but no side plates and only given 2 thin pcs of serviette which we used to  hold the pizza. Venue is still considered good and outdoot sitting is pet friendly.\n\nOverall, it's something can consider to try. Still grateful for making their outdoor sitting pet friendly.\n\nUnassuming on the outside with minimal decor on the inside, I thought that there\u2019s no way this place could be selling authentic middle eastern food!\n\nBut of course I was wrong. Meat dishes are decently priced and delicious, baked goods are fresh, and the Kunafe is deeelightful.\n\n\nOption: 5:\nName: Istanbul Grill\u2019s & Cafe\nAddress: 25 Baghdad St, Singapore 199664\nPhone: 9130 3043\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.2\nReviews: \n\nWe ordered mixed grills with chicken and beef.

The staff were committed to great service and were very friendly. The atmosphere was awesome and I definitely liked that you have a very modern style. Most importantly, every food and drink on your menu tasted great\n\nI've had lunch there. The waiters were friendly. They gave me a complementary Apple Tea \ud83c\udf75 since it's lunch time. The food is pretty good. The Turkish taste is there. They have plenty options. Unfortunately most of the beef items were unavailable. Had to choose the lamb ones. It's really tasty nonetheless. They also have good chicken and vegetarian options.\n\nWe used the Eatigo discount and its definitely worth it.. the foods are great, taste just fantastic to our liking! The waiter is friendly to recommend us their signature foods too..\n\nMy first time having Turkish cuisine and I enjoyed my food here. Love the hummus, great flavour. Ordered Istanblue kebab - Doner and lamb chop has great flavour, goes well with rice, rice was flavourful. Their garlic yogurt dip is tasty too I love it.\n\nGot to try kunefe, really sweet and not for those who doesn\u2019t have a sweet tooth. Washed it down and cleanse my palate with their Turkish Apple tea. Fragrant, but can\u2019t really taste much apple note for the tea. Overall, decent.\n\nService by the Chinese guy was good, but the food was really so so and would have been very expensive (avg $25/main) if not for the entertainer app we used. We tried their most popular mains and switched the rice to pita bread. But the bread was very stale and tough, the meat was so so and we ordered hummus which tasted rather diluted. The only good dish was the kunefe, although somehow it's really oily. I'm not sure if that's normal cos this is only the second time I'd eaten kunefe and the last time I had it elsewhere, it wasn't swimming in oil. We literally poured the oil out on a separate dish and it was a lott of oil...\n\nSetting was pretty although it was mostly empty on a Sunday lunch time, not surprised \ud83d\ude05\n\n\nOption: 7:\nName: Chef Ahmet Deli Turk\nAddress: 239 Jln Kayu, Singapore 799463\nPhone: 6481 1083\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.9\nReviews: \n\nBest hummus in Singapore!

We ordered the Mixed Jumbo Kebab Platter for us to share and followed by Kunefe with ice cream for dessert. They even sang birthday song to me when they presented the dessert with a candle on it. It is very nice and I appreciate their thoughtfulness.\n\nWe are impressed with the jumbo platter as all the meat and veggies are well prepared, well marinated and well cooked. We finished everything off the plate. It is simply delicious. We also enjoyed the Turkish Tea and dessert.\n\nWe will definitely return to try out other food from here again.\n\nIf you follow my Google reviews, you'll know I'm very critical. Yet, this is a restaurant that I'm giving a full five-star rating. That is because it's really perfection!\n\nThis was my third visit, and this time was with a group of friends. I was not kidding when I shared that I liked the food here more than what I had when I was in Istanbul! Was it because they catered well to the local Singaporeans? I'm unsure, but I really liked the Turkish food here! Most importantly, the service quality here had been great thus far! Please maintain!\n\nSuch a gem! The food was so I\u2019m very impressed!! Some meats are dry but overall the food is so good! I love the hummus dips! Our table was nxt to the glass so the view was amazing!!! The food does get cold fast because the place is cold!\n\nI love love love the desserts they are super sweet as expected of Turkish desserts but with their tea or coffee it is perfection! Will come back for the desserts!!\n\nMy partner and I had a wonderful anniversary lunch at Sofra Turkish restaurant. We were impressed by the authentic and delicious Turkish food, the friendly and attentive service, and the cozy and relaxing ambience. We ordered the mix platter salad, the chicken Adana kebab, the baklava, and the Turkish coffee, and we enjoyed every bite and sip. The salad was fresh and flavorful, the kebab was tender and juicy, the baklava was sweet and crunchy, and the coffee was strong and aromatic. The portions were generous and satisfying. The staff were very kind and helpful, and they even gave us an extra dessert to celebrate our special occasion. We felt very welcomed and appreciated. The restaurant has a nice view of the CBD and esplanade, which added to the romantic atmosphere. We had a great time at Sofra Turkish restaurant, and we highly recommend it to anyone who loves Turkish cuisine. It is one of the best Turkish restaurants we have ever been to.\n\nAmazing food. Would recommend! Good options but most of it are variation of similar items. Service is friendly and prompt. Prices are slightly above average but portions are good for sharing, so its good for groups. Great outdoor views (minus the heat). Would be good if there are those  mist-fans or coolers outdoor.\n\n\nOption: 10:\nName: Istanbul Turkish & Middle Eastern Cuisine\nAddress: 25 Baghdad St, Singapore 199664\nPhone: 6296 4084\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.6\nReviews: \n\nFriendly staff\nFoods were delicious and well cooked\nFree complementary\nPrice was okay and worth to eat.\n\nIf you are coming Singapore don\u2019t hesitate to visit this restaurant.\n\nFood was really really good, it improved my mood to be even better.

The malakoff and coucou salad was very good with us feeling of wanting more. The crescendo of the evening would definitely be the venison striploin from their seasonal menu. Really nice texture and went perfectly with the cranberry sauce accompanying it. Wanted to have the chocolate fondue for dessert but we were so stuffed that we just opted for the seasonal dessert of vanilla ice cream with Chantilly cream.\nService staff was excellent and attentive. Always checking in on us to make sure everything was to our liking.\nThank you to Chef Yves and the staff of Coucou for the wonderful evening.\n\nNice place with interesting food. Cheese fondue is slightly expensive but unfortunately had a slightly bitter taste. Would not recommend this dish.\nRosti and steak is good. Desserts are ok too.\nService is great with many attentive servers, there was almost no wait for any requests. Atmosphere is good too, just slightly cramped but not to much inconvenience.\nOverall a good experience and nice place.\n\nMy second visit to Coucou: first time with a group of 6, the next with 2. Better to dine with a bigger group as you can try more dishes (the cheese fondue might get a too rich after a while). The meringue dessert was not too sweet and was paired well with fresh berries.\n\nThe service staff was very friendly and patient with us. As we were leaving the restaurant it started raining heavily , so we decided to head back in for some desserts. As it was getting quite cold inside, we requested for a table outside and the waiter was very accommodating where he took the extra effort to find us another table.\n\nThank you for a great dinner and will return again!\n\nwe called in to make a reservation instead of online and they were nice to arrange an indoor seating for us nevertheless \u263a\ufe0f\nwe ordered the original cheese fondue (comes with free flow bread) - amazing though gets a little salty after a while!\nwe also had cordon bleu which was crispy but quite lacking in taste (likely because of the saltiness from the cheese fondue which ruined our taste buds haha) and spatzli (very disappointing in taste).\ntotal damage was $150~\nnote: for the cheese fondue min order is 2 pax which is $70++ so can just order for 2 pax then whole table (more than 2 pax) share also OK \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\n\nWould rate this place 4.5/5!! We ordered the Cordon Bleu, Rosti Zermatt and the Ovomaltine Mousse. Cordon Bleu was nice - the breaded crust was well done, the chicken was yummy but could be a little more moist. Rosti Zermatt was slightly underwhelming for us - the cheese and ham were good, but rosti was a little too thick and hard. Ovomaltine Mousse was amazing - the ginger bread was yummy even on its own and the mousse was really light. We spent $97 for three dishes. Staff was extremely attentive - filling up our cups many times without having to ask for a refill. They also cleaned our table before serving the dessert.

The star of the show was undoubtedly the steak and fries, while i order the oysters as well. The fries were absolutely amazing, perfectly crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside, making for an irresistible side dish.\n\nWhile the quality of the steak was commendable, I must admit that the accompanying sauce fell short of my expectations. It had a slightly acidic taste that didn't quite complement the flavors as I had hoped. However, this minor setback didn't overshadow the overall dining experience.\n\nThe service at the restaurant was top-notch, with attentive staff members who were friendly and accommodating. They ensured that my dining experience was pleasant and enjoyable. The ambience of the restaurant added to the overall charm, creating a cozy and inviting atmosphere that made me feel right at home.\n\nIn conclusion, while the sauce accompanying the steak was a bit disappointing, the delicious fries, excellent service, and cozy ambience more than made up for it. Additionally, the restaurant's location in a beautiful area added an extra element of charm. I would highly recommend visiting this establishment for a memorable dining experience.\n\nThe steak at this restaurant is delicious, and I highly recommend trying either the entrec\u00f4te or the tenderloin. The quality of the meat is exceptional, and it's definitely a highlight of the dining experience.\n\nHowever, I must mention that the service could use some improvement. On a couple of occasions, I had to remind the staff to provide napkins, which is a minor inconvenience. Additionally, the waiters seemed inexperienced in pouring wine, resulting in a small amount of wine being wasted. It would be beneficial if the staff received further training in these areas to enhance the overall dining experience.\n\nOne aspect worth noting is that the restaurant charges $3 per bottle of still water, as indicated on the receipt. While this might not be a significant issue for some, it's worth considering for those who prefer complimentary tap water or have budgetary constraints.\n\nOn a positive note, the ambiance and surroundings of the restaurant are quite pleasant, making it an ideal location for a romantic date. The attractive setting adds to the overall experience and creates a welcoming atmosphere.\n\nIn summary, while the steak at this restaurant is undeniably delicious, there are a few aspects of the service that could be improved, such as the attentiveness of the staff and their knowledge of wine pouring. Additionally, the extra charge for still water might be a consideration for some diners. Nevertheless, the restaurant's charming ambiance makes it a recommended choice for a memorable date night.\n\nOrdered a set meal(58++) for lunch.\nFor the starter, the snail prepared with butter and garlic is good while the baguette is kinda soggy and considered normal. 3.5/5\nThe green salad is below average. Lettuce not fresh and seasoning bad. 2/5\nFor the main course, the trimmed steak is good. I ordered medium and readiness is excellent. The secret sauce is a bit sour for me but still good. It would be better if the gravy could be served separately. The portion of fries is super large and I cannot even finish half. 4/5\nFor the dessert, Paris Brest is chosen but it really disappointed me. The cream is soaking, making it impossible to be cut into small parts. 2/5\nOverall, the taste is good, mainly contributed by the taste and portion of the main course. 3.5/5\nService is good and attentive but I might be smoked. Atmosphere is good. Wine and cocktail list falls on the expensive side.\nIn summary, it serves some good steak but other dishes a bit disappointing. Besides, kinda pricey.\n\nHad a nice lunch at the quiet atmosphere in the afternoon. The drinks served was tasty and the wine is good as well.\nThe lunch menu is very affordable and the signature steak is flavourful. The sauce and fries are free flow as well. Do note that the salad and steak are already part of the 2 items fixed in the set lunch when choosing between 3 course and 4 course.\nOverall, would definitely come back again to try more of their selections and to thank the service staff Nisha for providing us good service!\nDined: Oct 6th\n\nglad that we reserved a table indoors on a Saturday evening as the place was pretty packed when we arrived. service was friendly & prompt, with the staff knowledgeable on their menu offerings. limited mains available, but it wasn't an issue for us as we came specially for their steak & fries. requested for my steak to be done medium-well & was really pleased with the doneness when it was served. also happy to know that they provide free flow of their perfectly salted fries! oh so yummy! \ud83d\ude0b just note parking might be tricky if you're planning to dine during peak meal times though.\n\n\nOption: 4:\nName: Latteria Mozzarella Bar\nAddress: 40 Duxton Hill, Singapore 089618\nPhone: 6025 6025\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.4\nReviews: \n\nGood Italian restaurant to have afternoon lunch. Cozy while not crowded, compared to evening. Liked its fried calamari, crispy outside and tender inside. Salad was quite sumptuous, only that we had to ask for additional dressings and some salt to add flavour. Beef cheek was fantastic and recommended, while the pumpkin mac & cheese was ok although I were not crazy about. Night time was a great place to be. Price was above average.\n\nWe were here to celebrate a colleague\u2019s birthday. The ambience was great and food was delicious. Homemade Gnocchi with Porcini Mushrooms was certainly my favorite. Service staff were friendly and attentive. Overall it was a pleasant and enjoyable dining experience.\n\nDelicious Italian food in a nice, mostly outdoor setting. Very nice patio, much of it covered if needed, and some indoor seating. Food was great, loved the gnocchi in truffle cream sauce. The namesake mozzarella dishes were also very good. The service was friendly, but sometimes hard to find. Would definitely go back again.\n\nI came here for dinner with a friend. The restaurant is in a great location and the outdoor space is particularly lovely at night. Their speciality is of course the variety of Italian cheeses they offer, but this also leads me to why I don\u2019t come here more often: the menu isn\u2019t really the best for couples. It would be great if they offered portions or even a mix of cheese dishes that were sized and priced appropriately for two people to share. As it is, they\u2019re a little large and, frankly, rather expensive. Likewise, the rest of the menu offers some nice dishes, but it\u2019s not a huge range and we struggled a bit to find things we could share. For larger groups, I think this would be less of a concern, and there is a set menu available, as well. I just wish they had a more couples-friendly menu. The dishes we tried were of course all very tasty. Likewise, service was nice and friendly.\n\nWe ordered the smoked burratina which was really good and I mean the mozarellas are a must order since its in the name. Pastas were good but the mains stood out for me. Service was great as well, staff were attentive and friendly. I really loved the ambience as well, the outdoor seating just felt so cozy and intimate.\n",

Enjoyed the food! I do not know remember the exact name of the food my friend ordered but here are the pictures! I like the red wine with fruits. Tasted sweet so good for ladies. The meat in the pan is the chicken.\n\nIt was a packed evening with a good crowd.\nWe ordered 3 dishes. I would recommend a party of 4 to really go enjoy the food as they are made for sharing.\n\nAfter a while, you start to see similarities in the ingredients and basically dipping into the same sauce and same protein spread across different wraps. I thought there would be more varieties.\n\nOn the whole, service was 5 stars.\nAttentive and warm.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing much you can do with the sewer smell when you sit outside and smokers from the neighbouring drinking joints.\n\nService and food are top notch!

Am definitely coming back!!! Thank you so much for the warm, homely service \ud83d\ude4f\n\nCame by for an afternoon lunch over a weekend. Found the food a bit underwhelming and under-seasoned. Had the fish tacos and quesadillas. Would have been nice if the taco shells were handmade. Anyway, the salsas and dips saved the under seasoned quesadillas for me. We were the only guests at the restaurant at that time.\n\nVivian was very welcoming and sincere in recommending us the dishes for the night.

(especially the brussels sprouts & patatas bravas). short ribs were really tender so that was great. paella was alright for me personally. really liked that the tapas came really fast.\n\nthe cafe is really quaint and cute, love the design but because its size is rather small, the noise depending on the crowd can get quite deafening, inevitably affecting the atmosphere.\n\n\nOption: 3:\nName: Blu Kouzina Siglap\nAddress: 907 E Coast Rd, #01-01, Singapore 459107\nPhone: 9710 8303\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.5\nReviews: \n\nVisited for the first time after hearing good reviews from friends. Awesome ambience and child-friendly. Helpful staff who helped us with food orders and wine recommendation. Dips were great, octopus tender and flavourful. Desserts were also delightful. The standout dish was the lamb chops!\n\nHad dinner some time last week and the food was pretty good but it was quite pricey. The waiter asked if we would like sparkling or still water and we thought still meant free tap water, but it turned out to be $10 bottled water. Don\u2019t make the same mistake as we did if you don\u2019t want to splurge on water!\n\nUnfortunately, we found a piece of stainless steel dish sponge in our food which is quite unhygienic and dangerous. The staff were kind enough to take it off our bill but this was a very eventful first experience dining here.\n\nWent to celebrate birthday with a few friends. The food and service were good. Only disappointment is that when we were leaving the place, the wine was actually not finished.  The staff could do better to confirm if we still want it before throwing the bottle away.\n\nI celebrated my birthday at this restaurant today, and it was a fantastic experience. We had been here a few years ago and were still in love with their delicious dips. This time, we ordered two servings of pita, which filled us up completely! We just couldn't resist that warm, fluffy pita bread \ud83e\uded3. After reading some reviews that praised the lamb shank, we took Uncle Bob's recommendation and were not disappointed. The staff was incredibly pleasant, and I want to give a big shoutout to Uncle Bob, Manager Jennifer, and Jay for making our celebration even more special. We'll definitely be coming back! \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf7d\ufe0f\ud83d\ude0a\n\nThe food was fantastic. My favourite dish would be the lamb chops - I've never eaten lamb like this before. It was without the muskiness you typically get from lamb, but it was a clear, smooth lamb flavour.\n\nWe had the dessert platter and I'd say the 'spring roll' is the best. the sweet custard with the thin layer pastry exterior makes it the perfect last bite for the meal.\n\nService was excellent. Special shoutout to Hakim who was very attentive and knowledgeable.\n\nThoroughly enjoyed my experience here!\n\n\nOption: 4:\nName: Asador Singapore\nAddress: 51 Joo Chiat Pl, Singapore 427775\nPhone: 9836 1792\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 5:30\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nTuesday: 5:30\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nWednesday: 5:30\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nThursday: 5:30\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nFriday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:00\u202fPM, 5:30\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nSaturday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:00\u202fPM, 5:30\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nSunday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:00\u202fPM, 5:30\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.3\nReviews: \n\nIt was pouring when we arrived. The restaurant should do an extension shelter to help patrons exit the car. Even the lady at the reception did not help to offer an umbrella and just stood at her station. First experience entering the restaurant is spoilt by the lack of the service.\nOnce we were seated, the service staff were attentive. The food was delicious. The sourdough with smoked butter was really good. The bread was crispy on the outside and soft and warm inside. The butter was smooth and smoked well. The rest of the dishes were good too. The jamon was flavorful.\nThe staff offered us to move to their bar for drinks and we moved there once we settled the bill. The bar was cosy and comfortable. Love the vibe.\n\nA beautiful restaurant with excellent and attentive service from everyone. Nothing much to complain about the food, as bread lovers we the warm sourdough and smoked butter did stand out for us, that we ordered another half way into the service. Meat were all well cooked. We were hoping for a chocolate based dessert. The alternative of the interpretation of cafe con leche works well too.\n\nI had a fantastic end-to-end booking experience at this restaurant. The hostess was not only friendly but also very accommodating. The food was delightful and, as a pleasant touch, \"muy rico\" as they'd say in Spanish. Although I was initially suprised to find a limited cocktail menu. It didn't detract from the overall experience. Based on my visit, I've already recommended this establishment to a friend. I'm also looking forward to visiting another restaurant of theirs - Next Door Spanish Cafe, in the near future.\n\nThis is one of those in my todo visit place for a while. The food and service surpassed all our expectations. The sourdough bread may look normal but it is so crusty outside but soft inside. What is more amazing is the house smoked butter which is unlike anything we had before. We were recommended the charred cabbage which is so refreshing before the main dish which is the dry-aged beef rib. It is enough for 3-4 pax comfortably to have room for other dishes. We ended with Pina Colada and a scope of lemon sorbet. It\u2019s a memorable experience I must say.\n\nThe foods are alright but pricing is on the steep side. There is a speakeasy bar in the restaurant itself called 60ml. They make great cocktail and ambience there is much better:)\n\n\nOption: 5:\nName: Lower East Side Tacqueria\nAddress: 19 E Coast Rd, #01-02, Singapore 428746\nPhone: 6348 1302\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20091:00\u202fAM\nSaturday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20091:00\u202fAM\nSunday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.1\nReviews: \n\nTasty mexican food at decent prices.

The staff there were extremely approachable and helpful in recommending dishes and constantly checking in on us. A must visit if you are craving Mexican cuisine and I recommend the Pork Carnitas. Worth the travel to go back again \ud83d\ude0a\n\nWent there for a couple of refreshing beers to end my day and it was great. It was almost closing but the kind staff still served us.

Heads up, do not sit outside unless you want to be a buffet for the mosquitoes like us\ud83d\ude2d\n\nStaff was very friendly, food came on time, not too crowded on a late weekday evening.\n\nPizza was as expected, thin crusts are my favourite and the sauce spread was in appropriate amounts. Ordered the marinara pizza.\n\nRegretted the aglio olio, noodles were too thick, rather tough and garlic was overpowering everything else. Ravioli was right on point with the amount of sauce as well, generous serving.\n\nDesserts were nice\n\nBack in Singapore for a quick trip. Caught up with an old friend and we decided on one of Singapore's OG Italian restaurants.\n\nSoup and pasta were okay. Competent. Tasty enough... although my Carbonara was a tad salty and the sauce was just a bit too thick for my palette.\n\nWas looking forward to the Tiramisu... which was like the go-to hip dessert there during my youth long long time ago \ud83d\ude09 ... I was disappointed. The fingers were not well soaked... it was dry. The chocolate powder was overdone... that was an overdose. My memories were slightly tainted \ud83e\udd28\n\nWas there for dinner on a Sat evening with my family of 8 person. We took the inside table with aircon. The ambience is cosy and nice. The taste and quality of the pasta is generally good. The cream sauced pastas are really thick and rich and can be a little to jelak to finish. My Carbonaro is too salty for my liking, it could be due to to bacon in it. If I am not wrong, I think their they used fresh pasta. Price is of mid-high range.

The curries and naan were delicious. We loved the samosa as an entree. The atmosphere was great and staff were very friendly and welcoming. It\u2019s a great place for dinner with friends or family. Perfect for sharing.\n\nI visited Masalaa Bar on a weekday evening, and I must say, the ambiance was quite enjoyable. The Indian street food and Desi-themed cocktails they offer were a highlight of the evening. I tried their Saffron Royale cocktail, and it truly lived up to its reputation; it was indeed nice.\n\nThe culinary journey continued with a huge masala papad and Vada Pav, both of which were incredibly tasty. The Pani Poori shots with alcohol were a delightful surprise, resembling tequila shots in appearance. The chicken biriyani was another standout, bursting with flavor and deliciousness.\n\nWhile the food and drinks were of very high quality and incredibly tasty, there is room for improvement in service quality. Responsiveness and the dessert experience could use a bit of enhancement. Nonetheless, Masalaa Bar offers a delightful blend of Indian street food and Desi cocktails that's definitely worth trying for the culinary adventure.\n\nWhen we had eaten food few months ago, was good . But today, service was bad, they refused to give napkin after two pieces ,\nPistachio kulfi was made from burnt milk . Chiki ice cream was melted like milk, and full of excessive cardamom. waiter says fridge was not working well\n.it bothers me, even after giving feedback, there is no apology or feeling sorry .no remorse\n\nGreat food and ambience. Non-alcoholic mojito rocked. Tried many vegetarian options and all were good.\n\nVisited Masalaa bar for the first time and we surely were not disappointed. The food menu is limited but has great options for those craving Indian food and some popular Indian snacks like pani puri.\n\nWe ended up trying the masala papad, paneer tikka, tandoori chicken, chicken tikka masala and pudina paratha. Also ordered one of their chilli cocktails which was quite delicious.\n\nOther than one of the paneer slices being burnt, the food was quite delicious and flavourful.\n\nThe prices are slightly on a higher side but if worth visiting for a fun evening.\n\n\nOption: 8:\nName: Georges MADBar & Grill\nAddress: 687 East Coast Road, Frankel Ave, 459055\nPhone: 6441 9122\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 3:00\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nTuesday: 3:00\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nWednesday: 3:00\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nThursday: 3:00\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nFriday: 3:00\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u20091:00\u202fAM\nSaturday: 3:00\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u20091:00\u202fAM\nSunday: 3:00\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.3\nReviews: \n\nGood service and tasty food.

But of course,  that how most of the people are going to choose the place. Nobody likes  empty  pubs and etc.  So far so good.\nWe got a small standing table for two. And we got a menu in 2 min. I was a good start.\nNow its getting a bit more complicated.\nService.   The staff were friendly enough.\nThe first lady gave the menu and another lady took the order.  Her hands were occupied with a dirty plates so she didn\u2019t write the order. Maybe it wasn\u2019t the case, but nobody cares as long as the result will be satisfying .  But it usually goes with the order mess up as we were predicting.\nSo we ordered 4 glasses of wine,  onion rings, impossible burger and pasta to share.  It was a different waiter every time so I was actually wondering about the result.\nAnd yeah, it was some mistakes like a missing onion rings and 4 glasses became 6. But I do aware about quantity doesn\u2019t mean quality. So even if 10 people will take the order it will take some time to get the job done.  So just be ready to wait and etc. I was prepared.\nFood. Food was tasty. I did like the impossible burger  the most.  It reminded me the time when I wasn\u2019t a vegetarian yet  . Good job.\nDrinks. The house pour wine was a good one as well.\nThis place has some drink promotions and happy hours till 8.00 pm so you can check it out!\n\nOver all> well\n\n\nOption: 9:\nName: Patro's Sports Bar & Restaurant\nAddress: 920 ECP, Singapore 449875\nPhone: 6440 9372\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 3.6\nReviews: \n\nA lovely location by the beach on the East cost. They serve Mexican, Indian, Italian dishes. Beer available on the tap. Food quality OK. Beer pricy at S$14+\nOverall OK for one off visit, especially watching cricket, soccer matches in groups since they have multiple large screens.\n\nFood was ok, service was acceptable. At the beginning, I took a spoon of the butter chicken and found a food wrapper inside. Still, ate and didn't complain. Towards the end of the meal, at the last pc of my naan, I discovered a strand of hair stuck inside. I must be unlucky to see 2 inedible items in 1 meal. Still finished our meal, but not gonna return here again.\n\nHappened upon this great spot for lunch right next to the beach , we had the mexican fare and it didn\u2019t disappoint - tacos , nachos, pasta and pizza - all good. They have a huge menu for both mexican and indian cuisine , next time we will try the indian menu. Service was good and staff friendly. Will be back.\n\nService is really bad. The staff seem to ignore you and you have to call them multiple times to get your order/ food.\n\nLocation is superb. Food is ok. Price is quite high.\n\nBeing on the East Coast Park and one side facing the beach is an added value for this restaurant. Good ambience and if we sit out, view of the water will be clear. Food was average, okie okie taste. We ordered a mix of Mexican and Indian dishes, all turned out to ve average. Prices are maintained as per the location. Staff is very friendly and during weekends orders will be served with a delay due to good crowd and many orders.

Whoever the manager was on 20th Sep, 8.34pm.\n\nStandard McDonalds ... crew usually polite and service is above average.\n\n3 stars because no shaker fries as advertised. Only regular fries. And cannot accommodate to simple request to add tomatoes & lettuce to order of angus cheeseburger only can remove cheese & ketchup but no add ons. Geez so calculative. I given up the 2 cheese slices. C\u2019mon lol\n\nAnd so many items not available besides the shaker fries. If it gonna be 24 hours kn a Friday night ... stock up.\n\nManager don't have any idea about how to make payment with PayPal or pay now ...infact he was confused with ez link payment. Finally I make the payment with Ez Link..\n",

All the dishes were so flavourful & delicious!\nSpecial shout-out to Martin, the manager, and his team for the attentive & great dining service provided. We really had an enjoyable time at the restaurant.\nThis is our first visit and it will definitely not our last! (:\n\nCame here with my husband and in laws for his birthday. We started off with the doubles and plantain nachos, then had the spiced lamb, jerk chicken and fisherman stew, all of which were excellent! All of us had cocktails to go with our meal, and the house lime punch was so yum. We have to commend the manager for his wonderful service.  while we did not inform the restaurant that it was my husband's birthday, he made it extra special by giving us a cocktail on the house and also made our desserts complimentary. Thank you very much for the lovely experience and we will be back for sure.\n\nFirst time trying jerk chicken after seeing it countless times online. Fair warning, it packs a punch! \ud83e\udd75 I ordered the Jerk Chicken Skewers and Fish Taco. The taco was drenched in a delicious sauce and I highly recommend ordering this even though it is slightly on the pricier side.\n\nWould love to return with friends and family since none of us have tried Caribbean cuisine before!\n\nThe fisherman\u2019s stew which came with rice and beans was the star of the night - the sauce was filled with seafood-y flavour and goodness. Will come back again just for this dish, and try other appetisers like the Mac and cheese balls. The other dishes we tried were quite decent too, like the BBQ pork ribs.\n\nExcellent selection of food! We had the nachos, curry goat with rice and spiced lamb. Every one of them was well-seasoned, leaving our stomachs feeling happy.\n\nAn area of improvement would definitely be the space- lighting was terrible for good photos. It looked a bit rundown, unless that was the effect they were going for.\n\n\nOption: 2:\nName: Rocking Rickshaw\nAddress: 01-12, Kallang Wave Mall, 1 Stadium Pl, 397628\nPhone: 6282 5174\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: Closed\nTuesday: Closed\nWednesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20091:00\u202fAM\nThursday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20091:00\u202fAM\nFriday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20091:00\u202fAM\nSaturday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20091:00\u202fAM\nSunday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20091:00\u202fAM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 3.5\nReviews: \n\nGreat Indian food here. Serving portions are quite good. tastes authentic. We went for lunch,  so it was not that crowded. Likely to get crowded at night.\n\nIt\u2019s my first time in Singapore and this restaurant did not disappoint. The food is so tasty, the staffs are friendly. We met the owner and he\u2019s so accommodating. There is also a live band at night. CANT WAIT TO GO BACK!\n\nFood was ordinary. Ordered something but something else came. The staff was too busy and it was too loud so we ate it anyway. The staffs were disrespectful and not very accommodating. We told them that the booking was for 2 but they wrote it as 3 and gave us a table and kept on telling us to move to allow walk in customers and last minute booking customers. However, the atmosphere was fun and the singers made our night. Not sure if I\u2019d go back again though.\n\nWas a wonderful experience on Wednesday at Rocking Rickshaw! Amazed that as busy as it was, the waiter still had a smile on his face and tried his best to get our food and drinks to us fast! Food was very good and of course prices are more than competitive. Definitely a highly recommended place for a night of food and drinks plus the live band was great!\n\nWe super enjoy our dine here. Though we are not into Indian food but it was sumptous..not a food to waste. And what I really love are the drinks and the live band.

It was perfect with no glare to eyes. Menu item names were funny. haha.. triggering to try it out. Would suggest this place for both couple dining and team dining. For desserts, expect for vanilla ice cream nothing else was available. Little disappointed that I could not try out the creme brulee :-(\nNachos was too good. Must try. Food was served hot and we all loved it.\n\nThe Troublemaker\n\nAl Capone's Sports Bar + Dining\n\ud83d\udccdKallang Wave Mall, 1 Stadium Pl, #01-15, 397628\n\n\ud83c\udf5c Food wise: For bar food, this was surprisingly good! Better than good actually. Each item on this dish was made perfectly, although it was saucy but it wasn\u2019t too greasy.\n\nThere was this lamb masala, thought to be an oily dish, but it wasn\u2019t! It was fragrant, well balanced flavour of spices and it came with soft and tender lamb! The meat also had the nice aroma of the spices, they were generous about it too! They came with crispy hot bread that one can dip into the sauce of the masala, delicious!\n\nThen there was nachos, so good! Nice and crispy, the nachos were well layered with the guacamole, cheese, and salsa, so refreshing!\n\nThere were also a variety of sausages, 4 different sausages, firm, soft, and tender, some more juicy and the other. Taste wise, they were not very salty, not very sure what was the difference in them though.\n\nThe salad was also tasty and refreshing, fresh, sweet, and appetizing!\n\n\u2728 Ambience wise: Great bar! Very cozy and serves delicious beers!\n\n\ud83e\udd35\ud83c\udffb Service wise: Great!\n\n\ud83d\udcb5 Price wise: $45.90\n\n\ud83e\udef5\ud83c\udffcWhere else will you recommend?\n\nShare with me in the comments below\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffc!\n\n\ud83e\udd17Remember to follow me to see what can make you hungry!\n\nI hardly complain about stuff but i think the establishment needs to improve.\n\nWe waited quite a while for your meal to be served, while the others who came after us were served first\n\nThe lamb shank is such a disappointment! Unfortunately, it didnt make its mark. For the many lamb shanks i have eaten, this one had ONE slice of carrot and ONE slice of garlic bread. The whole dish tasted like it was bought from the wholesaler and heated up over the stove.  Sticking some rosemary and a chilli padi will not add any flavours. Huge disappointment \ud83d\ude44\n\nThe sea bass came much later and by the time it did, the lamb shank turned lukewarm. We requested for roasted vegetables instead of mash potatoes and were told that they can't do so. At least the bass was fresh, but nothing to scream about.\n\nWhen we aaked for more warm water, we were told they already gave us a complimentary glass and had to pay $1 if we wanted more. Hmmm I would imagine that the establishment had already factored these costs into its pricing... Anywayzzz\n\nI doubt we will be back again. We only went in because there werr seata and the other places we wanted to go had really long queues.\n\nWe came here with a big group after a great CrossFit workout at CrossFit Unit in the same building. I only took one for which is my Bangers and Mash but the group ordered all kings of food. The portions are very generous and worthy the price and can be for sharing. We also tried the wings, fish and chips and pasta. All were good.\n\nFood is goods and so are the beer taps. Have Guinness on the tap and have the rest of the team having beers and 1 bottle of whiskey. Food selections are a lot, and the same goes for alcohol selections. The only issue is short-handed and take some time for things to come.  Highly recommend on the platters and the fried chicken in the bucket.\n\n\nOption: 4:\nName: Typhoon Cafe\nAddress: 1 Stadium Pl, #01-35, Singapore 397638\nPhone: 6702 1752\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.2\nReviews: \n\nUpdate: Decided to drop to 4 Stars after my 2nd visit.\n\n2nd visit:\nWent with my gfs to this outlet yesterday. Most of us ordered their set dinner menu which comes with main course & tea set - $15.90. Or, you can change your drink with an add-on of $3.80.\n\nThe consensus among my gfs and I is that although the price for the dinner sets are good, the quality of their mains needs improvement. My Mee Sua was way too salty. The fried salted chicken that came with my Mee Sua was quite tasty. The hot tea & drinks were also really good.\n\nAlthough the restaurant wasn\u2019t too crowded, the senior staff attending to us was quite impatient. I was trying to pay for the bill through my phone, and realised that the only way we can get the $5 discount is by signing up as a member.\n\nThe way the senior staff attended to my queries wasn\u2019t too professional. After I signed up as a member, our mobile order disappeared from my phone. She then came over to take our orders manually, and seemed impatient when doing so.\n\nI was very mindful that we keep to their opening hours, and asked the staff politely what time they close.\n\nWhen the same senior staff replied, she emphasised that it\u2019s 9.45pm quite loudly. I think the way she replied is quite uncalled for. She could have just given a neutral reply.\n\nAlthough I love their desserts, I am not sure whether I\u2019ll return to this outlet after the unpleasant experience.\n\n1st visit:\nMy lucky day! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 I had the restaurant all to myself for about 2 hours on a weekday late afternoon.\n\nFirst time at this eatery. Frankly, what caught my eye was the pretty interior with the huge Turquoise (my fav colour) Ceiling Centrepiece.\n\nI needed a comfy place to have some happy food (aka desserts \ud83d\ude02) & do some work. I asked the staff if I could sit at the big table at the back of the restaurant.\n\nThe staff told me that it\u2019s meant for big groups, but kindly obliged me with my request. That made me happy!\n\nWhat made me even happier was that the dessert that I ordered - Souffle Stackers with Honeycomb Ice Cream - was super yummy! I also ordered a decaf lemongrass tea as I was feeling a bit guilty eating the huge portion of dessert \u263a\ufe0f\n\nI had a good time at this eatery, and I managed to get my work done. It would have been great if the restaurant has wifi. I had to use my personal hotspot to do work on my laptop.\n\nI\u2019ll definitely be back at this outlet or their other outlets to try their other foods.\n\nOrdered a $6.90 small pot of tea and I was told the refill can only be once. I wonder how much does it cost for the tea leaves!?\nThe souffl\u00e9 pancakes are not bad, but the rest are not worth the $.\n\nAmazing customer service especially by Sharon, who is very patient in introducing the food & drinks & she went the extra mile to ask if everything was ok & took care of our requests professionally\u2026\u2026\n\nVery impressed with her service \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\n\nAlso, U must try the \u7f8e\u4eba\u8336 - Yuzu Pu\u2019er with Peach Gum!!!! It tasted so so so heavenly!!!!\n\nWe wanted to try the food typhoon cafe for quite some time and we are happy we finally tried the food here. The items we ordered were close to the taste we had in Taiwan! Dessert looks and tastes awesome! Staff service was excellent! We are sure to come back again!\n\nI recently dined at Typhoon at Kallang Wave Mall and had a mixed experience. The service was generally polite and very attentive throughout the meal, which was great. The portions of food were impressively huge, and considering that, the prices seemed reasonable.\n\nHowever, I can't recommend their Mee Sua dish as it lacked flavor and the ingredients seemed untraditional. It consisted of a bowl of Mee Sua with chopped up chicken cutlet. On the bright side, the chicken cutlet itself was delicious. Additionally, I highly enjoyed their mala edamame and would definitely order it again.\n\nDespite the positive aspects, my dining experience took a downturn when it came time to pay the bill. The staff member who assisted us had a rather unfriendly demeanor and seemed to give off a vibe of \"you owe me money,\" which left a negative impression.\n\nOverall, Typhoon is a decent place to enjoy somewhat traditional Taiwanese cuisine with reasonable pricing. Just be cautious when ordering the Mee Sua and hope for more consistent service throughout the entire dining experience.\n\n\nOption: 5:\nName: \u6781\u9c9c Ji Xian Seafood & Hong Kong Dim Sum Express\nAddress: 1 Stadium Pl, #02-15 Kallang Wave Mall, Singapore 397628\nPhone: 9329 1881\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.1\nReviews: \n\nI was in a dilemma... should I gate keep this place or write this review. Decide not to be selfish. Lol! I visited this place 3 times. Twice for dinner and once for lunch. The seafood and dim sum are so fresh and value for money. My family used to patronise a seafood restaurant in the west but the prices have been increasing. Yet, the quality of seafood we had on the last 2 occasions there was disappointing. So, when we found Ji Xian, we decided this will be our go-to place for seafood! However, do not expect much from the service nor the ambience. Enjoy!\n\nSeats a bit squeeze. Food taste is good Cantonese style. Serving seem to have shrunk. Service wise is still good. Helps if you know Cantonese.atmosphere old school type of restaurant. But highly recommended for Cantonese food.  Good and nice dim sum too.\n\nFirst time eating in this resturant. Started with some dim sum, love the chicken feet cos its so peppery \ud83d\ude0b Actually not a bad place to eat dim sum! Had the Geoduck sashimi, haven\u2019t had this for so long since hong kong. Slight crunchy texture, really individual preference but I quite like it. Bamboo clams, braised lobster noodles, veg with pork lard, fresh steamed fish etc all so good! Will definitely be back to try more of other dishes!\n\nCame over for dim sum lunch on a Saturday. Ordered their signature dishes, mainly dim sum. Firstly, quite impressed by the variety especially live seafood and the affordable prices. Ambience is like a friendly neighborhood restaurant with a cozy atmosphere. Foodwise is OK, pretty average, slightly better than those foodcourt standards. Portions and pricing are good so making it value for money. Service was prompt and efficient. Really wanted to try their live seafood next time. Anyway, really enjoyed the dining experience.\n\nSeafood is very fresh. Steamed prawns are really lovely.

We meant to go to the restaurant next door but they were closed. We came in here on a whim. The food is amazing. My friend had the goat curry. I had the fish curry. Both were spicy but flavorful. The plantain chips are hot and crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. The coffee was amazing, presentation and taste.\n\nWe had a wonderful dining experience at this restaurant. The standout feature was their incredibly welcoming, friendly, and attentive service. The staff patiently recommended dishes and even showed photos of them when we needed assistance.\n\nWe ordered the peanut chicken stew and goat curry, both of which were absolutely delightful. The flavors were well-balanced with just the right amount of spice and heat, and there was no gamy taste from the goat meat.\n\nThe cocktails were also a hit, and the evening was rounded off with delicious desserts. The overall ambiance was cozy and inviting, making it a perfect setting for a memorable evening.\n\nWe'll definitely be returning, and I can wholeheartedly recommend this restaurant to friends. It's a gem worth visiting again and again.\n\nWent there for dinner and I had cauliflower and buttermilk fried chicken for starters and the portion is pretty generous. Absolutely love both of it. Got the fish curry too and it was amazing tho pretty spicy. However we didn't enjoy the Malindi Halwa dessert so much with it's jelly-like texture. Service is really top notch as they were always attentive.\n\nIt\u2019s my first time trying Africa\u2019s cuisine, and I\u2019m pleasantly impressed with the food.\n\nWe ordered a variety of curry based dishes, with different level of spiciness - and we enjoyed all of them.\n\nHighly recommended the Goat Curry, where in our opinion is the best one there.\n\nGreat ambience and fantastic customer service from the staff. Our waiter spent time to recommend us the dishes. The food is definitely on the pricier side and it felt that it might have been adjusted so much to suit the local palate that the food does not feel uniquely african. When the food tastes very similar to local dishes, it does not really justify the high price.\n\n\nOption: 2:\nName: Paofan Paradise \u6ce1\u996d\u5929-T.K Kitchen\nAddress: 37 Teban Gardens Rd, Singapore 600037\nPhone: 8330 7554\nDelivery Available: Information Not Available\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 4:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 4:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 4:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 4:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 4:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 4:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 4:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4\nReviews: \n\nThe crab Pao fan here is good. Other recommended dishes are Ipoh Hor fun & their signature dish, red wine Por ribs.  The La Zi chicken was however a let down. I think the quality of the food has come down recently.\n\nOrdered flower crab paofan ($38) and prawn paste chicken ($12). Good tasting broth for paofan and generous amount of chicken for chicken.\n\nSome downside is the seafood ingredients are not fresh, prawn is so rubbery. Also very costly at $38. Good to try but don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be back soon as I think they\u2019re many paofan that are cheaper with better ingredients in the food scene now.\n\nDespite the good reviews, unfortunately, not for me. The Ginseng Chicken Claypot taste more of wine than ginseng. The Pork Ribs is total disaster, the waiter pour white spirit and lights up before serving. He doesn\u2019t check if the fire burned off the spirit. Imagine you could taste the heavily liquor pork. Vegetables & Tou Fu are normal.\nService is below average.\nPrice is not cheap as the area is not consider a prime area.\n\nTaste: 8/10 Chicken breast is slightly dry but otherwise the flavour is pretty alright. Mild ginseng taste. Love the variety of mushrooms in it!\n\nCost: $38 (3-4 pax)\n\nWaiting time: 10 mins on Saturday 1230pm\n\nOverall: Will come back to try the flower crab paofan\n\nTried the Ginseng Chicken Pao Fan. Love the combination of egg rice and broth. Portion was huge with lots of ingredients. Chicken was very well done and fall-off-the-bone tender. Would definitely come back again to try the other dishes.\n\n\nOption: 3:\nName: Nando's Jurong Point\nAddress: JP1, 1 Jurong West Central 2, #02-32 Jurong Point, 648886\nPhone: 6254 1542\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 3.7\nReviews: \n\nIt\u2019s sad that the best tasting item was the wedges. Although the chicken was well cooked, the chili sauce, the spice level was ultimately disappointing. Not tasty, too salty, the ketchup sauce tastes so much better.\n\nAs much as I enjoy the staffs mingling and enjoying their work, but the chefs were talking a tad too loudly.\n\nYummy food, big portion. A variety of sauces like ketchup, garlic, herb and those with different level of spiciness.\n\nHad the Tuesday deal which is Chicken Pita bread (buy 1 and get another for 50% discount) including 2 sides each. Added a pineapple ring for additional $1.\n\nRecommends also the quarter chicken. Free flow water provided! However the water tasted weird so 1 star less.\n\nmy experience there was amazing. i love the food and how nice the people are over there. personally, although it is a little pricy, the wild herb sauce there made me love the food but the amazing service there made my experience even better. you should definitely go down and experience it for yourself!\n\nOne of the better Nandos outlet in Singapore. Service is fast and friendly despite it being a peak hour lunch. Food came hot and relatively fast. Get up to 25% off if you\u2019re an NSF with 11B. Good atmosphere. Nandos, pls open up an outlet in the North!!\n\nNando\u2019s is well known for their peri peri chicken, we had boneless thigh and chicken breast, they are both cooked very well and tender. Love the sides too. Quality of food is fantastic, just the quantity has reduced quite a lot. The restaurant is very beautifully decorated as you can see from the pictures. Service was also great. However we feel a bit warm in the restaurant, seems the aircon is not too strong. Got to order and pay for the food online before the order is placed. Cutlery and sauces and side plates are all self service at a corner counter. Will be great if they operate like a normal restaurant instead of having to order and pay online and take cutleries on our own.\n\n\nOption: 4:\nName: \u00c9la Bukit Batok\nAddress: 2 Bukit Batok West Ave 7, #01-07 A B, Singapore 659003\nPhone: 8816 9418\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.5\nReviews: \n\nOne of the few times you go to a restaurant and feel that the amount you paid for the service charge is worth it. The floor staff attend to you immediately and ensure the food served are hot. Unfortunately, there were some mishaps with the food served. When informed, it was immediately rectified and a new dish was served. I am very impressed with the service and the quality of food. Kudos.\n\nWe were there on a weekend for a late lunch. The place was very empty. We were ushered in quite quickly, but when we wanted to place an order, we waited quite a while to be able to get someone's attention.\n3 out 4 items we wanted to order were not available, but we were not informed when we sat down, hence very disappointed. They also have a pasta menu that is not available for weekends too..\nFood came quite fast, but the plates have very disgusting dirty and wet cotton string wrapped handles. I cannot imagine anyone's hand touching that and then touching the fries or wrap. Mocktail was a glass of diabetes, 15% to 20% syrup, coloring and milk. The orange cake was a miss too. It tasted like tapioca kueh.\n\nWe had a comfortable good time on a rainy Sunday evening, eve of PH, at Ela (Bukit Batok)! Our favourite dish was actually 'Keto' with Pulled Beef - the cauliflower rice was very well done with a generous portion of pulled beef! #mustry\nWe would like to do a special shout out to the one and only floor staff that night, Yani! She was like a wonderwoman, running the floor service alone, serving at least 5-6 tables of guests professionally - from bringing guests to tables, to taking orders, clearing tables, making drinks, serving the dishes etc.! Mad respect! Thank you for being so attentive and patient with your warm services! Will be back at the new outlet to try other items soon too! \ud83e\udd73\n\nIt was so cozy and absolutely loved the vibes. The food was exceptional and the service was great.\n\nThe smell of the pita was sooo good and the pita on my lamb was soaked with flavor. Tho you may want to note that lamb generally has a strong smell/taste. My suggestion is to maybe elevate their dessert as the cake tasted like any ordinary lemon pound cake with an ice cream scoop on top. Wish there were smtg more special.\nhonestly would come here again.\n\nFood is good, atmosphere is just nice, very family friendly place for people to hang out. The lamb ribs is the bomb; grilled octopus is ok for me, the portion is a bit small for us. But overall is amazing dining experience for us.\n\n\nOption: 5:\nName: Joo Siah Bak Koot Teh\nAddress: 01-1215 Jurong East Ave 1, Block 349, Singapore 600349\nPhone: 9111 8129\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: Closed\nTuesday: 8:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20097:15\u202fPM\nWednesday: 8:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20097:15\u202fPM\nThursday: 8:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20097:15\u202fPM\nFriday: 8:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20097:15\u202fPM\nSaturday: 8:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20097:15\u202fPM\nSunday: 8:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.1\nReviews: \n\nI recently visited this Bak Kut Teh place, and it was delicious! The meat was tender and juicy, and the soup was nice and peppery. The tenderloin soup was also tasty. It is worth a try. The location is far from the center of town, but it is worth the trip.\n\nThe meat was fall-off-the-bone tender. Soup was not overwhelmingly garlicky or peppery and there's a taste of sweetness of the pork in it. Pig trotters was fabulous too.\n\nA Bak Kut Teh stall that is the main anchor stall in a coffee shop. Order at the counter, and food will be served to the table. Soup refill is self-service.\n\nReasonable price and above average taste. One of the better BKT in Singapore thou there was no wow feel.\n\nFood not as good as before. Prices increased but quality of food gone down alot. Soup is over salty now, side dishes too oily, mei cai contains too much hard unchewable parts which I need to spit out constantly.\nIt took away my pleasure of enjoying this popular bak koot teh. We're quite the regulars here by the way. Disappointed.\n\nLove the BKT.  The meat is tender and soup, which is pepperish and flavourful.   The pork trotter is very well done,  soft and juicy, which just melts in your mouth.\n\n\nOption: 6:\nName: ButterNut\nAddress: 3 Yung Sheng Rd, #02-108, Singapore 618499\nPhone: None\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: Closed\nTuesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 1 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.3\nReviews: \n\nOrdered the Butternut Chicken Pizza and Cinnamon Sweet Potato Fries, both were very good.

Bought the meat pizza & some portobello pizza- the latter was served up in a really big juicy portobello, t'was the best! Pls give this a try. 1 pizza is about the size of a medium sized plate. Bought 2 pizzas and 1 baked pasta. Total cost was $26.\n\nVisited for lunch and the baked spaghetti chicken was so flavorful! The meat was huge too. Added on the portobello mushroom with cheese, tasted amazing, well seasoned! Will definitely come back \ud83e\udd13\n\nExcellent thin crust pizza with minimal variety of ingredients that worked hard to give such delicious pizza. Ate once there and ordered to-go twice. Consistency is there. The butternut chicken pizza is my absolute favourite. The saltiness of the cheese juxtaposed with the sweetness from the butternut squash worked well together with the chicken. And the crust of the pizza, the thinnest i've never seen even in Italy, holds the other ingredients well. Kudos to the team!\n\nChanced upon it while craving for pizza places near Lakeside Gardens. Got the highly suggested butternut chicken pizza and classic choice, Hawaiian pizza. Thin crispy crust, generous cheese and sufficient toppings. The chicken pizza is worth recommending. Surprise were the fresh sweet potato fries (way better than Nandos) and Holland Portobello (3 cheese-stuffed mushrooms with balsamic vinegar).\nThere is also a membership discount by liking their Fb/Instagram page.

A not fancy but good for a simple non fussy meal\n\nClassic meatballs are delicious as usual. Pork ribs were also juicy and tender at affordable prices. However, they were clearly under staffed as each staff has to manage a food section on their own. They also looked frustrated and overworked, which led to them snapping at some customers. The ordering was also slightly confusing as peole could order differently but the price for some meals were not stated upfront.\n\nGood food at good price. There is always a queue here during meal hours. Popular place for the young & elderly, even for people who ate not here to shop for furnitures.

Visited again after a long while to buy furniture and have lunch there. The chicken wings and meatball are still tasty like I rmb. Tried their salmon dishes which are decently priced given the ingredients inflation. Cheese cake is super smooth. Very value for money.

However there isn't good ventilation and it does become stuffy.\n\nMany good food stalls but open Lunch onwards...for Bkt.try the Muslim stalls..very good ..\n\nOne of my top three hawker centers for the food and ambiance. Wide range of food options from leicha and caifan to Penang and SG-style laksa. Also parata options, chicken and duck rice, soba, and more. It\u2019s also spread out so the breeze gets through. there\u2019s ample seating at 11-1230pm on a Sunday. It\u2019s well lit so you don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re eating in a dungeon. Extra points for being close to ikea\n\nABC BRICKWORKS, a heartland hawker center. Open all day - Chinese India Malay food. Have a reasonable good food to try. Today manage to try THE MEEPORK - the minced soba was great (see photo) and JASON PENANG - the char kway teow ( the light ) was excellent, Penang laksa was good too. There are still plenty to try on my next visit.\n\nThe claypot chicken rice ( Yuan Yuan ) was so satisfying ! Rice was soft, drizzled with black sauce brought to mix round with all the ingredients. Chinese sausage not hard, chicken tender and not overly dry, and bits of salted fish just nice for the portion and not an overkill. Veg can be a little bit more but it\u2019s not a deal breaker :) love it when it is served piping hot and warm all the way to the end digging the burnt rice crusts out from the sides of the pot. Maybe I don\u2019t eat claypot rice for a long time so the experience may sound a bit exaggerated.   The or jian ( oyster omelette) just a few doors away on same row was nice and crispy that put a smile to my face when I crunched the omelette bits in my mouth combined with the oysters oozing. Oysters were of good size - not too big. It too small.  Ended with iced Ching Tng  with generous ingredients! Impressed ! Uncle has a cheerful demeanour too ;) .\n\n\nOption: 3:\nName: OVERBR\u00d8D\nAddress: 370 Alexandra Rd, #01-14A, Singapore 159953\nPhone: 8951 1198\nDelivery Available: No\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.9\nReviews: \n\nReally enjoyed our brunch at this cozy restaurant. Highly recommended for those that are looking for brunch menus that are not generic (like your eggs benedict, pancakes, etc). Also their plating was on point and the ingredients were super fresh & well prepped. I will definitely come back again.\n\nSmall cosy joint that serves excellent Scandinavian food. Though menu is limited yet the curated specialities are made with such excellent culinary standards. Enjoyed the shrimp toast and fish stew so much, we practically wanted to wipe the utensils dry. Love the simplistic clean look of the place and inviting ambience. Will surely return to try the other things on the menu.\n\nCosy, relaxed little cafe serving Nordic style toast with some amazing toppings. Just the one vegetarian toast option which was the mushroom so tried that with the bean side salad. Both really fresh and tasty. Also had a delicious herbal tea. The staff were very friendly and took a lot of pride in the venue and food. My friend had the seafood stew which looked generous and she really enjoyed it. Worth a try\n\nDelicious open faced sandwiches in a beautiful, unpretentious and welcoming space staffed with warm family vibes! The potatoes were great as well and the tomato with fennel seed soup is a winner. The level of detail in the tableware and decor is admirable too. 10/10 will come back!\n\nThis is a cool little spot for having simple but delicious Scandinavian food! I especially loved the bread that came with the fish stew. The meatballs, too, are certainly not your run-of-the-mill IKEA meatballs!\n\nIt would be nice, however, if there could be stricter rules against people bumming a 4-person table by themselves, with a laptop, during lunch hour, with nothing but a glass of water.\n\n\nOption: 4:\nName: JOFA GRILL\nAddress: 165 Bukit Merah Central, Man Lin F&B Coffeeshop, Singapore 150165\nPhone: 9827 2827\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.2\nReviews: \n\nValue for money chicken chop set meal at a promotional price of $7.80. The smoky, tender and juicy chicken was great on its own even without the gravy (though it would have been nice if the sauce was slightly saltier). Fries was crisp and piping hot, while the tanginess of the coleslaw was perfect.\n\nMy only gripe was there was too many tendons in the chicken chop, disrupting the overall eating experience. It would also be good if customers are given the flexibility to select their own side dishes, instead of sticking to the usual fries and coleslaw.\n\nFor the price of $13.50, there was definitely some expectations plus i actually tried since I seen xiaxue raving about it. I reached around 6pm and there was only 1 staff. He was busy frying stuff for the western food options and took my order for noodles while informing that I had to wait for a while. I was damn annoyed when he took my order as he kept frowning. The best part is he frowned again when I requested for no meatball and guess what? Check the photo \ud83d\ude02 he was the same guy who made my noodles but I think he may not be supposed to be the one, maybe he just took over cos his colleague was not there... Anyway, scallop is not fresh, fishball is standard factory made type, soup is a weird diluted msg taste, soft shell crab was hot but batter is very thick, and noodle texture is poor. I would say if you really like bak chor mee (No. 25), go to next block 161 stall during day time the young couple makes amazing bcm you won't regret.\n\nI ordered a sirloin steak, medium rare.\n\nThe cut was a bit dry and less seasoned to my liking.\n\nI have yet to try the rest of the dishes. I hope my dining experience can be better refined the next round.\n\nThis is probably the most expensive meepok I\u2019ve ever had, but I just couldn\u2019t resist not trying their \ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc26\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc26 \ud835\udc12\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc1d \ud835\udc0c\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1d \ud835\udc0c\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2d \ud835\udc0d\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc1e ($13.50) \ud83d\ude06\n\nIt came with premium toppings, like abalone slices, prawn ball, pork slices, minced pork, crispy soft shell crab, tobikko and clams.\n\nOverall, it\u2019s a good and satisfying bowl of meepok to try though it\u2019s quite a splurge for a hawker food \ud83d\ude1b so I won\u2019t buy it repeatedly..\n\nWent around 2pm on a weekend and there was no queue.

The chairs are special and hippy, with a touch of heritage. Nice hangout place if you wanna have yakinuku and beer at night. In the day, wanton mee and liver bak chor mee are good choices.\n\nRong Fa Bak Chor mee: If you love pork liver, or just lots of ingredients in yummy soup accompanied by al dente noodles, this is the place! The liver served is in HUGE chunks, and lightly blanched, so it is tender and melts in your mouth. So much ingredients in the soup too... 2 meatballs, 1 fishball, fishcake slices, sliced taupok, chunks of minced meat... The noodles are well-cooked and seasoned too. If you order the double balls soup, you get a range of fish balls and meatballs with fillings.\n\nOnly downside is the wait. We went at about 1.30 and waited for about half hour. Fortunately, it was worth the wait and we were not in a rush.\n\nWorth the price we paid, which was a total of $13.\n\nTasted the wanton mee and minced pork noodles, waiting time for for mee pok was 45 min for a non busy day. Wanton mee char siew is nice!\n\nBunch of variety of food stalls hiding inside this industrial canteen slash beer garden. There is thai, vietnamese, western, bachormee, japanese don, chicken rice. Quite varied options to try, however location is a bit obscure. Food was generally good and tasted above averahe for it's price point.\n\nNice place for beer. They have draft and bottles beer. Only 4 stalls are open on weekday nights.\nTried the thai food. Ordered the egg, fried rice and noodles. All was good except fried rice was salty.\nWestern food was nice , tasty and priced reasonable.\n\nExcellent selection of affordable beer on tap served in chilled glasses. Only $8.80-10 a pint. Happy Hour from as early as 7.30am (yes, morning!) till closing, every day. Even credit card payment was available.\n\nFood stalls seem to have a rather high turnover rate. Currently, there are stalls selling Thai, Japanese, Vietnamese, Ipoh cuisine, Grilled lamb, Western and Bak Chor Mee. However, there is nothing much left to eat after 8pm except for mookata.\n\n\nOption: 6:\nName: Bukit Merah Central Food Centre\nAddress: 163 Bukit Merah Central, Singapore 150163\nPhone: None\nDelivery Available: Information Not Available\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 6:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 6:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 6:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 6:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 6:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 6:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 6:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 1 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4\nReviews: \n\nKaya butter toast is a huge let down at the \"star coffee\" stall. You a big slap of NOT butter, but margarine! Coffee is not your usual kind of coffee but more to western taste so some might like it.\n\nIt's overpriced at 4.30 for a set (because no butter), but maybe because of the coffee.\n\nCame here for lunch during weekday on several consecutive days. They have a good variety of rice, noodles, vegetarian food available. Tried their vegetarian store, chicken rice store and Yong Tau foo store. Prices are affordable and food tasty. Can get quite crowded during lunchtime due to nearby office crowd.

Price is super good in the midst of today's high food inflation (display on stall signboard). Variety of items good enough for most patrons. Laksa & Tom Yam soup is good.

Delicious, could be a little more seasoned. Fisherman pasta was filled with plenty seafood. Prawns were especially fresh. Pasta was Al dente. Sauce was delicious although a little salty. Great service and environment (indoors)\n\nService can be warmer. It really doesn\u2019t cost much to wear a smile when introducing your patrons to their table. Had a steak with warm potato salad, received almost well done instead of medium rare.  We asked for more water once, and it didn\u2019t come. Water comes with a small charge. Our group was seated upstairs, and one of us had to make our way down every time if we wanted to ask the service staff for assistance.\n\nIt\u2019s been a while since my last visit to Fika. Was rather disappointed by the quality of the food and service rendered this time round.\n\nI recalled the server used to take order but now we have to self-order at the counter.  As we were seated at the second level, it was rather a hassle to go up and down a few time just to order and ask for water. If they want to have self-service ordering, at least allow customers to scan and order via QR code.\n\nThe meatball was rather dry and the grilled chicken was slightly salty too. We requested for candles and they did not offer too. Could feel a huge difference in the overall experience this visit, and would likely not return again.\n\nNever fell in love this easy with food before and yes i said it. I love how tasty the meatballs are and the beef stew are made with almost perfection. Definitely come again next time to try some new dishes next time.\n\nAlthough the food was alright, the seat I was at was vibrating throughout the whole meal and it was really annoying. We later realised that we were seated directly above a ceiling fan installed on level 1 which is likely the cause of the vibration. Our table was next to a window and I found it rather glaring but was sternly told by one of the servers that the curtains must be kept open. While I respect that the restaurant might have a good reason for such a rule, the message could have been more politely communicated.\n\n\nOption: 8:\nName: Alexandra Village Food Centre\nAddress: 120 Bukit Merah Lane 1, Singapore 150120\nPhone: 6225 5632\nDelivery Available: Information Not Available\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 7:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 7:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 7:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 7:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 7:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 1 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.2\nReviews: \n\nLarge range of food available here.

Always spoilt for choice when I come here. It gets crowded and bloody hot during lunch hour, though.\n\nVery good food court...great choice and great taste with all dishes Asia can offer, at reasonable prices...go where the locals would go\n\nPatronized this \u53e4\u65e9\u5473Big Prawn Noodle Stall in Alexandra Village Food Centre. It was 3pm, hence no crowd in the Hawker Centre.\nI was second in queue. Ordered a Pig\u2019s Tail Prawn Noodle and another Pork Ribs Prawn Noodle. Our orders were served within 5 minutes, self collect.\nI was a little disappointed when the orders were collected - the two bowls of Prawn Noodles did not appear like those in their photo displays.\n\nIn the Pork Rib Prawn Noodle, the prawn were pretty small - 4 halves small prawns deshelled without prawn heads but with the tails attached. Two pieces of pork bone chunks instead of pork ribs and four slices of lean pork. One miserable strand of vegetable.\n\nFor the Pig\u2019s Tail Prawn Noodle, the prawn serving, lean pork and vegetable servings were similar. There were 4 pieces of pig\u2019s tail.\n\nHowever, we must say the prawn soup was really good. The pork bone chunks were well seasoned and texture were nice. The lean pork slices were quite tender. And oh\u2026the pig\u2019s tails were really soft and the skin and meat slide off the bones easily.\n\nBesides \u201cfeeling deceived\u201d by the photo displays and the small sizes of prawn, the servings were reasonably sized and the meals tasted good overall. $6 for each bowl of noodle was reasonable.\n\nRelatively cheap place to eat with lots of options. Went here around 10am and it wasn't crowded.

The hawker centre us a little run down and could definitely do with some upgrades. It is also not easy to find parking especially during peak hours and weekends\n\nGreat old school hawker centre. Enjoyed the NaNa Curry. Spicy but tasted good. Hokkien mee was also tasty with bits of fried pork crackers on top and mixed with into the noodles. It was hot in the afternoon but will go there again.\n\nNow this is the real deal. With a plethora of options, I stumbled upon fantastic selections at incredibly reasonable prices. Situated in a bustling location, it exudes a wealth of character that makes the visit absolutely worthwhile.\n\nThis hawker center (recently renovated in Nov 2022) caters mostly to the breakfast and lunch crowd and come dinner time, many stalls are closed or their food sold out by 7.30pm+.\n\nOne notable and nondescript exception is the Vietnamese Cooked Food stall located at the corner of the hawker center (next to the Modern Old School coffee stall) and facing the carpark.\n\nThis is a one-lady operation helmed by a hardworking Vietnamese lady, Ann who speaks Mandarin, English and some dialects. For carbo eaters, check out the Ribs with Rice (Com Suon) (generous rice portion!) and Bahn Mi (bread). They are both delectable and very filling even for those who feel Vietnamese food are light. Many customers, especially the ladies, are seen ordering the Pho with Beef and Noodle Soup.\n\nThe stall operates from 10.30am-10pm. Something to consider if you are coming here for a late dinner, or wish to skip the lunchtime crowd at the other popular stalls. At 9pm+, most stalls, except the drinks stalls,  at the hawker center would be closed. Paynow and Paylah are available.\n\nA Huge hawker center with many stalls some a few with Michelin Bib.  Nice airy and clean environment with ample parking around the hawker.\n\n\nOption: 10:\nName: Redhill Food Centre\nAddress: 85 Redhill Ln, Singapore 150085\nPhone: 6225 5632\nDelivery Available: Information Not Available\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 8:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 7:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 8:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 8:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 8:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 8:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 8:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 1 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.2\nReviews: \n\nHidden Gem Unearthed - Redhill Food Centre Singapore! \ud83c\udf72\u2728\n\nAmidst the bustling city, I stumbled upon a culinary oasis at Redhill Food Centre. This unassuming hawker centre revealed a hidden gem - a delightful $1.5 chicken rice with a mouthwatering taste of soup. The flavors danced on my palate, leaving me pleasantly surprised by the incredible value and authentic taste.\n\nRedhill Food Centre is a treasure trove of local delights, where passionate hawkers craft affordable and delicious dishes that satisfy both the stomach and the soul. A true haven for foodies seeking a taste of Singapore's gastronomic delights without breaking the bank.\n\n\u2022Bak Kee Satay BeeHun\n\nI recently had the pleasure of trying \"Bak Kee Satay BeeHun\", and I must say, it left me thoroughly satisfied. The star of the dish was undoubtedly the satay sauce, which perfectly complemented the noodles. The rich and creamy satay sauce had just the right balance of sweetness and spiciness, creating a harmonious flavor explosion, which I find it very creative.\n\nThe noodles, accompanied by tender squid, succulent pork liver, and thinly sliced pork meat, were a delightful addition. The variety of textures and flavors added depth to each bite, making it a truly memorable experience.\n\nOne word of advice to fellow food enthusiasts: devour this dish quickly! The noodles have a tendency to soak up the flavors, and while that might sound tempting, it's best enjoyed when the noodles are still slightly firm.\n\n\u2022Fried Oyster\n\nOut of so many dishes the stall offered, I would recommend their Fried Oyster, non-greasy, and the oyster was just cooked right. Not too raw or not too cooked.\n\nChar Kuey Teow was just so.. so only in my opinion, and nothing to shout for.\n\nLittle do you know:\nThe difference between fried carrot cake black or white are not only the colour of the sauce itself, but also the taste. To all tourist, remember to choose the white instead as that's what local Singaporean will choose. If you are curious with the black sauce, it tends to be sweeter if you like it.\n\nOne of my go to Hawker for breakfast, lunch probably not recommended for dinner.\nPrata, duck noodles, Chee Cheong Fun, Nasi Briayani, chicken rice, curry rice, bread and toast, soya beans, soft boiled eggs. What you name it, will definitely full-fill your 90% of your choice.\nPrices might not be as economical as you thoughts, but it won\u2019t be rocket high. Saturday & Sunday are packed, avoid peak hours.\nEnjoy!\n\nGood variety of food stalls here. Been here thrice but so far all the stalls I have tried are good. Only tried the pancake this time which I personally like for the crunchiness as well as softness and non-dryness (if this is the right way to describe it).\nWould update next time upon visiting\n\nHere to mention that this dessert stall\u2019s chendol is weird. Taste more like ice kacang. Forgot to snap photo of my tau suan, but they are good \ud83d\udc4d at tau suan.\n",

Food was painfully average, although the portions were more than enough : ) Prices are average as well.\nOverall.... decent place. Not worth going out of your way for this place\n\nOrdered Run Down burger\uff0cFirebird burger, Carbonara spaghetti with chicken, Spagetti with Steak. Serving is very generous. Steak is overcooked and hard although we ask for medium rare. Spagetti was just nice. Firebird burger was not to my liking because it is fried chicken and oily. My stomach did not feel too well after that.\n\nDisappointed with my order of rib eye. It didn't look or taste like rib eye. Very rubbery & I didn't finish it. Waitress was kind enough to serve me a serving of chicken chop but I Was still charge the full price for rib eye. Chicken chop was OK. Pasta so so. Mushroom soup was not bad. Unfortunately, it'll be my first and last time coming here...\n\nGreat service and ambience. Portion was big and affordable pricing. Taste wise, can be better! Fish and chips was too oily for my liking and steak was a little tough.\n\nThe food here is priced competitively and the quality is good. We had a great time catching up with friends and the food is so good.

We understand the humidity, the heat in Singapore and the hawkers needing to stand for a really long time (if the business is good). However, my recent experience with the service staff was bad tempered and unable to convey what further information he needs to take my order. The food was mediocre. People only queue for this stall because the good stall (selling the same thing) was closed.\n\nPretty average. But the serving size though. At $4.50 the hokkien Mee is really one of the larger serving size I have encountered. This is the thick bee hon variety which I don't prefer. Should have asked more chili for the taste.\n\nEdit (Jan 2023): doing my dd to review their fkt. Small plate cost only $4.\n\nIt was better than their hokkien Mee. Generally more savory (salty) [my preference] than sweet, Chinese sausage is a contribution to that as well. Cockles was very small and few in between.\n\nNoodles is just slightly on the softer side for me but i am sure many will find it enjoyable.\n\nAdded: White carrot cake $3\n\nThe bigger chunk variety, it is pretty average. Chill has a kick and the preserve radishes add a more savory profile to carrot cake. Otherwise if u like scramble egg this might be up your alley. The egg isn't crispy at all but large chunk of scramble egg so is like 50% scramble egg 50% average carrot cake\n\nNot sure how this place was even awarded the Michelin bib gourmand award because the food tasted pretty ordinary. Ordered 4 dishes from the stall and NONE stood out at all. In fact there was no queue at all for it in that forever bustling Chong Pang Market. Ironically, it was a stall selling similar stuffs just diagonally behind it that had a queue of over 20 persons.\n\nChar kway teow not bad, the wet kind. Feels abit like mee goreng in fact only sweet sauce instead of tomato sauce...\nQuite big cockles and not stingy with the numbers.\n\nCarrot cake ok only, maybe should try the other stall next time\n\nWe saw a long queue for this stall. I can say it is very popular and many locals really like their cooking. We ordered the white carrot cake and it was pretty good. The chilli goes very well with it and the egg was perfectly fried. So nice. We like the fact that we can ask them to put more onion chives on top 'coz it adds more flavour to it.\n\nDespite the long queue, it moves fast and they also cook and serve the food very quick. The uncle is also very nice and cheerful.\n\n\nOption: 5:\nName: 928 Yishun Laksa\nAddress: 928 Yishun Central 1, #01-155, Singapore 760928\nPhone: 9731 9586\nDelivery Available: Information Not Available\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 7:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20096:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 7:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20096:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 7:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20096:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 7:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20096:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 7:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20096:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 7:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20096:00\u202fPM\nSunday: Closed\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.4\nReviews: \n\nVery good bowl of laksa with thick and fragrant gravy soup .

Perhaps dabao would be better than eating here.\n\nFlavourful laksa, filled with many curry leafs. Always to go place for a bowl of heart filling warming bowl of noodle.

Noodles are al dente with nice mouthfeel. Lots of ingredients with self service for laksa leaves and chili.\n\nGood value. Less than $4 for delicious laksa. Gravy is not those thick coconut flavour.

Great service, food and variety at an affordable price! What is there not to like?\n\nPersonally I loved the Vietnamese coffee ice cream (Little Saigon) when paired with the soft and chewy waffles \ud83e\uddc7 which went swimmingly well!\n\nPerhaps what can be done better is that the cappuccino could be serviced in a ceramic cup for a better tasting experience.

Recommend to try the \u77f3\u5e74pork rice, its super delicious!\n\nHot and cold desserts are available (~$2). Always nice to have after meals or even on its own. Queues in Chong Pang hawker centre are generally good signs that the food from that stall(s) are appealing and appetising. The noodle stall facing the fruit stall (or market) opens from morning and till evening. So far so good!\n\nThis place is not the best hawker centre I Singapore. It is just ok. Many stalls here repeat the same type of dishes. For example, I think there are at least 5 stalls selling fish all noodles and 4 stalls selling prawn noodles, none of which are particularly outstanding and nice.

Ordered the Salted Egg Chicken and wow, it's really good! If you like the dry version for salted egg, this is a must try! \ud83d\ude0b Ordered the Yang Zhou Fried Rice which was tasty with the wok taste and Moonlight Hor Fun which was on the sweeter side! Nevertheless, a delicious meal here! \u263a\ufe0f\n\nI am pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food at this neighbourhood's Zi Char food stall.  Business is brisk with takeaway orders as I sat at the table waiting for my order.\n\nI only took one picture of the star dish from my set dinner, the assam fish head.\n\nThe fish is very fresh and the assam sauce is very generous, very satisfying meal!\n\nService staff is very friendly and helpful.\n\nThe tables at the coffeeshop are also very clean, thanks to the regular cleaning by coffee shop assistant.\n\nCounter lady doesn't have the patience to understand your questions about the menu.\n\nFood was horrendous possibly because the counter lady doesn't care about your stated preferences and simply keyed in food order as how she deems it to be.\n\nOperating hours mention till 10.45pm ... Reach there then wait the cashier ask the kitchen staffs then tell me they are close ... I ask the cashier about closing time then she look at another place (i guess she look for time) and tell me last order at 10.15pm ... I directly look at my watch and it 10.16pm ... So the time i reach your counter and wait for you to ask your kitchen staffs not counted ? Dont want to make noise as you never know what they will do to your food if they are not happy.\n\nLazy staffs ... Super Duper bad service !\n\nDropped by for quick dinner. Food was so so.

Love the fish \ud83d\udc1f burger \ud83c\udf54 because I think is the fillets that a difference for Mac fish. The hamburgers though uses onions which Mac burger uses  pickles as the favour enhancement.\nOnly drawback is the size of the outlet, small area so gets quite crowded at times.\nThe burgers are now pack in boxes, use different tapes to differentiate the contents.\n\nJust wanted to share my favourite order of fish burger, milk tea and fried chicken! Just $10 for this set :) Their milk tea is light and refreshing, while their fish burger is the best! Japanese Mayo and mustard with crispy fish patty, onions, cheese, all between two soft buns.\n\nThe buzzer rang twice when my food wasn\u2019t ready though... hope that the technology improves here\n\nV disappointed, 2nd time I order this burger but the standard at Northpoint is so lousy. When I approach ur staff, he asked me I want more guacamole is it? I mean do I look like a beggar? Ur ala carte burger is $9.\n\nThe fries were hot but hard and stale and tasted like they have been fried a few times and left to sit there for some time... the staff was nice to change a new one for me however the second portion was still the same as the first... Northpoint outlet needs to look into how they fry their fries to ensure it\u2019s fresh and good tasting when served to customers.\n\nI know this can\u2019t be right because I\u2019ve tasted better at other Mos Burger outlets. Come on Northpoint team you can do better. This is not the standard of your fries.\n\nOne of my go to fast food joint. My personal favourites are yakiniku rice burger and ebi rice burger. The French fries are also better tasting then other fast food restaurant. The reason why I gave it a 3 star? Their lemon tea drink is always very diluted. Feels like drinking sugar water doesn't taste like tea at all. As for service, the staff is always on the ball and serve with a smile. Will still patronize from this outlet. Please give a 'Like' if you enjoy this honest review.\n",

Didn't know where to start so we went for the tim sum (since most had some on their table).\n\nTim sum was below average in my opinion (won't go to details).\n\nThe pao fan was quite bland (didn't like it), fried HK kailan was normal, and the sweet and sour pork was disappointing (a tad too sweet too sour).\n\nNot coming back in a hurry.\n\nOutlet was quiet in a Saturday evening so it was a nice dining experience. Not crowded. Food was okay. The best is indeed their prawn pao fan. The pao fan was soooo flavourful. Just this dish is enough to feel happy and full. Ee fu mee not bad, oily enough. Get the luffa fish ball soup. Soup was yummy and fish ball was full fish paste.\n\nGood for family gathering.\n\nplace was very warm although indoors, seems like aircon is all broken.\n\nFish bait was fried beyond recognition, absolutely hard and crackling.\n\nSan Lou horfun was black, tasted like normal horfun, when clarified if it was san lou, staff didn\u2019t even reply, just nodded and said didn\u2019t we ordered that?\n\nplenty of fish scales in the fish slices in the horfun though, almost wanted to ask if it\u2019s part of the dish.\n\nChicken feet was sweet, period, no savoury taste.\n\nLor mai gai was borderline edible.\n\nthe dim sums are still edible but not recommended.\n\nDrinks had a charred taste, but it\u2019s still acceptable i guess?\n\nnot sure why it is rated 4 stars? i wouldn\u2019t give it above 1 star, a random kimly dimsum would have tasted better, so i am doubting the ratings here\n\nHave been here a few times with friends and family. Will often order a variety of Dim Sum here. The Mango Pomelo Sago is my favourite too esp when it comes with full load of good stuffs!\nFor Dim Sum and Pao Fan lover, this will be a good place for you!\n\nA place to enjoy the old school vibe. It has a good selection of dishes and dim sum, from the typical Zi char items to Hong Kong style quick bites. Their pao fan (rice is rich broth) is a must order. Thoroughly enjoyed that.\n\nPlace is generally not overly crowded. Parking can be an issue if you go at lunch time.

Quantity of food is very little even though price is on high side.\n\nSaw some good reviews on google and decided to try out the white beehoon here.\n\nHowever, taste wise it was really a little lacking. The white beehoon was like a sticky gooey version with lots of egg. Came with 2 small prawns and 2 scallop which was honestly quite little at this price point.\n\nThe XO fried rice was also just average- quite spicy, nothing really outstanding.\n\nService was very good and friendly. Ambience was quite warm during a hot afternoon. Overall really quite average food for this price- I will probably not try again.\n\nI had previously tasted their white bee Hoon at Jewel, and it was delicious. However, last night's dish lacked the wok hey flavor. Additionally, their yam ring was small and missing key ingredients like cashew nuts and other vegetables. Just to also note, there was no air conditioning.\n\nWent to the Vivo City Restaurant. Was disappointed with the food. What's up with restaurants these days having do many branches with offering the quality of the flagship stall? Do they think all the chefs are the same? That they will cook like the Sembawang shop? I will stay away from them if I cannot make it too Sembawang.\n\nI went there on a Saturday Night around 6pm. There is a slight queue but the wait is not too long. It's is my first time trying Singapore white beehoon, and yesh I'm honestly grateful that I have my first dish here. It's sooo good, the lime makes it so much better. Asides from white beehoon, the Signature Meat and Seafood Roll is nice too!\n\n\nOption: 3:\nName: Jew Kit at Sembawang\nAddress: 604 Sembawang Rd, #01-26 Sembawang Shopping Centre, Singapore 758459\nPhone: 6570 3328\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 10:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 10:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 10:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 10:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 10:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 10:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 10:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 3.8\nReviews: \n\nService staffs are friendly.

Their tandoori corner starts from 5pm onwards. Price wise expect to spend around 10 dollars per person.

The daily cooked Indian Mutton soup is a must-try, but they are ready only around 4pm. Actually, best after 7pm.\n\nHave been coming here since I moved to Yishun in 1986. Nothing much has changed except they now have an air-conditioned area next door and have some digitalisation. They now gives out receipts. See photo\n\nOne of the best Roti prata shops in my opinion.

The chill vibe and cooling environment with fans made it a pleasant spot, but be warned about the mosquitoes. Luckily, we arrived early, as the place filled up quickly. Although the food took a while to be served, the quality and generous portions made up for it. It might be a bit pricey, but the overall vibe is worth it. We will visit again with friends next time.\n\nDiscovered this hidden gem after driving by and the atmosphere was alluring. Looked like a full house, but staff made space for us. I was already expecting a bit of a slow wait, so bearing that in mind, food was definitely worth the wait. Drinks (root beer and Heineken bottle) came within 5 minutes of sitting down, first dish (fried rice) came around 30+ min after, and everything else came quite quickly after that.\nHighly recommend the onion rings, satay and fish and chips. Serving sizes were generous and tasted great.\nNot sure what\u2019s with the recent low reviews - this place definitely is a charm for what it is. If you\u2019re expecting super fast, quick, and \u201chigh class\u201d restaurant vibes, then this isn\u2019t the spot for you. If you\u2019re looking to chill, have a hearty meal, enjoy the atmosphere without rush, then this little gem of a cafe does the job.\n\nOur experience at woody\u2019s cafe was okay . Food was overpriced, my wife and i ordered the bua keluak burger, pork ribs, onion rings and satay . We only enjoyed the satay and onion rings. The burger\u2019s sauce was too salty for our liking, and the pork ribs was not that meaty and tasted bleh. We liked the unique atmosphere though.\n\nA lovely place to chill. As I was driving so didn't drink. They have a good selection of food and drinks. Must try if you're ard the area or at least Tey to make yr way there. Secluded and quiet.

Healthy cooking.    Not crowded, so the staff keeps coming to our table. Food is good but business is not attracting big crowd. Maybe they can do more promo.\n\nDecent teochow Chinese food here at chin Lee\nQuite a hidden gem as it\u2019s tucked all the way in a corner on the second floor\nWe ordered set menu. Dishes we quite liked include the chicken, fish and prawn\nService is good and They were very accommodating with larger table as we came with children . Overall pretty good food and service\n\nIt\u2019s a hidden gem that only got to know this place now whereby they have been here for almost 2 years (open during covid time). Its actually sister restaurant from its main restaurant at Bedok. It\u2019s family friendly with mostly all round table setting. Easily good for 6-12 pax. This place can be very crowded so be there early to avoid disappointment. It\u2019s very spacious, nice ambience and comfortable to dine in. It\u2019s a Teochew restaurant, hence must try their signature dishes. Chilled Teochew Pork Trotter Jelly, Homemade Teochew Prawn Ball, Teochew Kway Teow are some of the must try. There is currently promotion on extra value set on weekdays dinner only which is really value for money. You can have choice of fish/prawn, chicken/duck/meat & veg/tofu/omelette on top rice, soup & tea/water. All good taste great and portion is decent for 4 adults. Especially the coffee pork ribs, it\u2019s tender juicy and yet flavorful. Kway Teow also got wok hey. The only disappointment we have got is we did not manage to get our oyster omelette \u8814\u714e order on our table during our 45 minutes dining time (6:45pm-7:30pm). Not sure if they missed our order but they claim that its still on order queue even we finished all our extra value meal. We just have to give up with disappointment. You can\u2019t expect customer to wait oyster omelette for another 30 minutes whereby you have already finished your dinner. Probably they just couldn\u2019t cope with the order and do not mind missing one or two customers along the queue in any case they will still sell it to a later customer (probably a shorter time).  That\u2019s a 2 star rating for Service. Hopefully can try it when my next visit (with reasonable waiting time).\n\nHad an assortment of dim sum for lunch. Overall pretty average. I reckon the cooked food might be better? It was quite crowded during lunch hour. The charsiew pau was probably the best of them all.\n\nAuthentic Teochew Cuisine.\nSat Dinner, luckily we have made a reservation as the place is almost full .\nBeing first timers we ordered a fair bit from the recommended list.\nFood is served very fast and they asked if we want to slow down the pace... and then last 3 dishes did not come till they activate again\ud83d\ude05\nI would say the food is within our expectations of a good teochew cuisine and portions are good.\nOnly exception is the teochew kway teow, L portion but hardly enough for 8 of us.\n\n\nOption: 8:\nName: Sum's Kitchen \u6df1\u8a18\u98ef\u5e97\u71d2\u9d28\nAddress: 3 Jln Legundi, Singapore 759266\nPhone: 6757 2118\nDelivery Available: Information Not Available\nDine-In Available: Information Not Available\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: Closed\nThursday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 3.7\nReviews: \n\nMy regular choice, Best HK Roast Duck, Steam Fish, Cantonese Soup\u2026\n\nThe roast duck is very good.

You will not taste the curry aroma and instead you will only taste peanut flavour kinda gravy.\nThere may gut be a long queue during peak hours.\n\nRemember to put extra sambal into your curry chicken noodles for the spiciness and fragrant. Always ordered the medium size, as small size was never enough for my craving of it. A single bowl of CCN served with a generous portion of Hainanese Steamed Chicken and tau pok, the meat was juicy and tender. Overall it taste good and delicious.\n\nLong queue for a reason, and will queue for it again!\n\nThere's always a long queue. It's my second time (gave it a second chance), but i can't quite fathom why still. The soup is the most distinct part of the dish here imo; it's more milky than most others and perhaps this is its draw, but my friend and i couldn't get into it. Everything else is rather on par with the average curry chicken noodles, and you might get better cuts of chicken if you're lucky. As a bonus, the chicken portion is rather generous.\n\nSo not worth it! Just 2 pcs of chicken meat and so many tau pok and 1 pc potato.  I'd rather get the curry noodle at golden mile market. So much tastier.\n\n\nOption: 3:\nName: Xing Ji Rou Cuo Mian (Bak Chor Mee)\nAddress: 85, #01-07 Bedok North Rd, 460085\nPhone: 9879 4599\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nThursday: Closed\nFriday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 1 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.2\nReviews: \n\nDate of visit: Wed 4 Oct 2023\nTime : 10 pm\n\nTried this stall for the first time. Ordered a small meatball noodle soup priced at $3.50.\n\nQuite many people ordered. Got the beeper to inform you when it\u2019s ready.\n\nSoup is alright but salty. Noodles are springy maybe tough for old folks. Portion quite small.\n\nOverall taste is good.\n\nMore than 10years apart, the taste and flavour are well maintained!\nComfort food.\nSoup is simple yet comforting.\nNoodle texture is done just right. Minced meat blends well with the hot soup and tastes really great with the noodle.\n\nRelatively clean and very organised in terms of ordering system and buzzer.\nSpeed is quick as there is a system within the store.\n\nI love the broth so much as even though it is very greasy and oily, the soup has a sweetness from the minced meat, and the alkalinity of the thick mee kia noodles is not too heavy. The noodles are so chewy and quick thick. I love it!! Minced meat is soft and generous as well. The addition of the dumplings is a must! It has sa fragrant sole fish flavour in it.\n\nUsing the old school style of ceramic bowl, it feels like I'm eating my grandma's food \u2764\ufe0f\n\nFirst time trying a soup version of Bak Chor Mee! Maybe because I was never a fan of bak chor mee, this soup version tasted underwhelming for me. The soup felt under seasoned and the noodles were quite average. The only thing I like about this dish is that they gave a lot of pork balls at only $4.50! Overall a underwhelming experience for me....\n\nThis is a nice bowl of soupy bak chor mee. They do one item and do it well, and no wonder it has a big following and long queues.\n\nTried the $4.5 Bak chor Mee on a Sunday morning. Luckily, no line and was served in 2 minutes.\n\nOne thing that is distinctly clear is the number of meat balls, which are really soft and nice to chew.\n\nThe soup is nice and not like water. Good flavour. Asked for extra chilli, and that adds some much needed spice. Good amount of minced meat as well. Noodles are soft.\n\nThis is a feel-good meal.\n\n\nOption: 4:\nName: Brotzeit German Beer Bar and Restaurant - Katong\nAddress: 126 E Coast Rd, Singapore 428811\nPhone: 6348 7050\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.2\nReviews: \n\n18/11/23\nhad cravings for pork knuckle.\n2 dishes that contained pork knuckles did not disappoint. the skin was evenly crispy, and meat was soft and tender. they taste quite similar to the ones you get in germany.\nthe mac and cheese was great, too.\nyou can skip the soup, was good, but save your tummy for another sausage platter\ud83d\ude09\nonly 2 of us, so we couldn't order much to try. We will be back to try new dishes~\n\nwaiter and waitress(chinese) was very hospitable.\n\nOne of many outlets in Singapore serving hearty German fare and beer. Akin to a German beer hall in atmosphere with friendly staff serving the delicious food. Visiting during Oktoberfest presents more food and drink options and that makes it very popular, requiring advance booking. Value for money considering the amount of meat that\u2019s served.\n\nI am a Germann living in the US and visiting Singapore. This place is absolutely amazing. The food is authentic and delicious. They even import the breadcrumbs for the Schnitzel from Austria. The Erdinger Helles was one of the best I have had. Five stars all around! (and yes, I went 3 times here in 4 days)\n\nHad a great time at this place. As much as I love Asian cuisine, after about 13 days it is always nice to go back to some western comforts and you can\u2019t go wrong with a chicken schnitzel and a beer. The staff were all great and always made sure to serve your beer with the obligatory \u201cPr\u014dst!\u201d which is generally used to say \u201cCheers!\u201d The deserts were nice and the ambience at this location was quite calm which is a welcome change to the busy street markets, food courts and hawker centres. Really glad I visited!\n\nThis is a nice German beerhouse in Katong and has a few branches around the island. A reservation is recommended as it's quite popular and fills up fast.\n\nService is friendly and quick. Beer are strong and taste great in the sweltering Singapore heat. We tried the following -\n\n1) Schweinshaxn (Signature Pork knuckle) - So so good. Crispy but meaty, this is a good rendition of pork knuckle. It was so much that we had to pack some of it. Served with bacon sauerkraut and potato salad.\n\n2) Brezn (4x Pretzel) - Liked how this was presented, but the taste is okay.\n\n\nOption: 5:\nName: Ye Lai Xiang Cheng Tng\nAddress: 1 Bedok Rd, Singapore 469572\nPhone: 9299 5062\nDelivery Available: Information Not Available\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: Closed\nTuesday: Closed\nWednesday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20097:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20097:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20097:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20097:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20097:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.3\nReviews: \n\nThis is the best Cheng Tng in SG! A refreshing dessert featuring the natural sweetness of sweet potato, the chewy richness of dried persimmon, and the subtle crunch of winter melon strips.  It's thirst-quenching and perfectly balances flavors and textures. With each bite, you'll experience a symphony of tastes that rejuvenate your palate on a hot day. Do note it's with ice chips, not shaved ice.\n\nUsed to come here for the Cheng Tng in the past. However, standard has dropped over the years and it is not as good as before.\n\nOverall, still a decent bowl of Cheng Tng, although price has also increased due to inflation: $3 per bowl.\n\nVery generous with the variety of ingredients they used!\n\nSurprised to find strips of dried permission and even sweet potato chunks in it! Portion was huge and it\u2019s was such a delight to have this on a hot day.\n\nOnly wishing for it the be less sweet and served in shaved ice.\n\nFor cyclist, this is a great stop for a break!\n\nA nice bowl of cheng teng. On the sweet side. Ice chips instead of shaved ice. Pricey at $3.\n\nHad cheng tng ($3) on 15/7/23, was excellent!

Noodles were cooked just right, chewy and tasty. The soup was packed with flavors and I loved that it had a garlicky note. Overall always a good place to slurp down a good bowl of mee.\n\nReally inconsistent. Sometimes good, sometimes bad. These days they do not close past midnight. The queue is much more forgiving these days hence ok to pop by for a quick meal. Always order the large one.\n\nMeatballs are good and the noodles are quite al dente.\n\nThere are a few bak chok noodle stalls in this hawker centre.  This stall served not only soup noodle but also dry noodle.\n\nThis is my preferred stall as the meat balls and minced meat were tastier for my liking.  I also prefer their ordering system.\n\nYou will be given a caller after your order.  You do not have to wait there.  While waiting for the food, you could queue for other stalls.\n\nSoup was thick and rich filled with minced meat, noodle springy. Pair with generous amount of fishballs and meatballs.\nA bit tough to find seats and parking lot during weekend peak hour.\n\nOrdered the small portion. Was quite satisfying. Love the overall taste. Bring back many memories of those late night supper at Bedok 85 back then.

The food here is really amazing. Each plate is lovingly cook to perfection for each customer. From the beginning to end, I can see that the chef is very passionate about his food and want to share it with his customers.\n\nDefinitely 5 stars.\n\nWe tried the top 3 items on the menu - Signature Mee Tai Mak, Dry Laksa and Dry Mee Siam. The Mee Tai Mak is fried with century egg! It is a very unusual ingredient for fried noodles but it blends in so beautifully! It is also full of wok hey! Excellent. The mee siam is so full of flavor! Dry laksa is also amazing.\n\nAll is nice but really recommend the signature mee tai mak!\n\nOmy the mtm is really good! so much textures & flavours...can't really pinpoint everything but it is defo a pleasureable one!\n\nLaska was lemak fragrant & really special!\n\nMee siam was OK, but I think cos I was wowed by the earlier 2 dishes more! But still a lovely dish though I wished it more tangy in its flavours!\n\nPrawn paste chicken wings and prawn rolls are very nice. Dry meesiam is great after adding lime! Dry laksa is pretty good too. Mee tai Mak is not bad.\n\nTried the dry laksa small portion and the prawn roll. Was blown away by the taste. Also bought a calamamsi spread home to try. Will be back to try the mee tai bak and har cheong kai next round. Love that everything on their menu is tasty yet fairly priced. Will recommend that one order the medium size portion. Small portion is just not enough.\n\nOrdered the dried laksa and mee siam. Both are bad. Dried laksa lacks the usual laksa aromatics eg. haebi, laksa leaf. Can only taste coconut milk. Dried mee siam is sweet and too wet a consistency. Overall just badly executed.\n\n\nOption: 8:\nName: Sin Ho\nAddress: Bedok North Street 1, block 216 #01-75\nPhone: 9693 8265\nDelivery Available: Information Not Available\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: Closed\nTuesday: Closed\nWednesday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.1\nReviews: \n\nThe only stall opened in the evening so we had a nice quiet space to dine. The prawn paste chicken was seasoned very well. My husband liked the fish soup. Dishes were not too salty. Can\u2019t ask a lot on the service as it is a hawker stall. We spent $30 for 2 of us. Might come back and try other dishes as stall owner seemed passionate and diligent with his craft.\n\nDecided to do a dinner take-away at  this zi char stall at Blk.16 Bedok South. Wait time was slightly shorter than 20 minutes even though there were a bit of a queue. Pretty fast I must say. Ordered the following dishes and my taste bud's verdict: 1) Sweet sour fish; It tasted ok. Nothing to shout about. 2) Black soy sauce pork with ginger; The pork slices were tender with a nice gingery taste. The bits of fried pork lard gave an additional porky flavour. 3) Fried sambal kangkong; Sambal flavour was nicer than most places. 4) Fried rice; The rice was lumpy and soggy. There wasn't any wok-hei flavour in it. Disappointment. 5) Fried prawn paste chicken (Har cheong gai); Perhaps the best dish. The chicken wings were crispy on the outside and tender and juicy inside. My favourite dish here. 6) Fried tofu with vegetables; Tasted just like any other zi char stall. It's saving grace was the bits of fried pork lard which added an extra texture to the dish. Overall verdict: It's about the same as the average hawker centre/coffee shop zi char stalls.\n\nWe (3 covers) had Har Cheong Gai, crayfish soup, bitter gourd pork ribs, prawn omelette, and mixed vegetables with one rice for $48.\n\nIt\u2019s a busy stall so it\u2019s best to arrive and order before 7pm. Make your payment at the point of order and make sure you know your table number. Har Cheong Gai was amazingly juicy and crisply fried! The meat inside was tender but not very flavorful.\n\nOverall it\u2019s a great value, and delicious to boot!\n\nGem of a zhi char store at the hawker centre of Blk 216 Bedok North street 1. The food is generally delicious and cooked with good wok hei.\n\nThe prawn paste chick is crispy on the outside with good prawn paste flavour, and juicy on the inside. The braised red garoupa fish head with bitter gourd is very well seasoned, and for us the star of this meal. The Kang kong is properly cooked.\n\nPrices are not quite Hawker centre level, but for the  food you get it\u2019s well worth the money in my view.\n\nOne slight drawback: if you\u2019re going for dinner, there are few other stalls open except for Sin Ho, so you\u2019ll have to buy your own drinks.\n\nHighly recommended.\n\nThey served a delicious seafood soup with a awesome broth. And the prawn paste chicken was equally tasty. It was nicely fried and had a fragrant prawn paste taste.\n\n\nOption: 9:\nName: yang epok epok\nAddress: 1 Bedok Rd, Bedok Food Center, Singapore 469572\nPhone: None\nDelivery Available: No\nDine-In Available: Information Not Available\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: Closed\nTuesday: Closed\nWednesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.1\nReviews: \n\nArguably one of the best genuinely-handmade epok-epok around.

At 60CENTS a pop, what's not to love? Yang's epok epok firmly belongs in our hawker culture and we need to protect places like these.\n\nBest epok epok in Singapore! The crusts stay crispy for hours.

Definitely need to make a reservation the next time I'm coming here.\n\nReasonable prices, good service and atmosphere, waiting times can be a bit long. Coffee was fragrant and not acidic. Unfortunately I found the raclette to be too pungent, even more so than blue cheese. Otherwise this is a nice small Cafe to hang out at.\n\nWe came here at 2pm on a Sunday, not crowded but the service was damn slow and bad. We ordered at 2:11pm, 1 steak with 5 dollars top up for the cheese and 1 salmon. Half an hour later at 2:41pm, the food were still not here so we went to ask the staff, they said 6 more minutes. Waited for about another 8 minutes still no food so went to ask again and they replied rudely \"now, now, now!\" Ended up our food were still not here. Finally my salmon arrived, only the fish was hot, the sides were all cold, terrible! Steak arrived around 2:52pm and we had to wait another 5 minutes for the cheese that we paid $5 for. Of course the steak turned cold! Ordered medium rare, what came was medium well to well done. Come on... you all can do better, waited more than 50 minutes for trash food. My hubby ate 1 mouthful and asked for refund. Within 1 minute, the female cook came to clear the food angrily making quick and noisy moves. Wow, serve so slow clear so fast, worst service I've experienced.\n\n\nOption: 2:\nName: Putian Flavour Food\nAddress: 121 Hougang Ave 1, Singapore 530121\nPhone: 9225 9418\nDelivery Available: Information Not Available\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: Closed\nThursday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 1 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.3\nReviews: \n\nOrdered the $39 set menu for 2 which came in fairly small portions. Their signature sweet sour pork with lychee is good, not overly sweet nor sour. The bean curd vegetable dish was on the bland side. Our fried rice had some wok hei but the portion is more for a person instead of 2. The herbal prawns (6 of them) soup was not over powering of herbs if one is not fond of angelica. The free dessert was white fungus with red dates. Although sweet, it was cold and a nice way of ending my meal. Good thing abt this place is no GST or service charge and actually the service personnel is attentive and polite. Food was served fast as well.\n\nPutian style food place. Neat and nice location. Ordered the set meal for 2 pax. Food is tasty enough but portion is more for small eaters. In fact the portion can be finished by 1 person with big appetite. Drinks like tea and coffee can be ordered from the coffee shop next door and consumed.\n\n1. They have worms in their broccoli. I found 2 worms so i minus 2 stars\n2. They served me one of the hardest and toughest chicken i\u2019ve eaten so i minus 1 star\nThe rest of the food served tastes fine, not too bad lor.\nBut if you have a fear of worms I don\u2019t recommend you to come (:\n\nFast turn around, fast serving, attentive staff, friendly and great food.\n\nHighly recommended the xin hua thin noodle if you like stir fried bee hoon. If you like soupy kind, you can op for fujian noodle.\n\nIf you can take raw seafood, you can try the garlic raw cockles.\n\nA very popular small eatery in Lorong Ah Soo. About 4 tables inside and 4 outside the restaurant. Can get crowded at peak hours for lunch and dinner. Ample parking available.\n\nTried the Putian Lor Mee and fried sweet potato noodles. Flavour is mild but delicious. At $6 for 1 pax it is reasonable price for restaurant setting.\n\nCan order dishes when dining with more pax.

The serving is quite a lot. Big chunks of liver in the porridge with fried shallots and spring onions. The porridge is tasty and smooth. Don't mind coming back again to try the other options . It's crowded during lunch time but the shop assistant will help you find seats\n\nHow can a porridge restaurant garner such a high number of reviews and such a high rating? The answer is the porridge is really that good and very affordable.\n\nThere weren't much seats in the restaurant so most people would opt to takeaway. The queue was quite long and I had to wait about 30minutes for my porridge. Even though I ate it about an hour later, it was still piping hot.\n\nThe porridge had a slightly smoky aroma with a gooey consistency like typical Cantonese porridge. Initially I was afraid that I wouldn't be full so I added on some sliced pork to my pork ball and century egg porridge, and a youtiao but I kinda regretted it as they were so generous with the ingredients that I felt like I just came back from a buffet after finishing the porridge.\n\nI would recommend getting the minced pork ball and century egg as the combination works the best.\n\nBest porridge in town! Be prepared to queue for at least 15 mins and then wait about 30 minutes for your piping hot bowl of creamy goodness chockful of ingredients! Go for the signature porridge. My parents frequently travel accross the island just to eat here. Ingredients are generous and great quality, squid thick and tender, liver so velvety and just ooh la la. It can be confusing to secure a table, approach the lady manning the delivery station. Price? Cheap! For the quality you pay!\n\nTasty porridge, especially when complete with the you tiao and additional egg. Do consider 45-60 mins during peak breakfast to lunch time hours. If dining in, tell the walking/cleaning aunty you need a table then given a number and take a seat, once she found a seat, then you may start to queue to put your order.\n\n20 min wait for porridge after my order #14 was placed. Fast action by all the crew to clear the q. Enjoyed my hot yuanyang while waiting.\nFound the meats n innards too sweet, expecting savoury.  Not sure if the powerful waft of durian, next door was the factor.\n\n\nOption: 4:\nName: 5 Star Corner Western Food\nAddress: 805 Hougang Central, #01-116, Singapore 530805\nPhone: None\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 1 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 3.9\nReviews: \n\nThe portion is big and it only cost $7 !!! But I think their usp is the sauce of the chicken chop, so the fish and chips just soso lah and they even didn\u2019t give tartar sauce just a normal mayonnaise. Recommended for all their chops except fish and chips.\n\nTried this stall many years ago and ventured to try out again with my son and daughter. There's a pretty long queue but it is moving fast with efficiency. We ordered mixed grill ($12), Pork Chop ($7) and Chicken Chop ($7). The friendly service crew processed the orders very quickly and deliver the food to our table within 15 minutes.\n\nPortion wise, they are huge! Taste wise, I would say there's some room for fine tuning and improvement. But its already pretty decent and tasty.\n\nI noticed that the several tables around me, all ordered mixed grill too. So its a very popular choice here. Your have Chicken, Pork and lamp meat on the same hot plate. Very satisfying experience, dining here.\n\nThe legendary Hougang Ah Beng western.. The food is excellent.. But at the price point don't expect very good service.. Want service, go restaurants and pay service charge. Atmosphere, coffee shop, don't expect air con.. Want air con, go restaurants and pay service fee..\nNothing to complain, just simple western food..\n\nPatronised this store more than 20yrs ago, i rem manned by a few ah bengs at that time, very popular stall with a messy q system. Fast forward 20yrs later, still popular, seemed to be manned by same guys and chicken chop is still good. Pork chop can skip though, too hard. Portion of the sides quite generous.\n\nOne of the best western food hawker stalls I've ever tried. Seriously don't know why it has such a low rating, portions are good, meat is well cooked and tender, and prices are very reasonable.

Other dishes like the Briyani and satay as well were delicious! Definitely something you should try given the price \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffb\n\nTheir food is ok, butter rice is nice. Chicken cutlet reminds me of my secondary school fried chicken snack. The price increases a few times. I order online but they gave me wrong/missing order. If order at their stalls, the preparation could take sometimes, then sometimes they will closed their stalls to go smoking at the carpark.\n\nGenerous portions, delicious food, friendly staff! Western Ambeng idea was definitely a hit with the family as usually everyone is so fickle for iftar choices and they love the variety of sauces as well!\n\nUnderrated western food that happens to be halal. Warm and friendly staff that greets with a smile. Food portion is very very generous. The aglio olio is especially superb. Worthy of #cleanplateclub\n\nDecided to check out the long queue that is consistent during peak hours. While cooking time may varies depending on what you order. There is a buzzer system and I will say it is worth the wait. Taste wise I got what I paid for. If there is one small niggle, the price is considered on the mid tier side considering it is inside ci yuan cc.\n\n\nOption: 6:\nName: Prata Lahhh!

Bull\u2019s eye nicely done. But sadly Egg Benedict\u2019s yolk was broken during the process. Staff apologised to me and I said it\u2019s okay. Good service. But the Prata still taste good \ud83d\udc4d\n\nTried the kosong, the thosai and the paper thosai. The prata was fluffy and crunchy on the outside. The thosai and paper thosai texture is nice.\n\nAs for the fish curry, find that it is lacking in flavor. Mainly can taste sourness. I feel that a dash of salt will bring up the flavor. Possible that the chef wants to create a healthier version and reduced the salt. Anyway, I am giving feedback more based on the taste :).\n\nTried this Prata stall run by young enterprising owners. Their food is made to order. We ordered the cheese Prata and Egg Benedict. The cheese they used is mozzarella cheese, not the normal square ones. The Egg Benedict Prata is very creative and it elevates the prata dish to next level. Love how the egg benedict was done and it goes well with the prata and turkey ham and cheese. The mutton gravy was thick and full of flavour. Very shiok. What impresses us is the cleanliness of their stall. Will definitely frequent this stall. A must go to for Prata craving.\n\nBriyani and the chicken was very dry and so little curry provided. Somehow was not provided curry for the bull's eye but it was still nice but my expectations is certainly dropped\n\n\nOption: 7:\nName: Arnold's Fried Chicken Hougang Branch\nAddress: Hougang St 51, #01-49 Hougang Green Shopping Mall, Singapore 538719\nPhone: 6386 9015\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:45\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:45\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:45\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:45\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:45\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:45\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:45\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4\nReviews: \n\nHave a sudden craving for chicken and visited Arnold\u2019s.

Pork chop was tender though we wish there\u2019s options to choose the sides. Mushroom soup was decent and fried was well fried. The cheesy escargot was unique. We dipped the Fried with the cheese! Generous portion for spaghetti. Staff were friendly too. Cashless option via QR code payment available.\n\n1st time there. Their grilled pork chops (bestseller) was really tender and especially flavourful (eat with their mustard). The portobello was nicely breaded and fried under their Portobello with grilled chicken. Good deal to add soup with drink for extra 5.90. Place coikd do with some background music to liven up thd restaurant. Will be back tk try others in menu.\n\nThe staff was coughing badly and didn't wear a mask! I am irked by this behaviour after the COVID pandemic. The prawn and grilled chicken pasta was not bad, but the \"aglio olio\" lacked parsley flavour. It tasted like garlic and chilli pasta. The mushroom soup was also not flavourful and lacked texture. I prefer to have some bigger bits of mushrooms for texture and bite.\n\nJust bought oysters for takeaway, and I'm impressed how well packed they are. Even more impressive are the plump and fresh oysters! They are really juicy and super tasty!\n\n5 stars for service - all staff were friendly and helpful.\n2 stars for food.\nBeef burger - The beef patty was pretty dry.\nGrilled fish fillet - Fish fillet was way too salty. Would be nice if there were more vegetables, they just looked too sad. For this price point, there are many better western fare around.\nPasta bolognese with fried chicken - The sauce was a little bit too sour but still bearable. The crispy chicken was nice.

I really enjoyed everything on the all-inclusive menu that we had. Every dish was delicious. It was a shame the only dish recommended to us was not available.  I can't score the atmosphere as high as we were the only table all dinner. So you feel a little looked upon by everyone working there. I also think price wise for the all you can eat and drink package I think it's expensive, really the same as a hotel price, the portion sizes maybe could be a little small and reduce the price a little, we didnt have room for dessert, but they were already included on the menu, we did ask for another drink but was refused. We had a good time and probably would come back in the future\n\nWanted to try something different and chance upon this restaurant at Mohd Sultan. The dishes cooked from the tajine are awesome. We had both chicken and veal. Both are savoury and flavourful. The batbout which is a round, firm and chewy dough goes extremely well with the tajine dishes.\n\nDo notes you must order two portion for the tajine dish which will cost you almost $70 per dish.\n\nNew Moroccon restaurant run by a very friendly Moroccan owner who's super helpful and has built a great varied menu that we thoroughly enjoyed.\n\nGoing as a group to this restaurant is probably a good choice so you can order a few different dishes and try as they are all good for sharing.\n\nThe specia slow cookedl lamb shoulder dish was our favourite, the lamb was so tender and juicy and meat falling off the bone, cooked perfectly with rice and the combination was wonderful.\n\nWe tried Tajine and few other dishes which were all good and made it for a wonderful Moroccon feast.\n\nGlad we have Tajine joining latest scene of diversity in culinary works. The salty sourdough mini buns gave quite an interesting pairing compared to usual pita bread. I love the light intensifying broth that comes with braised monkfish. Lentils dip surprised with almond flakes, while the hummus and grilled eggplant are lighter than the norm Indian and Middle East buds. Tasteful decor within small space, friendly and attentive staff to brighten vibes. Would hope to see more well maintained restroom, for it's the only one for all.\n\nVisited this TRADITIONAL restaurant yesterday, so it claims. I thought the meat was well cooked and all. Unfortunately the flavours were underwhelming and portion was small. Please note this is a 2 persons portion. The lamb stock was very light in colour too seems like watered down. One is suppose to pour the lamb stock over the Royal couscous dish. I expected a more robust flavour and looking forward to more spices. We are in Singapore and very exposed to diff\u00e9rent foods with lots of spices like briyani, and all the dishes available in a Nasi Padang joint. So I was surprised to learn from this restaurant that North African food seems \u201cvery clean\u201d.\n\nI love th\u00e9 cocktails though, they were really yummy. We would have come back to try the starters and some other dishes but we won\u2019t be coming back. So why two stars? It was very odd that the Israeli floor manager asked for our feedback and when we provided our truths that we love food just that the spices were underwhelming. She seemed defensive but most importantly she said that the Chef is just interpreting Moroccan food in his way and has tone down the spices for Singaporean taste buds. I was surprised to hear. Aren\u2019t you marketing Tajine as a traditional Moroccan restaurant so I expect that? Not a watered down or modern interpretation. Just traditional please.\n\nOh and food prices were really expensive.\n100 plus per person for Royal Couscous, corne de gazelles (dessert) , 2 cocktails and one mint tea each.\n\n\nOption: 2:\nName: The Larder Cafe\nAddress: Blk 177 Toa Payoh Central, #01-124, Singapore 310177\nPhone: 6253 8382\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.2\nReviews: \n\nFirst time having lunch here today. I ordered from their Weekday Brunch Special Menu which is available from 11am to 3pm.\n\nI ordered Pan Fried Dory Fillet in Cilantro sauce with some greens and fries ($12.90++) plus $4.80++ for the Meal Upgrade to include the soup of the day and a drink.\n\nRating for the main course: 4/5 (the fish portion is just nice it is well cooked but the fries are slightly salty.\n\nRating for the spinach soup and bread:\n4/5 (the soup is delicious and the bread is nice)\n\nOverall, this place is ideal for lunch and dinner with family or friends but it does not impress me enough to give a 5-star rating.\n\nThe Larder cafe has never fail to make my day. Standard of the food is still there. Ambience good. Enjoyed the Truffle fries & Salmon thoroughly.\n\nThe food was good! Got the brunch set meal of the chicken skewer and pasta, with soup and drinks. Go if you would like to have a cafe feel at a reasonable 'cafe' price (for the set).\n\nHidden treasure of Toa Payoh! There are not many cafes in TPY that offers, coffee, food, all day breakfast, beer, ice cream in a cosy setting.\n\nScan QR code and self order but the servers are friendly and easy going. The layout inside lean toward a bit of Retro settings, nice pics with warm lights.\n\nFood was good! Every dish was a 4-5 stars but hands down it\u2019s the desserts that\u2019s gonna kill! Ice cream, Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e, waffles! If I had more space, I will try the rainbow cake.\n\nThe Waffles and Ice Cream is really very good.  The other food I would say so-so and can be missed. So I'd only be back for Waffles.\n\nThe place is really noisy when running full house. We can't wait to leave right our meal. It's so stressful to eat in such noisy environment.\n\nCafe is on 2nd level.

Different price for malay. Very unreasonable. Avoid at all cost. Portion pathetic . $13 for this food !!\n\nNice nasi padang. The beef rendang is good and traditional. Rempah of the rendang is great and fresh. Ask for extra gravy for rendang as it is more traditional dry style. Other dishes is good too. They are generous with the gravies so that added complexity to the dish. I think firstly the dishes are traditional and what dish we choose to balance with each other is important. It is almost the same for all nasi padang too. Overall it is a great gem for authentic nasi padang. Well done!\n\nOne of the best nasi Padang in Toa Payoh. The beef rendang is stew till very soft n tender.\n\nAuthentic Indonesian style nasi Padang done very well at good prices. Very popular with a queue during lunch time. Can tell many are regulars.\n\nThe gravy is flavourful and not overpowering spicy which is great for me. Also lotsa variety to choose from. The beef looks really tender even though I chose the Sotong, which is fresh and tender.\n\nIt is a true local treasure that brings the authentic flavors of Malay cuisine to our neighborhood. If you're in search of a memorable dining experience that celebrates the heart and soul of Malay culture, look no further. This eatery is a must-visit, whether you're a local or just passing through.\n\n\nOption: 5:\nName: Pistachio Middle Eastern & Mediterranean Grill\nAddress: 501 Orchard Rd, #02-04/05 Wheelock Place, Singapore 238880\nPhone: 6262 6400\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.4\nReviews: \n\nI came to Singapore few weeks ago and was looking for Mediterranean restaurants. I stumbled upon this gorgeous place 5 minutes away from my hotel. I tried Kebabs on day one and man it was delicious. Atmosphere is great and all servers are friendly, specially three girls Urmi, Wendy and Fina are super nice, they make sure to get you a table quickly, take the order in timely manner and also make valuable suggestions on the menu. They always keep checking if everything is fine and customers are enjoying food. I loved the desert suggestion after eating my dinner. After first day I have been to this place 7-6 times and was always greeted with same service. I highly recommend this restaurant and will go again before I leave Singapore for USA.\n\nWe had the sultan's delight and mussels with garlic cream and cheese toast. The sultan's delight is really enjoyable. We could taste the smokiness from the eggplant puree and the lamb stew is really tender with tomato based sauce. It's tangy and smoky with some crunchiness from the pine nuts. Really enjoyable. But the mussel is pretty standard. It didn't taste really fresh but they're quite generous with the amount. The garlic cheese sauce is ok only.\nService was good and attentive.\n\nExcellent experience with vibrant dining experience. Food has great range of taste to excite the palate. Service is welcoming and top notch, they also gave a complimentary cake.\n\nVisited for my birthday meal with my family as I was craving some Mediterranean food and this place had great reviews. However, the whole experience ended up kinda disappointing - as I had high expectations too on my first visit.\n\nService:\n- It\u2019s a restaurant but I felt like there was not much service per say.\n- It\u2019s a pretty high price point but they don\u2019t serve complimentary water (charged at $3 a pot of hot water, or $11 for Evian water only)\n- Ordering isn\u2019t as fuss free as they try to make it. Online ordering only from mobile app, with just one physical menu at the door. Asked for any extra copies for easier viewing but none available. You also have to pay upfront in mobile order.\n- Feels like I visited a restaurant but received fast food style service.\n\nAtmosphere:\n- Overall atmosphere is okay. Like a typical restaurant\n\nFood:\n- Average, I\u2019ve had much better at other places for a similar price point.\n- Pita bread, spreads and kebab grills were okay.\n- Saffron rice & Briyani rice were disappointing. They use basmati rice which gave a nice texture. However, flavour is so subtle that I could barely taste the difference between the 2.\n\nSummary:\nWould I return? Definitely not! For the price point, the food and service didn\u2019t live up to expectations for a highly rated restaurant. Will continue on my hunt for yummy Mediterranean food!\n\nFirst time at this restaurant, and I can say the dining experience was great.\n\nFood is great and the serving is not bad as well.  I can only say good things about the service of the Staffs.\nThe place is easy to find and the ambience is something to remember.\n\n\nOption: 6:\nName: Mahaprajna Snack Cafe\nAddress: 22 Lor 7 Toa Payoh, Singapore 310022\nPhone: 6286 8028\nDelivery Available: Information Not Available\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 2.2\nReviews: \n\nDidn\u2019t know if the reviews before I bought them, but granted they were one of the only coffee stalls opened on a Sunday afternoon, there\u2019s not much choices around..\n\n\ud83d\udcb0 At $3.20 for the 2 drinks, it\u2019s at least a full dollar more pricey versus the other two I tried\n\n\u2615\ufe0f taste wise, we both found it to be super bland, really not worth the money at all..\n\nUnfortunately it\u2019s deserving of a 2 star, would have given it a 1 star if the service was poor - not a stall I would consider returning.\n\nLovely elderly lady selling snacks and drinks.

Each table is equipped with one, allowing you to make the most of your waiting time by browsing the web, shopping online, or enjoying a game. Additionally, they provide wireless chargers, so don't forget to charge your phone while savoring your meal. The staff is exceptionally friendly and accommodating.\n\nTo be fair, this rating is based solely on their signature chendol. Was graving for dessert and chanced upon their chendol advert outside their shop. Looked so good so proceeded to order their signature chendol as take away. My work place is only a few shops away and not that far. Almost immediately I opened the tub and was disappointed that the 'shaved ice' was all melted. The ingredients were also very pathetic plus the coconut milk was very lumpy as seen from the photo. I think they use ready-made coconut milk as I could see boxes of them at the counter. Very heart pain that I paid $5.09 for this lousy 'signature' chendol.\n\nOmg~ so nice! I love the texture of the noodles, the small little container of chilli yet potent enough, the fried wanton that has filling and not just fried wanton skin and the overall portion of the meal! The soup is strong in flavour, slightly to the the salty side. Bakso is good. My complete set cost about 10.50 with a drink (lime juice or lemon tea) (i prefer lemon tea), 2 wanton and 2 bakso. I thought quite reasonable! Please don't change ur taste or standard for this particular Jakarta chicken noodles~~~ I always love indo chicken noodles! The sulawesi noodles is just as good too, just that the chicken feels lesser but chilli spicier. No matter how, am coming back again and again! Note: Service may need to slightly speed up when there's more customers but I'll definitely wait for good food! Also, this particular section of shop has always been small so seatings very limited and slightly feels more cramped with people eating and queueing.\n\nFriendly Staff and very attentive to customer.\nLove the springy noodle texture that is authentically indonesian! Must try is the Bakmie Rica Rica and Bakmie Yamin Bandung.\n\nComplete the set with a cup of Cendol, its the real indonesian cendol and you could choose jackfruit or durian topping.\n\n\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\n\nGood option if you are looking for authentic bakmi and cendol. The cendol is great, choosing the less sugar option has the right amount of sweetness for me. The pangsit goreng is also good.

Good choice of vegetarian options\n\nThe staff, Kati, Apple and Coco were very helpful, providing assistance whenever required. The food was served was promptly, with high quality. Every dish served surpassed expectations. Keep up the good work!\n\nTruffle mushroom fettuccine was heavenly. Hawaiian pizza was awesome. Both dishes around sgd20. Ribeye sgd35 was a disappointment (3/5 stars at most). Dessert medley sgd19 was alright but hits and misses (4/5 stars at most). Giving this place 5 stars coz they serve complimentary water and service was attentive yet not obtrusive. Great ambience too, chairs were comfy tables were large. Serviettes were thick and luscious. Place was dimly lit, quite romantic, yet so many diners were large groups of family, still able to enjoy. Plenty of baby chairs available and children's cutlery also provided. We will definitely be back for the fettuccine and the pizza. Give the ribeye a miss.\n\nGood food and plenty selection of wine ,\nSpecially thanks to Kati who served me thru out the whole dining experience,\nSoft spoken person and pleasant.\n\nKati's service is excellent.

This course is truly helpful if you wanna learn everything about coffee bean's history, global logistic and how to make your own decision to get the best suitable type for yourself. Looking forward to the upcoming course about Coffee Cocktail Mixology in 2021.\n\nA fantastic workshop that taught me more than I could have hoped for about coffee and its making! The barista course was very informative, well explained and fun at the same time. We got a lot of information from history, over beans to coffee quality and equipment.

THIS IS HANDS DOWN THE BEST AND MOST DELICIOUS AND TASTY nasi Ayam penyet. the curry + crumbs mixed with the rice is AMAZING \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d and the chicken is well cooked and tender. Thank you.\n\nI had steam chicken with brown rice , service wise is good from the workers . They are friendly but not the boss, the boss is a Chinese owner non Muslim employed Muslim workers, unfortunately she only speaks mandarin when I tried to communicate with her, she not that friendly and had a stuck up face .\n\nThe business about 5years .\n\nOk back to the food, no standard at all.\nBrown rice so smashy, steam chicken tasteless no marination at all even they have a big part of the chicken but tasteless, really tasteless, their chillies no match at all with the steam chicken.\n\nMy conclusions go and buy steam chicken rice from the Chinese stall way much better than eating steam chicken from this stall.\n\nFor ayam penyek I dare not try after I alreday tasted the steam chicken with no taste at all in the meat, marination is very important to have a good chicken flavours.\n\nThis is my own opinion ya, so for this , I only give 1 star \u2b50\n\nOne of best Ayam Penyet I have ever had. The chicken is crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. Pair with rice and curry sauce which makes the whole dish very satisfying. The sambal belacan is spicy which makes the chicken tasted even better.\n\nThe staff are friendly and helpful.\n\nWorth to queue/travel to eat: Yes\n\nThe food here is surprisingly good. What stood out the most is the portion of the chicken; They are generous with the size of the chicken, hope it remains this way. The size of the chicken is bigger as compared to most Ayam Penyet places. The set comes with rice as mentioned on the menu below. Service is just as fast despite having to serve orders collected by delivery riders waiting to collect. Also kudos for treating them nicely, reminding the riders to double-check their orders.\n\nI like that they provided sauce and chilli in smaller separate containers for takeaways, easier to make hot if I choose to eat it at a later time. I also like that they provided curry gravy such that the rice is not dry.\n\nOne star missing for charging the extra chilli (at 50 cents each tub) and not separating the chicken from the rice for takeaway.\n\nOne of my go-to at Pasir Ris hawker. The fried chicken is quite big and crispy! The curry and chilli is decently good. It also comes with fried crunchy bits and tauhu. It\u2019s a good portion for 6.50sgd! :)\n\n\nOption: 7:\nName: Richton Cafe\nAddress: 476A Pasir Ris Drive 6, #01-600, Singapore 511476\nPhone: 9388 9150\nDelivery Available: Information Not Available\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: Closed\nTuesday: 7:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 7:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 7:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 7:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 7:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 7:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 1 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4\nReviews: \n\ncame here to try their nasi lemak set A (+ luncheon meat, sausage, fish) and a teh o bing. Dish came up to about $10.20; but the best thing about this dish is the flavourful sambal!! the sambal did the dish justice, spice is just right and all the different ingredients to the dish are made hot and fresh on order!\n\nchicken wing is well seasoned and crispy, fish filet was a tad over-fried though.. and the rice is decently hot and importantly flavourful too! Definitely coming back again for the sambal and the rice - the rest are supporting ingredients\ud83d\ude05\n\nas for reviews about the staff being rude or what not, i dont ever see them being like that..even when there is a long queue and they\u2019re busy. they have character but so long as you\u2019re not out of the line, i doubt they would too. in fact, they\u2019re friendly and helpful!\n\nVery nice cozy food corner in HDB void deck along Pasir Ris Drive 6.\n\nDropped by for breakfast while on an early morning cycling trip in the area because it was the only place to open that early (7am). Auntie is brash in character and blunt but it makes the place more endearing as a heartland food corner IMO (as long as you haven't been an annoying customer to get on the receiving end).\n\nOrdered the set A nasi lemak with otah, yuan yang and bean curd with longan. The main food was alright. Nothing outstanding about it, though it's nice that it's light on oil and freshly cooked, and the \"otah\" was basically flavoured sponge rather than actual otah, which was disappointing.\n\nI like their (seemingly handmade?) dessert offerings, and the cold bean curd, sweetened by the longan, hit the right spot to bookend the meal. It helped that there was a seat with a view of the road outside and some nice greenery.\n\nCan't really comment on comparative pricing for the area (or the recent price hikes) since I don't live in Pasir Ris, but as someone who's used to the higher prices in the North-East, it definitely remains on the affordable end of the spectrum.\n\ntl;dr nice cozy heartland breakfast spot. Don't mind the auntie, try the dessert.\n\nEnded up ordering food here over two days and it was a mixed experience. The service was friendly and quick.\n\nThe morning  kway teow noodles were tasty but there was too much tofu in the ngoh hiang and fishcake.  The mee goreng was enjoyable, if a little sweet, and I liked the chicken chop with rice. The ayam goreng with fries was disappointing though. It did not look like the menu photo at all, and was in fact over fried till black and the meat was super dry. It seemed as if it was someone else\u2019 order that was cancelled and then refried. It was inedible.\n\nI have been patronizing this place for more than 7 years. The food is decent and the price is reasonable. This eatery has its character. I have no problem with the operator.

Ordered the sambal hor fun and stir fry beehoon with a plate of kangkong too. I like how the food were served really hot and portion was decent too. Kangkong was a little too salty. Very nice deco in the shop, service was prompt too. Might drop by again to try the breakfast.\n\nGreat breakfast !

Omg, had an awfully yummilicious meal. The highlight is the sambal sweet potato leaves. Not many eateries serve this dish. Its a must have. Thanks Ms Ai and team. What a way to wrap the hectic day. Am happy.\n\u2248===========================\n\nHave not visited this eatery for awhile. The service and meal served are still awsome. Highly recommended, especially for family get together. Thank you Ms Ai and team!\n\nNice fun cheery place tucked in a corner. Food was a total let down sorry to say. Far far cry from established eating houses with zi char style. Food had zero wok hey and rather tasteless and almost bland. I looked around and I am pretty sure I wasn't alone given the handful of half eaten food. Quantity is reasonable and menu had good variety which was probably its saving grace. Hyper fast serving time as well if you need a quick fix.\n\nOrdered this under food delivery for a family dinner and we were satisfied with the quality and taste!\n\nThe set for 2-3 pax is extremely worth it, and we added on one more meat dish. The Har Cheong Gai deserve special mention as it was the type that just has fried chicken skin with minimal batter, and was bursting with flavour. The sweet and sour fish was also tasty.\n\nPortions were a little small, but will definitely order again and try more of their seafood next time \u263a\ufe0f\n\n\nOption: 10:\nName: OMOOMO\nAddress: 1 Pasir Ris Close, #02-321, E!Avenue@Downtown East, 1 Pasir Ris Cl, #02-321, Singapore 519599\nPhone: 6282 7381\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 3.6\nReviews: \n\nUnderrated place. Generally the 3 meals I ordered will fresh and with big portion. Sauce are flavourful. No Q even on a weekend dinner timing. Order at counter and self collect the meal. Self serve drink counter. No frills cafe/restaurant. Recommend to have a quick fix for a decent meal/price\n\nLousy food, we complain that the food shows on the menu is totally different from the cooked food. One look at the posted picture below tells u how charred the bulgogi beef is cooked. They replaced another one and still looks the same.  The chicken noodle bowl is extremely salty and the seaweed taste bad.. Don\u2019t even deserve a 3.8 star as shown in the google review. Will never come again and avoid this restaurant in downtown east!\n\nNice cosy restaurant in the busy area of Downtown East. Food is priced well, affordable meals that actually taste good! :)\n\nGo for the sets, it\u2019s more worth it (and also because the portions are not that big). Great flavours, hardworking staff.\n\nOnly gripe: If you could increase the food portions, it\u2019ll be more filling and I could enjoy eating more of the great food! ^^\n\nOrdered a beef bulgogi & karage teppan as well as the promo Takoyaki with drinks.\n\nFood is decent, nothing special but perfectly serviceable but portions are lacking. I honestly couldn't tell i was eating beef as it's more minced then bulgogi. The surprisingly good item here was the Takoyaki. It's nice & crispy on the outside while remaining soft & fluffy inside even though it's only filling is the batter. Though given the behaviour of the staff, i wouldn't try it when they're busy.\n\nIt's pretty much a self service style of eatery, you order at the kiosks in front, then collect your food when it's ready & get your drinks from the dispenser.\n\nI wouldn't worry about it being too busy though, 2pm on a Saturday & i was the only customer. Make of that what you will. I wouldn't recommend this place unless you're in a rush & just need fuel for your body.\n\nTad bit salty for the ramen but do enjoy their croquette and does the dispense coke taste better for some reason idk. Really nice and friendly staff too\n",

I added pate for $2 which is creamy and complements the sauces and meats.\nGrilled BBQ pork - the meats is well marinated and kinda like a savory sausage. Not bad.\nSlat baked roast chicken - children like this cos the meat flavour is milder than the pork I guess\nSpring rolls - quite large pieces, suggest to buy and share esp is also buying the banh mi.\n\nOverall must eat! I believe the rat saga is well over and I wish the staff and business all the best to continue providing great Vietnamese fare!\n\nI am not a fan of Banh Mi but this changed my mind about this humble sandwich. The bun was crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside while the generous fillings were flavourful but yet not too salty. The coffees were good too and were huge enough to be shared. Glad that dine-in is available again as the ambience was very quirky and authentic. Friendly service too. The menu is diverse and includes pho, spring rolls and flan. Those who stay nearby to this gem are really lucky.\n\nOrdered number 4, with the roasted pork, and all the fixings (cucumber, coriander, spring onions, pate). They\u2019re super generous with the servings, and there\u2019s lots of ingredients stuffed in the lightly toasted baguette; the whole thing was the length of my forearm!!\n\nThe takeaway corner also has friendly staff, especially the cashier who patiently asks every customer how they\u2019d like their order, and helps make recommendations when the extensive menu makes choosing just 1 thing too difficult.\n\n10/10 would love to come again!\n\nI recently had the pleasure of dining at Banh My Saigon in Singapore, and I must say, it was an absolute delight. This unassuming gem of a restaurant offers a culinary experience that is nothing short of exceptional.\n\nThe first thing that struck me about Banh My Saigon was its cozy and inviting ambiance. The warm and welcoming decor creates a comfortable setting for a memorable dining experience. The staff, too, were incredibly friendly and attentive, adding a personal touch to the entire visit.\n\nNow, let's talk about the food. Banh My Saigon specializes in Vietnamese cuisine, and they do it with an authenticity that's hard to come by. I started with the traditional pho, and it was a flavorful bowl of comfort. The broth was rich, the noodles perfectly cooked, and the meat tender and full of flavor. It truly transported me to the streets of Vietnam.\n\nThe real star of the show, however, was their banh mi. The crispy baguette, fresh vegetables, and a choice of mouthwatering fillings make for a sandwich that is an explosion of flavors and textures. Whether you're a fan of classic options like the grilled pork or daring enough to try their unique creations, you won't be disappointed.\n\nOne thing that stood out for me at Banh My Saigon was the attention to detail in their dishes. It's clear that the chefs take great pride in their craft. The presentation was as impressive as the taste, making every meal a feast for both the eyes and the palate.\n\nWhat also impressed me was the affordability of the food. You get high-quality Vietnamese cuisine at reasonable prices, making it an excellent option for both casual dining and special occasions.\n\nIn conclusion, Banh My Saigon in Singapore is a true culinary gem. With its warm ambiance, friendly staff, and delicious, authentic Vietnamese dishes, it's a must-visit for anyone looking to embark on a culinary journey to Vietnam without leaving Singapore. I can't recommend this place enough, and I'm already looking forward to my next visit.\n\nBanh Mi is really delicious with many varieties and the baguette is crispy on the outside which makes the cracking sound as you bite!\n\nThe setup is just like in Vietnam with low tables and stools! The eatery is run by Vietnamese folks and the menu includes pho and other vietnamese food items.\n\nIt is a surprising find in a HDB block with ample carpark lots!\n\n\nOption: 2:\nName: Chef Minh Vietnamese Pho\nAddress: Blk 721 Ang Mo Kio Ave 8, #01-2823, Singapore 560721\nPhone: 8409 9203\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4\nReviews: \n\nSorry.

It sells combination of laksa and Vietnamese dishes. There must be an interesting story behind their decision to sell these 2 unrelated type of food :).\n\nAnyway, decided to try their banh mi. The bread was soft inside and crispy outside. Nice sauce and well marinated meat.\n\nVery rare to find Vietnamese cuisine in food centre. Laksa seems to be the popular for most residences. But decided to try the original Vietnamese pho. No regrets. Tasted very nice nd generous with the shredded chicken $3.50. The broth is so flavourful. Another must eat is their spring roll \u00d72pcs $2.50. Usually you need to travel downtown to Vietnamese restaurant. So this is the place if you want to enjoy simple Vietnamese food. My next visit will try the Laksa and rice item. For tourist, come and experience this and other local food stalls. No regrets.\n\nOne of my go to lunch places at Mayflower Market. From Mayflower MRT station (TEL) take exit 2 or 3.\n\nAuthentic taste and really value for money. The stall serve Laksa that is equally delicious too.\n\nSpring roll noodle and special pork chop rice are my favourite but you can also try their fresh vietnamese spring roll, banh mi, and chicken ph\u00f3\ud83e\udd24\ud83e\udd24\ud83e\udd24yum!\n\nThis is the laksa i been having since i was a kid, which is also my late father favourite laksa. Elderly uncle no longer cook the laksa now. maybe that reason the laksa taste abit off but still not bad.  Elderly uncle will still come to stall and see see look look. The stall now focus more on vietnamese food.\n\nLaksa sauce was thick and flavorful. Quite typical ingredients like cockles, sliced fish cake, tau pok and bean sprouts.\n\n\nOption: 5:\nName: F.I.C.

The Viet rolls and pizza came in a close second. Despite not being the top rated in my book, every single dish that came out of the kitchen was beautifully presented and satisfying to eat. No complaints in the food department!\n\nThe service was excellent as well!! The owner gladly and proudly introduced dishes to us and took her time to let us know what to expect from the dishes. She was absolutely easy to talk to, more than happy to answer any questions that you may have. Note: There are items that aren't on the menu. Strike a conversation with her, and she'll gladly tell you about the items that weren't shown on the menu.\n\nThe coffee took a while before their ready, but absolutely worth the wait. My advice is to order another drink together with the coffee to sip while you wait.\n\nThe vermicelli bowl is bee hoon based, soaked, and marinated with beautiful flavours of Vietnam! If this is your first time eating Vietnam cuisine, this would be a great introduction, something familiar to welcome you into a new cuisine. The only thing people might not be accustomed to is that the vermicelli bowl is served cold.\n\nOverall, it's a must try! Even if you're new to Vietnamese cuisine, this would be a great place to start.\n\nLoved the fried spring rolls, super crispy and tasty. The fresh rolls were also super generously stuffed with prawn and pork. Overall really yummy & will be back. The owner is super sweet too :)\nOnly downside for me was the ventilation (the place was abit smoky)\n\nFried Ice Cream sounded like a very interesting proposition so we thought to give this restaurant a try. First impressions is that the food was carefully prepared and looks good. We liked the chicken wings and vermicelli more than the rice plates. The pizza was by far the best dishes but not filling as it\u2019s super thin. I think this restaurant is still new as orders still gets mixed up (serving later customers earlier). The Fried Ice Cream was very beautifully prepared but all of us felt it was kinda watery inside probably due to the heat from deep frying. Very friendly service from the cashier. Ambience was a bit hot for lunch and the additional spotlights made it even warmer.\n\nA nice local food place serving Viet dishes. Like the Lemongrass Chicken Vermicelli Bowl & Fresh Rolls. Ordered the paper Pizza series: Lemongrass Chicken n Mentaiko Crabmeat which is small unique bites. Tried the Viet Coffee Phin Affogato as well.

Will takeaway again if im around Marymount.\n\nCold milk coffee ($2.80)\nNice thick viet milk coffee, even the ice has melt I felt the drink was still great. It doesnt cut on the amount. As compared to coffeeshop price it may be pricey, but the thickness of it is worth the try.\n\nDownside of the place is more for takeaways, nonetheless the food are prepared esp for rolls are done upon request. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\n\nI ordered the black pepper beef banh mi. They were really generous with the beef, every bite I had was full of it. The bread was also very fragrant and delicious. I would say it wasn\u2019t as crispy as other banh mi places I\u2019ve visited, but again that could be due to condensation from having to take away the food (no seating).\n\nAlso, if you\u2019re a student, you get 10% off every set meal (banh mi + drink). So it usually works out to be around $7, which is extremely affordable. :)\n\nAll in all I would absolutely visit this place again.\n\nIf I could give 3.5 stars I would.\nTL:DR new stall finding their footing, wait time too long, food nothing special.\n\n**But I do think they will continue to grow and change since the stall is pretty new.\n--------------\nOur usual Vietnamese stall at the nearby market is closed and on one grocery trip we walked past this and thought to give it a try.\n\nWe got the Signature Pork Banh Mi ($6.50), Chicken Banh Mi ($5.50) and Beef Rice Vermicelli ($6.50). It seems you can request for no spicy / less spicy / more spicy for the Banh Mi.\n\nIt's a takeaway-only stall with no seats at the bottom of a HDB block. There was one lady assembling the Banh Mi, another at the back whom I assumed was preparing ingredients, a man manning the cashier. I do hope they are refining their processes because I waited 20-25 mins for my order. There were 2 people who had ordered ahead of me. It didn't help I needed to rush off to work, but I did feel the wait was a bit too long.\n\nSignature Pork Banh Mi looked like it was made from sliced ham - to be fair the slices were tasty, we were just expecting actual meat. It was also unexpected that other ingredients (veggie and condiments) weren't very tasty / present. Perhaps we have been spoiled by Banh Mis that cannot be closed due to overflowing veggie and meat for a slightly lower price....\n\nFlavours-wise, the rice vermicelli wasn't very exciting - that is, compared to the usual market stall or even the one I have at work. I'm not sure if the sauce is diluted or if it's their recipe, but it's somewhat flat and mild. I was concerned it would be spicy but had zero issues. The amount of meat given was pretty good for the price. I did feel there could have been more veggies though!\n\nWe're not in a hurry to purchase again, but never say never :)\n\nI was walking around and saw this newly open place selling banh my and coffee. It looks authentic so I decided to try and loved it. The person who was making banh my was actually a Vietnamese and the taste was great. It was crispy and delicious.\n\nI also ordered a coconut milk coffee and it was very good as well. It was strong but refreshing at the same time.\n\nThe B\u00e1nh M\u00ec was assembled by herself infront of your eyes with fresh ingredient and toasted after. The crispy loaf had its unique taste from p\u00e2t\u00e9, french word for paste that\u2019s usually made from some meat.\n\nB\u00e1nh M\u00ec & Coffee by Phan have 4 different B\u00e1nh M\u00ec you can choose from.\n- Signature Pork B\u00e1nh M\u00ec $6.5\n- Black Pepper Beef B\u00e1nh M\u00ec $6.5\n- Shredded Chicken B\u00e1nh M\u00ec $5.5\n- Golden Egg B\u00e1nh M\u00ec $5\n\nThey also served other authentic Vietnamese cuisine like Spring roll(3pcs $5.50), Shredded Chicken with rice vermicelli($5.50) and Black pepper beef with rice vermicelli($6.50) which are really affordable to the hood.\n\nThere\u2019s a distinct fragrance from the Milk Coffee ($2.50 Hot) that I couldn\u2019t really describe what it is. I also recommend trying their Ice Coconut Milk Coffee ($3) here.\n\n\nOption: 7:\nName: Tina's Viet Kitchen\nAddress: 1 Serangoon North Ave 5, Singapore 554915\nPhone: 8786 2137\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 8:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 8:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 8:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 8:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 8:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: Closed\nSunday: Closed\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.4\nReviews: \n\nQuite value-for-money beef pho set.

It has, hands down, the best Vietnamese barbecue in Singapore. The staff are always so friendly and accommodating, and the owner never fails to make you feel at home by personally greeting each guest. And let\u2019s talk about the food - absolutely delicious every single time! The raw prawn dish, in particular, is to die for. It\u2019s obvious that a lot of care goes into every aspect of this restaurant, from the carefully crafted menu to the overall atmosphere. I always look forward to my visits to Lang N\u01b0\u1edbng Vietnam and highly recommend it to anyone looking for authentic flavors and top-notch service. It\u2019s always a treat to dine here!\n\nFood very nice. I like their cockles in tamraind sauxe as well as the prawns steamed in herbs. Service staff very approachable and friendly. Very attentive to your needs. Ambience very nice, feels like you are transported to a local eatery in Vietnam with the low tables and chairs. Vietnamese music in the play too .\n\nAuthentic Vietnamese cuisine, with authentic ambience too. Food is nice as expected. Tried the fried chicken wings, snail with spinach and beef pho. Will try other dishes next time when I come back again  :)\n\nStumbled into this restaurant on a Sunday and it was empty compared to the rest of its neighbours.\n\nWe ordered the BBQ meat dishes as recommended and asked for them to help us with the BBQ in the kitchen.\n\nPork was the best of the lot.\nThe premium beef was out of stock and we opted for the VN beef. It tasted like protein just not beef. It was coated with alot of sweet sauce and we could quite make out what meat it was.\n\nThe coke we ordered was flat and there wasn\u2019t and fizz left.\n\nWe packed some more food home.\nThe usual, Pho, spring rolls to continue out dinner as it was really stuffy and hot in the restaurant.\n\nStaff was friendly except a little forgetful.\nWe waited half an hour only to be informed they ran out of the dish we ordered.\n\nI have been a regular customer of the restaurant since a few years ago. And now also still a regular customer . It can be said that I will come once or twice a week. The food here is very suitable for my difficult palate. Especially the dish \"Cha Ca\". The fish is very fresh and sweet. Add dill and onions. Hanoi taste 100% . It is very difficult\nto find a restaurant in Singapore that makes such a authentic foods same here . Highly recommend it very much.\nThe service is also fast and attentive. Hope the business prospers.\nThey also have wine from a small and very beautiful city in Vietnam.

It is a quick-serve concept that caters to healthy eaters with less sugar and salt, and virtually no MSG or oil. Special mention goes to the avocado mousse ice cream \u2014 a rare find in Singapore.\n\n[What it\u2019s good for]\nThe banh mi classic (S$9.50) is stacked full of pate and butter spread, Vietnamese pork ham (cha lua), pork floss, pickled carrots and daikon, and enough chilli to make you sweat. The ham is the standout star, thanks to its meaty juiciness. The banh mi beef ribeye (S$13) features premium beef ribeye that's sliced fairly thinly and roasted perfectly with a flavourful tenderness and a touch of five spice. The sandwich is stuffed with a heap of coriander and fresh chilli. The pork belly bowl (S$10.80) comes with a generous portion of chunky and fatty pork belly, which is tender and nice to chew on. There\u2019s also a certain smokiness from the marinade that melds harmoniously with the other ingredients. For the more health-conscious, try the regular pork bowl (S$10.80) that is less fatty than the pork belly version and vibrates with a more savoury umami flavour.\n\nVietnamese coffee (S$4.60) is the only drink served here. It's rich and has a dark flavour profile, with strong chocolate and caramel notes. The avocado mousse ice cream (S$6.80) \u2014 dark green avocado mousse at the bottom of the bowl, with coconut ice cream, desiccated coconut, almond flakes, and chopped peanuts on top \u2014 is a beautiful dance between the decadently creamy mousse and denser, milky ice cream.\n\n[What it could improve on]\nThere was a lack of sauce (think sriracha) and oil \u2014 perhaps olive or sesame \u2014 that could take the banh mi here to another level.\n\n[Our quick takes]\nIs it conducive to conversation? -\u2014Yes, but I can\u2019t imagine it\u2019s the kind of place you\u2019d want to stay at for long.\nIs a reservation necessary? \u2014 No reservation needed!\nHow to get there? \u2014 A 13-minute walk from Serangoon MRT station should get your appetite started. Otherwise, there are several buses from both Serangoon and Kovan MRT stops.\n\n[Things to note]\nIf you like the salad sauce, you can add 50 cents for another container \u2014 totally worth it.\nDo note that this place is hardly suitable for groups \u2014 there are just eight stools and three wooden tables. I\u2019d consider it more of a delivery and takeaway spot.\n\nRead more at HungryGoWhere for the full review\n\nA hidden gem around upset Serangoon, nested among the boutique cafes. Well toasted bahn mi with generous ingredients, could be stronger in taste with more sauces but still great overall!\nOrdered the grilled pork bowl filled with lots of well charred grilled pork balanced out with crunchy vegs and rice vermicelli, will try the other bowls next time!\n\nLocated deep within a commercial space in between Kovan and Serangoon is this humble Vietnamese restaurant.\n\nDishes ordered were the chicken bowl and pork banh mi. Personally I would give the banh mi a miss mainly due to the tough pork meat used. On the other side, the chicken bowl was such a great deal, ingredients were generously given, mints and greens were so refreshing and crunchy while the nuts within gives a good crunch in texture.\n\nLittle downside would be its price and location.\nAlso please take note that there are very limited tables (3) for dine-in as this place mainly serves takeaway.\n\nWe tried the Pork Bowl, Chicken Bowl and also the Tofu Bowl. I like the char-ness with the roasted pork and chicken in both the meat bowl. I like that there is the option of tofu bowl which is vegetarian, as you know, we have all got one of such friend.\n\nThey are filled with greens including romaine lettuce, japanese cucumbers, big cherry tomatoes, mint, basil, pickles carrots and daikon. The mint gave a refreshing taste. There\u2019s also chopped roast peanut for that addition crunch and taste.\n\nThe Chilled Vietnamese Coffee is really bold and strong with added sweetness from condensed milk. A little sweet and could do with some melted ice for that perfect taste.\n\nDelicious Vietnamese food! We had the pork belly and chicken bowl which was very flavourful. The chilled Vietnamese coffee tasted bold and refreshing. Will come back again!\n",

Barman with earrings is not so attentive. The rest of the staffs are so so. They need to learn how to walk while looking around rather than looking at the floor. Myanmar, India, Philippines staff good! The rest better wake up. Nonetheless Vibe wise band is good. Service can be better on a slow Monday Night. Good draught promo but bottle wise still expensive. Food was decent! Overall I\u201dm just truthful.\n\nThere's live performance on Friday. I enjoyed the performance and the setting of the bistro. The place has a big seating, so during peek hours, you need to be patient. Food are always good. Their lamb chops were nicely done. Seafood marianna and chicken wings were nice too.\n\nIt's an ok bar to chill out with friends. its annoying with their Chinese live band, no international vibes. Was ok at first with English songs from the stereo till the live band started. Price was ok for a bar standard. Had a calamari and soju with coke for about 40 bucks\n\nHighly do not recommend. UNHYGIENIC PLACE, FULL OF INSECTS with bad service recovery.\n\nLizard on their counter. Black bug in my cocktail. My drink was still a full glass as I only had tiny sips. The staff (lady with short hair) tried to return me the same drink sans the bug. Told me to speak to her supervisor instead.\n\nHer supervisor was apologetic but insincere. He gave me a replacement drink that was extremely diluted with water. Based on the other reviews on here, this is their standard SOP.\n\nAvoid at all cost unless you are willing to put your stomach at risk. There are much better bar options elsewhere.\n\nGreat place to enjoy a drink or two with family or friends. Live music entertainment helps liven up the atmosphere.

Always love their baby back ribs, juicy soft and tender moist from outside to inside, their mussels are also very good. Friendly staffs and serene surroundings, serves very good beer, will definitely come back again.\n\nNice area at Punggol settlement. By the seaside on the 2nd level, you can feel the sea breeze and occasionally sighting of climbing monkeys on the trees. Enjoy the sun set and enjoying the beer.\n\nService staff was excellent and attentive. Great service I must say, kudos to the team.\n\nDespite been a bar, there\u2019s kids menu for my kido so the adult can drink at ease without worrying what to order for the kids.\n\nThe beef burger was superb, as the veg were fresh as it can be and the patty is as juicy as it should be. No wet buns or whatsoever.\n\nMussel was well prepared, and my family enjoys it.\n\nI regularly bring family and friends as this place has a great atmosphere, excellent food and perfect service. It's an enjoyable moment every time we go.\nIt's very cozy. The sea is litterally 10 meters away. There's a huge fish tank to make your kids busy. And the staff especially Melanie and Ken are very friendly and always go the extra mile to wow our visit giving us not choice to come back regularly.\nThank you.\nGregory\n\nMade reservations for a simple dinner with a friend here. The location itself, which is at Punggol Settlement, is really inaccessible if you aren't driving a car. The nearest LRT station is Punggol Point, after which you would have to walk 1.2km. Not too sure about the bus, but I am pretty sure it's not too frequent as well.\n\nHowever, this restaurant was worth the long journey. First of all, we were really lucky to be able to sit indoors because it had started to drizzle slightly. We were also seated directly in front of the TV, which was coincidentally showing the Women's World Cup between Colombia and England. Although we don't usually watch soccer, the atmosphere and the hype made the experience all the more worthwhile and we found ourselves watching it intensely too. For the food, we ordered spaghetti aglio olio, truffle fries, mojitoh and peach coolers. The aglio olio was delicious, although the portion could have been slightly more. The peach coolers was perfect to cool me down during a hot day, after which I ordered one more glass of it. The staff was also really professional in ensuring that our orders were swiftly prepared and that the food came out fast. Overall, if you are willing to travel a bit further, we recommend coming here for a chill night with friends or family. You can even walk along the coast after dinner, which was really relaxing.\n\nWe had a last minute family gathering (25 adults) for dinner at George's by the Bay.  The atmosphere was great.  The service was slightly slow but understandable given our large group and other guests at the restaurant (it was also a public holiday).  Kudos to staff for being accommodating - we had reserved tables for 16 but had to accommodate an additional 9.  All the dishes ( chicken satay, chicken wings, fries, chops, fish and chips, mushroom soup, garlic bread, and more) were delicious.

Very no frills and simple place.\n\nShe had a falafel moussaka, and I had the mexican beef bowl. The moussaka was delicious but I feel like 5 pieces of nacho chips wasn\u2019t enough and mind you this cost $13\u2026..\n\nThe beef bowl was a little dry, could do with some kind of sauce but it was good and we finished both dishes. The churros came freshly fried and was good too, but would have preferred actual choc sauce vs the hershey choc syrup.\n\nOnly gripes; the overly sugary lemongrass drink that was served premade with no ice. Had to ask for ice twice but given few pieces\u2026..  also very weird that we dined in but were served with plastic cutlery when we clearly saw metal cutlery, it was a little strange. It was practically only 2 tables and the lady served my food to the other table\u2026. Could tell she wanted to take it back to serve me but they already started eating it.\n\nI think its a quaint little place but some things need to be improved. At $30 for 2 expected just a little more.\n\nExcellent service. The beef Mexican rice bowl was not bad. With the homemade drink, I spent less than $10. I was there alone at 5 ish and I had the entire place to myself. I don't remember music playing but it sure would be nice to listen to some tunes.\n\nSmall quaint shop located near Tai Seng Mrt, they had a $10 set meal that had a wrap, small hash brown and a lemongrass tea. There was a small side of nacho chips with salsa.\n\nNothing amazing but I guess it was better than nothing coz there wasn\u2019t anything there open before 11am\n\nDropped-off my 10-months old laptop at LENOVO Service Centre at 3 Irving Rd, #01-17 Tai Seng Centre. BITC, Singapore 369522 on Tuesday 18 April 2023,\n\nThus decide to settle my late lunch within the area too.\n\nOne will be spoiled with choices as there are so many small eateries and cafes. I was drawn to  Olive Mediterranean & Middle East which was located across the street at 11 Irving Place #01-14/15, Tai Seng Point, Singapore 369551.\n\nOrdered for myself a Mexican Rice (Celantro & Spinach With Beef) Bowl at S$7.50.\n\nIf you are a small eater, the serving portion is just right. However, definitely a \"No. No.\" for someone who has a heavy duty digestive system, I would recommend that you order some nachos or Quesadillas too.\n\nIn my opinion, the rice is mildy aromatic (I was expecting a more pungent aroma of Celantro and spinach).\n\nI will rate the minced beef topping as \"healthy choice\".  It is relatively quite nice BUT will not leave one any special impression.  It will definitely taste alot better if there is a little more fat (this will enhance the juiciness) and more spices are added.\n\nHowever, if you working in this area, it is a great place to meet up with your colleagues and friends after work.  You can sufficient outdoor sittings surrounded with plants.\n\nStumbled on this place as i happened to be browsing around. Been awhile since i had my tacos and wraps, decided to try this as i noticed they had very high reviews.\n\nHad the beef Quesadilla - loved it as it was simply nice\nChicken Saffron Stew - Soooo tender and nice but soup wasnt as thick as i wanted but thats purely due to my own taste\nHashbrowns - Thumbsup as we all loved it. Hearsay its even better than M's hashbrown but i leave it for u to judge.\n\nService wise was top, very homely feel given by the lady boss and staff. She took her time to guide me through the menu and shared with me what we should order.\nI must say the food takes a pretty long time to come for a quiet Monday Afternoon but i guess Good Food - Time to prepare so no complaints from me on this.\n\nOverall i recommend this place based on the food served + prices. Very nice and they deserves better businesses. should be pretty quiet when its after office hours.\n\nWill be back again :)\n\n\nOption: 4:\nName: Streamed Gourmet (Koufu@Oasis Terraces)\nAddress: 681 Punggol Dr., #04-01, Singapore 820681\nPhone: None\nDelivery Available: Information Not Available\nDine-In Available: Information Not Available\nOpening Hours:\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 0\nReviews: \n\n\nOption: 5:\nName: The Punggol Settlement\nAddress: 500 New Punggol Rd, Singapore 828617\nPhone: 6702 6383\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nTuesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nWednesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nThursday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nFriday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nSaturday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nSunday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.2\nReviews: \n\nGreat place to head over to in the evening /night to watch the sky getting darker / the brilliant sunset when the skies are  clear. There is a picturesque spot to watch the sunset and take pictures.\n\nThe pond fronting the settlement has several turtles in it, who seem to swim over to the edges of the pond at the signs of human activity.\n\nSeveral restaurants dot the settlement, offering patrons a choice of food and drinks.  Makes for a great place to chill out with friends/family. Can get loud and noisy at times. The cycling and walking trail from Sengkang goes through the settlement.\n\nThe public toilet though can be pretty disgusting  especially during public hoildays and weekends.\n\nCame here because of good reviews. Indeed, it didn't disappoint us.\n\nIf you want to enjoy the happy hour beers, the best hour is come before 7pm to enjoy the special price.\n\nLive band only available after 8pm.\n\nIt's next to the sea.

Outdoor or glass window seats are preferable as we can enjoy the greenery scene outside while having a meal. The staff is helpful. The food is not outstanding but not bad at all. Will definitely go back!\n\nHigh ceiling and spacious cafe. It is located next to the park so the ambience is quite exceptional. Food wise is just ok. The mushroom soup  pizza and beef bolognese are decent. They are famous for their \ud83c\udf6a cookies.\n\nHad their seafood pan. I must say the bread they served was amazing. It\u2019s crispy on the outside, soft and moist on the inside, more importantly, the bread was warm when served. A perfect combination to dip into the seafood pan.\n\nI think this was our second visit, perhaps after a very very long while! Wife decided to hop by for an afternoon cuppa after dropping off the kids at our in laws.\n\nAs we already had lunch prior, we ordered light. A nice pasta to share with coffee. The prawn Bisque was decent.\n\nLoved the atmosphere, very relaxing environment coupled with really nice food. Coffee was great too.\n\nVisited before and tried the Lamb and Prawn Rose this time around. The Lamb was super soft but a little bland, while the Prawn Rose was nice.\n\nThere is a playpen for kids at the outdoor tables, hence we weren't able to enjoy much of the nature ambience. However, those with kids would enjoy it.\n\n\nOption: 7:\nName: Izakaya 95\nAddress: 500 New Punggol Rd, #02-05 The Punggol Settlement, Singapore 828617\nPhone: 6384 1132\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 5:00\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u200912:30\u202fAM\nSaturday: 2:00\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u200912:30\u202fAM\nSunday: 2:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.1\nReviews: \n\nThe waitress had a moody face but after a few orders in, her service became better. The food was well cooked and the seafood was quite fresh. Quite a chill place to have a few drinks and some skewers with friends. Very long walk from the nearest LRT station though. Better to drive or cycle there.\n\nStaff was friendly and helpful, food was good, the grilled oyster is no more which was very good, but the current fresh oyster is also very big, juicy and fresh. The grilled lamb and pork was superb. Very nice to be back again.\n\nThe food and ambience is great, I had a late night snack that became a whole meal instead but well worth the calories. (You can always walk it off later at the park nearby.)\nFood was well seasoned and grilled, particularly enjoyed the squid and fried rice.\nThey offer a wide range of alcohol as well and offered to extend our menu from the shop next door which was selling Thai food.\nOverall a great experience and would recommend to visit if you are in the area to support their family business :)\n\nVibe and feel is great. Staff are really friendly and food is generally good. Loved the garlic rice especially, didn't manage to take a pic as it was the first to serve and I gobbled it up in no time. Beer is cheap IMO - $26 for a jug, skewers' price is on the high side though. Nice place to chill nonetheless.\n\nGreat place to chill! Service is great. Food is alright.

Starting from the hummus, absolutely generous and delicious portions. Perfect appetizer.\n\nThe butter rice with kebab was crazy delicious, we literally scraped the plate clean from the rice and the greek yogurt like substance in the centre.\n\nPizza was crispy and fragrant at the same time, the tomato sauce parts was absolutely amazing.\n\nStrawberry drink was okay!!! Not super special but nice!\n\nIn the middle of Arab street you find this restaurant. We were welcomed\u00a0by a real Turkish guy. Very friendly and he could advise us what was the best to order. We sat outside, along\u00a0the street. Within 15 min the table was full with all kinds of grilled meat. Real Turkish flavors and a nice apple tea were enough to make my day complete. Eating here, and watching the people pass by is a big joy.\n\nParking in this area is very hard, as you can understand.\n\nHad a great dinner here today. My friend saw this online with high rating stars so we just stopped by after work.  And yes, the food is delicious, the atmosphere is awesome, love the music too.\nSo if your family or friends are outgoing and friendly, this is the right place for you to gather together and laugh together and dance together !\n\nCuisine is new to me as a traveller. Trying the dish with my arab friends and the chef being a wonderful host in telling us about the different food added to the stellar experience of dining here. Service was awesome. Food was a good blend of flavors.\n\nJust returning home from an amazing service and hospitality from Cappadocia.\nChef Ahmed Hagras went out of his way to arrange a very sweet surprise for my husband's birthday at my request.\nThe whole staff sang happy birthday for him with a special kunafe.\n\nThe food itself is finger licking good, no doubt.

Good view of the sea and the park. Nice spot for an evening meal. But there is no restroom at the shop, you will have to go to the public restroom at the park nearby.\n\nGood spread of ala carte dishes. Especially the cheese beacon is a must try. Black pepper pork, Taiwan sausage, honey ham and juicy big prawns. If you have friend like Thai milk tea, they come with tower. Although is open air concept, do wear lightly or casually as you clothes will be all smell of cooked meat and smoke after eating. Service is ok just no smiles no further recommendations from staff. Will come for the food, variety of chill sauces and free ice cream. \ud83d\ude0a\n\nReasonably priced mookata, with nicely seasoned meats. The buffet is quite extensive, and they even give ice cream at the end.\n\nThat said, the service could be better. When explaining the menu to us, the staff told us that we could order everything on the menu if we get the buffet. Right after we confirmed that though, he took a pen and marked off all the items that we couldn't order or were not available. I mean this is something you should have let us know as we were making our decision, and is quite misleading. Some of our orders were also missed out, so we had to reorder. Granted it's a buffet menu and it didn't cost anything to order again, it's additional effort on our end to keep track of what hadn't been served.\n\nAtmosphere-wise it's pretty chill, you can have a look out to the sea and the breeze is nice. There are a lot of houseflies however, which were pestering us and our table of food which made the dining not so pleasant. Lighting was pretty dim too.\n\nBeen there few times. Had late dinner with Family on last Sunday night. Quite crowded and it seems that the staff are struggling to cope just like how others had reviewed.\n\nOverall having buffet is more worth it and it does taste good. Nice environment to dine though it feels so cramped as tables beside and behind are just so close to one another.\n\nParking about $4plus. So overall still okay. Worth trying!\n\nWent on a Thur nite. There is a steady stream of customers so it best to make a reservation.\nAmbiance is good facing the sea and with background music\nFood is reasonable price for the quality given.\nStaffs are friendly, responsive and efficient at clearing the tables.\nOverall a good place to chill out with friends with food and Chang \ud83c\udf7a\n\n\nOption: 10:\nName: Med@59JCT\nAddress: 59 Joo Chiat Terrace, Singapore 427221\nPhone: 9108 2041\nDelivery Available: No\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20092:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 6:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: Closed\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 5\nReviews: \n\nWonderful experience at the Med last weekend. First time trying Mediterranean Food and it blew my mind.

Al and Natalie were the best hosts you could ask for, from start to end. They were so generous, kind, and charming as they shared the intentions and origins behind each dish and design choice. I loved hearing about how they chose to emphasise some of the Peranakan and Chinese design elements of the house whilst infusing it with their own identity and culture!\n\nThe house was as beautiful as the food was delicious - we came here for a meal, but left with so much more!\n\nGREAT dining experience at Med@59JCT. We had enjoyed the delicious Mediterranean food prepared by AI. AI explained the food and story about the food. Love it all.\nNot only the delicious Mediterranean food, a good chat with AI make the dining experience even better.\nWill be back again.\n\nHad the best private dining experience with my closest friends at Med@59jct. Al and Nat were the most friendly and welcoming host, Nat brought us on their house tour and explain patiently to our questions.. we were very intrigued by the many interesting displays in their place. Al, is like a master chef! The dishes were amazing one after another, with each dish explained by Al carefully. We were belly full!!!\nSpecial mention to the moroccan spiced carrots and tomato zucchini bake. Al mentioned that food doesn\u2019t have to be complicated\u2026 We can feel all the love that Al and Nat has put in for the private dining experience.. My friends and I enjoyed ourselves throughout the dinner and will definitely be back for more.\nBonus tip, just add on the wine pairing.. You won\u2019t be disappointed! \ud83d\ude09\ud83c\udf77\n\nWent in a group of 4 in early 2023.\nFood - delicious, varied, made with a lot of care and accommodated 2 vegetarians in our group. Portions were very large so go hungry.\nHospitality - Al and Nat were very warm and answered all our questions patiently and in a lot of detail.\nShophouse - really tastefully renovated and love that all the pieces have a story.\n\nHighly recommended and hope to return.

Promotion pricing for meals was quite affordable.  $30 for 3 course, $40 for 4.  Definitely worth the price. Wine was also not marked up too high.  Food was good.  Shoes required.\n\nA cosy place for family and small group of friends to gather. The service staff all did a great job from welcome to preparing and serving the food. An old English setting but filled with warmth. The food is all great and will definitely be back again next month.\n\nMy family regularly dines here for special occasions as we're members of SGCC. We're never disappointed with the food or the service. Do look out for monthly promotions as they'll focus on different cuisines, and they normally have a weekend semi-buffet (choose a main, while the appetizers and desserts are buffet).\n\nAmazing steak!

The drink was definitely not something I am used to, I wouldn't order it again. The dumpling was not bad. The Lu Rou Fan has too much rice for me, maybe enough for other customers. The food doesn't stand out much to me compared to other Taiwanese food restaurants. However, if you live nearby and feel kind of lazy to travel out to get Taiwanese food, they are a good alternative.\n\nFood was good but I couldn't quite figure what it was lacking, probably because I'm unconsciously comparing it against other taiwanese restaurants. I appreciate that Bubble Tea wasn't overly sweet.\n\nAmbience is nice and interesting.\n\nHeld back 1 star on the rating. I'll give it a go again when I'm in the area.\n\nGreat place! Week nights was rather quiet and empty but service was still impeccable.\n\nPricing a little high for the food you are getting. But if you like Taiwanese food this is a very decent place!\nThey have many outlets and this is the first time trying this outlet! Would definitely come back!\n\nThis is a spacious restaurant serving Taiwanese delicacies in Serangoon. Arrived here at 1:30PM on a weekday and the place was mostly empty.\n\nService is friendly and quick. Ordered the following -\n\n1) Pork dumplings in fiery sauce - 6 soft dumplings in a wonderfully spicy sauce that\u2019s not overpowering.\n\n2) Pork wonton noodles with guan miao noodles - Soft dumplings again. Well cooked noodles. Ask for their extra signature chili to add a spicy zing to your meal. Loved this to the last bit.\n\nReliable, great tasting food. Really glad that they have vegetarian options on their menu.

Porridge. (Century egg and mincemeat) was too plain can only tasted the salty taste. Siew Maii was quite good but personally don\u2019t like the mushroom flavour.  Braised chicken feet was abit too sweet for me but overall was good.  Bo Lu Bao char Siew filling was really good, but the bun dough have a very good yeast smell.\n\nWe love Chinese cuisine, we avoid eating at high end Chinese restaurants, we prefer hardworking independent chefs who have small eateries with authenticity in their cooking, this place is the cherry on top. As usual we ordered dishes we are familiar with, their dim-sum selections for dinner is a mini menu so we choose 2 , and 3 main dishes, quite enough for us as we are small bites people, more on quality of the food than quantity, I must admit Chef Wong have skills. And we will be back soon for lunch. Service was great too, happy we came !\n\nI can vouch that it\u2019s the best and most underrated dim sum in Singapore - in terms of its taste and presentation \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\n\nIf you\u2019re skeptical like us to think that the signatures beautiful dim sum are probably just gimmicky, think again! so glad we tried them, they are so delicious \ud83e\udd24 \u828b\u89d2 skin was so flaky yet not oily, taste of yam filling is so well balanced and not overly sweet like the average ones. \u867e\u997a skin is very delightful and thin. Everything is done to their perfection *chef kiss*\n\nHighly recommend and would definitely visit again!\n\nP/s: Room for improvement- we can smell waft of cigarettes \ud83d\udeac coming from the outside as we\u2019re seated near the entrance.\n\nClean and comfortable eatery with fresh and tasty dim sum - hargao and deep fried prawn dumplings were impressive and bursting with firm prawn flesh, buns were hot and freshly made, chicken feet and pork ribs were also very good \ud83d\udc4d love their kopi siewdai (no sugar added) too!!  Floor was manned by very friendly ladies :) will be interested to try their bolo butter buns and orh nee tarts the next time.\n\nThis is the best dim sum place in the area. Food is affordable and so much better than many other dim sum places in the same price range. I really enjoyed everything that we ordered. Service is also very good. Will definitely be back again, and also try more dishes! Highly recommended! Safer to make a reservation as it can be crowded at certain times and the place is quite small.\n\n\nOption: 7:\nName: Soi Thai Kitchen\nAddress: 58 Serangoon Garden Way, Singapore 555954\nPhone: 6282 3788\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:30\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 3.7\nReviews: \n\n\ud83d\udc4d:\n-The omelette was nice and crispy.\n-The chicken skin was a yummy appetiser.\n\n\ud83d\udc4e:\n-At an exepsnive price of 21.90, the prawn vermicelli was very disappointing. It wasn't like the other Thai outlets where they fry it till its dry and fragrant. This one was basically sitting in a pool of lacklustre gravy. Just disappointing.\n-The premium pork cheek wasn't good as well. It had a very smelly pork meat smell that can be slightly nauseating to people who dislike this kind of smelly meaty smell.\n\nOverall, nothing fantastic or mind-blowing. It's the kind of restaurant you'd just try it once and probably not wanna return.\n\nFirst time visited and it would be our last. The sambal kang kong had no sambal taste. The phad thai was worst than foodcourt\u2019s and lastly the garlic fried chicken was so hard and overcooked. Worst of all, my partner had diarrhoea the whole night after that dinner. Hope NEA go and take a look.\n\nFood taste average. The restaurant is windy and spacious. Able to cater for large group, we had about 10 pax. The fried omelette is a MUST try. I love the chicken wing too. Other dishes taste rather average and small.\n\nNot too bad thai food, but I had better ones here in Singapore. Looks a bit lacking of staff in front, had to walk into the restaurant before they noticed us.\n\nWas quite turn off by the way the male server just turn his back away while point his finger to a table for us to seat. When I was ready to ordered, I waved to him and he just look at me with no response.  Food was ok but some was way off. The drunken noodle taste like dish washer and belachan kang kong was not spicy. Had to head off to the hawker center for a rojak to wash down the taste. $30/pax\n\n\nOption: 8:\nName: Chong Qing Grilled Fish Serangoon\nAddress: 2 Maju Ave, Singapore 556680\nPhone: 6702 6680\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20091:00\u202fAM\nTuesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20091:00\u202fAM\nWednesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20091:00\u202fAM\nThursday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20091:00\u202fAM\nFriday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:00\u202fAM\nSaturday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:00\u202fAM\nSunday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20091:00\u202fAM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 3.9\nReviews: \n\nGot the mushroom seabass, medium spicy and added Chinese cabbage. Portioning is quite little, can only find a few pieces of veg and that's about it.\n\nService was also slow. Our noodles was not served as we were almost finishing our food. We checked twice with one stuff who told us that he will check for us. Then we checked a third time with another staff and staff told us they forgot our noodles. She asked if we would like to cancel this item since we are almost finishing our food. We said ok. Our noodles came shortly.\n\nSeasoning and food is quite nice and flavourful.\n\nWe specifically chose this Chong Qing for its location and crowd. We reserved well in advance as this place requires reservation during the peak hours.\nOrdered Grilled Tilapia in spicy fragrant sauce and few veggies like potato, lettuce, tofu. The flavours were amazing and fish tasted really fresh and there was no fishy smell as you usually feel while eating any seafood. We got a plate of home made buns and rice to go along with it. Cooled ourselves with cucumber salad. For drink we got sour plum four seasons tea and local craft beer. Everything we ate or drank were worth it.\nStaff was friendly and accomodated our request of getting rice later and also getting some of those buns take away. Definitely will visit again, Cheers :)\n\nWe brought our friends to experience mala cusine and were told that the Classic set meal for 4 pax offers whole seabass so we accepted their recommendation. The medium seabass was slightly small in our perspective because we were expecting a larger fish since fish is the main item in this set. Each one of us got a little portion and it tasted fishy and unfresh, we didnt enjoy the fish at all. Nonetheless, we thought the presentation of this dish was beautiful and the side dishes in the fish tasted yummy. We were wowed by all other side dishes like Spinach, Lala, Sweet&Sour Pork, Watering Chicken, etc.  We feedbacked to the Server on our experience and glad that they will inform their kitchen. In general, their service level is friendly and helpful.  It is the fish dish that ruined the overall eating experience.\n\nSaturday lunch at 12pm, only customer in the restaurant for a while. We ordered the set with the grilled fish and several side dishes. Fish was fragrant and flavorful, but the portion was a little small for 4 pax. Generally on the saltier side as expected of Chinese cuisine. We had a good lunch together.\n\nExcellent food and customer service. My food was in a mess when the grab driver delivered to me and was irresponsible to reply or answer my call. When I call in the restaurant to ask for a solution, immediately after seeing the photos that I send them. Without second they arrange to send me those damage food to be replace and resolved my issue. Would like to thanks chong Qing grilled fish serangoon for your fast reply and your efficiency.

So I just ordered a bowl of Chirashi Don. This is already very filling. And I love their thick cut sashimi. The service is good as their kept checking if we need anything throughout our dining experience. As we are seated indoor, which is air conditioned, it\u2019s comfortable.\n\nSashimi feels not very fresh. Mentaiko tamago & jellyfish quite good! Fried ebi and octopus average. Overall, expected the food to be better due to the good reviews. Perhaps they are more specialised in their dons, might pop by one day to try their dons. Service was not bad.\n\nThe sashimi here doesn't quite match up to other places in terms of flavor. However, the tamago and Japanese jellyfish are highlights; the mentaiko is seared to perfection and the jellyfish is marinated beautifully. As for the fried dishes, the tako karrage and ebi are decent but not outstanding in taste.\n\nExperienced the outdoor (sheltered) dining on a cool evening. Service staff serving us was friendly and helpful and took time to share with us their popular items and also other items that we should try. We ordered the wagyu beef bowl, which was really flavourful and done-ness was on point. We also ordered the chirashi don and the tuna, salmon & swordfish slices came in thicker slices as compared to many other places. We also enjoyed the fried squid, crispy and tasty. Overall, a good experience dining here and we will be back.\n\nHad a great experience here, enjoyed the takowasbi and parents liked the dons. Sashimi was good too. Shout out to Angeline!

Best chocolate fondant I ever had (but wish there was a scoop of vanilla ice cream).\n\nI've to caveat this by saying that perhaps Argentinian food isn't for me. So please view this review with a (huge) pinch of salt, especially in view of the other glowing reviews here.\n\nTo me, the food just doesn't hit the spot. I'm left feeling confused - and cold inside. Ordered the Chapa for appetiser - it tastes like normal bread with cheese fondue - nothing to comment about. For my mains, I ordered the grilled zucchini stuffed with risotto - and it's fairly disappointing. It was served with white sauce that has a subtle milky flavour but no risotto to be found. It may be hidden. I stopped eating after the first piece because there's nothing exciting about the dish. I was left stagnant and not looking forward to my next bite. We also ordered the vegetable platter - the vegetables tastes raw and bland, and the potatoes taste a bit coarse inside.\n\nOverall, I don't find the food value for the money. It didn't even attempt to take flight. Apologetically, I've to say that it was a fairly sad dinner for me and my company.\n\nThough the staff was very friendly and attentive. I've to credit that.\n\nSince I am a vege lover, I selected this restaurant because I saw good options of vegetables dishes in their menu. My first time tried Argentinian grilled food and we love so much of their potato rescoldo in grilled vegetables platter. Grilled potatoes are crispy outside and soft inside, saltiness is just nice. I love the smoked asparagus with fried garlic too. Steak is ok and lamb is good too. My hubby likes the Empanadas. Dessert - Dulce De Leche Cookies, Love it!!. I should have ordered more cos the size is a bit small. Service is great, attentive and know customer needs without a need to ask. View is great. Can see the fireworks at Marina bay for NDP rehearsal.\n\nFood was really delectable and I would return for a second round! Loved the black cod. Beef was really flavourful and savoury. Their dessert chocolate hazelnut cake was one of my favourites! Wished the table service could be better in terms of knowledge of their menu. Overall a pleasant experience in a warm and welcoming environment.\n\nVisited FIRE 2 years after having an amazing experience there, left a little disappointed with the same dishes we ordered.

Conclusion, dont ever try to take away for western food. They are more interested to fulfil grab order then walk in.\nMookata is ok but not the western food or zi char.\n\nHad the hot plate tofu, unfortunately the taste was just 1 layer which is savoury!\n\nTried out the Halal Mookata. Service is satisfactory. Item served quite fast. Price is reasonably cheap with about 6 items costing us $25. What lacked is the variety of food items available.\n\nNote: I can't comment on Buey Tahan See-Food x Halal Mookata as I didn't patronise this stall for its food or service. This review is for the coffeeshop experience.\n\n1st time visit this so-called 7 stars signboard coffee shop but the experience was an awful one. The drink stall uncle wearing spec was sitting biting his thumb on his lips. Then we ordered homemade herbal tea as indicated in the posted menu. He said don't have and stared at me with face \"very long and black\". See how rude that was. I told him if off the menu already should take down that menu poster. After taking the drinks to our table, he keep staring at us for few mins with the same expression. I came all the way from Bedok to this sengkang coffeeshop only to get badly treated. This coffeeshop should change their name to 1 star coffeeshop instead. The service rating here is for the drink stall. My experience here was really \"buey tahan\" See-Uncle.\n\nWe tried the japanese food stall, the food portion is good for its price. The tray quite heavy to carry when ordered for 3 pax. The outer area of this coffeeshop is quite spacious with natural ventilation and high ceiling.\n\nmy 9yo son loves the Brown sauce chicken chop + baked bean + coleslaw. the chicken and mushroom sauce was bubbling when served. Do take note that the western food takes sometime to be served.\n\n\nOption: 3:\nName: Thohirah Restaurant\nAddress: 258 Jln Kayu, Singapore 799487\nPhone: 6481 2009\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: Open 24 hours\nTuesday: Open 24 hours\nWednesday: Open 24 hours\nThursday: Open 24 hours\nFriday: Open 24 hours\nSaturday: Open 24 hours\nSunday: Open 24 hours\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 3.4\nReviews: \n\nThohirah Restaurant is a great place to have a tasty and economical meal. I loved the fish head curry, paratha, and biriyani that I ordered. They were all well-spiced and flavorful. The prices were also very reasonable for the quality and quantity of the food. The only downside was the customer service, which was not very attentive or friendly. However, I did not mind it too much, as the food was so good. I would definitely visit this restaurant again and suggest it to anyone who likes fish heady curry and prata type food.\n\nPlain prata is recooked it is hard as rock. First time having tissue prata without any sugar coating inside. Asked the staff abt it, he pass me a bottle of sugar. The standard has dropped tremendously. During payment the staff/ owner just talking on the phone without interaction with the customer/ telling how much and all.\n\nGreat mutton briyani! Meat is tender, non gamey at all! Paired with it's flavourful briyani and thick curry, each mouthful is a match in heaven!\nPortion is huge@$9.50, would come back to try other dishes.\n\nFood coma kicking in while writing this review\ud83d\ude05\n\nthe Worst cheese prata i ever taste. The cheese taste like plastic.and the Masala thosai too much cinnamon stick till i ate like afew and throw back.\n\nPretty disappointed with the food here. No longer serving yummy food. Many places serve better Prata than here, plus the food is not hot! You can give the Nasi Lemak a miss too! Served Cold and rice has no coconut taste and fragrance.\n\n\nOption: 4:\nName: Bochinche\nAddress: 27 Club St, Singapore 069413\nPhone: 6235 4990\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 6:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:30\u202fPM\nSunday: Closed\n\nPrice Level: 3 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.5\nReviews: \n\nHad an amazing dinner with my friend on a Friday night. Reservations required. Service was great. Food was fantastic. Especially love the tenderloin, it\u2019s so tender and yummy. Also love the bread we had, it\u2019s well worth the price of $16.\n\nFantastic steak & food & service! You\u2019d probably also be able to get a decent steak here for \n\nIt was our first time visiting Bochinche. The restaurant has a lovely ambiance and the staff are polite and helpful. The manager kindly explained to us the differences between each cut of meat.\n\nFor starters, we had the SD bread basket and ox tongue carpaccio. The bread slices were delish with butter. The ox tongue carpaccio was an interesting blend of flavours that worked well together.\n\nFor the main, we ordered the Heavenly Meat Board with 4 different kinds of steaks. They were perfectly cooked medium rare, served with a bit of smoked salt, garlic confit and padron peppers, which elevated the flavour immensely. Sides were chips, broccolini and wild mushrooms. Kiddo had the cheeseburger and finished the entire thing off!\n\nTo finish off, we shared the nectarine tart and espresso creme brulee while kiddo had a scoop of vanilla ice-cream. The creme brulee was delicious. Creamy with the wonderful fragrance of espresso. We enjoyed that immensely. Were not too crazy about the tart though. The nectarine slices were not ripe and still hard after cooking. The sharp tang wasn't to our liking.\n\nAll in all a wonderful dining experience. We'll be back for more!\n\nGreat place with great food.\n\nThe staff were amazing as I celebrated my wife\u2019s birthday. The steak was beautifully done and all the food recommendations were good.\n\nKudos to the people for making this place awesome.\n\nEdit -\n\nForgot to mention that we also ordered the hand cut beef empanadas. Sad to say my nenek can make better epok epok.\n\nOrdered the \u201cRobbins Island\u201d Wagyu Bone In Striploin (MS7) along with the creamy Mac-cheese pangrattato, broccolini pomegranate (without bacon bits) and Chips Provencal.\n\nThe wagyu striploin was cooked well but lacked the juiciness that wagyu steaks typically have. The steak was also under seasoned but was accompanied by smoked Maldon sea salt and roasted peppers.\n\nChips was fried well and had a nice crisp bite to it and was salted just right.\n\nBroccolini was grilled perfectly and had a nice charred smoky taste to it but was overly salted. Portion was a tad too stingy in my opinion for the price. Served on a medium sized plate it looked like a few broccolini might\u2019ve escaped during plating.\n\nSurprisingly the creamy M&C was the best of the lot! Very creamy with gooey cheese and a nice layer of bread crumbs on top to give it a welcoming different mouth feel and texture.\n\nOver all I think Bochinche is worth a visit due to its lovely homey interior but do be prepared to spend a few dollars here. 3.6/5.\n\n\nOption: 5:\nName: The Banana Leaf Apolo\nAddress: 11 Rivervale Cres, #02-10 Rivervale Mall, Singapore 545082\nPhone: 6241 4141\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:45\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:45\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:45\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:45\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:45\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:45\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:45\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.4\nReviews: \n\nThis is probably my favourite Indian restaurant. Food is excellent and everything is mostly very good.\nWe've tried many dishes and most would not disappoint except for the squid. The biryanis and pratas are of huge portions and the sides are generous and tasty.\nSome signature items tend to sell out early on weekends so you may wish to go early or try them on weekdays instead.\nThe staff are friendly too and they also give good recommendations and advice. The seating arrangement may not be the best but it still offers relatively comfortable seating and acceptable views.\nThere are vegetarian choices too so those with vegetarian members amongst friends or family can eat happily together.\nWe will certainly continue to visit. Car parking is of no issue as it is within the neighbourhood shopping mall.\n\nFantastic dining experience at Banana Leaf Rivervale mall! Prem, the manager, was gracious enough to set up a table for 10 people for us! The food tasted fantastic! Very good customer service! Prem checks to see if everyone at the table is satisfied by asking if we need anything or if there is enough food. He goes above and above in his service! He will always beam while he serves us, without fail! Definitely returning here! \u2665\ufe0f\n\nTasty food & great service! Serving was generous and definitely filling for sure\n\nKudos to Premnath who helped us changed our vegetable dish that was way too spicy for us.\n\nWill be back for more!\n\nI had a rather heavy day at work, and whenever this happens, I love to imbibe in one of my favourite foods, Indian.\nThere\u2019s something about the spice, the smell and the flavours that give me that \u2018kick\u2019 I need to continue with my workday!\nSo I drove to the Mall and walked into this place. I always (well, almost always) have my Garlic, butter naans with mutton keema. Minced mutton cooked with a spicy thick broth, with peas to pop, and something magical happens with I top my naans with this dish.\nAlas! They don\u2019t make keema here, but the nice gentleman who attended to me offered me an alternative. Keema naan!\nI thought about it awhile, and reluctantly said yes!\n\nCertainly a great recommendation from him! What I had was a paper-thin, buttery, garlicky, naan, sprinkled with seasoned minced mutton on the insides. It\u2019s amazing how they do this! The whole concoction still looks like it\u2019s half the thickness of an average plain prata! Don\u2019t be fooled ok? Bite into it, and all that buttery, garlicky goodness pops in your mouth, and the insides render flavours reminiscent of a mutton murtabak, but only ever so slight, and not as overwhelming. What can I say? It was a delight to eat! I savoured every bite, as I downed this delectable dish with an equally spicy but delicious rasam soup and some fish curry for a sip.\nThe naan was so good, that after a few bites, I realise the fish curry had become redundant, and remained untouched until I finished all of my Keema Naan!\n\nGreat service, good food, and I love the quiescence of this place amidst a crowded noisy mall! I\u2019m happy, and will surely be back:)\n\nOne of the best fish head curry ever in Singapore.  Fish head was meaty and FRESH..curry is superbly tasty and tangy.A MUST TRY!!  Masala chicken is fantasic , a good portion meat , soft and juicy. Staff Gulshan from Rivervale Mall is commendable..attentive and polite . Will definitely  come again and recommend  to all my friends!

It was crowded with people, and we had to wait a short while to be seated. The restaurant service was not up to the mark as the server was inexperienced and didn't seem to know what to do. The service was slow, and it took us more than half an hour to get our food served, even though we arrived early.\n\nThe black pepper crab, which was supposed to be the restaurant's signature dish, was overcooked and not very fresh. The taste was average, and it didn't live up to its hype. The best dish we ordered was the vegetable dish, which was delicious.\n\nThe fish maw soup disappointed us, and the prawns were not very fresh. It was the least worth ordering.\n\nThe restaurant had an upmarket and elegant setup, but the food quality and service standards didn't match up. It could be a concern for those who are short on time due to the slow service.\n\nOn the bright side, the restaurant had a clean toilet, which was a good experience. Overall, the restaurant wasn't a great dining experience, but it was worth it if you're in the mood for good veggies or a clean restroom\n\nSimple dinner, just ordered steamboat Ang Go Li and chrysanthemum tea. The food was delicious and fragrant. My husband doesn\u2019t like fish but he was enjoying. Just nice for 2.\n\nThe Mala grilled fish is our must-order dish every time we visit. The portion is enough for 2-3 pax. It's the best-grilled fish I have in Singapore. It comes together with some potato thin slices, black fungus, peanuts, and cabbage. The fish is fresh, so the meat is very tender! Please try it out, everyone!\n\nWe ordered the \u56de\u9505\u8089, but it is a bit oily for us.\n\nWe have come back to visit serial times. The food quality maintains good, and the service is excellent!\n\nNice little \u716e\u7092, air-conditioned, neat and clean. We had deep fried squid, tofu and broccoli. The prices may be steeped compared to coffee-shop prices but I think it is worthwhile as it is after all air-conditioned. I like it that the food isn't salty or taste like msg. The tofu was soft on the inside and crispy on the outside. As I don't eat pork, I simply scrapped the pork toppings from the tofu. I appreciate that the waitress is service-oriented. She was attentive and the food were served very promptly. Oh yes, their barley was homemade without the canned drink type of taste. We'll definitely be back!\n\nThis is a Chinese style stir fry dishes with BBQ spicy while fish as it's signature dish! the fish was large and fresh, fragrant and spicy(non spicy sauce available as well) and only costs $35! other dishes we ordere includes sambal paste long brand, sweet sour pork cubes, hotplate seafood beancurd, hotplate beef slices all were flavourfully executed too. We were surprised even drinks offered was wide range: Pu er flower tea, coconut sugared milk tea was fragrant yet not too sweet and smooth to have.

It's now so much more crowded than its predecessor Legends. I love the buffalo wings! I can take spicy food well, but level 3 was already quite spicy. Recommend to pair with some beers for even better taste. The live band was a plus esp if sitting indoors. The music can also be enjoyed outdoors as the sound system was pretty decent.\n\nWent on a Thursday night, rather crowded but managed to find a seat for 1 pax.\nThe drinks selection is pretty good but do ask the price before ordering as the menu price is before ++\n\nFood wise it is ok, edible and nothing to shout about. The impressive bit was the live band. They were good and made up for the avg food.\n\nOrdered the grilled chicken, seafood marinara and take out pizzas (Pepperoni, Hawaiian).\nGrilled chicken was slightly tough and too salty with sides(mushroom+potato and some greens)\nSeafood marinara with spicy tomato sauce was nice and not that spicy actually.\nPizzas topping were slightly salty and well done.\nWe were seated outdoor and there were bug flying around and one went for a swim.\n\nSecond try: Ordered burger, fish n chips, buffalo wings and ice cream. Burger was ok, salad was black at the tip. Fish and chips was well done. Buffalo wings - sauce was not nice, spicy level 2. Ranch was not cold while celery stick was too thin and soft, no crunch.\nIce cream was creamy with tiny marshmallow and nuts.\n\nFirst visited to this place and did not expected it to be crowded. They have indoor and outdoor seating. Only limited seats in the restaurant which have air-cond. Outdoor can be breezy too as it\u2019s near the river. They offered limited but general choices of Thai/Viet food, Pasta/Pizza and Western grills. Not wide selection, but it\u2019s good variety to choose from. Thai prawn cake abit salty, probably it\u2019s from vendor, not house made. But glass noodle seafod is good, quite refreshing and appetizing. Carbonara cooked to al dente and we like the creamy sauce with well smoked bacon. Pizza is a missed as we think taste like from frozen food. They have beer promotion at Happy Hour (\n\nCouple of good selection of beer choices. Food varieties are good too. Really like their luncheon fries, given very generous portion.  Their prosciutto pizza are just average. And had jug of beer and a bucket of mixed beers.\n\nThe ambience is great both outside and inside seating for chilling.\n\nThe live band was nice but inside seating will be harder to chat with ur company.  Outside seating will be preferable for chatting. Inside seating sound system are better.\n\nDo take note: if it rains, the cantilever shelter only able to extended to first 3 rows.

The timer added about 20 mins.\n1210 pm then start serving us. But only got the prawn paste.\nWaited till 1227 pm then served us again with meat.\n3rd serving is 1255 pm. Prawn paste, crab sticks.\n1257 pm gave us prawn. Kelp.\n1.10 pm then final stuff.\n1.30 pm finished eating. Still left about 7 mins in the tablet (we asked the manager to add more time halfway through)\n\nNot much selections at the sauce station. Even shi li fang has more to choose from.\n\nSliced US beef is indicated as sold out in tablet. It was enabled only after we notified the manager.\n\nCheaper than Shi li fang if choosing the same premium food. But enjoyed better dining experience in Shi li fang. But perhaps this isn't an accurate review due to them having issues with their system.\n\nParadise Hotpot disappoints on multiple fronts. The poorly trained staff at the entrance add to the initial negative impression. The narrow interior feels cramped, especially around the self-service sauce area, which is invariably overcrowded. Continuous need for fuel replacements disrupts the dining experience. Moreover, the ingredients are very average . Overall, this hotpot restaurant is highly unrecommended due to its inadequate service, cramped space, and mediocre food quality.\n\nI love that you get an individual hotpot here which is perfect when eating alone. I love their pork bone soup, mala soup and the tomato soup. Ingredients here are always fresh and service is always helpful and polite. They have various discounts available and you can use Kris+ to earn miles here too.\n\n\nOption: 10:\nName: OnePlace Bistro\nAddress: 273 Jln Kayu, Singapore 799501\nPhone: None\nDelivery Available: Information Not Available\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 5:00\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nTuesday: 5:00\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nWednesday: 5:00\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nThursday: 5:00\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nFriday: 5:00\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nSaturday: 5:00\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\nSunday: 5:00\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u200912:00\u202fAM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.1\nReviews: \n\nJust went there today!

The staffs even help to refill without prompt. Thumbs up! Definitely a recommended place to go. Will definitely suggest to my friends for a chill out there again.\n\nWent for a drink over there. Just a simple place for drinking with a few friends\n\nBeen here way before they have a new look.\nA \"feel at home\" environment to have a drink.\nWant to sort out some thoughts over a drink, or have a chat with staff to laugh off a lousy day, it's the place I will go.\n\nSuper chill bar for a night out catch up with friends.\nBeverages are at an affordable pricing.\n\nOne down point is the air-conditioning, not cooling.\nI guess I will go for the outdoor alfresco option next time ;)\n\nHad a surprise celebration for my husband here.

Over the years the flavours have not changed a bit and the soup is so refreshing and not with a overpowering of herbal fragrant & taste. Not too salty either but just nice for me. Though, the soup is good and beef is tender, the amount of meat, to some maybe, too little and soup is too much. Serve with sambal, I think, belacan and white rice.\n\nWe also ordered Beef Claypot Rice and its is also 1 of my favourite here. The portion is a lot for the rice, sauce & beef but a bit too salty because it also have salted fish in the sauce and the burnt bits the bottom of the claypot is the best part and to not get too burnt you must scrap and mix the rice with sauce etc,  as soon as it is served.\n\nSambal Kangkong is a must as side dish and the portion for small is generous and delicious. Well balanced flavours.\n\nSituated at Bukit Gombak and jammed between a few other restaurants, Habib has made a name for themselves.\n\nWanted to makan dishes and so we decided on Habib. My sis loves this place for their butter naan and normally when I'm here, I would just almost always have individual dishes. However today was different decided to try individual dishes and boy it was a smart choice.\n\nSambal Petai, Black Pepper Beef, Sambal Sotong and Beancurds were all super sedap lah! Delicious!!!! Simple mouth watering. I can't gush enough on how good it was. And the portion size was absolutely fair. I don't care if I sound bias but it really was that good. And service timing was also on point. Maybe it was off peak but we had our drinks in less then 10 minutes and another 10 minutes all our orders were served.\n\nMy only grouse would be that a clearer instructions about the ordering process and the clearing if tables be put in place.\n\nAll in all, I would definately be here again and hopefully they keep up to their standards! Pls do not falter or regress cause that would be absolutely disappointing.\n\nFood : 4 / 5\nStaff : 3 / 5\nAmbience : 3 / 5\n\nIf you're looking for a delicious and filling meal, then Habib Family Restaurant is the place for you. This family-owned establishment is known for its delicious Bak Kut Teh made of beef and mutton, which every foodie in the area should try. The menu is full of tempting options, but the Bak Kut Teh is the real star of the show. The broth is rich and flavourful, with a perfect balance of spices and herbs. The beef is tender and juicy, while the mutton adds depth and complexity to the dish. All in all, Habib Family Restaurant is a must-visit if you're a fan of Bak Kut Teh or just want to enjoy a delicious meal.\n\nMust try halal beef bak kut teh at this muslim family restaurant located at Bukit Gombak\n\nThe claypot style bak kut teh is very herbal and is better than most chinese versions.\n\nThey also give big chunks of beef\n\nYou can opt for bee hoon option\nAround $8 for a big portion\n\nAlso must order their sambal stingray. For $15 comes quite big and very meaty.

Ordered mutton murtabak and tandoori chicken Briyani. Wait was about 15 minutes very normal. Place was clean and neat. Mutton murtabak was average. Tandoori chicken was flavorful. Size was slightly small. Rice serving was large.\n\nA restaurant just near the Bukit Batok MRT. The food is delicious and the service is quite good. We visit them regularly and they have never disappointed us so far. There is a big variety of food and the prices are reasonable. There is a story upstairs with Aircon and a larger seating area.. the downstairs story may seemed cramped up and noisy. So if you need to relax and have a better experience, always opt to dine at the upper floor. Afternoon hours are less busy and the staff attends to you quite soon. But we have been there during evenings and found the place busy and the food orders take time to come.\n\nThe lychee and milo dinosaur is lovely. And the thosai are really soft and nice. Chicken biriyani, Rice and Curry, Tom yum sea food rice and chicken fried rice are must try\u2019s in this restaurant. They are open passed 12 midnight as well. We will surely return again for a meal here.\n\nI love mee goreng yet I hardly came across a good one. Even when you occasionally had a good plate of mee goreng and came back again, the 2nd time may disappoint because it may not be cook by the same person, the simply fact that most Indian eatery are not manage by 1 person but by a team.\n\nThe mee goreng here was moist enough and flavourful but by no means fantastic, and probably because I hadn't had one for a long time where marginal utility play a part.\n\nUsed to be good  and a frequent at this stall but now\n1. Price increase\n2. Tastes drop tremendously\n3. Got an upset stomach and diaahrea\n4.

Reasonably priced. Almost full house when we reached at 10.45pm. Noted that a couple of tables ordered western food.\n\nWe ordered red Tom yum - average, Pad Thai - beef is over cooked, but there is wok hei. Fried baby squid - got to eat while it\u2019s hot, otherwise wouldn\u2019t be crispy.\n\nQuite good place to go for supper since it opens until 2/3am.\n\nIt's our first time dining here. We came on Sunday lunch hrs, not much crowd. We were served approximately 15 mins after ordering.\nThere's a variety of dishes for Thai food lovers. All look super appetizing .\nLove  their initiative of customising the table to display all the menu with the prices stated clearly on it. So convenience for customers to choose from.\nWe ordered  fried kuey teow & Singapore fried Beehoon.\nBoth suit our taste bud..thou we felt that the portion could be more :)\nI love the teh o longan which definitely quench my thirst in this hot weather. A must try!\n\nIt was our first time dining here. Service was quite fast. The only thing the runner who send the food is not sure of what he is sending us. It was nasi goreng kampung, but he told us it is nasi goreng seafood. So i rejected the food at first, another server came and say it is nasi grg kampong. Alhamdulilah it is delicious. Only that dissappoint us is the nuggets set that cost $6.50. The fries is dark, some is hard and some soggy and oily. It looks like it was being refried again. Hopefully they can do something about it.\n\nWhat i like is the wide range of variety of food available.\nOrder chicken fried rice, it was fine, but just.\nCame out within minutes of ordering, chicken wasn\u2019t that fresh, hard.\n\nFinally the west side has decent food. I have to admit, their food is really nice. I tried their seafood tomyam spaghetti, it was spicy and delicious! I was a bit skeptical at first cause usually it is hard to get a perfect spicy sour taste for tomyam spaghetti but this one is simple and hits just nicely.\n\nTheir beehoon goreng was great too!! At first my hubby was upset cause the beehoon came not only super late.. it looked soggy and wet..He likes dry kind of fried beehoon... But the moment he tasted it..he was like wow... I tried it too...it was really delicious! It has the spicy chilli padi taste with a touch of tomato sauce as well ...\n\nTheir red spider drink remind you of childhood pink cough syrup! Maybe it the combination of strawberry ice cream and their red gassy drink..\n\nAmbience is nice too...if you come at night, it feels cosy...\nBut parking is weird as the nearest parking in front of the shop it is only meant for season parking holders only.. therefore need to have to drive all the way at the back of HDB and park inside.\n\n\nOption: 5:\nName: Dajie Makan Place - Halal Chicken Rice & Niang Dou Fu\nAddress: 372 Bukit Batok Street 31, #01-374, Singapore 650372\nPhone: 6896 4569\nDelivery Available: Information Not Available\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.4\nReviews: \n\nI really like eating here compared to the nearby coffee shops.

The fried items are always nicely done and they will cook the veggies separately. Yet to try the other bases but there is also Hakka sauce, Tom Yum, laksa and soup!\n\nOverall, worth to stop by this place for a satisfying meal if you\u2019re nearby. It\u2019s just across the street from the MRT anyway. They sell kopi/teh, canned beverages and also accept various cashless payments too\n\nThe very first time I tried yong tau foo that was fried and filled with delicious meat sauce was from Dajie Bukit Gombak! I instantly fell in love with it! I got hooked onto their Hakka sauce! I loveeeee how oily, crispy and delicious the yong tau foo were when paired with this sauce!\nRemember to eat it there and then as it can get soggy! Y.u.m.m.y!\n\nThe only thing I think they can improve is on their soup though.\n\nThe food at Da Jie Niang Dou Fu (Dajie Makan Place) never disappoint! Used to frequent the Clementi outlet when I was a student at Ngee Ann. Nowadays, we venture out a little further to the Bukit Gombak outlet. We really like the food here! Spoilt for choices!\n\nFood is very good but service by the staff AWESOME. They are pleasant and freindly even during their busy period\n\nThis place is a monthly visit requirement even pre pandemic \ud83d\ude0a\n\nEnjoyed the chicken rice (good portions), the Yong Tau Foo was good (more variety would be nice) and price was reasonable for sure.\n\nBiggest issue with me since day 1 I visited here was the tiny tiny tables. 2 person to a tiny table is just super crowded and uncomfortable. 2 tables seating 2 people (as per the required regulations) would not breach the space and distance requirements. So hopefully they can look into this.\n\nThe food can be nice, the staff can be wonderful but when the set up is uncomfortable, the whole experienced is compromised.

Friends mentioned that their food standard fluctuates. Apparently when there\u2019s lesser crowds, the food is good. It\u2019s probably only a 70% pack on a sat evening.\n\nSo this time round every thing was on point.\nAlso they offer free flow of icecream though there was only 3 flavors.\n\nTried during lunch time, the area was pretty hot despite the kind gesture of the staff to bring cooler. Tried few food, they are nice but not leaving much impression. If you stranded there with no much choice, can try their Salted egg chicken, seafood bee hoon and Roasted pork. Not recommended: Fried Rice, stir fry vegie and yam Ring.\n\nThough the food is tasty, unfortunately it is alittle too oily for my liking. I really enjoyed the fried pork dish intially but after the 3 to 4 slices it was really sickening. We ordered the chill crab dish where the meat was already extracted (since we were lazy to deshell it ourselves) and while the crab meat portion was pretty generous, the sauce was too watery to my liking. It felt like an oily soup dish with crab meat in it. The four heavenly king dish was good since I didn't taste much of the raw veggie taste and the salted egg yolk chicken was good too just that it was pretty heavy towards the end.\nOverall I will still visit this place for it's other dishes such as the hokkien noodles or fried rice which seems promising\n\nAlways liked coming to this bustling joint that's fast gaining popularity. They even started engaging a magician to entertain patrons while waiting for our food to arrive. The Hokkien Mee and White Seafood Bee Hoon are must try items but portion is slightly small. We liked the prawn paste chicken and coffee ribs too. Kiddos welcomed the free ice cream for dessert. Will keep coming back!\n\nVisited JB 101 many times over the years. The food is delicious and service is good. The ambience is good too. We love the fragrant lala and fried pork. The curry fish head is nice too.

I Never go to this hotel again.\n\nOrdered roti John chicken w cheese and in the comments I wrote add onion under the comments section but it came without onion. Ordered ice milo and wrote more sweet in the comments but it came and tasted like there was no sugar at all.

Food and drink might be prepared fast but it's pointless without people to serve to the customers.\nBeen coming here for years and food is still up to standard though, good job on that \ud83d\udc4d\n\nToday we celebrated Mother\u2019s Day at Jiak. I have been wanting to try this eastern after recommendations from my colleagues. As reservations were full, we went early to try our luck. Blessing that the timing we went was perfect and we are a seat on arrival. There were only 5 of us so we did not order too much. We ordered the Signature Seafood Black Beehoon; Prawn paste chicken; Sweet & Sour Seabass; Ladyfingers and a Seafood fried rice as the girls are too sceptical to try the black beehoon. I must say all the dishes are cooked to perfectly suit my palate\ud83d\ude0b I was initially worried if the black beehoon would come with an over empowering flavor but no, it didn\u2019t! In fact it contains the freshness of the seafood in the dish and overall a \ud83d\udc4d. The fish is another one worth recommending. Personally I love sweet & sour dishes and this one is done right on the spot. Fish is fried till it\u2019s crispy to every bite and the sauce nailed it all. Chicken comes covered with loose crumbs which my daughter finished to the last bit! The 2 desserts which they have, the chendol and mango ice were sweet and serve as the icing to the cake for the evening. Great place with tasty food. One minus point is, the food took a bit long to be served and there was one staff giving our free snacks to appease the diners but I am not sure why our table was left out when we are the second table to be seated\ud83e\udd28 Not a fair gesture on his part. I would have rated 5 stars if not for this.....\n\nthe ambience is nice! we ordered kopi o chicken, mee soto, and curry fish head.  looks exactly like in the menu. i would have ordered veggies too but my dad doesn\u2019t eat them. Will come here again to try more dishes!\n\nPrawn paste chicken was good! Decent dinner, had the set for two and added prawn paste chicken, also topped up $5 for dessert, total bill came out to ~$60.\n\nInformed the staff that the plate served was dirty and requested for a new plate, there was remnants not washed properly, but staff says it's not dirty, just a hole?? and never came back with a plate. Poor service. Regret signing up and paying for the membership. Staff should not throw their unhappiness to work at customers.\n\nOrdered the divine chicken pot recommended on display, but the chicken had gamey taste, and the entire dish is super salty we rather waste the $18 than eat it, would not recommend it.\n\nUpdate since management has shared that the feedback is helpful - adding on, other areas of improvement we hope to see:\nTraining of staff on the membership before processing any payment, and to listen to constructive feedback to improve and acknowledge. At the point of payment, no staff asked me whether customer is a member or whether there are coupons to offset either. When I feedbacked about the dish at the cashier the staff simply looked at me and completely ignored my feedback, pretending like she did not hear a thing.\n\n\nOption: 9:\nName: Air Pasang Food Court\nAddress: 374, #01-192 Singapore 650375, Bukit Batok Street 31, Singapore 650374\nPhone: 8261 9479\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 7:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 7:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 7:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 7:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 7:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 7:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 7:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 1 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4\nReviews: \n\nVery generous and kind people, always give me the feeling of Itaewon class(Korean TV show), whenever you go there staff will treat you in very good manner, either you are doing dining or take away, service wise they are awesome.\n\nBelow are the breakdown of features,\n\nPros:\n- very kind staff\n- tasty food, must try chicken curry rice and Mee Goreng.\n- environment and staff will give positive vibes\n- spacious dining area\n\nCons:\n- I found nothing.\n\nIf you wanted to eat good food and want some positive vibes, just there and speak with any staff member.\n\n23rd July\u2026its open guys\u2026since 21st July\u2026a day after Eid Adha\u2026check it out\u2026\nLatest as of Jun 2021 for those whom has not known yet\u2026they r under reno LAH \u2026n maybe somewhere in July is ready\u2026i did saw more seats will b available\u2026Yahoo!\nThe only problem is...Insufficient seatings but the rest is quite good...\nSecond last shop away from the drink stall...only open half day bug the lontong goreng...its sambal goreng its much much better than Allif\ud83e\udd2b...sambal sotong...superb\n1st shop after the drink stall has good variety of food and delicious...if u r early u can try their mempedal..grizzard\nNasi ayam is not too bad...they have their own style...\n\nFriendly service, comfortable well ventilated dining venue. But skip that, let\u2019s talk about the FOOD \ud83e\udd24 I had sambal beef fried rice and this dish has CHARACTER! Most sambal fried rice I have had are just good because they\u2019re spicy, but the fried rice here has an umami flavor that complements the spice! The chili is also awesome and a must eat condiment pairing with any of their dishes! For the beef itself, don\u2019t expect too much from it. It\u2019s pretty lean, but at $6 a plate, this is a very value for money meal! One happy and satisfied customer here!\n\nThis place is not $, it deserves $$$ or $$$$. 1 hotdog, 1 mini sotong a size of my thumb will cost you $4. As a customer, I find it hard to eat $4 dish with the portion I get. Felt like a food scam.\n\nNo doubt the food here is nice, but i had a bad experience dining in. It was during the new rule of max 2 to dine in. They have insufficient seats at the main dining area (outside the stalls area. I bought my food and went to look for an empty table to sit. It was full. So i look around inside the stalls area. Found an empty table and went to sit there to consume my food. At the end of my meal, was told cannot sit there. Those tables are for staff only. But there was no sign and no one said anything. They should put signs saying \"No eating here. For staff only\". It was very misleading. Next time, better to take away.

I could say this is so far the best briyani I had. Chilli sauce is not too overpowering, and the curry goes well together with it. Pair it with a crispy pappadum, and acar, the taste is heavenly. I would also like to say thank you to the friendly staff, Naveed, for the service and  recommendation of Mango Lassi. It helps to lower the heat from the food and is very delicious too. First time trying out Dahi puri, quite an interesting taste experience for me. Sweet, salty, and a mixture of spicy makes it a well snack for anytime.\n\nPrice: $6.30\n\nMasala Thosai: 5/5\nThosai had extremely crispy edges, the potato of the curry was more like a mash, there were carrot, peas and lentils which added a nice crunch.\n\nSambar: 4.5/5\nA hearty and moreish sambar containing lentils with some heat from the chillies.\n\nChutney: 4.5/5\nRed chutney is flavourful, tangy and tasted tomatoey. White chutney has A LOT of coconut with tiny bits of ginger. Very refreshing.\n\nTotal score: 14/15\n\nButter chicken biryani, add egg ($1) and masala chai came up to $15.40 which is very reasonable given the portion. See how small the fork and spoon is in comparison to the plate lol. Sauce is addictive, chicken is tender, egg is delicious. I like everything about this \u263a\ufe0f The service was also very good and friendly. One small thing is that the place is very cold, so the food gets cold fast. Other than that, everything is awesome. I like that they have a small sink so you can wash your hands and they have napkins as well.\n\nWe ordered the butter chicken briyani (pictured; $11.90) and curry chicken briyani ($10.90) and the portion size was so huge that each dish could be shared by 2 persons. The curries were pretty good, though the curry chicken was slightly tough. It was busy on a Sun afternoon but there were still a few seats available.

I enjoyed the satays (70c each) and liked that the peanut sauce was a bit chunky with the bits of crushed peanut clearly visible.\n\nAlso tried some of their bbq chicken wings ($1.40, minimum 2pc) which looked a bit small but they were packing flavour. The wings went nicely with the chilli sauce which seemed to contain a bit of tanginess.\n\nI also appreciated the food being served on reusable crockery.\n\nStill as good Satay, popular with locals. Taste as good even when pack back to consume. Gravy not spicy, strong hint of peanut.\n\nThe best satay that we have eaten so far. The pork satay is juicy and flavour full. The ketutput is wrapped in coconut leaves unlike of others in plastic paper. The lady who attended to us is pleasant and courteous  despite the hot environment & many orders. The digital queue system gives you an informed waiting, no worrying if your order had been missed. This make the waiting easy. Overall eating experience 5 stars. Will definitely return for more. Highly recommended.\n\nThis satay stall is my favourite. Meat well grilled; add 50 or 80 cts more for cucumbers /onions rounding up to nearest dollar.\n\nBest satay I have tasted so far.

She explained to us what are some of changes.\n\nMaybe this is the only time I\u2019ll finish all the rice! \ud83d\ude06 be it beef, salmon, or chicken, scallops, it\u2019s always good.

Super disappointing. Can u see how pale the dory is?! Really waste of money, its not cheap mind u! And as usual alot of things in the menu are not available during order.\n\nI like the gado-gado so much.\nThe ayam bakar also quite good.\n\nThe tofu was good. The yellow sauce tasted amazing. But the chicken in ayam penyet was so dry without any sauces. The only moisture in it was the chili which is super spicy\u2026\n\nBad experience with their service team. My toddler spill the drinks on the table and floor, the service crew just ignore us thou the shop was 50% empty. They were just being blinded that the spillage on the floor. Initially tght some of the crew would help to bring out the mop, NOBODY bothered. Food there also felt normal compared to intiallu when they opened. Bad expereince that i would not even think of having any meals there. If there is no star rating on their service, i would change to 0 star.\n\nCrispy Perfection: The chicken was exceptionally crispy. The outer layer had the ideal crunch, giving way to tender and succulent meat inside. It was clear that the chicken had been expertly, and most importantly, freshly fried to achieve this level of crispiness.\n\nFlavorful Spice: The seasoning and spices used in the chicken were well-balanced, providing a harmonious blend of flavors. The spiciness was present but not overpowering, allowing the other flavors to shine through. The combination of herbs and spices added depth to the dish.\n\nAccompaniments: The dish was accompanied by a reasonable portion of fragrant rice and sambal chilli. The sambal added a delightful kick to the meal. The fresh cucumber slices on the side provided a refreshing contrast to the spice.\n\nPortion Size: The serving size was just nice for an average Asian eater.\n\nPresentation: The dish was presented neatly, showcasing the crispy chicken on a bed of rice. The vibrant colors and the overall presentation were visually appealing.\n\nAffordability: One of the most commendable aspects was that it offered great value for the price. You get a delicious and substantial meal without breaking the bank.\n\nIn conclusion, the Chicken Penyet exceeded my expectations. It's a dish that combines texture, flavor, and value, making it a must-try for anyone who enjoys Indonesian cuisine or simply loves a good crispy chicken dish. I would highly recommend it to fellow food lovers.\n\n\nOption: 7:\nName: Boon Lay Power Nasi Lemak\nAddress: 642221, Boon Lay Pl, \u53f7 01-106221B\nPhone: 6811 0443\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: Closed\nTuesday: 7:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20094:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u20093:30\u202fAM\nWednesday: 7:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20094:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u20093:30\u202fAM\nThursday: 7:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20094:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u20093:30\u202fAM\nFriday: 7:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20094:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u20093:30\u202fAM\nSaturday: 7:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20094:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u20093:30\u202fAM\nSunday: 7:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20094:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u202fPM\u2009\u2013\u20093:30\u202fAM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 3.9\nReviews: \n\nSo so only nothing fantastic.

Good selection and choices. Nice flavorful rice and sambal. Friendly and quick service. POWER!\n\nOrdered the Chicken Set ($4) for takeaway and only managed to eat it almost half a day later. The rice and chilli is amazing, I finally understand why this place is so popular! Chicken is alright, and the egg yolk was cooked to a nice jammy consistency. 10/10 will come back!\n\nPower Nasi Lemak.. powerful punch of sambal and powerful crunchiness chicken wing that is flavoursome too. Despite the current unpredictable weather, customers who are craving for this powerful nasi lemak remain undeterred and patiently queue for their turn.

The taste is a delightful blend of savory and umami flavors, complemented by a rich demi-glace sauce. Overall, a visually appealing and delicious culinary experience.\n\nWalked in on Sunday 530pm for early dinner and could get seats readily. What attracted us into the restaurant was the smell, likely from the sizzling hot plates that the steaks are presented on. Had Bacon & Kinoko Hamburg Steak Teishoku. The food is good but not excellent probably due to my personal preference of not so greasy food to begin with.\n\nWalk in on a Sunday early evening at around 5.45pm and there was only one group ahead of us so waiting time is around 2-3 minutes.\n\nOrdered the truffle omelette set at $18.80++ and avocado pork hamburg set at $16.80++.\n\nEach set come with a side dish, a salad, a tamago soup and a rice.\n\nService staff are very attentive and excellent customer service.\n\nWill definately return to dine in again.\n\nI was quite hungry, but unfortunately, the food here left me with a sense of normalcy, which in itself speaks volumes.\n\nHere's what I ordered:\n\n1. Tsukimi Pork Hamburg Don - The hamburg was rather tasteless, but fortunately, they provided soy sauce on the side. I must say the egg yolk was a highlight. In fact, I ordered an extra egg to mix with the remaining rice, elevating the dish.\n\n2. Tamago Egg Soup - Surprisingly, this simple soup stood out amongst all the dishes.\n\n3. Thick-Cut Bacon - A decent choice if you're hankering for bacon.\n\nThis was my first experience tasting hamburg steak in Singapore! We conveniently placed our order through a QR code, and the food arrived promptly after we ordered. We opted for the Bacon Hamburg Steak Set Meal and Tsukimi Hamburg Don, and both dishes were incredibly delicious! The Japanese ingredients were impressively fresh, leaving a delightful taste in our mouths. We're already looking forward to returning to try other items on the menu!\n\n\nOption: 9:\nName: Joo Siah Bak Koot Teh\nAddress: 01-1215 Jurong East Ave 1, Block 349, Singapore 600349\nPhone: 9111 8129\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: Closed\nTuesday: 8:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20097:15\u202fPM\nWednesday: 8:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20097:15\u202fPM\nThursday: 8:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20097:15\u202fPM\nFriday: 8:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20097:15\u202fPM\nSaturday: 8:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20097:15\u202fPM\nSunday: 8:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.1\nReviews: \n\nI recently visited this Bak Kut Teh place, and it was delicious! The meat was tender and juicy, and the soup was nice and peppery. The tenderloin soup was also tasty. It is worth a try. The location is far from the center of town, but it is worth the trip.\n\nThe meat was fall-off-the-bone tender. Soup was not overwhelmingly garlicky or peppery and there's a taste of sweetness of the pork in it. Pig trotters was fabulous too.\n\nA Bak Kut Teh stall that is the main anchor stall in a coffee shop. Order at the counter, and food will be served to the table. Soup refill is self-service.\n\nReasonable price and above average taste. One of the better BKT in Singapore thou there was no wow feel.\n\nFood not as good as before. Prices increased but quality of food gone down alot. Soup is over salty now, side dishes too oily, mei cai contains too much hard unchewable parts which I need to spit out constantly.\nIt took away my pleasure of enjoying this popular bak koot teh. We're quite the regulars here by the way. Disappointed.\n\nLove the BKT.  The meat is tender and soup, which is pepperish and flavourful.   The pork trotter is very well done,  soft and juicy, which just melts in your mouth.\n\n\nOption: 10:\nName: Ichiban Boshi (Jurong Point)\nAddress: 1 Jurong West Central 2, #B1 - 75, Singapore 648886\nPhone: 6397 1242\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.1\nReviews: \n\nThis was a busy place during our family patron.

They realised that they served my bro\u2019s food to the wrong table, we know this becuz they discussed in front of us, but they nvr explain to us, nvr say sry.

Unsatisfied by the tasteless dishes and overly salty omelette that I received.\n\nWe ordered seven dishes from your restaurant, which came to a total cost of $96.12. However, upon receiving my food, I was immediately struck by how bland and unappetising everything looked. Each one was seriously lacking in flavour, and I found myself struggling to finish even a single serving.\n\nTo make matters worse, the omelette that I ordered was incredibly salty, to the point where it was almost inedible. The fried fritters turns out to be frozen fish and tempura with fried chicken instead calamari. The fried rice is dry, bland and has zero fragrance. The tanghoon is awfully bland as though there isn\u2019t pinch of salt in it. Furthermore, we ordered this as a form of  Hari Raya celebration but the food turns out to be terrible.\n\nAs a paying customer, I expect a certain level of quality and care when it comes to the food that I receive. Unfortunately, this was not the case. I was deeply disappointed by the lack of attention to detail and the overall poor quality of the dishes I received.\n\nI hope that you take this feedback seriously and work to improve the quality of your food and the overall dining experience that you offer.\n\nBecoming from bad to worse. Everything was so bland from the food to the drinks. Taste of the salted egg tasted funny. Fried fish noodle soup has so little noodle in it and the vegetables in it doesn\u2019t taste fresh. Come on ah.\n\nWould come again! Convenient for those who stay around the area. Clean restaurant with ample of seats.\n\nWe got the cereal fried rice and kway teow goreng (spicy). Price range is about $6.60 for the usual goreng dishes whereas anything abit special would be $1 extra. Honestly, a fair deal for a place with aircon and in a mall establishment. Generous portions\n\nWould come and get more dishes next time!\n\nI'm not for wet mee goreng and what I ordered came wet.  Unpeeled cooked prawns are a no no for an al carte restaurant. Not taking the extra effort.\n\nTerrible. Came afew times and service is really bad. Came early all the time, but with sufficient staffs and no other customers at that timing, their food still take forever to serve because they do not check their orders, we had to remind them every single time. The food was not bad the first few times. However, it just got worst time over time. Today the chicken chop turn out to be  breast meat, really dry and tough to bite. They add alot of garlic butter in the mushroom soup and its very disgusting as there are so much oil in every scoop and when it turn cold the amount of oil harden at the top.

At first the CTK still decent but standard drop not long and it become one of the worst CTK I ever eaten, give it a try recently but it still sucks.  Highly not recommend.\n\n$3 fried kuay tiao portion so less. Few mouth and gone. Might as well sell $4 and remove $3. Requested no cockles but still put. Not buying here again. Not recommended.\n\nOrdering is pretty fuss-free here and there are multiple options by paying through digital wallet. The receipt has your queue number and you wait for the number to be shown on their display. I had a mix of both white and black carrot cake ($4).

The white carrot cake on the other hand was average, and the only good thing about it was that it was crispy.\n\nGet the yuan yang. The white one is eggy and the black one is sweet and savoury.

Its taste reminds me of Mee Sua in soup cooked for me by my mum, her mum or her sister as a comfort food when I had had measles or fever or they cooked it on weekends to take a break from the rice staple. To me, a taste that reminds me if my loved ones and their love each time i patronised the stall. Thumbs up!\n\nTotally worth the price. $5 for soup mee sua and the soup is power much! Love the handmade meatballs and the lean meat is marinated too! I believe they added huadiaojiu to the soup and the fried ginger level up the soup.\n\nWill be back to try more of their other noodles.\n\nHERE: 3x\n\n\u518d\u6765\u963f\u5af2\u9762\u7ebf.

I think food tastes extra good after having a swim. \ud83d\ude0b\n,.\nThe ah ma meesua is yummy, they drizzle hua tiao wine into it, with fried ginger and chives this makes a hearty warm meal. \ud83d\ude0b\ud83d\udc4d I asked for extra fried ginger.

It wouldn't be the same if they weren't nestled here.\n\nA charming nasi padang place in an equally charming neighborhood, complete with a handsome silkie chook freely roaming the premises. I chanced upon this place while exploring the area seeking breakfast and it felt like i was transported back to old kampung days.\n\nA good thing about coming early is that the curries and padang dishes are all piping hot. The food was all right, not very spicy (might not appease hardcore sambal lovers) - was happy to find sayur manis lemak here.\n\nWhat i loved best was the laid back vibe, and the friendly staff who served up the warm nosh with warm smiles. Refreshingly un-Singaporeanesque.\n\nServers are really friendly and food is amazing. Love the choice of 3 types of chilli sauces. Price is reasonable as well. Premise is well ventilated and clean.\n\nThe coffee shop, decor, location, car park and even a resident chicken makes this place a great idea.. but it's more than a great idea now that I've tried it (maybe I was hungry and enjoyed the food a tad more).\n\nI think their dishes are not very spicy which is a nice change (from all the mala).. they were nicely executed, taste, texture and all. And by today's standard, $12.50 for this is not exorbitant (compared to some nasi padang at Geylang Serai).\n\nGreat place for Nasi Padang , easy to find parking. Came after lunch so I guess most of the items were sold out.

This humble corner store offers one of the best Appams in Singapore. We had the egg, plain, Ondeh-Ondeh and Kaya with a side dip of Ikan bilis sambal. Very nice!\n\nThey have other food too: thosai, bryani, etc. Worth a try if you are in the area!\n\nWent there because of the good review. But I really don't know what's so special about this stall.\n1. Dirty utensils, have to dig and find those slightly better ones.\n2. Dirty dining area. Prolly school holiday, u have to tahan sitting on dusty seats. Wet tables due to rain.\n3. Because the whole place is empty and this stall is the only one that's open. U could clearly hear what's going on in the kitchen. All I'm hearing is the microwave sound every other min.\n4. I thought only if u take away, it would not be crispy. But I was wrong. Even if u eat there, it's the same.\n5. Had the ondeh ondeh, the palm sugar tasted sour.\n6. Worst of all, the price shown on the signboard is student rate. And when I told the lady that I'm a student. The reply that I get is. Sorry, key in already, cannot change. Win liao loh. $4.50 for a so-so appam only.\n\nI ordered the nasi lemak appam and ondeh ondeh appam. To be honest, u should just go have the real nasi lemak instead.\n\nMy overall review. Not deserving a second visit.\n\nAppam is quite ok. To be fair, we didn\u2019t try the special ones. Just did the plain. The appam is lacking in flavour but the texture is good (nice springy taste). Price is on the high side ($2.50 for one plain).\nThe foodcourt is clean and airy.\n\nNeed to be patient once order, because each and every appam is made upon order (including those in food delivery order). But it\u2019s worth the wait. Had the egg appam & plain appam. It\u2019s so fluffy in the center and it\u2019s amazingly well cook in the center. It\u2019s not oily nor greasy. Next time can try other modern combinations.\nTake note: They only have takeaway after 6:30pm to close 7:30pm.\n\nIs really nice if you eat at the shop.  They should improvise their packaging. This is definitely a good packaging but is doesn't help to maintain the crispiness. Should try using paper container. That would help slightly.  Just like those waffle shop.\n\n\nOption: 2:\nName: Marsiling Lane Food Centre\nAddress: 20 Marsiling Ln, Singapore 730020\nPhone: None\nDelivery Available: Information Not Available\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 5:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 5:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 5:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 5:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 5:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 5:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 5:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20097:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 1 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4\nReviews: \n\nI order the $8.50 Seafood Soup, 3 big prawns with fish meat & lots of minced meat.

He reluctantly gave a few more spoonfuls of soup - never ever again.\n\nA honest and personal review on this.\n\nOrdered Clayfish Seafood Soup, $13.50, because of the price (I think), the portion is generous, it got clayfish, minced meats, dory fish, prawn and some sliced tomatoes.\n\nMaybe because of the minced meats given, a huge portion, almost filled whole the bowl, there is not much of the \u201cseafood\u201d taste in the soup. The food tastes more than mixed pork soup, \u732a\u6742\u6c64. The sweetness came from the pork instead of seafood.\n\nIf you are looking for a food portion that worth for the price, this is the right place.\n\nPaying $9.50 for a pathetic medium size if seafood soup, charging me additional 50 cents for a takesway bowl that pack almost nothing in that bowl! Feedback on the spot but worker say that more soup will ruin the taste, what a \u201csplendid\u201d excuse.

However, we were a bit disappointed when the service person provided us with a menu that seemed incomplete. Drinks like coconut and canned drinks were not listed on the menu, which left us wondering about the full range of beverage options available.\n\nDespite the initial confusion with the menu, we were pleased to discover that the restaurant accepted both e-payment and cash payment methods, making it convenient for all of us to settle the bill.\n\nAs for the food, we ordered a selection of dishes from different cuisines. To our delight, the taste of the dishes was quite decent, and we found the overall spiciness level to be manageable, as it was not overly spicy. The variety of flavors from the different cuisines added an exciting twist to our dining experience, and we appreciated the diverse range of dishes available.\n\nOverall, while the incomplete menu and missing drink options were a minor setback, the positive dining experience, delicious dishes, and the option for various cuisines made the dinner gathering enjoyable. We would consider visiting again in the future to explore more of the restaurant's offerings and perhaps inquire about their full drink menu.\n\nChance upon this eating house on the way back from JB. Amazing food! Nothing is not nice about this place! Opens till 2am, best place for indian muslim supper. Their mee goreng mamak is one of the best eaten so far, hard to get a place that serve mee goreng merah the correct way and taste. Beef soup was flavourful too and peppery, chicken rice is nice too. Will come again to try their kambing soup!\n\nQuite amazed on their cooking speed too, the place was rather full yet all the food came within 15mins. Staff are also friendly, only downside is the parking.\n\nLots of varieties here, choices of food will make u drool \ud83e\udd24, servers and waiters all are good and prompt, price wise is ok but not your regular typical coffee shop. Place is big and can cater combined tables to supply for a larger quantity of customers for dinner gatherings. Parking is also not a problem for not cars and bike, toilet and washing available too. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\n\nWow. Absolutely blown away by the hearty and delicious food. Not to mdntion the realllly affordable prices! Would definitely come here again because oh my god beats al amaan and other places by a MILE!\n\nButter chicken is ridiculously creamy and buttery for just $7! Thick chunks of chicken coated in gooey curry. SSo yummy! The garlic naan wasn't as garlicky as I liked but still a good complement!\n\nWe also got their palak paneer which is more... unconventional. Thick green spinach curry which is less creamy and has cottage cheese curds! Interesting taste, though I prefer their classic butter chicken.\n\nTheir roti prata is on the softer side, not crunchy you you won't get sick of chewing. It was soft and fluffy, a little floury. Tasty!\n\nOne of the best Mamak food in the North.\n\nTom Yam very tasty and spicy\nChz naan very soft\nBeef Kwey Teow also very tasty.\n\n\nOption: 6:\nName: Mei Xiang Yuan (Satay & Rojak) \u7f8e\u9999\u5712\nAddress: 4 Woodlands Street 12, #01-15 Marsiling Mall, Singapore 738620\nPhone: 9369 7250\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: Closed\nTuesday: Closed\nWednesday: 2:00\u2009\u2013\u20098:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 2:00\u2009\u2013\u20098:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20098:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20098:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20098:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.8\nReviews: \n\nCuttlefish and century egg rojak ($8.50) - Average. The flavour of the sauce could have been stronger and thicker. The portion was small. Even the cucumbers. The cuttlefish was not bad. The century egg was fine.\n\nDecided to check out the hawker centre at Marsiling mall as I was in the area and chanced upon this absolute gem of a stall.\n\nThe owner was friendly and extremely professional, and even though it was peak hour, the food came quite quickly.\n\nI really enjoyed the satay, with its smokey aroma and succulent meat which was delicious especially when paired with the peanut sauce. Definitely recommend the the crispy taupok and rojak as well.\n\nI learnt that they are a third generation hawker in Singapore from the owner too! Definitely check them out - and support local hawker talents while enjoying a great satay experience in the north.\n\nObserved the satay meat shrished this time as we ordered regularly when we are there. Fruit rojak are fresh and portion small.\n\nOur all time favourite satay and rojak in the whole of singapore, consistent and always a pleasure ordering for our lunch. \u2764\ufe0f \u2764\ufe0f \u2764\ufe0f love the friendly and efficient service especially Godon and godon wife are truly a charm.\n\nWent there recently and tried their cuttlefish rojak + their satay!

(Especially thankful for that so I didn\u2019t need to stand around and wait or keep checking whether the food is ready)\n\nThe food was really good and my favourite was the cuttlefish rojak!\n\n\nOption: 7:\nName: Marsiling Mall Hawker Centre\nAddress: 4 Woodlands Street 12, Level 1, Singapore 738623\nPhone: None\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 7:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 7:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 7:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 7:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 7:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 7:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 7:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4\nReviews: \n\nDecent neighbourhood hawker centre. Supermarket, shops and a Burger King located on 2nd floor. Multi-story carpark for drivers out there.\n\nFood wise my opinion is that Marsiling Mall is average. There are some stalls here that deserve a look at if you\u2019re in the area but I wouldn\u2019t go out of my way just to eat here.\n\nThe wanton mee stall always has a long queue. People mainly order the wanton mee or the lor mee but it also sells fried chicken noodles. Got the wanton mee at $4.50. The portion of noodles is not a lot , good amount of char siew (not fatty or chewy) and a small piece of fried wanton. It also comes with a bowl of soup with 2 small dumplings.\nThe coffee stall sells not too bad coffee and soft boiled eggs which are nicely cracked into a bowl for you. The Kaya toast could have been crispier (in comparison with Ya Kun).\nNot easy to find a cool table on a Sunday morning. Quite a crowd here. There are quite a variety of foods here.

Just the right thickness of butter, kaya leaned on the less sweet spectrum but could be more fragrant. I liked how they used the traditional brown bread though number of butter slices was inconsistent.\n\nEggs: Yolks were soft and creamy \ud83c\udf73\n\nOverall, my dad preferred this to Ya Kun due to its affordability and decent quality!! There\u2019s always a queue at this stall despite a few other stalls selling kaya toasts in the same hawker centre, and I can now see why after trying \ud83d\ude0b\n\nFollow @iloafbready Instagram for more food reviews! :)\n\nGood variety of food choices, I like the 'Bukit Panjang Dessert's ching teng and bobochacha.\n\nGood Lao huo tang as well.\n\nSome of the hawkers like to put their stuff on the table near their stall especially under the fans and chope place there. This makes it difficult for customers patronizing other stalls to find seats or to be sitted under cooler table as the place is deem stuffy especially in the day time.\n\nThe pig organ soup, pig liver, pig stomach soup are fresh and taste sourish nice \ud83d\ude0b at Fu Qiang pig organ soup stall. Coffee O is strong enough at Yinle hot & cold beverages. The hot & cold desserts \ud83d\ude0b at the stall operate by an old uncle & auntie near to the escalator nearer to woodlands stadium.\n\nAttach photo shows the hawker stall owner's stuff on the table under 2 wall fans ):  Seemingly people think that someone has choped the seat, but it's the stall owner 's stuff when we inquired about it being there for more than an hour. We went to Sheng Siong supermarket after our meal and back in about an hour's time yet the stuff are still there ): this no good especially that these are the 2 walls fans in that row of stalls and there's no other cooler place for customers to sit and have their meals.\n\n\nOption: 8:\nName: Arabica Kebab\nAddress: Woodlands Street 12 Marsiling Mall Hawker Centre, #01-38, 738623\nPhone: 8464 9264\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20098:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20098:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20098:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20098:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20098:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20098:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20098:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.7\nReviews: \n\nHidden gem here in Woodlands. Great tasting middle eastern food at less than half the price of those restaurants at Arab street. Everything was flavourful, juicy, and with just the right texture. We had the Lamb Mandi, Chicken Quesadillas, and Kunafe - all were amazing. Portion sizes were HUGE too. Highly recommended.\n\nThis is an amazing kebab place. Everything is delicious and real deal. They just opened Arabica Grill just behind this outlet and it's equally amazing. If you are in mood of good Arabic food, no better place in Woodlands than this.\n\nOrdered via grab food and its so goood. My lamb mandi was still warm when it arrived.  The lamb shank was super tender and juicyyyy!!! First time to try knafeh and its was so yummy too, crispy outside but soft cheese inside \ud83d\udcaf Will try the quesadillas next time as I\u2019ve been reading a lot of positive reviews on it. \ud83e\udd24\n\nOrdered the Kofta Mutton. Very juicy and tender. Even better than well know restaurants. They might be located in a coffee shop but the food is great.\n\nAte the mixed kebab and i must say that it is the best kebab i have ever eaten in my life. Had this quite a while back (~3 months ago), and i think about eating this every now and then! The meats are so juicy and tender, moisture is locked into the meats unlike some other kebabs sold by other stalls that have dry, stringy meat. Seasoning is so good as well. Will definitely come back here again to try their other dishes\n\n\nOption: 9:\nName: Bhai's Chapati & Biryani\nAddress: 4 Woodlands Street 12, #01-43 Marsiling Mall Hawker Centre, Singapore 738620\nPhone: None\nDelivery Available: Information Not Available\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 7:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 7:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 7:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 7:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 7:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 7:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 7:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.3\nReviews: \n\nPerhaps the only place in the north to get your dose of authentic satay! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\ude0b\n\nThis place has the best chappatti I ever eaten.

I would skip the butter chicken as it\u2019s a little on the sweet side. The dumplings are good although it do taste like Chinese dumplings. The lamb biryani is so flavourful! Will definitely come back\n\nIt was lunch time and today we decided to check out Gurkha Palace.\nOrdered Lassi, Chili momo,  Naan, Chicken tikka masala ,  mutton and chicken Biriyani.\nGood Service, Ambience is great.\nStaff is helpful, attentive and kind to offer suggestions.\nFood was served in reasonable time. First came the Mango Lassi. taste and flavour was a bit different. Not the flavour and smoothness as I would expect.\nChili Momo came the next and it was just super delicious. Well cooked, rich in flavour and slightly spicy. The texture was perfect. We loved this dish the most.\nNext the Naan and Chicken Tikka masala, Naan was thin and soft. It had good flavour. Chicken Tikka masala gravy was nice but a bit salty.\nLastly, the much awaited Biryani..  the rice had a good flavour but rice in  both mutton and chicken Biriyani tasted the same. The meat was well cooked but lacked the freshness. Seemed like the meat was cooked separate and added to Biryani Rice. Overall It's a different taste. Something different from the  usual Indian style Biryani.\nPortions were generous. Overall  it was not bad experience.\n\n1st time here. Make a reservation for 6 pax Lunch.

This place has lots of bad ones but it was packed during my Sunday evening visit.\n\nAnyway, here's mine.\nStaff were friendly enough. Prices MUCH better than the two places nearby that are popular with expats. Especially for beer. And the Sunday specials are hard to beat for price. $9+for Thali. And the portion was very hefty. I think this place is popular for prices more than food.\n\nMy mutton tasted very familiarly western Chinese. I've lived in China for the past 4 years and there was definitely a Chinese spice going on. It wasn't bad at all. Just didn't taste northern Indian to me.\n\nOne of the thali side dishes was black beans and they were hardish like briefly boiled peanuts. Maybe that's the way they should be?\n\nVisited this place randomly for dinner and drinks. Happened to see as Nepal Cuisine, so wanted to give a try. Beer offers are good, food prices are fine, however, the taste of the food is below average. Staff is very friendly and courteous, Manager Jessie is taking care of the place very well. Food lags taste in terms of spice, chili and freshness.\n\nFood was delicious! The meat platter was a great choice, allowing us to try all the different flavors in one platter, though the green meat looked a little too \"radioactive\"! \ud83d\ude02 The ambience was just so-so.\n\nWhen we first entered, the waiter attended to us mentioned that waiting time for the food is about 30 minutes to 45 minutes.\n\nThe food came within 15 minutes, and is really delicious. They provided papadum and room temperature water. The service is alright and the food is amazing. Per person, average damage about $25+.\n\nI enjoyed their naan and one of the chicken dishes. Tasty, will return!\n\nAbsolutely wonderful Northern Indian and Nepal cuisine. Having spent many months in Northern India, I can say that this food is about as authentic as it gets. Service was great! The atmosphere is very generic. But the food is wonderful. I will be going back\n\n\nOption: 3:\nName: Springleaf Prata Place - Junction 10\nAddress: 1 Woodlands Rd, #01-25 Junction 10, Singapore 677899\nPhone: None\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 1 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 3.5\nReviews: \n\nNo queue and place was relatively empty when visited on 26 October 2023, Thursday morning.

The Prata sugar is crispy, my girl loves it. I like the masala chicken and nasi biryani. The staff there is very friendly too.\n\nWe found a cockroach in our food!\n\nWe raised the complaint to the service crew and they offered to give us a replacement. But we're already grossed out about this as we are unable to eat anything here. The service crew suggested that it might have fallen from the ceiling. But it is dead already and one of its legs is chopped off as well. I cannot imagine it being from the ceiling as the leg would fall far away or it would be alive and walk off normally.\n\nI don't think I can eat outside for a while now\n\nOne of their smallest outlet with limited seats.\nSo there\u2019s a rule that you have to order first and they will assign table for you at the counter. However some idiots will just chop seat and then q to order. Previously they do have a sign saying the above rule. But now they took it down. Thus there\u2019s this constant confusion. I am happy for this rule but I hope that the staff can be consistent to tell the people off.\n\nToday they are kind of lack of staff as the plates were short and the orders took longer than usual.\n\nmaggie goreng which is overly salty.\n\nMy fav here is mozzarella cheese prata. 10/10\nPlain Prata is crunchy and nice.\n\nMilo dinasaur is in a small cup which I think they do not have enough cup.

Ordered Roganjosh, chicken biryani, chicken tikka masala and garlic naan.\n\nThe taste of all the dishes was truly authentic and flavourful with all the aroma from the spices, but not overwhelming.  Love that the gravy was thick and the portions of chicken and lamb is also pretty good.  My favourite was the garlic naan, crispy and garlicky, it really went well with all that gravy.\n\nThe servers were polite,  helpful and prompt. The restaurant itself was also nice and cosy. Thoroughly enjoyed the dinner.  Only thing is that there is very limited (parallel) parking along the road. There is a small public carpark nearby, a short walk from the restaurant but it is pretty difficult to get a parking lot too during dinner hours. Parking aside, the food and ambience is really good, give it a try if in the vicinity.\n\nThe garlic naan was great. The paneer butter masala could be less sweet and have more Indian spices. The noodles could be cooked in a bigger fire. The mutton set was very nice.\n\nThe portion is reasonable for sharing. I enjoyed the Basmati rice which is perfectly steamed to bring out the nice fragrance and texture. The sauces are great to go with the rice and naan.\n\nMy friend takes me here to taste Nepalese foods. Wow ! It\u2019s super delicious and very tasty. Tea is the best ever I have tried in Singapore . Pretty similar to Burmese Tea . Will go back again definitely.\n\nWill nvr be coming this restaurant again. Had to remind them to provide the mint chutney which is typically served with the papad, $14.50 for chicken thali and you will only get 3 tiny pieces of meat which wasn't worth it. Bad incident of one waitress serving the thali in an abrupt way, can't even place the plate straight it was served slammed on the table slanted sideways. Gave feedback to the male manager, he asked me if I am from the industry also which I assumed he meant if I'm a waitress too? I think its rude to ask customers that type of question.

I bought the Mandi chicken and half of the chicken was quite dry. Even though it was half a chicken but the portion was quite small. The rice was dry too. Giving 2 stars because the rice portion was generous.\n\nBig portion and so delicious. I tried the mixed kebab.

Furnitures quite old and needs to renovate. Food are expensive. They even have a promotion but actually not really a promotion price. They just added their current meal bundle price just to look like a ($58) promotion. I walk out the restaurant not satisfied with what I paid. We ordered Ultra and Mega burger. The Ultra burger looks small in actual compared to their posters and in this photo. Don't be fooled by it.\n\nVisited swensens on a Saturday night in a group of 3. Went around 6+pm, managed to get a seat after waiting about 5min.\n\nOur waiter was patient and professional, took time to explain the perks of the swensens memberships and the vouchers we could use (nowadays the swensens memberships is quite rewarding but also quite complicated - requires the use of telegram). There was another waiter subsequently who was a bit rude when we asked for our banana split - literally didn't acknowledge us and just waved his hand at the kitchen and walked away.\n\nOrdered one pizza, one battered fish and chips and one meatballs to share. Came with 3 free drinks (topped up 1 dollar each to get special drinks), and a free banana split because of all our membership perks.\n\nTotal bill of 60 for quite a filling and value for money dinner. Thank you\n\nI remembered my first visit to this Swensen\u2019s outlet. As a kid, it was nothing short of an excellent experience. Staff was nice, my fish and chips classic was delicious, and my ice cream was nicely presented. That was in 1998.\n\n25 years on I still walk out from this branch a happy diner but no longer a kid. And I would absolutely change nothing about this restaurant.\n\nOverall, the food is ok. I have ordered a combo \"steak & chicken\", the steak somehow well prepared as per my order \"midium rare\", as some restaurant could still see bloody in the middle.\nFish & chip is ok, too. No special vs. others.\nSwensen's should be famous in their ice cream, but I'm not able to find the special of it. The milky cream is not as strong and a bit watery. Just hope could improve further.\n\nThe fish and chip is not up to standard. Batter too thick for my liking. Fish too bland.\n\nWorst of the worst is chicken in basket. The chicken is not fully cook. Is cold inside. Apparently the waitress just took it back to the kitchen, fry it and bring it back to me without any explanation or any apology.\n\nThats about it for my experience.\n\n\nOption: 3:\nName: Tun Xiang Hokkien Delights \u8c5a\u9999\u798f\u5efa\u9986@ Bukit Panjang Plaza\nAddress: 1 Jelebu Rd, #02-19, Singapore 677743\nPhone: 6235 0568\nDelivery Available: Information Not Available\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 3.4\nReviews: \n\nFast service , QR order. Tried the Hokkien Mee. The portion is quite generous and flavour is ok. Compared with some hawkers lacks the seasoning and intense wok hey taste but it\u2019s acceptable and decent for the price. With Svc charge and gst outside of promo days is about 10SGD. Worth it if you\u2019re around , but i would still rather train to Bukit Timah Hawker Center for the Hokkien Mee there.\n\nWe tried the hokkien mee and we find it flavourful with slurpy texture! There were intense wok-hey taste too! Besides the food, ordering process was easy too!\n\nDecent Hokkien Noodle. Feels like the noodles are freshly cooked upon order instead of warming up from precooked one like many stalls do.\n\nthis place won't survive for long, I've eaten better standards in coffee shops and hawker places. staff was not attentive at all, stood for a good 5mins before someone came to take our order. pig organ soup too much pepper and pork slices were paper thin ($15++), hokkien mee tasted so so only and the pork lard not crispy, don't think the prawn were fresh. sadly this place does not meet the standards, hawker centre cheaper and taste better, everything just overpriced here. ain't coming back.\n\nNot bad, but quite salty. Price is quite ok for the promo\u2026. Otherwise it\u2019s quite expensive for full price. Noodles are not piping hot despite being served on the spot, not sure why? Or wok fire not big enough\n\n\nOption: 4:\nName: Ajumma's @ Bukit Panjang Plaza\nAddress: 1 Jelebu Rd, #03-10A, Plaza 677743\nPhone: 8892 6047\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.4\nReviews: \n\nfast service...nice food especially their stew..fried chicken and rice cake crispy..i usually dun eat rice cake but i like this..but the sauce is bit too salty.\n\nWanted to try Ajumma after seeing multiple franchise opening up in Singapore and people queueing for it. Ordered the jjajjangmyun, kimchi fried rice and galbi. Not sure if we ordered the right food warranting of the long queues. But the food did not stand out much. Although the galbi is nice and tender, the jjajungmyun and kimchi fried rice tasted rather flat and bland. There are certainly many better versions of jjajangmyun and kimchi fried rice than Ajumma\u2019s.\n\nComfort Korean food! Quite authentic. Egg souffl\u00e9 was light and fluffy. I had the beef noodles - pork bone broth was delicious! Free flow sides are great as well. Reasonably priced. Will definitely be back\n\nSome dishes were good, others not so much.\n\nThe fried chicken with tteokbokki was particularly bad. There seemed to be more fried batter than chicken, and only a tiny amount of sauce was given.\n\nWater costs $0.50.\n\nHad a pleasant experience from one of the staff, Richele. We ordered one of the dishes with extra Noodles but didn't realise it doesn't come with extra soup. She was kind to help us with our request.

Ever since they had done the renovation and started using the machine to make their drinks, the quality of their drinks have dropped. I have ordered ice kopi and ice teh in the past week, and both drinks tasted more like sugary milk. I really do hope they improve their standards, before customers start heading over to Yakun.\n\nThe aunty at the cashier super rude. Show attitude. Bang the atm device and slam the receipt on the counter. Not the first time we encountered with her. Previous aunty was so much better, patience and helpful. Food and drinks are still good.. Have to face her first though.. \ud83d\ude44\n\nAverage place.\nFood is ok, served quickly. Eggs are not warm. They provide a plastic bowl for the eggs, instead of a traditional ceramic bowl. It's kind of weird for the eggs.\nPlace is slightly messy, a lot of boxes and cartons on the benches and chairs. Then you get these old folks blasting music or videos from their phones.\n\n\nOption: 6:\nName: ANDES by ASTONS @ Bukit Panjang Plaza\nAddress: 1 Jelebu Rd, #03-10, Singapore 677743\nPhone: 6219 3816\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 3.9\nReviews: \n\nDate of visit: 13 August 2023. The restaurant had empty tables when visited just after noon. However they all filled up pretty quickly a short while after. Ordering was via scanning the QR code found on the table. Food and drinks came shortly after e-payment. Service was also quick and efficient, with staff members quick to clear empty plates. Only gripe was the tomato ketchup packets, which were quite oily and thus hard to peel open.\n\nAlways pack during dinner time, food serving is abit slow, would recommend their fiery chicken it\u2019s my fav order every time I dine in. Would not recommend to go for the all day breakfast which I did, scramble egg tasted sad. However their fiery chicken always make up for it, fries and wedges are given decent portion and crispy. Would recommend to dine in instead of takeaway.\n\nKind of slow in cooking the food. They do QR Code order n payment. No service charge\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\nFood is decent, not expensive. Double chicken can be share between Two.\n\nHad fried fish and hickory chicken during lunch and the portion was pretty big. The fish was skinny and crispy but kinda tasteless while the hickory sauce was a little too strong. The rest of the sides were nothing surprising. Overall quite affordable but service was lacking. No people in the queue but still have to stand there and wait. Staffs have to be more attentive.\n\nDo not eat here if you are used to a western quality steakhouse.\n\nBurger had absolutely zero seasoning or flavor.\n\nSalmon ad bland as can be.\n\nThey brought out my burger and almost 12 minutes later the salmon came out.\n\nI would avoid if here again and eat ramen next door.\n\n\nOption: 7:\nName: Streats (Bukit Panjang Plaza)\nAddress: 1 Jelebu Rd, #02-17, Singapore 677743\nPhone: 6767 4745\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 2.7\nReviews: \n\nStreats Cafe needs no introduction.\n\nI used to find the food on the average but at a recent visit, I change my mind a little. The food is still on the salty (flavourful) side but I do enjoy the Claypot Rice Porridge with Seafood and Minced Chicken Ball.\n\nThe soup dishes which my friends order also taste overly flavourful, to me. I hope they don\u2019t have to drink lots of water after the meal. \ud83d\ude06 Oh, but I like the HK Carrot Cake with XO sauce. That scores another thumbs up from me. \ud83d\udc4d\n#tiramisooojiaks #jiakjiakjiak #sgfoodie #streatscafe #friedcarrotcake #claypotriceporridge #kimchisoup #halalfood #halalsg\n\nThis \"hybrid\" cafe serves HK style dishes as well as local fare. They have a small selection of dim sum (I like their siew mai), small selection of \"Nasi Lemak\", small selection of local tze char dishes...you get the drift. When put together, however, it becomes quite a smorgasbord of choices.\nThe Nissin Soup Noodle is one of their more popular choices. It's like a more glamorous Maggie Mee, with 'liao' inside. The soup is tasty and overall it's yummy. And who doesn't love the oversized soup spoon that it's served in?\nThe Nasi Lemak - hmm. The Nasi is not Lemak, and the Acar serving is quite pitiful (nowhere near as shown in the menu picture). However, the fried chicken was great, and the prawns were fresh. And the sambal, while not the best I've had, was good enough.\nThe star of this cafe, to me, is it's ambience. Tucked away at the corner of the mall, it's 2 storey ceiling with glass windows one one side makes for a cosy and warm casual dining experience. Worth a visit. Or two.\n\nConsider A Moderate Halal Restaurant For Fusions I Would Say, Not Very Fantastic, But Can Be Consider Above Average Comparing w Some Few Other Fusion Cuisine Restaurants Out There... \ud83d\ude0a\n\norder the food on 1930, food delivery takes 30 mins. Message from Streats set to aim to deliver the food by 8pm yet it is 8.23pm now and the food is not delivered yet.\n\nVery slow service, not going to order again.\nWill advise my friends and relatives not to order from this outlet in Bukit Panjang Plaza\n\nThe beef noodle was the worse I ever tasted in my life especially for a Hong Kong restaurant. The beef was hammer to tenderiise it and was so salty . I told the staff and they literally shrug it off .

The fried rice texture is dry, fluffy and every grain well fried. The chilli padi adds the extra heat and drizzled with lime to give the spicy tangy taste (maybe that\u2019s the thai part) and fried chicken is a good side that makes the meal more hearty. The place is quite messy, service is normal. Eat and go place.\n\nTried this dish (Aroi Royale) as its different from their zhi char dishes.\n\nNot bad. Tom Yum soup based with seafood varieties and noodles. Serving was huge for 4 pax.\n\nOrdered via online from the table QR code. Hassle free.\n\nThe staffs were polite and courteous.\n\nOverall, nice experience. Thank you.\n\nSet meal was really worth it. About 28++ for assam fish, veggie, sichuan soup, 2 rice. It was marketed to be for 2 pax but would think 3 pax is good for it too (maybe order 1 additional side). Would revisit to try their fish head / other seafood options.\n\nGood old Halal Zhi Char . We tried some normal or usual selections. I must say , I love the mee goreng and prawn paste chicken wing . Overall food tastes qreat but as the place have no sound proof,  it get noisy at time especially when it crowded.\n\nWeekend and it's time for lunch and buddy picked West Coz. I'm up for it for sure.\n\nWe arrived around 2pm thereabouts and the place was not that crowded. We were seated and given our menu by a lady. She seem rather uptight, not rude just the tone I guess. Nothing to be bothered much by. In fact she was nice enough to inform us to call when we were ready to order.\n\nThe choices! Oh my, that was the biggest issue albeit a good issue to have really. So we decided on Assam Fish, Sambal Kangkong, Oyster Omelette, Black Pepper Beef and rice of cause. The male server came and took our orders and in about 15mins all our items arrived. That's a nice thing. Probably because it wasn't that crowded.\n\nThe pictures speaks for itself. The portions were generous, the veggies seems fresh however I would assume the assam fish to be different, you know the red soupy type rather than what I believe to be coconut based gravy. And half a fish head? Hhmmmm ... Nevertheless it was still delish. For the price point, was it worth it, definately. Would I be back here again, sure.\n\nOh, and after we ate and went out to catch a breather, saw the lady leaving on her bicycle. Thank her and she smiled and went on her merry way.\n\nAll in all, enjoyed it.\n\nFood : 4 / 5\nStaff : 4 / 5\nAmbience : 3 / 5\n\n\nOption: 9:\nName: Bukit Panjang Hawker Centre and Market\nAddress: 2 Bukit Panjang Ring Rd, Singapore 679947\nPhone: 6225 5632\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 6:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 6:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 6:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 6:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 6:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 6:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 6:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 1 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 3.9\nReviews: \n\nLocated on level 2 - Celsius Vegetarian\u7d20\nThe stall offers an impressive variety of vegetarian frozen food that caters to different tastes.

Ordered my food at 6.08pm and was told waiting time of 20-30 minutes based on the time chart. The number wouldn\u2019t move even after 50 minutes. Collected my food at 7.02pm for two packets of fried rice. Mind you there\u2019s 3 chefs cooking and the grab food orders kept coming in. Please tell your crew to off the grab machine if you can\u2019t even handle ground orders. If I can give zero stars i will. And one of your malay chef was talking to a regular instead of cooking during peak hours.\n\nOrdered at the store there.\nWas standing there waiting and saw some boxes ready and put on the table but no number was called so thought is for delivery or online self-collect.\nWaited 10mins, number still did not jump so go up to ask, in the end the foods that are placed on the table are mine.\nNot sure what the number system are for if do not use, inside got 7 peoples working some more.\n\nOrdered many times from this outlet. But first time reviewing cos really cannot tahan anymore.  Always pay for extra vegetable but only realised missing ingredient when we were about to eat! Happened to me three times! Can the Wok Hey staff please be more careful while scooping in the ingredients?\n\nTried the egg fried rice with seasoned prawns. Surprisingly it was good, and tasty. The eggs and rice blend together nicely, and the short grain gives it a nice texture. The prawns are fresh and the overall experience was good. Will be back to try other options!\n\nHey! It\u2019s my first time trying wok hey. I found the rice a bit soggy. Yes it\u2019s tasty but could it be because of the MSG that they add?\n",

There wasn't much of a queue and they were relatively fast in preparing your order. I have waited approximately ten minutes before they serve you the food. The price is reasonable, the food is great and it is definitely worth the price.\n\nIt is quite hot here so I recommend you to sit somewhere exposed to the outside air so that there would be an occasional cooling breeze that would circulate the air so that you wouldn't feel that hot.\n\nIt's best to eat here in groups so that you would be able to enjoy the different varieties of food together. Recommend this to your friends too!\n\nGoogle reviews is pretty accurate, very very average Korean food here.\nServed up by very authentic Korean ladies but the food(I tried) were not close to authentic tasting at all. The kimchi stew and ginseng chicken soup tasted like premix or just stock, with lots of msg and not made with fresh ingredients. I was super thirsty after eating. The soup was watery and not tasty.\n\nPrice I feel is ok, not too expensive for the portion which is rather generous, 1 stew and rice will be very very full.\n\nHowever with the number of other Korean options in this building, I won\u2019t be back for this Korean food.\n\nI have to blame myself for not reading other reviews before ordering.\n\nSeafood stew with rice $13.90 at a hawker centre. Taste bland and the ingredients (prawns and mussels) are not fresh.\n\nThe only thing authentic about this place is probably the store owner who is a Korean.\n\nRooftop dining and great place to chill at night. Serves Korean food and beer. Love the oiginal fried chicken wings, crispy on the outside, tender inside. Located in the hawker centre decorated with assortment of plants which adds a botanic side yo the place.\n\nOverall about 3.5 stars for this popular Korean food stall.\n\nThe ginseng porridge $10 was pretty good. Tasty, comforting food and the portion was a huge ball. The ginseng was cut into thin stripes so it doesn\u2019t come across as super bitter when I bit into it.\n\nHowever, the seafood soup was lacklustre. The main complaint would be that the prawns and mussels were not fresh at all. I was struggling to peel the prawns so much it simply disintegrated. I just gave up eating it.\n\nPeak hour wait could be from 30 mins onwards so be prepared to wait during dinner time!\n\n\nOption: 2:\nName: Gayageum Korean Family Restaurant\nAddress: 170 Upper Bukit Timah Road B2, #14 Shopping Centre, 588179\nPhone: 6463 8011\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: Closed\nWednesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 3.9\nReviews: \n\nHad a quick lunch here, pleasantly surprised by the seafood kim chi soup. It\u2019s one of the best I\u2019ve tasted. There\u2019s crab meat in it which makes the soup authentically \u2018seafood\u2019 in flavour. Everything tasted v good. A surprise find this one!\n\nAlways a quiet and chill place where you\u2019ll almost be guaranteed a seat even on Friday nights. Food options are decent but some dishes are a hit or miss. The fried chicken had lots of batter and the flavour didn\u2019t feel like Korean fried chicken (somehow it reminds me for sweetened dark soy sauce). Will return mainly because it\u2019s quiet.\n\nThe hotplate beef is served on a cold plate. The banchan is not worth a repeat. You get better fried chicken at a fast food place. The tofu kimchi soup is ok. The chive pajeon is thick and uncook at the center and doesn't taste Korean.\n\nNot much of ambience but a good place for some quiet moments and good , reasonable price k food. Although I am not a fan of k stuff, the pancake is really good and the various fried chicken. Do go for the sets as they are more worth it.\n\nHomely and very customizable which is a plus for vegans/vegetarians! Naengmyeon is a must at Gayageum whenever I finish trekking nearby especially during hot weather. The jeons are tasty and in good servings - there's banchan too but not all side dishes are vegan.\n\n\nOption: 3:\nName: Yogiyo Korean restaurant\nAddress: 144 Upper Bukit Timah Road #04-03 Beauty World Centre, 588177\nPhone: 9615 4419\nDelivery Available: Information Not Available\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nWednesday: Closed\nThursday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:30\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.6\nReviews: \n\nWe had cold noodle, kimchi stew and fried dumpling! Their price point is considered steep for typical Korean dishes . The kimchi stew is average, not too spicy nor flavourful. However it is a good meal to wind down after a long day! The cold noodle texture is great and refreshing. We enjoyed it.\nTheir fried dumpling is a great snack to go along with the main dish.\nThey serve complimentary side dishes and barley tea.  I\u2019m unsure if the side dishes are refillable as I did not request for refill.\nThe ambience of the restaurant is acceptable!\n\nI\u2019m neither Korean nor have I been to Korea, but I definitely believe this is what Korean food is supposed to be.\n\nI loved every minute in the restaurant. Its ambiance is very warming- almost like you\u2019re hosted by a warm lady.\n\nHearty and rustic dishes that really hits the spot.\n\nHearty authentic Korean food with large servings, you're definitely not leaving this place without a full stomach.\n\nCold glass noodles were delicious (not too spicy despite the color of the chilli).\n\nThey had baby octopus noodles which serves 2 pax, and actually this was the standout dish for me. The baby octopus was really delicious, my first time having it and really left me with a great impression.\n\nI dined in a group of 8, which was a little large, best to dine in groups of 2-4.\n\nVisited for dinner a couple of times. The food is delicious, and the portions are big.\n\nIt is a small restaurant with a low ceiling, and isn't acoustically treated, so it feels too noisy to have a conversation without raising your voice (which then makes the problem worse).\n\nAnother odd thing we felt was that either the tables  are shorter than usual, or the chairs taller than usual. We could be wrong, but our backs felt a little sore halfway through the meal.\n\nOwner is extremely Cheerful and is full of smiles. The food is absolutely stunning, making me crave for more everytime. Will definitely recommend this restaurant to all Korean food lovers! Food is also authentic and fresh \ud83d\ude0b\n\n\nOption: 4:\nName: OMMA Korean Charcoal BBQ\nAddress: 20 Cheong Chin Nam Rd, Singapore 599744\nPhone: 6513 9553\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 12:00\u2009\u2013\u200911:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.3\nReviews: \n\nDecided to do this review when I saw my old photos of this place. Came here because my regular Korean BBQ place next door was too packed.\nRemembered that the marinated meats were good. Overall a good experience although you have to do the meat grilling yourself unlike at....\n\nIt\u2019s a long time since we had Korean bbq & decided to give it a try since the ratings are good. The side dishes are really good \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f, better than most Korean restaurants. We ordered beef & pork set. It came with the soybean soup that was quite tasty \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f and the steam egg which we didn\u2019t really like it as much \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f since it is harder than the usual steam egg. The meats : iberico pork collar, pork belly & beef striploin were good \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f except the beef ribs as it was quite chewy \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f. We were given free beer due to our spending amount. Overall it was a great experience.\n\nHave always wanted to try the wood fired meats ever since I heard about them and today I got a chance. We ordered a set meal for pork with three different types of pork, steamed egg and also kimchi beef soup. The set is pork omma set meant for 2-3 pax.\n\nMeat were generous and really more than enough for two pax. They recommended 2-3 pax but it should be more like 4 pax as both of us were not big meat eaters.\n\nWe ordered a wood flavour charcoal that is suitable for pork - hickory wood which tbh we both cannot smell it and cannot even taste the difference!! The steam egg could be better as it was chao tar at the sides:) the marinating of meats were left to us and the variety of salt and pepper to me were one of the more unique features of restaurant:)\n\nThe set comes with ban chan and they were delicious. There were free flow of ban chan until they ran out!\n\nI like the kimchi and the ikan bilis banchan:) my friend like the ikan bilis banchan and ordered 2nds for both. By the end of the meal both kimchi and ikan bilis have ran out!!!\n\nThere were drinks on special offer but since I drove we did not get the offer.\n\nWas surprised they don't do the cooking for us and also the young girl who first approached us seem new. There was also a housefly landing on the wood panels after we finished eating!!\n\nThe meat set was still a little frozen when served. The fried chicken was pretty average while the beef soup lacked ingredients and it doesn't come with rice. The seafood pancake was floury and non crispy. Food was alright, nothing surprising.\n\nOne of the staff doesn't know the differences between a receipt and a ticket and was augmentative about it. He said because we add on orders and not order at the start (which we totaled over $300 for the bill) doesn't count for the free flow beer for the table. While it was written on the poster outside the restaurant that \"with minimum spend of $250 in a single receipt per table\" he feels he had the need to go outside take a photo and show us to prove us wrong. At that point it just made us feel that the restaurant was kinda scammy. In the end he said only for this time he let us have the free beer. But kudos to the rest of the staff that were friendly, attentive and filled our drink fast.\n\nOverall the food was mediocre and the service should be quite good but there's always a bad apple that spoiled the experience. Or maybe it was the management policy, who knows. I won't recommend this place instead just try the next door O.bba Jjajang for better Korean food.\n\nIts my second time coming back here and they notice me directly!!

Place is not crowded and quite a nice homely atmosphere.  Ordered pizza, lamb chop, burrata cheese plater and bruschetta bread. All tasted delicious and pizza is really good.  Finished with nice coffee and tiramisu dessert.  Service is fast and prompt.  Overall a pleasant experience and the bill came up to $126 which is reasonable for the quality of food served.  Will certainly be back.\n\nA nice cosy Italian restaurant nestled inside a private apartment. You will be spoilt for choices as they have a great authentic Italian menu and everything is tasty. Interior decor is also nicely done with a homey touch. Very friendly staff and chef as well.\n\nI used to order often from them 4-5 years back as I was living next door and I returned for a dinner (last visit was probably 2019). The atmosphere is still great (old school italian place), the food is still amazing. Had the burrata, the 4 cheese pizza (I always order this wherever I go and Al Borgo is top 3 in Singapore for me) and pasta (angel hair with prawns). Nice Super Tuscan red wine at 90$ a bottle. Had deserts too (tiramisu and affogato with whisky instead of coffee). Total damage approx 230$. I left happy in spirit and tummy\n\nIt's definitely a great restaurant for who wanna taste real Italian food!!

Piping hot and crispy pork cutlet matched with silky smooth Japanese curry and steaming rice.\n\nOne of the best curry rice I have had.\n\nThe curry packs some spice is not the all-sweet curry sauce. Cutlet is flavourful; the crunch and temperature of the meat is excellent!\n\nOne of the star outlets of this hawker centre. Atmosphere is what you would expect of a hawker centre. The pigeons are a problem for this hawker centre but shouldn't distract you from the good food.\n\nLook at what you can get for $10. Definitely 5 stars for someone who value quantity over quality yet quality is decent for a hawker fare Japanese curry rice. Pork katsu was the best out of the 3 meats on the plate while the other 2 were forgettable. Very extensive menu for such a small stall which makes ordering decision quite a headache.\n\nUpdate Jul 2023:\nHad their Char Siew Don which is definitely value for money at $5.50 though it's quite lacking in the taste department. Their char siew was succulent and the rice has the right texture but the sauce just doesn't felt right. I guessed the lack of mayonnaise was the difference, there's a reason why most Japanese outlets would add them in their CSD, something that the owner shd consider including.\n\nUpdate Aug 2023:\nHad their Poached Rice which is so far my favourite dish at this stall though it's recipe essentially derived from their ramen by changing the noodle to rice.\n\nUpdate Aug 2023:\nFinally got to try their ramen again which I had it long ago but didn't left an impression. Totally enjoyed it this time eventhough the tonkotsu broth lacked some depth(as expected for a hawker fare) but this can be gloss over by avoiding the original flavour and order either the spicy or black garlic flavour. A 80% restaurant's quality at less than half their price.\n\nUpdate Aug 2023:\nThe Miso Rice w Mentaiko Pork Cutlet is my least favorite by far. The miso rice was too mushy and tasted like kimchi rice which I happened not to like. Pork cutlet was ok but the Mentaiko doesn't seems to compliment the meat as well as it did to salmon.\n\nMy favourite ramen place of all time!!!! Even better than typical ramen restaurants who claim to be \u201cmichelin star\u2019. I always order their signature ramen bowl ($8.00), comes with the ingredients as shown. The pork slices are SO THICK and crispy on one side! Absolutely savoury! Also gives a generous amount of black fungus & the noodles are not overdone with texture in-place. Broth was flavourful yet not too overwhelming.\n\nEven when their food is excellent, their service is impeccable as well. Due to the layout of the food centre, rain splashes quite heavily beside the stall (causing some flooding water as well). The owner came to deliver the ramen to me personally & even wrapped the ramen bowl with a layer of cling wrap + put seaweed in a plastic bag to prevent water from going in, even though I was dining in. Was blown by the effort & it showed how much pride they put in ensuring their ramen quality tasted the best! Kudos! Recommend anyone to go try!!!!!\n\nAtmosphere is not that great - sg weather hahaha & area is not clean, but I\u2019m not going to shortchange this stall of 5 stars as it\u2019s the foodcourt\u2019s issue xD\n\nI purposedly went to Beauty World Food Centre just to try this ramen stall. I read that this stall is one of the 'must try' in the list. I went through the menu and saw that the ramen called BLACK KING (GARLIC) has 3 thumbs up sign. I ordered a bowl costing $9.90. It did not disappoint me. The broth is tasty with rich umami flavor while the noodles are al dente. The thing that I liked most is the barbecue slices of pork with nice  charred flavor while maintaining the tenderness of the meat. It also comes with cabbage, japanese style soft boiled egg, and generous topping of bonito flakes. I would definitely recommend this stall. An affordable ramen that is only a fraction of cost than a normal ramen would be.\n\nButa Kin must be a favourite at Beauty World Food Centre. There is a waiting time of 15 minutes for the Ramen.\n\nTo me, good ramen is one with great-tasting broth, and the noodles must be cooked to my liking (a tad on the hard side). This ramen store ticked all the right boxes (almost). The broth was lovely, but it bordered on the lighter side on the taste. The noodles were perfect. The Char Siew or Charred Pork Slices were delicious and with a little charred flavour. The umami was perfect.\n\nFor extra ingredients, like one boiled egg and extra Char Siew, the cost turned out to be $11. Cheap for the food court? Not exactly, but compared with the ramen restaurants, it is very reasonable.\n\nVerdict, I would certainly come again. I like it.\n\n\nOption: 7:\nName: Tee Kitchen\nAddress: 505 Beach Rd, #01-78 Golden Mile Food Centre, Singapore 199583\nPhone: 9222 7799\nDelivery Available: Information Not Available\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: Closed\nTuesday: Closed\nWednesday: 10:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 10:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 10:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 10:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 10:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20093:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.8\nReviews: \n\nFinally tried the Colombian chicken ($5.50) for lunch. There\u2019s option to add steamed vegetables (which I didn\u2019t).\nTender meat, with lots of gravy, and nice salsa to accompany. The rice is flavored too which is a great addition. Not bad a meal! Portion would be small for a guy.\n\nI have no idea what authentic Colombian food is but this stuff was delicious, inexpensive, and reminded me of my mom\u2019s cooking.

It came with two huge chicken thigh and drumstick. The Colombian flavour had an sweet and savory taste which was really nice. Owners were friendly too.\n\nHumble hawker stall selling something unique and affordable - Colombian chicken rice for $5.50. One of the rare instances where the food itself looks better than the photos at the stall front!\n\nAll portions served include a drumstick and a thigh so the meat was very tender and came off the bone easily. Can taste the mix of various herbs and spices within the sauce. Refreshing tomato salsa at the side. Loved the extra dollop of spicy chilli padi - this added Singaporean touch elevated the whole dish! Pay an additional $1 for a bowl of mixed vegetables. I was supposed to limit my intake of carbs but couldn\u2019t resist finish the entire bowl of rice here with the sauce. Good service and will try the apple crumble next time.\n\n\nOption: 8:\nName: Tok Panjang@Bt.

Boss was a really friendly chap and recommended his specialties Nasi Kunyit and Mee Siam but I ordered Prawn Noodles and I was not disappointed.\n\nThis has got to be the best prawn noodles I had this year. The soup has solid taste of prawns. The yellow noodles were springy in terms of bite with crunchy bean sprouts. Loved their sliced red chilli sauce when you dip the two shells off prawns into.

My friend ordered the Laksa Lemak, and made me regret not buying that even though the Nasi Kunyit was good. The Laksa just had a very thick and gao soup / sauce.\n\nThe Teh peng is different from most shops in that it's not too sweet, rather a thinner feel to it, and the flavour is more subtle. Something different that I enjoyed!\n\nOh, the seats aren't too comfortable for longer meals, and the payment is a little confusing, I don't know exactly when to pay (especially if you're ordering desserts or having a friend join a little later.

Tried their sliced fish mee sua and added fish maw. Apparently all their noodles are handmade. Really tastes similar to home cooked food. There is a good balance of ingredients, just the right amount of everything - greens, fish slices, meat, mushroom etc. They were quite generous with the fish maw. The chilli and black sauce complemented really well with my dry mee sua. Comes with a bowl of soup as well. Would pop to eat again next time. Definitely recommended, especially when queue is short!\n\nWorthy of the name Top 1, the noodles are decently priced and delicious.\n\nWe had the Tom Yum You Mia , Abalone Clam Mee Sua and Ban Mian. All 3 were distinct in their own flavors.\nThe Tom Yum soup was more of a thick gravy with a nice kick. The default soup was flavorful.\nLots of ingredients in all made us pretty full.\n\nThe 30 cents chilli is skippable if you are a chilli fiend, otherwise it is acceptable to normies.\n\nWe paid $16.80 for 3 bowls of soupy goodness. The only downside is the 30 mins plus queue time but I would say it's worth it.\n\nLong Queue, ordered $5 dry ban mian. Although a small table spoon of chilli paste, it's very potent. Enjoyable experience when eating.\n\nMeats and condiments are comforting.\n\nNext time I will order a larger portion the next time.\n\nWaited about 15 mins in line and another 10 mins after ordering for a dry ban mian. Very tasty ban mian and soup. Portion is a bit small compared to other ban mian places but I think this is very good quality. If you don\u2019t mind waiting time then this is nice.\n\nTop 1 Home Made Noodle holds a special place in my heart as my ultimate go-to stall for exquisite noodle delights. Despite the inevitable queue, the wait is undoubtedly worthwhile. Offering selection up to 8 distinct noodle varieties, from thin strands to thicker cuts, this multi-generational establishment has consistently delivered impeccable quality.\n\nOne of their standout dishes, Dry Noodle aka (Gan Lao Mian) stands as my personal favorite. Its chewy noodles bathed in a tantalizing combination of rich dark sauce and spicy chili create an explosion of flavors on the palate. The addition of premium toppings prawns, fish, and abalone elevates the experience to an unparalleled level of indulgence.\n\nWhile the queue might seem daunting, the freshness of the soup speaks volumes about their commitment to quality. For anyone yet to savor the delights of this noodle haven, it's a must-visit destination. Top 1 Home Made Noodle is not just a stall, it's an experience that seamlessly blends tradition with culinary excellence. Prepare to be captivated by the harmonious marriage of chewy noodles, exquisite flavors, and premium toppings\n\nAnyone have not tried it go for it you will love it for sure!\n",

We had the octopus and truffle egg mash for starters. The dishes were all superb and up to standard but the portions were pretty big too so be warned not to overorder. The highlight for us was the seafood paella and the iberico pork, each spoonful of the paella was bursting with flavour and fresh seafood, we felt like we were one with the ocean itself. Our table for two was also very spacious. They served a light Basque baked cheesecake on the house for our birthday celebration. Will definitely be back again!\n\nWe celebrated my wife birthday at Una on a Friday. Only set lunch option available unless we pre ordered tapas.

Decided to go for my all time favourite dry beef sliced rice noodle.\n\nImpressed by their choice to use porcelain bowls and it is the rooster printed type, gave me a traditional olden days feel especially with the piping hot soup and noodles. Many vendors have abandoned forsaken such practice to save cost and for ease of handling. This bagged their first star!\n\nGenerous portion of noodles and beef slices, the portion of meat is definitely enough to last with the noodles which is so rare to find nowadays. Many foodcourts\u2019 renowned beef noodle stalls in only give 4-5 tiny thinly sliced beef with few mouthful portion of noodles.\n\nThe gravy is thick & tasty towards sweet but still acceptable for me who usually prefers more savoury food. The sliced beef is tender and chewable. The soup is flavourful but can be improved as it lacks the wow factor of simmered soup base. The effort to top the soup & noodle with generous amounts of garnish is applaudable.\n\nNot the best that I have tasted but it beats many foodcourt ones. It is value for money at $5 with good presentation and taste.

Unfortunately we didn\u2019t like the kueh and desserts. The bobo chacha has too much sweet potatoes and a little too sweet. Chendo, as you can see, not lemak enough. Not much fragrance to the rice kueh selection and some rice weren\u2019t well cooked. The sugee cake has a little nutty feel but overall not to my liking. But the ambience is quite good, with choice to sit in aircon inside, a little cramp though. You can sit outside, sufficient fans and air cooler fan around. Tables and chairs looking clean.\n\nThe food is nice and serving is good for 2 people. Like that it is dog friendly at the outside dining area. Can slightly before lunch time on a PH and it was almost full during lunch. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc glad I found this place\n\nWhite rice is different. Was using Indian rice. It good. Foods nothing special, it just a normal peranakan dish. Can go and try it out. One of the quiet place and environment I like.\n\nThis place is good. We spent $76 today. The kueh pie tee is so good - Met my expectation. The ingredients of the food here are fresh and good. The only disappointing item is the Bobo chacha - too little soup but they give lots of yam and sweet potatoes. The yam is not soft enough\u3002it will be nicer if the texture is the \u7c89 \u7c89 type.  Service is ok. They accept cash or PayLah only. No credit card payment.\n\nAuthentic and delicious Peranakan food. They also serve Peranakan snacks and kueh.\n\nFamily run. The food is home cook quality what you would like to eat every night.\n\n\nOption: 5:\nName: Sum Kee Food\nAddress: 2 Telok Blangah Street 31, Singapore 108942\nPhone: 6737 3233\nDelivery Available: Information Not Available\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 10:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20092:30\u202fPM, 5:00\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.2\nReviews: \n\nThe location is really interesting. Gives me the feeling of a Taiwanese restaurant that is outside of the city, when I travel to Taiwan.\nThe restaurant spreads the table giving good space to enhance the dining experience.\nFood is generally good, although I find some dishes a little saltier than what I would prefer. But \u771f\u7684\u4e0d\u9519\u5403\uff01\ud83d\ude0a\nIf you have got been here before, give it a try! Quite a unique place.\n\nClassic horfun and fried rice done right at this tze char place in the Yeo\u2019s Building at Telok Blangah.  Tried one of their signature dishes - Ultraman chicken which is salted egg popcorn chicken - pretty good! Super fast service and nice retro vibe to place\n\nAwesome food. Was so good and ate a lot. Portion is reasonable. Ordered approximately 11 dish of varying sizes for $250++. No regrets.\n\nA classic Chinese Tze char eatery for the nostalgia. Food was decent and not too salty. I really liked the pumpkin tofu as the tofu was very silky. Coffee ribs were a bit of a misrepresentation as it was pork slices (easy to eat coz it\u2019s boneless I guess?) Am still on the search for a good Yam ring which wasn\u2019t fulfilled here although still ok but  unfortunately the Yam felt like it was cooked in overused oil. Fried mee sua was underwhelming.\n\nAunt picked this place for her 84th birthday treat & was disappointed. The place kind of messy maintained outside & ordered dishes are not the best. The chilli crab doesn't look & taste as said. Management proposed to wash the sauce off to re-cooked into pepper crab, which still tastes average. The sauce for the fish head had so much starch that turned into paste when cold. The black pepper beef is overcooked, rough & tough like John Wayne. Although the desserts are thrown in by Management & I'd the yam paste which many highlighted... my verdict ... disappointed.\n\nWe'll 04 agreed that this'll be our 1st & last.\n\n\nOption: 6:\nName: Hai Kee Teochew Cha Kuay Teow\nAddress: 11 Telok Blangah Cres, #01-102, Singapore 090011\nPhone: None\nDelivery Available: Information Not Available\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 4:30\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 4:30\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 4:30\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 4:30\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 4:30\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 4:30\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nSunday: Closed\n\nPrice Level: 1 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.5\nReviews: \n\nFirst off, this uncle is such a pleasant, polite and friendly man! Not an ounce of arrogance despite being so popular. Truly admirable!\nAs for his char kway teow, it\u2019s one of the classic renditions still available.\nMore on the moist side, slightly sweet, a good amount of tasty crispy pork lard but not too much of the lard oil, which is good because it doesn\u2019t feel so sinful.\nReally good for cockle fans!\nBest eaten there.\n\nUncle is so sweet! He opened the stall a little early at around 4pm because there was already a \"sitting\" queue on a Saturday. Usually, he says it's around 5pm.\n\nIt's totally worth the craze- wok hey Kway Teow with crispy lard and delicious cockles. Only 1 size portion - $5 and max 10 per order.\n\nIf you are done, you can return the empty plate to the grey bin and the chopsticks to the smaller green bin.\n\nUncle also does his stall preparation is secret with the binds down. \ud83d\ude02\n\nPrepare for 1.5h queue. Uncle cooks plate by plate so each person about 10mins on average. One of the best CKTs I ever had in sg and is on the wet side. Pork lard very crispy and fragrant, stock used is sufficient. 1 size only at $5. The queue is too long for me to eat this again tho\n\nHand down one if not the best Char Kway Teow in Singapore! Came in $5 portion only. Plenty of fresh cockles and crispy pork lard in the noodle. Sometime you have to wait a hour or more if people in front order a lot of packets but it is definitely worth the wait! Uncle is soft spoken and friendly too!\n\nLong wait time as he fries each plate at a time. But puts in a lot of effort for each plate. No lap cheong but loaded with lots of cockles and bean sprouts. Five dollars per plate no more no less and so filling.\n\n\nOption: 7:\nName: Sabeen Sara Prata And Briyani Stall\nAddress: 79 Telok Blangah Dr, Singapore 100079\nPhone: 9004 0587\nDelivery Available: Information Not Available\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 6:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20091:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 6:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20091:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 6:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20091:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 6:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20091:00\u202fPM\nFriday: Closed\nSaturday: 6:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20091:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 6:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20091:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 4.5\nReviews: \n\nIt\u2019s good mutton briyani for $6.50 with tender meat. It\u2019s not gamey like most I have tried. Usually I dnt take mutton. But this is real light in taste but with strong herbs.\n\nSimply one of best mutton briyani you can find. Rem to ask for extra curry which fused with fragrant mutton flavor.\n\nThe usual stall that we have always patronised was not open on the day and thus we were given a good reason to try out the other popular stall in Telok Blangah Food Center. We remembered many of the diners enjoying their plate of Briyani from one of the Muslim stalls and guess it's our time to try it out now.\n\nAt one glance at the stall signboard, they are offering biryani and roti prata only. For Briyani, there is a choice of chicken or Mutton.\n\nWho needs a good presentation of the food when it tasted good? For both Chicken & Mutton Briyani, do expect the eye-pleasing serving that has a delicious drum or meat topping up the plate of Basmati Rice, papadum and colourful pickles to entice you. Instead, I would say what they prepared was a bare minimum, cut cucumbers, meat and rice with a plate of curry.\n\nThe first mouthful of the rice had landed me an understanding of why people are patronising them. No doubt that the food was simple and straightforward, I must say that their rice is very fluffy and non-greasy at all. There is no gamey taste from the mutton. The meat was tender and the meat literally fell off the bone with the slightest effort. I drenched my plate of Briyani with the curry gravy given and had enjoyed every grain of it.\n\nMutton Briyani - $6.50\n\nThe chicken Briyani too, was tender and delicious with meat falling apart easily. Curry was thick and satisfying.\n\nChicken Briyani - $6\n\nOverall, food is of the right amount of spice and not overpowering in any aspect of taste. I will be back again!\n\nI would have given them 5 stars if the biryani comes with papadum.\n\nVery thick and flavorful curry (both chicken and mutton). Both meat was cooked to almost perfection.\n\nVery fluffy basmati bryani rice. Not oily and delicious. Mutton was soft and tender.. curry have just the right touch of spices.

Beef noodles from Horiginal was really nice and not too gamey. The portion is really huge! Oyster omelette was not bad too.\n\nWanted to eat mee goreng at the food center but it's closed.\n\nCame over to the coffeeshop and noticed a new Indian food stall, so I ordered mee goreng from them.\n\nIt looks, not the usual red Indian mee goreng, just an unusual color.\n\nThe shock was, $7 for a plate.  Everywhere else is selling at $4.50 or at most, $5.  $7!  It's really expensive!  I was really unpleasantly and uncomfortably surprised!\n\nBack to the mee goreng.  It doesn't taste the familiar mee goreng taste.  The sauce, was it chilli or tomato sauce? It taste a bit stale so I didn't want to take it.\n\nNoticed there were a lot more Mutton than the usual, so that's why it's $7.  BUT who pays $7 for a plate of fried mee goreng at the coffeeshop or food center?\n\nI wouldn't want to try anything else again, for I'll likely get another shock I'm not prepared for.\n\nGood luck guys. I wonder if the business can last.\n\n1 star for the drink stall. Ordered teh c and it tasted horribly diluted. Just a sip and I am done with it.\n\n3 stars as there are really quite a number of interesting food stalls here including the famous char kway teow supposedly with generous serving of cockles with a super long queue.

It's worth it for $10.80 as there are 4 pieces of pork ribs which are quite tender. The waitress also took initiative to refill our Pu er tea and soup. Food was served promptly after ordering. Clean and spacious environment. A hidden gem in Taman Jurong!\n\nPretty nice BKT with 2 types of base soup for your preference. Impressed that they also have some tze char dishes for those who are not into BKT. Recommend that you get premium ribs since its easier to eat with tender meat. Soup are refillable - hurray! Prices quite reasonable but rice at $1. Finally being your own tissues because they charge for wet wipes.\nParking available since its at Taman Jurong Bowl. Will return for BKT craves.\n\nYummy soup with free refill of soup only. We had nice peanuts and hard boiled eggs, fried chicken, bitter gourds with salted eggs\u2026 staffs are friendly and crowds are moderate at peak hours\u2026\n\nOne of my favourite place to host client, family and friend!\n\nNice food, environment and friendly staff!\n\nLove their herbal and white pepper bah ku teh, with unlimited (I guess?) soup refill!\n\nHave tried their other dishes, mostly ok for me, and their price are reasonable, for me is restaurant standard, coffee shop price, worth to try \ud83d\ude01\n\nComfortable and spacious interior, suitable for families with kids. I personally prefer the white peppery Bah Kut Teh soup over the herbal one. There is a huge variety of options for diners. The chicken rice set was pretty good too. Reasonable price.\n\n\nOption: 4:\nName: Lao Huo Tang - Jurong Point 2\nAddress: #2 Jurong Point, Singapore 648331\nPhone: 6873 2181\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 11:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u200910:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: 2 / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 3.4\nReviews: \n\nThis place is good for a soupy meal. I like the soups they make and their Seafood Hor fun.\n\nThe only issue is that there are plenty of flies. For years they are having this problem and they can\u2019t seem to sort it out.\n\nService is a hit or miss. But for me it\u2019s generally good.\n\nHealthy and tasty food. Nice and clean environment, though now the seats are a bit too close to each other. Free top up of the soup once. Flavourful! Tried different dishes and so far very tasty.\n\nIG: sgfood13\nTiktok: gohht13\n\nService could be better. Food taste average. Used to have dimsum menu but sadly they removed it. You get a refill of the soup though( once ), which isn't allowed at other branch.\n\nUpdate Nov \u201822: Soup isn\u2019t as flavourful anymore, and a lot of the dishes were undercooked - chicken was red, pork rib was red, bitter gourd too tough.. dropping to 2 stars \u2b50\ufe0f\n\nCan\u2019t find any fault with the quality and taste of the food here, it\u2019s all wonderfully done.\n\nThere is also a 1 x free refill on all soups, which pretty much fills 60-70% of the bowl. Also, it\u2019s a good idea to takeaway the refill portion of the soup if you can\u2019t finish both bowls in one setting \ud83d\ude09\n\nHowever, the service level and price is a little off imo. (Or maybe we just weren\u2019t used to the GST and service charge after 4 months at home - $116 for 4 pax, you be the judge)\n\nDelicious and nurturing Chinese home dishes. Preferred the lotus root soup with more herbal taste than the chicken herbal soup which is too sweet. The homemade tofu is very good. Just soup and tofu with rice for 2 is very filling. Ordered 1 soup and 1 dish and get another soup free. Great bargain for a satisfying meal! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\n\n\nOption: 5:\nName: Lao Fu Ji Bak Kut Teh\nAddress: 442 Jurong West Ave 1, Singapore 640442\nPhone: None\nDelivery Available: Information Not Available\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\nMonday: 10:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nTuesday: 10:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nWednesday: 10:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nThursday: 10:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nFriday: 10:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nSaturday: 10:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\nSunday: 10:30\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20099:00\u202fPM\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 1\nReviews: \n\nthought can eat my favourite bakut teh...no more there.\n\n\nOption: 6:\nName: Lao chong Qing\nAddress: 505 Jurong West Street 52, #01-19, Singapore 640505\nPhone: None\nDelivery Available: Information Not Available\nDine-In Available: Information Not Available\nOpening Hours:\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 0\nReviews: \n\n\nOption: 7:\nName: Lao Er Herbal Soup \u80012\u7172\u9753\u6c64 (Ah Er Soup \u963f2\u8001\u706b\u6c64)\nAddress: 90 Boon Lay Pl, Singapore 649884\nPhone: None\nDelivery Available: Yes\nDine-In Available: Yes\nOpening Hours:\n\nPrice Level: None / 4 (0- Free, 1- Inexpensive, 2- Moderate, 3- Expensive, 4- Very Expensive, None- Price Data Not Available)\nRating: 1\nReviews: \n\nBought peanut lotus soup, soup seems thick but very salty.

Complimentary popcorn was served before our meal. The food was served within minutes of ordering and every item was worth the price we paid. Great place to go for a casual lunch or dinner!\n\nFood was good. Place was good.\nHerb fried chicken 9/10, sweet sour fish 9/10. Red ruby dessert 9/10, kangkung vege 6.5/10, tomyam chicken soup 6.5/10. Overall good experience. They serve free popcorn too. Price is reasonable for a restaurant in a mall.\n\nNot the best Thai food I have tried, chicken pad Thai kinda tasteless but the texture of the noodle is still fine. Lemon tea less sugar taste better. Free pop corn is provided which is surprised for me. Staffs are friendly and helpful.\n\nThere are good selections of vegetarian options here! Price is pocket friendly and we love their stir-fries!! Spicy food here are super shiok too, great for people who love spicy food. And kids will be delighted with the free popcorns!\n"
