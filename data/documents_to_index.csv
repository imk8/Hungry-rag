Focusing on a Chinese tasting menu that changes regularly, the Michelin-starred inside a shophouse on Boat Quay, is the perfect place for a special occasion meal with a group. Think A5 Wagyu, Japanese Tiger Prawns mixed with Risotto, Hokkaido Scallop, and unique desserts like Guava Shrub Sorbet made with granola and pink peppercorn. Certainly, this is an unmissable dining experience in Singapore.📍18 N Canal Rd, Singapore 04883This acclaimed 3-Michelin star restaurant is an excellent place to taste the flavours of France in Singapore. With more than three decades in business, Les Amis has mastered the art of serving contemporary haute French cuisine, resulting in an unmatched dining experience in an elegant setting. Diners can pay for a 3 or 4-course lunch or dinner, and be treated to the likes of divine duck breast, rich mushroom soup, and a selection of desserts and wines.

Boasting top-class international chefs and armfuls of dining awards, Singapore is home to hundreds of must-visit restaurants that represent pretty much every cuisine you can think of, all with their own army of drool-worthy signature dishes.So to give you a solid lay of the culinary land and steer you in the right direction, Urban List has rounded up the best Singapore restaurants every foodie needs to try.
Image credit: Tilly's East Coast | SuppliedAlthough Tilly’s East Coast is technically more of an Irish pub than it is a restaurant, the food is seriously next level and should definitely be on you radar next time you’re craving some good old-fashioned comfort food. The menu, which was created by Michelin-starred Chef-Owner Andrew Walsh, combines the soulful flavours of Irish cuisine with modern fusion inspirations.Expect to find classics such as their signature beef and Guinness pot pie with mash, beer batter fish and chips with tartare sauce and mushy peas, and chicken schnitzel served with horseradish cream and sage and lemon butter. But if you ask us, it’s their Sunday roast that really takes the cake. We recommend the roast beef which comes with gravy, duck fat roast potatoes, sprouts, carrot mash and Yorkshire puddings. If you fancy something sweet, finish with the sticky toffee pudding and clotted cream.
Image credit: FURA | SuppliedHelmed by power couple Christina Rasmussen and Sasha Wijidessa, FURA (which means pine in Swedish) aims to change the way we eat and drink by making sustainable dining more approachable. This is done by using ingredients that have a low carbon footprint that are either abundant in nature or out of balance in its ecosystem.FURA’s Journal of Future Food menu offers a range of planet-friendly options like insects, cell-cultured milk and coffee made from burdock root and hemp seeds. It also features familiar ingredients such as jellyfish, corn and banana, which are either invasive species or available in abundance. FURA also makes an effort to use ingredients widely available in Asia such as gongura, fish leaf and borage grown by hydroponic farmers like GreenLoop Farms in Singapore. The duo have also recently introduced a new six-course pairing menu which is a great way to try a little bit of everything.
Image credit: Marcy's | SuppliedIf you’re a fan of seafood and grandma chic interiors, Marcy’s is the place for you. Founded in 2020, the seafood bistro on Duxton Road takes familiar ideas and presents them in new, satisfying ways. Drawing on the similarities between Latin American and Southeast Asian ingredients, Head Chef Ryan Nile Choo showcases the best local and regional herbs, spices and aromatics, paired with seafood in bold new ways. Highlights include the octopus rigatoni and red prawn mafaldine. For those of you who don’t eat seafood, fear not, the iberico pork chop is a delicious alternative."

The last decade has seen more ‘modern’ renditions of the iconic dish too, offering nouveau flavours that include salted egg yolk too.

If you’re tired of steaks and burgers, and want something a little closer to home, or are simply hankering for a satisfying meal, we’ve got you covered. Oh, and gather as many family members and friends for this one – it’s going to be an oceanic feast like no other at these best seafood restaurants in Singapore.



(Hero and featured image credit: Melben Seafood)Red House Seafood has made quite the name for itself since it first opened in 1976. Apart from sourcing fully traceable seafood, you won’t find the creatures on full display in tanks here either. To maintain the quality of the ingredients, the kitchen team controls and monitors the living conditions down at the micro-ecosystem level as a sign of respect and appreciation not just to guests to dine here, but to the produce as well. We particularly enjoyed the White Pepper Alaskan King Crab, a meaty dish with a nuanced, floral spice that comes from the white pepper-infused stock.Long Beach Seafood Restaurant is best known for being the original creators of the Black Pepper Crab. Here, guests also enjoy servings of their Deep Fried Flat Noodles with La La King, a stir-fried hor fun dish with generous portions of clams and a fresh topping of fried hor fun. Dining with guests that aren’t a fan of seafood? The tender pork ribs are a must-try too.(Image credit: @longbeachseafood via Instagram)Palm Beach Seafood is perennially ranked amongst the city’s best offerings, and is not hard to see why. The King Prawn Soup is a comforting dish comprising vermicelli and tiger prawns that sit in a flavourful superior chicken stock made with evaporated milk, dried orange peel, Jin Hua ham, chilli oil, and lime juice. For a more unique take on the crowd-favourite crustacean, order the Crab Ala Singapura — it’s charcoal-grilled with melted mozzarella, aged parmesan cheese, creamy French butter, salt and pepper that’ll sit well with younger diners.(Image credit: @palmbeachsg via Instagram)Jumbo Seafood is almost synonymous with chilli crab here in Singapore. The household name prides itself on the classic rendition of this dish — sweet, savoury, and spicy all at once — that’s best had with a basket or two of crispy golden brown buns to lick up all of the sauce. The outlet at East Coast is popular for its alfresco dining situation complete with a cooling sea breeze on good days, and the Dempsey outlet, fashioned with a slightly more upscale interior is great for special occasions.(Image credit: @jumboseafoodsg via Instagram)"

Talk about setting. It presents a Japanese-European inspired menu that is all things modern and meatless. It boldly innovates in its specially curated dishes, such as the Vegetable Sashimi on Ice with Oyster-Leaf Shooter Glass. Don’t expect raw fish here, because this cold dish presents a mix of coconut flesh and ‘sashimi’ made with aloe vera. I reckon that you’ll be hard-pressed to find dishes like these elsewhere.

Admittedly, it’s difficult to picture Indonesian cuisine without the likes of ayam panggang and rendang. Yet, that is precisely what this humble eatery seeks to achieve with their vegetarian offerings. If you’re still unconvinced, just take a look at their Rendang Fried Rice (S$9.90).Featuring lion’s mane mushroom in place of meat, the rendang sauce here is equal parts smoky and heavy with the fragrance of coconut. It comes with an oozy egg yolk as well, so the whole dish is made even more satisfying and sumptuous.

https://gocity.com/singapore/en-us/blog/where-to-eat-on-a-budget-in-singapore,Where to Eat on a Budget in Singapore | Go City®,,"You’ve probably heard Singapore can be a little pricey for the unprepared vacationer. And sure, those luxury hotel stays, Michelin-star dinners, world-class attractions and casino blowouts really can add up quickly. But there are ways to do Singapore on a budget. You can save on visits to multiple attractions with a pass from Go City, for example. Or stick to cheap eats which are anyway (in our humble opinion) some of the very finest you’ll find in Singapore. We’ve put together a whistle-stop guide to where to eat on a budget in Singapore, whether it’s mouth-numbingly spicy local cuisine that floats your boat or, you know, you’re just in the market for a burger or a decent bowl of pasta. Dive in to find out more, but be warned: the following blog is guaranteed to make you feel hungry…***Note: prices quoted are in Singapore Dollars (SGD)***Singapore’s hole-in-the-wall joints and hawker centers serve up some of the tastiest and most wallet-friendly dishes in town. There are over 100 centers spread across the city, meaning you’re never far from your next $5 laksa or chili crab. Many of the thousands of street vendors within tend to specialize in just one or two dishes and have been doing this for generations. So you can be pretty sure these decades-old food stalls have refined their cuisine to an art form and that the food you’re buying for, quite frankly, next to nothing, is going to blow your mind.Expect a full-on assault on the senses, with the sights and scents of duck and suckling pig roasting on the spit, and plumes of aromatic steam and smoke rising from grills and pots around every corner. Your challenge is not to allow those intoxicating aromas pull you straight in to the first stall you pass. Indeed, the greatest tip we can give for mastering the art of hawker center dining is to actively seek out the longest queues of hungry locals: pretty much a cast-iron guarantee of a great meal, and well worth the wait.Some of our favorite hawker centers are also some of the most centrally located, ideal if you’re shopping on Orchard Street, taking a sightseeing stroll around Marina Bay, or visiting the exquisite Botanic Gardens. A must-see attraction in itself, Lau Pa Sat is as well-known for its distinctive colonial-style architecture and peculiar octagonal shape as it is for its satay and chili crab. Step beneath its wrought-iron Victorian arches for a gourmet wonderland of international cuisines including Filipino, Korean, Vietnamese, Indonesian and more.Close to the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple, Maxwell Food Center fairly heaves during lunch hour, when nearby offices empty inside, enticed by the heady scents of Hainanese chicken, crispy oyster cakes, zingy chili crab and the mother of all Singapore street-food snacks: pork that’s been skewered, char-grilled and smothered in umami peanut satay sauce. Unmissable.The nearby Amoy Street Food Center is another local favorite thanks to those low, low prices and some of the finest fish head soup, curry puffs and great steaming bowls of ramen known to humanity. Or check out Newton Food Centre, best known for its appearance in the movie Crazy Rich Asians, but more likely to live long in the casual diner’s memory for its fine seafood dishes like spicy sambal stingray in banana leaf. Another great way to hunt out Singapore’s best bargain bites is in the neighborhoods where food is a way of life. We’re talking Chinatown, Little India and Kampong Glam, Singapore’s Muslim district, each of which bustles with restaurants and street food stalls where feasting until you’re full for less than $20 is the norm. Kampong Glam is, not to put too fine a point on it, an absolute mecca for gourmands. Work up an appetite on a stroll that takes you past the soaring golden dome of the Sultan Mosque, picturesque Peranakan houses in chili reds, sea greens and mellow yellows and the authentic Turkish antique emporia along Arab Street, then take your pick from the deliciously decadent hotch-potch of cuisines that includes – deep breath – Turkish, Syrian, Lebanese, Indonesian, Malaysian, Singaporean and even Swedish. Try Kampong Glam Café for no-frills Malay favorites served at street-side tables right by the mosque, and Sari Ratu on Pahang Street for what some say is the best nasi padang in all Asia. At the Aliwal Arts Center, Tipo is a laidback joint serving freshly made pasta just like mama used to make. Choose from toppings that range from feta to salmon caviar. Yum.Ok, so we’ve established that meals that won’t set you back more than $15–20 aren’t actually all that difficult to come by in Singapore. But hawker centers and pocket-sized neighborhoods are easy pickings for foodies on a budget, so we’ve also tracked down a selection of popular restaurants that will fill your belly without breaking the bank.Founded in 1987, Jumbo Seafood more than lives up to its name, with huge flavors and belly-busting portions that have seen it expand outside of Singapore, bringing its signature chili crab to the masses in China, Korea, Thailand and Vietnam. A little more convenient for Singapore vacationers are the outlets in Orchard Road, Jewel Changi Airport and trendy Dempsey Hill. Go for the chili crab, stay for the crispy fried baby squid. Delectable and affordable. What’s not to like?"

The solution: head to one of these great late-night restaurants where you can satisfy those hunger pangs well after the rest of the city is tucked away in bed. Whether you’re craving tacos, ramen, Thai, a kebab, a burger, or just a plate of good ‘ol chicken rice, we’ve got you covered (you’re welcome!).Akanoya RobatayakiFor the uninitiated, robatayaki is a Japanese style of eating where you sit in front of a display of fresh ingredients like meats, seafood and veggies, and you simply point to what you want. The chefs will then marinate the ingredients, grill them up for you and hand the dishes over with a wooden paddle.

https://sethlui.com/best-midnight-supper-spots-singapore/,21 best midnight supper spots in SG for hungry insomniacs,23 Dec 2022 — ,"Being a nation of foodies, we do have an endless list of places to visit, regardless of cuisine, location, and time of day. At work, in school, along the street, it’s inevitable that we’ll walk past someone with food or a drink in their hand. Supper, for me, has always been either a steaming cup of instant noodles or ordering McNuggets at 1am, but here are 21 places for you to hit up if your stomach starts growling late at night.This list has everything you could possibly want— freshly made roti prata, comforting congee, childhood favourite fishball noodles, chocolatey brownies and waffles, good ol’ dim sum, smoky KBBQ, and more. There will be something for everyone, and that’s a promise.Breaking through to first place as best midnight supper spot is trailblazing gyu sushi specialist Black Fairy. With a name entirely suited to its focus on the evening crowd, Black Fairy also boasts a convenient location. It sits on Carpenter Street adjacent to one of Singapore’s most popular nightlife spots, Clarke Quay.We love this place because their sushi isn’t the typical seafood-based fare you get virtually everywhere else in Singapore. Instead, they serve gyu sushi, which features cuts of meat (nikusushi) instead. That’s the far better option in the middle of the night— they are open till 3am— after a long drinking session.However, the seats begin to fill up much earlier, almost immediately after Black fairy opens at 5pm. This crowd is made up mostly of young professionals who work in the nearby CBD area. There are many options closer to the CBD for them but they apparently can’t resist the Black Fairy appeal.On the menu is an ideal mix of quality sushi and grilled dishes for a satisfying after-work dinner. Despite the high quality and the equally high demand, prices at the Black Fairy are surprisingly low. This fact was really the clincher in pushing them to top position on our list. Where else can you get wagyu sushi at prices starting at just S$1.90 per piece? Their Meat Sushi Platter of 8 pieces (char siew, classic beef tenderloin, classic wagyu karubi, truffle wagyu karubi) goes at S$14.90— our favourite on the menu."

https://sethlui.com/best-italian-restaurants-singapore/,29 Italian restaurants to relish in Singapore,5 Sept 2023 — ,"What makes a good Italian restaurant in Singapore? Is it the authenticity, or is it simply how good you felt while dining there? I would vote for the latter. Despite adding a local touch, there are many good Italian restaurants in Singapore that still make pretty damn good pasta and pizzas.In this guide to the best Italian restaurants in Singapore, I tried different Italian restaurants across the country, all with their own styles. I’d have to say that after talking with chefs, authentic Italian cuisine is just too diverse from region to region. From Sardinia to Sicilian, the differences are astounding and each Italian chef focuses on his own region’s cuisine.It’s hard to say which is better when we’re comparing cuisines from different regions against each other, but Italian food is definitely beyond just pasta and pizzas, as most Singaporeans will assume.And then there are local chefs who trained under Italian restaurants, and started creating their own style of Italian-Singaporean cooking that wonderfully pleases the local palate. There are many Italian restaurants here that are rather authentic, but there are bound to be certain tweaks here and there to suit the market.I’m certainly not complaining as long as I find it delicious, and I hope you do too. This article is based on what locals and expats like, which may not necessarily imply authenticity. After all the burrata, risotto, pasta and tiramisu, here are 29 Italian restaurants to relish in Singapore.Singapore’s first authentic Italian halal restaurant, Kucina, is helmed by Chef Gero, who’s had 25 years of experience in Italian cooking in prestigious restaurants like Da Paolo and the Garibaldi Group. After becoming a Muslim revert, he was inspired to open his own restaurant that catered to the Muslim community without compromising the authenticity of Italian food, leading to the birth of Kucina. Unique to Kucina, the La Barca Funghi E Tartufo (S$28.90) is a boat-like pizza filled with the richness of mozzarella and the nuttiness of mushroom sauce with black truffle pate. To eat this dish, simply tear the pizza dough around its sides and dip it into the creamy centre!11 Tanjong Katong Road, KINEX, #B1-09/10, Singapore 437157

That is why you may see ground beef or hard shell tortillas, and yellow cheese featured in some of their tacos—these ingredients are not found in authentic, traditional Mexican tacos.Before we begin, here’s a glossary of common Mexican meats to get you up to speed:Carnitas: Braised, pulled pork shoulder cooked until ridiculously tender with a series of seasonings such as cumin and orange juice.Barbacoa: Lamb or beef steamed until tender and dripping with fat. Traditionally, the meat and organs of the whole animal are wrapped in agave leaves and cooked in a giant metal pot.Carne Asada: Mexican steak, distinguished by an intense marinade, typically cumin, chiles and citrus juiceTable of Contents

https://sethlui.com/best-mexican-restaurants-singapore/,13 best Mexican restaurants in Singapore for authentic ...,,"¡Hola! In case you can’t tell, my love for Mexican food runs deep and its no surprise I crave it even in Singapore. I might go as far as saying it’s my favourite cuisine. I mean, who doesn’t enjoy a warm basket of tacos, gooey enchiladas, or snacking on a pile of salty tortilla chips and homemade guacamole with a massive margarita. I know it sure makes me happy. I don’t just enjoy Mexican food, I crave it, all varieties of it… aggressively.I think I have about tasted them all, a couple of times, so I present to you my top 13 locations. So next time you feel like indulging in some meaty, cheesy, tortilla-y goodness you’ll know where to go—heck, you’ll probably end up seeing me there. ¡Viva México! With an interior that feels very much like a food truck, Papi’s Tacos is by far the most authentic experience you can find in our sunny shores when it comes to Mexican food. The restaurant is led by Mexican Chef-owner, Jose Mauricio Espinoza, otherwise known by regulars as ‘Papi’.A crowd favourite is their Tacos De Pescado (Fish Tacos) (S$13 for a set of 2, and S$19 for a set of 3), which is amazing when paired with some of the new Mexican beers in Papi’s Tacos menu—like the Taco Cerveza and Dos Equis.For truly no-frills, street-style authentic tacos and margaritas, Papi’s Tacos is as close and as good to the real thing as it gets. What’s more, they also have an awesome promotion on Taco Tuesdays, where you can get three tacos for the price of two if you come after 5pm. Happy Hours happen between 3pm and 7pm everyday, with frozen lime margaritas, house spirits, draft beer and wine going at S$9++ per glass.Papi’s Tacos: 39 Seah Street, #01-01, Singapore 188395 | Tel: +65 6258 0701 | Facebook | Instagram | WebsiteMuchachos tops my list for being the best burrito I’ve had in Singapore to date. If you’ve ever had Chipotle before you know how much of a travesty it is that there isn’t one in Singapore. Muchachos provides the closest substitute for my go-to casual, quick service custom burrito fix.They also whip up tasty tacos, burrito bowls and quesadillas to your liking, but I think the burrito is the star here. Make sure to pair your meal with a side of chips and guac and a Jarritos soda to complete the experience."

						22 September 2022					From casual taquerias to upscale establishments, Vogue rounds up the top Mexican and South American restaurants serving up the best of the region's vibrant culinary offeringsVibrant, rich in flavour and loaded with spices, Mexican and South American cuisine has so much to offer. There are the familiar favourites: tacos topped with a multitude of fillings; guacamole and salsa served with tortilla chips, and quesadillas oozing with cheese. But also on the table is a spectrum of lesser-known dishes, perhaps not as easily found in Singapore, but every bit as delightful. From the simple tlayuda, a variation of a tortilla from the Mexican state of Oaxaca, to the hearty arroz con mariscos, a Peruvian rice dish stewed in seafood broth, an array of culinary offerings from the region remains, to most Singaporeans, yet unexplored.Mexican and South American cuisine is incredibly diverse, but what these dishes have in common is their striking colours and complex flavours. With a frozen margarita on the side, a good Latin American meal is always a joyous occasion—ideal for both large get-togethers and casual gatherings.The Latin American culinary scene in Singapore might not be the biggest, but it’s certainly an increasingly robust one. Joining some of the country’s most established Mexican dining concepts—such as the ever-popular Lucha Loco—are innovative restaurants that afford us something exciting and different. Canchita offers a taste of what Peruvian cuisine has to offer, Papi’s Tacos brings to our shores the convivial spirit of an authentic Mexican taqueria, while Nixta distinguishes itself with its exceptional reinventions of Mexican food.From charming eateries to upscale establishments, Vogue Singapore rounds up some of the best Mexican and South American restaurants on the island.  "

Being a total overly-passionate individual for Japanese food, I decided that I needed to source for quality and affordable Japanese joints in Singapore to sustain my insatiable appetite.For all my like-minded souls, here’s a list of 17 affordable places for Japanese food in Singapore where you can get your fix without burning a hole in your pocket. Ideally, you would be spending less than S$30 a person at these places, although some might be more expensive at nightA hidden hideout serving quality Japanese food at affordable prices? Yes please! Morinaga Izakaya, located in the heart of town, strives to establish just that. Featured below is their Salmon Nigiri Aburi Mentai Mayo 6pcs Set (S$21). While many other Japanese eateries also have this dish, Morinaga Izakaya’s rendition is especially delightful. With a large slab of thick-sliced salmon over a smaller serving of sushi rice, diners can fully appreciate the luscious salmon texture and taste. I’d pair these sushi with heartier mains such as the Truffle-Flavoured Somen Noodle with Ikura (S$14) and meat dishes including the Japanese Roast Beef (S$14). Oh, did I mention Wagyu Sashimi (S$26) and Grilled Miso Pork (S$9)? It surely is a meat-lovers’ dream!For those looking to fully experience their sashimi offerings, the team serves Assorted Omakase Sashimi Plate (3 pieces each) or Single Pax (2 pieces each) — both priced at S$38. That’s a steal!220 Orchard Road, Mid point, #B1-08, Singapore 238852

YukiDon sees a surge of business growth and has 2 locations — Bishan (opening on 16 Sep 2023) and their flagship outlet in Woodlands. Although their prices are fairly steep for hawker food, their quality certainly makes up for it. While their Salmon Mentaiyaki Don (S$13.90) is touted as the most popular and most worth item on the menu, I was drawn to the Ebi Fry Don (S$8.90). Whether your preference lies for a chunky salmon slab or large snappy prawns, both seafood are dressed in a blanket of torched mentaiko sauce. Screams!Meat lovers, do not fret. The most expensive beef dish goes to the Truffle Yakiniku Steak (S$14.90) which is presented in a beautiful assembly. The Japanese rice is dressed with a sweet yet savoury marinade used to season the beef slices. "

In 2012, this program was expanded to include ready-to-eat/ready-to-cook processed Thai food.It’s not easy to get this prestigious award. The Royal Thai Government takes the entire restaurant into consideration and assesses its food, hospitality and ambience. Chefs must also have been trained to prepare bona fide Thai cuisine. Inspections, strict guidelines and training ensure that this endorsement is constantly up-to-date.When I mean seal of approval, I literally mean it— each approved eatery is awarded with an actual certificate of authenticity which you can look for onsite. It’s usually pasted as a decal, though some restaurants also choose to frame up the actual certificate. That’s how you know if the restaurant you’re dining at serves legitimate Thai food. Based on its authentic Thai food, decorations and service excellence, the restaurants are each given a certificate, which are divided into a total of four categories. In Singapore, three categories are applicable: Thai SELECT Signature, Thai SELECT Classic and Thai SELECT Casual.At the time of writing, 1,301 overseas restaurants have received this distinguished award. We’ve rounded up 11 authentic Thai SELECT-endorsed restaurants in Singapore so that you can dine to your heart’s delight, knowing that these places serve the real deal. Nestled along Purvis Street is Yhingthai Palace, an authentic Thai restaurant that was founded in 1993 by a couple passionate about Thai cuisine. This impressive restaurant specialises in Thai and Thai-Chinese cuisine, with a heavy emphasis on the freshness, quality and authenticity of all its dishes. "

This is no surprise as roughly 3/4 of the population here have Chinese ancestry. Chinese cuisine is also quite diverse – with regional subspecialties such as Teochew, Cantonese, Shanghainese and in the local context, even the Singaporean Chinese culinary style. Chinese food is so much more than your sweet and sour pork, dimsum or Peking duck. Thus, it is difficult to pinpoint exactly which is the best Chinese restaurant in Singapore. That being said, if you expand it to a list of about a dozen or so establishments – you will find some commonly cited names and that is what I aim to show here. This list is not ranked in order but you will find establishments which are usually regarded as among the outstanding Chinese restaurants in Singapore, catering to all sorts of budgets. This will also be a dynamic list – with restaurants added and even removed, depending on ever-changing menus as well as other deserving establishments that pop up in the scene.Table of Contentsman fu yuanThe place: The look of an upscale Chinese restaurant can’t get any more conventional than what you see at Man Fu Yuan. If you look at the InterContinental Singapore as a whole with its bright modern Peranakan motifs or even the snazzy Ash & Elm which can be directly viewed from the 2nd floor Chinese restaurant, the rather modest and homely interiors of Man Fu Yuan brings to mind a simpler time.Best dishes to order: Suckling Pig, Deep-fried Lobster, Slow-braised Pork RibsPros:"

The fact that it’s (sorta) healthy, thanks in no small part to the generous use of legumes, yet packed with flavours, is a big part of its allure. When the mood strikes for great food and a Mediterranean affair, here are the places to go to.Sea-to-table dining is made possible at Alati, a Greek food haven that’s worth its salt. Their seafood selection is unbelievably fresh, flown in thrice a week directly from the Aegean sea. Our usual order includes their grilled greek octopus with balsamic onions and confit tomatoes and the grilled European seabass. They also serve a killer traditional Greek salad with feta cheese, capers, and kalamata olives drizzled with extra virgin olive oil.This rooftop CBD restaurant may impress with their views, but it’s the food you’ll keep coming back for. From the standout Hokkaido scallop crudo served with curry oil, to some of the best meat and seafood mains in town, choices are aplenty here. The many (and we mean many) vegetarian and gluten-free options are just icing on the cake. Head out to the sky bar after dinner and soak in the night vibe.Chef-Owner Bjorn Shen’s Artichoke prides itself as the least authentic (yes, you read that right) Middle Eastern restaurant around. Ironically, its food is fun, flavourful and utterly fabulous. Order funky dishes like the falafel-crumbed fried chicken or cuttlefish shawarma. Then wash your meal down with a drink from their sizeable list.This Tiong Bahru establishment serving authentic Greek cuisine has a loyal following. From savoury appetisers and dips to meat and seafood platters plus premium specialities, Bakalaki never disappoints. Many of the ingredients used and products (like their fragrant and smooth olive oil) are imported directly from Greece.Not a fan of Greek food? A trip to Blu Kouzina might change your mind. Nestled amongst Dempsey Hill’s enclave of F&B establishments, the family-owned restaurant whips up tasty plates of souvlaki, mousaka and keftedes, prepared with their organic extra virgin olive oil from Messinia, Greece. Don’t miss out on their chicken, beef, or lamb kebabs and staple mezedes like the dolmades with rice, dill, mint and tzatziki. lamb kebab"

I’m sure many share the same adoration towards the cuisine as I do, for reasons that are unique and valid in ways of their own. This is why I’m bringing you 15 authentic Korean restaurants in Singapore that are run by Koreans so you don’t have to look too far the next time you find yourself longing for legitimate jjajangmyeon that hits the spot. A Korean friend of mine recently recommended Jangsu Korean BBQ to me; I hadn’t heard of the place either. Initially located along Teck Chye Terrace, they have since moved to 7 Circular Road and is expected to reopen on 1 Mar 2023.It starts with an ahjumma’s greeting as I step into Jangsu—their first customer of the day, as it turns out. Jjampong (S$15) and Bibim Naengmyeon (S$13) are must-orders in my books whenever I visit Korean establishments, while a friend of mine swears by Jangsu’s barbecued meats. We settle on the Soy Sauce Chicken (S$19) and Chilli Pork Belly (S$22), both to be cooked right at our tables atop a hot grill. If you’re intending to go all out for a full-bodied meal, BBQ sets of various tiers are available as well. Set A (S$68) comprises beef loin, beef sirloin, beef top blade, steamed egg and a choice of soup. For more affordable options, Set B and Set C go at S$57 each, both entitling you to beef sirloin, pork shoulder, pork belly, chicken, steamed egg and a choice of soup; with the only difference between the two lying in the chicken’s sauce—soy or spicy.    7 Circular Road, Singapore 049363

We’re certainly blessed in Singapore as an increasing number of Vietnamese establishments are setting up shop at hawker stalls and various eateries around the island.I’ve set off on an empty stomach and embarked on a little adventure to scout for the 10 best Vietnamese food places in Singapore that will blow your mind. Well, I hope they blow yours too!Egg coffee and bo ne (Vietnam’s version of steak and eggs) are seldom sold in Vietnamese establishments around Singapore, but Le Cafe Vie5 located at Upper Paya Lebar sells both.No visit to Le Cafe Vie5 is complete without ordering their Sizzling Beef with Loaf (S$18.90). I remember having this dish at a back alley on the streets of Ho Chi Minh and it has since been etched in my mind. It consists of a petite-sized baguette, sunny-side up, beef slices, two meatballs, pork pate, a piece of sausage, and a dollop of butter served on a hot skillet.You can also try the HP Prawn Noodle Soup (S$12) which is originated from one of the chef’s hometown (HP = Haiphong). It comes with 2 large prawns accompanied by a few smaller ones, mushrooms, pork cubes, black fungus, with garnishes of spring onions and laksa leaves.My personal favourite whenever I visit the place is the Grilled Pork Noodle (S$11)— you should try it.To finish off your meal, invigorate your senses with a cup of Coco Coffee (S$6.50) or Egg-Whisked Coffee (S$6.50 for hot)."

https://www.lifestyleasia.com/sg/dining/food/11-best-restaurants-to-eat-middle-eastern-food-in-singapore/,11 best restaurants to eat Middle Eastern food in Singapore,,"Middle Eastern food may not be on the minds of most diners here, but it should be. The dishes explode with vibrancy and textures, and the cuisine is a window into the region’s rich cultures. For a look at this supremely underrated fare, here are 11 best restaurants to eat Middle Eastern food in Singapore.The Middle East stretches from northwest Asia to the top right corner of the African continent, spanning countries like Iran, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Lebanon. It also steps slightly into Europe via Turkey.While each culture has its own tweaks and names for certain dishes, there are threads that weave them together: a deft use of spice, a focus on grilling, and the injection of energy into humble ingredients.For protein, lamb, chicken, beef, and cheese frequently show up, while vegetables like cucumber, onion, tomato, and eggplant appear regularly. Spices like caraway, cinnamon, cardamom, and clove bring flavours. Chickpea, pomegranate, pistachio, and dates offer textures.These ingredients arrive at various moments of a meal. Vegetables are transformed into hot and cold dishes called mezze, ranging from dips like hummus and baba ganoush to tabbouleh salad. Meats, slow cooked or skewered and charcoal grilled, make up the mains. Carbs are usually flatbread or rice, and desserts typically involve some form of pastry.In Singapore, places like Shabestan and Alaturka serve cuisines from specific regions, while Dubai Shawarma and Marmaris offer an affordable introduction. Fat Prince and Artichoke take the contemporary route, and Safiya lets diners enjoy the food at home. Read on more for 11 best restaurants to eat Middle Eastern food in Singapore.Modern Middle Eastern eatery Fat Prince has a new chef de cuisine, Simon Bell, who’s reinterpreting traditional favourites by making them lighter and fresher. Chilled Australian oysters, for example, are topped with saffron, coriander cress, and charred oranges, while the pit smoked aubergine comes with harissa deconstructed into its fresh forms.For the mains, pit roasted pumpkin is elevated with fresh herbs and lime, and tagine spiced chicken is cooked longer to intensify its flavours. During dessert, opt for the olive oil sorbet with pink peppercorns for a fruity, creamy high.Fat Prince is open from 11.30am to 3pm and 5.30pm to 10.30pm from Mondays to Sundays.Safiya is a new takeaway and delivery concept by Shangri-La Singapore hotel. The name means ‘purity’ in Arabic, and head chef Ara Sayegh aims to deliver on that promise through authentic and traditional dishes, some from his family’s recipes.For mezze, order warak enab (rice and vegetables wrapped in a grape leaf) and kibbe krass, a type of bulgur wheat croquette stuffed with lamb and pine nuts. The lamb kebabs main is a winner: smoky, spicy, and deeply complex. Finish your meal off with meghli, a smooth Lebanese rice pudding crowned with grated coconut and mixed nuts."

We love a good meze spread (small shared plates), shwarmas, and smoky grilled veggies and meats, so we set off on a mission to track down the best Middle Eastern restaurants in Singapore. These are nine of the most outstanding places we found where you can grab delish eats from the Mediterranean region and beyond.

Start with enticing appetisers like the spicy tomato salad and minty, yoghurty haydari dip with ekmek bread, then move onto mains like the lamb and beef kofte, musakka chicken with eggplant, potato, and cheese, or the Turkish pide, which is similar to an Italian pizza.

Arkadas CafeThe entrance to Arkadas Cafe is like a hidden oasis with lush greenery on all sides and a waterfall cascading down one wall. The interior is a little less inspiring with just simple chairs and tables, but that’s ok because the food is supremely tasty and authentically Turkish. Chef Mustafa was once the personal chef to the Turkish ambassador, so you can expect quality traditional dishes like yarprak sarma with rice in vine leaves, chicken doner kebabs, and beef musakka. Arkadas Cafe, 1 Fusionopolis View, #01-02, Sandcrawler,, Singapore 138577. p. +65 6466 9918.

However, the Muslim-friendly kitchen has already left its (scorch) mark on a long line of satiated diners. The locality is superb, and the restaurant rubs shoulders with names like the Mandala Club and Ms. Maria & Mr. Singh.When you step into the heritage shophouse, the decor is bright and tight. 4-seater tables are straddled by brown chairs on one side and blue ones on the other. Intriguing art adorns the walls. I find the bar at the corner on the smaller side but it’s not like I’m some big drinker, so *shrugs*.We visited Casa Brazilia for Dinner (S$79 per person), which comes with Starters and Compliments. ‘Dinner’ is an understatement, though— Casa Brazilia’s indulgent version involves a free flow of barbequed meat for a 1.5 hour dining experience.We’d cross that bridge when we got to it; first, the Starters.My first bite at Casa Brazilia was of Goat Cheese Crostini, and it was exquisite. I’m not talking about just the marvellous fig-topped presentation, which I loved. The Crostini  possessed a pleasant crunch from toasted bread, which paired dreamily with the creamy goat cheese that glided smoothly across my tongue. Garnished with herbs and spices, it was the ideal setup for the night to come.I’ve always enjoyed Empanadas, the wonderful little Latin American pastries.

https://www.asiaone.com/lifestyle/get-taste-home-cooked-african-food-singapore,Get a taste of home-cooked African food in Singapore,11 Sept 2022 — ,"Sometime last year, the word “fufu” entered my vocabulary when British actor Idris Elba appeared in a video inviting people to bid on a date night with him for charity. “We can order whatever your heart desires,” he drawled in his deep, buttery accent. “Pepper soup and fufu. That’s an African dish where you pound the yams. And you know what? I’ll let you pound my yams,” he whispers.I have been thinking about fufu ever since.Fast forward a year and fufu finally appears on my Instagram feed. A home-based business out in Jurong West called Pham African Kitchen had started dishing out exotic-sounding food with traditional sides like fufu and fried plantains, and I was here for it.I punched in my order for the egusi soup with fufu and chicken stew with rice and fried plantains. They were so delicious, I ordered the ewa agoyin (bean stew) and seafood okra soup two days later.By this time, my food-writer brain had burning questions about those dishes. Which part of Africa are they from? What are the histories behind them? What type of chillies do they use to impart this damn-shiok heat?Who better to ask than the people who made the food, right? Except, when contacted, they declined my questions the good old-fashioned way: With blue-ticking. Why liddat, Pham?Happily, my editor agreed we should write about the food anyway. After all, it’s not every day you get to eat home-cooked African food in Singapore, amirite? So, first things first: Fufu.In the absence of information from the people who made my maiden fufu, I could only turn to one irrefutably reliable source: Google. Here’s what I found: According to the New York Times, fufu is a staple in Nigeria, where it is made from crushed and fermented cassava; and Ghana, where it is made with a combination of starchy ingredients like cassava and green plantains. Traditionally formed by pounding the ingredients to a sticky mush, fufu is now commonly made by cooking the finely milled flours of these roots or tubers in hot water over a stove.Pham’s fufu came as a large mochi-like orb wrapped in clingfilm. It tasted like a mix of pounded rice and tapioca – plain, comforting, and a great canvas for tasty dishes with plenty of gravy.Fufu is meant to be eaten communally and with clean hands. Customarily, every diner pinches off a piece of fufu and rolls it into a small ball before making an indentation with their thumb to form something like an abacus seed. This is then used to ferry a bit of stew or sauce to mouth. Fufu isn’t meant to be chewed. Part of a food group called “swallows” in Africa, you are meant to simply swallow small morsels which helps maintain the feeling of fullness throughout the day. I instinctively chewed my fufu and I am happy to report that I was still full throughout the day.The egusi stew, which Pham makes using chicken as the star protein, is exactly the type of robustly flavoured dish that begs for a bit of fufu. The staple West African soup takes its name from the seeds of sundried egusi melons that flavour and thicken the broth. It had a lovely rounded saltiness from some sort of smoked dried fish. Imagine minced giam her in a thick, very spicy chicken stew. Shiok!"

https://sethlui.com/best-cafes-brunch-singapore/,21 best brunch spots in Singapore,,"An eternal question for foodies: What are the best cafes in Singapore?Cafes in Singapore are a dime a dozen. And as we all know, brunch is becoming a staple in most of our daily Singapore lifestyles nowadays, allowing for a late morning sleep-in, especially during weekends. We all could use a great cafe near us.So we said, “Hey, let’s find the best cafes that serve brunch!”, which led to this article.A huge aficionado of the breakfast-lunch combo myself, with its plethora of egg dishes, I often find myself spoilt for choice when it comes to choosing brunch places to dine from. There are just too many! But here at SethLui.com, we managed to narrow it down to 21 best cafes serving brunch in Singapore that are definitely worth the trip for a fully satiated stomach this weekend.This 1st is a first. In all these years, we have never had a vegan or vegetarian contender beat out all the ‘regular’ competition and garner top spot in a listicle. But then, Cultivate is no ordinary cafe.There is no better place to shatter the popular myth that vegan and vegetarian food is inherently inferior than the opulence of Cultivate’s colonial setting. Some part of the amazing experience originates in the wonderfully creative presentation of each dish. While the visual artistry draws you in, the exquisite flavours coaxed skilfully out of the organic, vegan, plant-based, gluten-free, GMO-free ingredients orchestrate the real magic.I am still stunned that I had brunch without eggs, meat and dairy and did not miss them at all! Perhaps sourcing every organic ingredient from small and family-owned farms has something to do with it.My pick of the mains is the Smoked Onion and Asparagus Risotto with Grated Lemon Rind (S$40). In the absence of dairy, the risotto is so light that it feels like it may float away. Every mouthful rewards you with the richness of roasted Italian asparagus that magnifies the other ingredients."

There’s no questioning Singaporeans’ love for fast food – be it KFC’s Hot & Crispy Chicken or McDonald’s McSpicy – these chains have filled our bellies with guilty pleasures for as long as we can remember.But if you ever question exactly how long, you’ll be surprised to learn that fast food has been around pretty much since our independence. Some have come and gone, some came back while some underwent massive revamps. These longest-surviving fast food chains in Singapore may look vastly different then and now, but they’re still dear to our hearts.Image adapted from: Yoshinoya Singapore via FacebookIt’s always refreshing when a fast food chain that isn’t fried chicken comes around, and that’s exactly what Yoshinoya brought to Singapore when it opened its first outlet at Ngee Ann City back in 1997. The Japanese chain serves rice bowls, udon, and curry rice among other dishes that are guaranteed to warm your belly. Lately, the brand has been reinventing itself with a new concept menu as well as renovated outlets island-wide. The Yoshinoya-of-old felt small and vintage but the stores today are much more spacious with more colourful meals, including new items like tonkatsu sets and ramen.Image adapted from: Subway Singapore via FacebookThe world is no stranger to Subway, with the chain boasting over 40,000 stores in over 100 countries. Subway captured the attention of Singaporeans back in 1996 by offering healthier alternatives to typical fast food. Since then, they’ve been a go-to for when you need a quick sandwich – or a delicious cookie.Most of us should be able to remember their “Fresh Fit” campaign over a decade ago where they sent fitness ambassadors to perform random acts of fitness at their outlets. With the 50 outlets still here today, they’ve still managed to keep themselves fresh.Image adapted from: MOS Burger Singapore via FacebookThe story behind MOS Burger is an inspiring one. It all started with a Japanese man with a dream, working in an American burger joint, who returned home, made his own style of Japanese hamburgers and spread it around the world – including Singapore in 1993. The famous rice burger was a hit, and still is today. In 2019, they even created the MOS Chilli Crab Burger to satisfy local taste buds."

This article contains a complete list of Michelin starred restaurants in Singapore. The 2016 edition was the first edition of the Michelin Guide to Singapore to be published. At the time, Singapore was the first country in Southeast Asia to have Michelin starred restaurants and stalls, and was one of the four states in general in Asia along with Japan and the special administrative regions (SAR) of Hong Kong and Macau.[1][2]
In the 2016 edition, two hawker stalls, Hill Street Tai Hwa Pork Noodle and Hong Kong Soya Sauce Chicken Rice and Noodle, became the first Asian street stalls to be awarded Michelin stars.[1] Hong Kong Soya Sauce Chicken Rice & Noodle's most notable dish and also the country's national dish, chicken rice, also became the cheapest Michelin-star meal in the world at S$2 (US$1.60) a serving.[3]
In September 2019, Odette and Les Amis were awarded the three stars award. In September 2021, Zen was awarded the three stars award, resulting in Singapore having three Michelin three-starred restaurants for the first time since the award's inception.

The ultimate hallmark of culinary excellence, the Michelin guide uses five criteria to assess these restaurants: mastery of technique, quality of ingredients, value for money, chef's personality and consistency—so you know they really are the best of the best. But with so many Michelin star restaurants in Singapore, how do you know where to begin?To help you out, Urban List has rounded up what we think are the best Michelin star restaurants in Singapore. From starched white tablecloths to hip barbeque joints, these are the ones we recommend checking out first.
Image credit: Thevar | SuppliedWith two Michelin stars to its name, you know you’re going to be in for a culinary treat at modern Indian restaurant Thevar. Helmed by Chef Mano Thevar, the menu draws inspiration from his Indian roots alongside the use of seasonal ingredients and modern European techniques.Highlights include the crispy pork jowl, which comes wrapped in betel leaf and topped with a coconut-sambal aioli, and the pork ribs glazed with medjool dates, which you should order with a side of berry pulao (long-grained rice cooked with garam masala, lemongrass and pandan, as well as pistachios and cranberries for added texture). The Chettinad chicken also deserves a special mention—think of it like an Indian taco filled with delicious chicken curry.
Image credit: Buona TerraNestled among the row of colonial buildings along Scotts Road, Buona Terra is a one Michelin-starred contemporary, fine dining Italian restaurant helmed by Chef Denis Lucchi. The menu showcases Northern Italy’s robust flavours alongside prized artisanal ingredients and the Italian recipes Chef Denis grew up with.We recommend the pigeon with beetroot, pear and Moscato sauce. A variation to the restaurant’s signature dish, the ten-day dry-aged pigeon is cured with a blend of spices, then marinated with olive oil and grappa before being char-grilled over binchotan with a glazing of Italian acacia honey. It’s delicately sweet and not overly gamey.
Image credit: Cloudstreet | Supplied#26 on Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants in 2023 and awarded two stars in the Michelin Guide 2022 and 2023, Cloudstreet is the result of chef Rishi Naleendra’s vision to create a dining room that exists on the philosophy of true hospitality."

Had a boozy good time with my friends, would definitely come back again for the food and experience.Amazing Italian food and the service was great. Go for the set dinner menu 4 course for $88 which is quite worth it. My personal favourite is the Pizza con prosciutto ham which was really generous. The cheese platter and desserts were great too, as we got to try a variety of desserts based on the chef’s selection. The best buffet in Singapore.

Went for lunch and had the shiokase, which was fantastic - the seafood was fresh and had such a wonderful texture, with garnish and wasabi carefully portioned to give off what can only be described as the ultimate umami experience.
The truffle oyster with fish roe was fantastic, not overtly salty nor fishy. The crab and clam soup was also not salty but rich in flavor. Dessert was a wonderful red bean covered matcha ice cream with mochi.
The server was very polite, explained all the dishes to us and was very attentive, and overall we enjoyed the experience tremendously.

There are high bar stool seating with playful vintage displays with zinc roof sheet container like backdrop.  A yard with fruit trees such as papaya and banana trees, herb garden with Thai basil, pandan leaves & lush hedge alongside the outdoor table with funky neon rope lights. There is also a retro neon sign that spells Happy Birthday for you to get some pictures for your special occasion with your love ones.The semi outdoor seating straddles between the indoor and outdoor seating, where u can enjoy both the outdoor greenery and indoor cool air. A very rare Thai restaurant with Kampong vibes complete with wrought iron swing and garden stone bench- great for photo taking. You can also find similar garden swings at their King George Avenue and Orchard Central outlet for photo taking!At Soi 47 Thai Food, one of their signature dish to order are their fish dishes, be it the Deep Fried Seabass with Thai Chilli sauce or this Steamed Seabass with Thai Lime Sauce ($19.80). A whole good size seabass is butterflied and steamed separately before pouring on their signature Thai lime sauce gravy atop. Served simmering on a stove, the seabass meat is tender but firm enough to be picked up with chopsticks. Gravy has a zesty tone and the heat from the chilli kicks in shortly after.Deep Fried Seabass with Baby Garlic ($19.80) is a whole fried crispy seabass topped with small cloves of baby garlic. The garlic clove with skin on are fried till crispy and disintegrates in the mouth with much chewing needed. Instead of the usually pungent overwhelming garlic flavours, the baby garlic offers a nutty and sweet flavour.The fried garlic are mini garlic oil pops which releases the flavours when you bite into them with the lightly coated, mildly saline flaky fish meat held together by a golden crispy skin.Deep Fried Seabass with Special Thai Chilli ($19.80) are like fish penyet where the fish is butterflied and fried till super crunchy. Texture wise is like fish meat encased in a crunchy crust, best enjoyed with the spicy & sweet Thai chilli sauce.Crispy Chicken Skin ($5.50) is one of the must try finger food. These are chicken skin that are scrapped clean of fats and deep fried till crunchy like a chicken skin cracker. Has an addictive umami flavour, loud crunch and easily disintegrates in the mouth on first bite."

https://ordinarypatrons.com/2021/12/14/muchos-mexican-restaurant-clarke-quay-review/,Muchos Mexican Restaurant at Clarke Quay Singapore,14 Dec 2021 — ,"The Ordinary PatronsThe Ordinary PatronsWe headed to the Muchos Mexican Restaurant for a weekday lunch at Clarke Quay Singapore recently. The popular entertainment and f & b enclave along the Singapore Riverwass quiet and almost deserted, which makes it a perfect location to have lunch during this pandemic period.Like many f & b establishments at Clarke Quay, Muchos was quiet when we were there for lunch on a weekday. In fact there was only one other group dining there. Social distancing was not a problem. They were 10 metres away. The restaurant is large and spacious. The decor is practical and comfortable.Here is a picture of the Muchos Mexican happy hours list. The happy hour lasts a long time.  We were tempted by the one-for-one deal to order two Tiger Pints for the price of one ($14)!Some restaurants have set lunch menus to attract diners during the quieter part of the day. Muchos @ Clarke Quay has a 3 course set lunch that costs $15++.  We did not try it that day as we had specific Mexican dishes on our minds.The minced beef nachos ($22) started our Mexican meal at Clarke Quay on a positive note. The beef toppings were meaty with a nice blend of flavours.By comparison, the chicken tacos ($15) were competent but not so outstanding. But still, anything crispy such as the hard taco shells with some form of meat content will also go well with ice cold beer. All the food that we tried at Muchos Mexican Restaurant at Clarke Quay were perfect companions for beer.Our highlight of lunch was the beef fajitas. We ordered the upsized version  –  beef fajitas supreme ($60). The beef steak slices and various vegetable were delicious. Eaten wrapped up in the tortilla (not captured in the photo), this reminded us of Peking duck.  This was a filling dish and can be an adequate dish for two persons.It has been a while since we had a Mexican meal. Muchos at Clarke Quay was a good choice to remind us of the rich flavours of Mexican food and how well they go with beer. Especially at a place with long happy hours!You can watch the Youtube video of our lunch at Muchos below."

https://finestservices.com.sg/blog/mediterranean-food/,10 Best Places for Mediterranean Food in Singapore [2023],Looking for the best places for mediterranean food in Singapore? Check out our top recommendations when your having your cravings.,"Singapore can be a real melting pot for different cuisines from around the world, and this includes Mediterranean Food. From the many hawker stalls to the fanciest Singaporean restaurants, there is no shortage of supply for Mediterranean Food lovers in Singapore, but it can’t always hurt to know where to look. So strap yourselves in and get your herbs and spices ready, because we’re taking a deep dive into the best Mediterranean Food restaurants that food has to offer.Mediterranean food originates from countries near the Mediterranean sea such as Spain, Morocco, Greece, Italy, and many others. Most foods of this cuisine are distinguished by their generous helpings of herbs and spices that bombard your taste buds with flavors that are both familiar and unfamiliar at the same time. Kebabs, gyros, pasta, and other such dishes make up this cuisine, and they are all as filling as they sound.Now without further ado, let’s grab a mouthful and begin this list.Speaking of accessible Mediterranean Food, why not start in Singapore’s signature hawker centers? Enter HaPiHa, a hawker stall manned by Albanian national and self-taught chef Klevis Shima. Klevis was once an illegal immigrant turned hawker stall owner after seeing an alarming lack of Mediterranean cuisine in the hawker centers of Singapore, and the rest is history. HaPiHa is an Albanian word that translates to “eat-drink-eat”, and oh boy does this hawker stall have that in spades.From Italian pizza to Greek Kebabs and dips, this stall has everything that you could want, including desserts. Each dish is expertly made by Klevis himself from scratch, with ingredients sourced from the origin countries themselves, giving this food the stamp of authenticity. This hawker food stall takes authentic Mediterranean food and puts it within reach without skimping on the quality.A stall that stood out among others in terms of cuisine and great service. Order was easy and the server was very patient. Ordered the hummus and the chicken kebab on pita bread with honey mustard sauce. It had been a while since I had hummus and this was good. The chicken kebab was the flavorful and very decent serving size. The mix of green, meat, and sauces was balanced and tasted refreshing. Certainly worth a revisit to try other items on the menu. – Kendrick WeeIf you’re looking for an authentic Greek experience, then Blu Kouzina is the restaurant for you. Blu Kouzina was established in 2010 by the owner and executive chef Effie Tsarikis, born from her vision of serving home-cooked meals that make you feel like you’re in Greece. When it comes to Mediterranean food, the taste is often largely dependent on the quality of ingredients, and Blu Kouzina has the highest quality ingredients you could find.  Their dishes use virgin olive oil sourced straight from their own olive grove in Messinia, Greece, giving customers a dining experience that transports them to the Greek countryside.Blu Kouzina offers a wide variety of dishes, each catered for the meal. If you’re looking to start your day with a Mediterranean breakfast, why not order their authentic Greek sandwiches and sausage rolls? Their selection of meals gets even larger come lunch and dinner time when pasta and other fresh Mediterranean entrees are served. These meals can also be paired with some of the best wine that Mediterranean countries can offer, sourced straight from the vineyard.Our favorite Greek restaurant. The 3 dips are recommended with a choice of the dips. I would go with a spicy dip and a choice of 2 others. The meat platter was also very good with the lamb chops being very tender. The place is very busy during weekends and you need to book ahead. The food is great and the ambiance of the restaurant is welcoming. – Lionel TanEver wanted to try authentic Greek seafood but never had the chance to take a plane to the Mediterranean seaside? Well, worry not, because you can now taste the salty freshness of the Mediterranean sea in Singapore! Meet Alati, a restaurant in Singapore offering the freshest Greek-style seafood you may ever taste. Named after the Greek word for salt, this restaurant prides itself in its quality ingredients including seafood straight from the Aegean Sea.If the blue and white interior of this restaurant isn’t enough to transport you to the Mediterranean seaside, then the dishes surely will! Alati offers Greek seafood dishes such as Octopus Souvlaki, Lahanodolmades, Bakaliaros Skordalia, and much more. If you prefer your meals on the meatier side then worry not, Alati has got you covered with its Beef Souvlaki, lamb cutlets, Moussaka, and need I go on? With its extensive menu, it might be time to visit Alati and look through the menu yourself."

The Food With more than thirty dishes on the menu, options are varied though I only had the beef pho in mind. I went for the Pho Dac Biet (S$8.9), a special noodle soup that comes with slices of beef, beef balls and the surprise is there even an egg with it. I love the broth of the pho, very hearty and it doesn’t taste like there’s much MSG added. Go for this dish if you like more variety of ingredients in your noodles.
Alternatively, the classic option is to go for the Pho Nam (S$7.9), a well-done beef noodle soup that is simple and it can’t go wrong. The broth here is cleaner in flavour as compared to the Pho Dac Biet and I actually much preferred this. Simply pho dish, with tender slices of beef and a comforting broth. I was very satisfied.
The Rantee tried the Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gio (S$9.9), a dry noodle dish with grilled pork and rice noodle. It is quite interesting as I have never tried this dish before. Mix the ingredients together, and the taste of the dish is close to a salad as it is strangely quite refreshing.Dishes to share include the Cha Gio (S$8), classic Vietnamese spring rolls which are so good. The texture is crispy and the fillings are so tasty. I couldn’t stop at one."
https://ordinarypatrons.com/2023/03/10/long-phung-vietnamese-restaurant/,Long Phung Vietnamese Restaurant,10 Mar 2023 — ,"The Ordinary PatronsThe Ordinary PatronsLong Phung is a very popular Vietnamese restaurant in Joo Chiat, known for serving reasonably priced authentic Vietnamese food. It has a new outlet in Chinatown.The bustling Joo Chiat neighbourhood is home to hip cafes as well as eateries serving cheap and good food like roti prata, nasi padang, vadai, po piah and bak chang. There are also more than a few Peranakan and Vietnamese restaurants in Joo Chiat. Long Phung is perhaps the most popular Vietnamese restaurant there.Long Phung Vietnamese Restaurant is located in one of the old shophouses along Joo Chiat Road, right next to a big public carpark. The place has the feel of a streetside restaurant in Vietnam.  The furniture is functional and the decor may be described as a little frilly with plastic flowers hung here and there.With Vietnamese staff and many Vietnamese speaking customers, and Vietnamese background music playing in the restaurant, diners in Long Phung Joo Chiat can feel like they are in a restaurant in Ho Chi Minh City.The new outlet of Long Phung Vietnamese Restaurant in Chinatown opened in early 2023. Located in a shophouse at the junction of New Bridge Road and Smith Street, Long Phung Chinatown is smaller than Long Phung Joo Chiat. It looks like a fairly typical casual dining restaurant we find in Singapore malls.The menu of Long Phung Vietnamese Restaurant is the same in the Joo Chiat outlet and the Chinatown branch.The specialty is Pho but Long Phung offers much more than just the popular rice noodles in flavourful broth. A wide variety of dishes are on the menu, including pork chop rice, stir fry cockles, spring rolls, PhnomPenh Noodles and various other one dish meals and side dishes. Pictures of a few sample pages of the menu are below. More pages of the menu can be seen on the Long Phung Facebook Page.We tried the Pho Dat Biet ($11.90), Pho Nam ($10.50) and  Pho Heo ($10.50) at Long Phung.Pho Dat Biet (which according to the menu means special noodle soup) was a version of pho that included beef slices, beef brisket, meatballs and egg. The broth made by simmering beef bones and various herbs and spices was rich and flavourful. The beef slices were tender and the noodles had a nice texture. Everything combined well for a delectable bowl of noodles with homely tatse."
https://www.thewackyduo.com/2022/01/long-phung-vietnamese-restaurant-review.html,Long Phung Vietnamese Restaurant Review : Joo Chiat ...,22 Jan 2022 — ,"Long Phung is a Vietnamese restaurant in Joo Chiat.
  Before Covid-19, there are certain parts of Joo Chiat that one does not often
  wander too often due to the presence of KTV bars and the rowdy nature of the
  crowd. 

  In fact, Joo Chiat had been seen as a problematic area where
  new bars, nightclubs and KTV are not allowed.

  Ever since Covid-19, the bars had shuttered their doors. While the bars are
  slowly disappearing from this road, eateries had popped up in their place.
  While the new eateries are gaining popularity, the older ones get a boost as
  new customers such as couples and families started exploring this stretch.

  Long Phung is one of the older restaurants on this stretch. Serving authentic
  Vietnamese food such as Pho noodles, Cha Gio ( Vietnamese spring rolls) and
  more, one could savour a real taste of Vietnam right in the heart of the East.
  Parking is easy as there is a big carpark located just behind the restaurant.

  The place had mixed reviews ranging from good and authentic to ""I will not go
  again"". As a result of the reviews, we were sceptical. Nonetheless, we tried
  out a few dishes and was happy with our choices. 

Chả giò (Vietnamese Spring
      Roll) $14



This is a must-try dish. We like the texture and the taste of both the
    fried and the non fried versions of the Vietnamese spring roll. The crab
    sticks are good too. You need to dip in the sauce provided to get the full
    taste of it.

Cánh Gà chiên nước mắm (Stir Fried Chicken) $14

I feel that Middle Eastern food is quite underrated in Singapore.That said, I’d love to show you where to try this cuisine. Sorted in alphabetical order, here are 9 places for you to try Middle Eastern food.Helmed by Chef Bjorn Shen and having a cookbook of the same name, Artichoke is one of the cooler brunch spots in Singapore (it serves dinner too, by the way).Don’t expect mainstream eggs benedict and waffles because this place serves contemporary Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cuisine.The popular options include the Feta Burrata ($24, left) and Ful Madames ($16, right), both served with Turkish toast and Middle Eastern spices. I loved the garden basil relish on the Feta Burrata because it managed to combine really well with the veggies and toast.If you’re looking for some contemporary Middle Eastern bites with a chill ambience, Artichoke is a great place to try out.Artichoke: 161 Middle Rd, Singapore 188978 | Opening Hours: (Tues to Fri) 6.30pm – 10.30pm, (Sat) 11.30am – 3.30pm, 6.30pm – 10.30pm, (Sun) 11.30-3.30pm, Closed on Mondays| Tel: 6336 6949 | Facebook | WebsiteNamed after the capital of Lebanon, Beirut Grill is known for its authentic Lebanese pastries, delicious grilled kebabs and meats.While it is really hard to stand out amongst other Middle Eastern restaurants in the Arabian quarter, Beirut Grill offers unique experiences such as belly dance performances that will probably make you feel like you’re overseas."

https://houseofperanakan.com.sg/,House of Peranakan,,"Reminisce a culinary heritage at House of Peranakan Group of restaurants where we have been proud bearers of the Peranakan culinary tradition for over three decades. Established in Katong in the 1980s, the House of Peranakan Group of restaurants is a pioneer in Nonya cuisine, managed by a pure Peranakan family for three generations.

Inspired by his mother’s culinary skills, Bob Seah wanted to share his family’s culinary culture with others. He established Peranakan Inn in the 1980s, one of the earliest Nonya restaurants in Singapore housed in a charming pre-war Peranakan shophouse built in 1937, which is still serving piping hot Nonya cuisine in claypots today.

A pioneer in the Peranakan food community, Bob created many Peranakan-inspired dishes such as Selar Sambal Fish stuffed with Rempah, Nonya Crayfish, Assam Prawns and Long Beans Sambal. He also introduced the concept of serving home-cooked Nonya food in claypots 30 years ago. Bob went on to establish several  award-winning House of Peranakan Cuisine restaurants at the former Negara Hotel, Singapore Tennis Centre and One George Street, and received accolades from Asian Wall Street Journal and The New York Times. 

Today, Bob still goes to the market daily and helms the kitchen.

https://therantingpanda.com/2022/04/24/food-review-katong-delights-at-figaro-street-rustic-under-the-radar-home-style-peranakan-restaurant-in-east-coast/,Food Review: Katong Delights At Figaro Street,,"Posted on April 24, 2022  by theRantingPanda  in FoodThe Place Figaro Street is alien to me and if not for Katong Delights, I probably would not have come across this quiet street in Singapore. A space which feels more like home than a restaurant, Katong Delights was an accidental discovery when I was searching for a casual Peranakan meal in the east. There are barely any reviews online, so I came with an open mind. The interior of Katong Delights is somewhat stuck in time. It is quite cluttered, and there are only two tables which makes walking in an impossible feat if you are thinking of an impromptu meal. The owners of Katong Delights also own a catering business, and this dedicated space feels like a passion project to me rather than a restaurant proper. Think table cloth and chairs from the 1970s, which add to the retro dining vibes.  The Food There are no visuals on the menu, though you can expect to find a good variety of Peranakan dishes at wallet-friendly prices. My meal started with some Nonya Otah Special (S$8.50) mackerel, a thick slab of mildly special Otah which uses generous portions of mackerel. A good starter for 2-3 diners to share. I like the Hee Peow Soup (S$16), also known as Nyonya fish maw soup. The portion size fits our table of four well, where the comforting soup is light yet delicious. You get slices of fish maw and meatballs. The Hae Cho (Prawn Rolls S$9.50) is a great starter as well if you are looking for an easy dish to share. It has a nice crispy texture and goes well with the accompanying sweet chilli sauce. One of my usual orders at Peranakan restaurants is Ayam Buah Keluak (S$16), and this version comes with two nuts by default and you can request for more nuts. A dish which takes much skills and time to exercise perfectly, the buah keluak here is not as flavourful as some others I have had before. The gravy and chicken though are not too bad. For the price, the Assam Fish Curry (S$16) is good value. You get a fresh flavour of the chunky fish meat soaked in the flavourful curry sauce which is not too rich, where the dish is best enjoyed with some white rice along with the Mixed Vegetable Curry (S$9). My least favourite dish is the Honey Plum Pork Rib (S$16). Not a dish gone bad per se, but the fried pork rib does not leave much of an impression and I am not fond of the honey plum coating as well. Rants Extremely limited tables where reservations are a must. "

Black sauced chicken thigh is also very fresh n crispy. Rice is fragrant but i prefer it to be of drier texture and a bigger serving will be better. Not expansive. Best of all no long ques. Will come back again.Good taste. Almost on par with Punggol Nasi Lemak. Heard they originated from the same group of folks. They increased their prices recently. For that price, there are a lot more optionCurrently my favorite Nasi Lemak in town. Chilli is nice and the rice is soft.

We got a wrong dish and makcik was so accommodating that she swapped it for us (right before the payment) with a bright smile. The casher and everyone else who worked there never failed to greet and asked us to enjoy our meal there, even when they just passed us by on the stairs.
I may forget how the food taste like tomorrow, but I'll never forget the warmth that people there showed to their customers. This is how any business should be run! Passed by this place for years and always wondered what the queue is about. I understand now!
First, it's air-conditioned to stay cool despite the spicy food . Next, the varieties are crazy. There are probably 50 different kind of dishes to choose from. Talking about spoilt for choices. Lastly, the flavours are as good as its prices. As the saying goes, cheap and good! Very good especially with the sambal chilli.
I'll be back.Not knowing their names but the usual this and that, the food are flavourful and really yummy.

https://eatbook.sg/peng-wang-claypot-geylang/,Peng Wang Claypot Cuisine Review: Malaysian Bak Kut ...,,"Filter By(Change?)I love Teochew bak kut teh and what it represents to Singapore, but there are times when I yearn for the Malaysian version—you know, the darker, more herbal variety, as well as its sister, dry bak kut teh. Peng Wang Claypot Cuisine, a newly-opened eatery in Geylang, seemed to arrive just as those cravings began to act up.A quick glance at its menu, though, and it becomes clear that Peng Wang offers so much more than just bak kut teh. We dropped by the eatery to see if the food tastes as good as it seemed on paper.Our first dish was, of course, the Soup Claypot Bak Kut Teh (from $9). Upon arriving, its powerful herbaceous aroma hit us right away, and a few stirs revealed a good variety of ingredients. There were slices of pork belly, meatballs, tau kee, some greens, and three pieces of pork ribs.Given that I was already craving Malaysia-style bak kut teh, the soup here just hit the spot. The herbal flavour was superb—it was simultaneously savoury and sweet, with a hint of bitterness that lent depth to the broth."

For those who don’t know, apom is a pancake with a soft, fluffy centre and thin, crispy edges. It is best accompanied by the two star condiments provided – red sugar and grated coconut.

It is topped with raw onions, green chilli and eggs to make it extra fulfilling. You also get a side of french loaf to eat alongside your Kacang Pool or to dip into the bean stew! A tip is to squeeze in some lime juice to add a bit of tanginess to the otherwise savoury dish!Hours: Mon – Sun (6:30am – 2pm)Far from the typical otak-otak we are accustomed to seeing nowadays that are smooth and solid, this place sells traditional otak-otak. What is the difference? There is no flour added and is made up mostly of coconut. There are also chunks of fish in every bite. However, because it is made up of more coconut, it carries a stronger coconut taste which may not be everyone’s cup of tea."

At Afandi Hawa and Family, their mee rebus is the real stuff, made from a good meaty stock thickened with sweet potatoes.Nice soft noodles served with tender beancurd with crispy skin, bathed in a balanced and flavourful sauce, with some sweetness, fermented soy bean flavour, and apparently made with prawn, flower crab, mutton, turmeric and potato puree etc.The Mee Soto is my personal favourite. A savoury Chicken broth best served piping hot - it gets too salty when cooled. Julaiha Muslim Restaurant is an Indian-Muslim eatery located along Macpherson road. They are open 24/7 so this makes a good supper spot to go if you're nearby! They are located somewhat in the middle of Tai Seng and Macpherson MRT station.The prata was fresh, unoily and carried with it a nice doughy fragrance, although it had only the faintest crisp. Nice, but I’m not sure that it is Food King Good.I will be back for the prata and, of cause, the Indian rojak!If I am craving for a good Nasi Ayam, this will be one of my choice in Singapore. We love the taste and texture of the marinated chicken meat. Besides the soup, every aspect of the dish was well-executed, especially the incredibly tender chicken and the fluffy basmati rice. While my personal favourite will always be non-crispy prata, I have come to realise that contrary to popular belief, food authenticity is relative. Overall, HJ Waliti HJ Mazuki is a good place to get your fix of Malay food."

Pagi Sore is a halal-certified eatery.One of the highest-rated Indonesian restaurants on this list is KULON, a bakmi specialist located along Bali Lane. For the uninitiated, bakmi is a dish comprising seasoned dry noodles, typically topped with fried wontons, beef bakso balls, minced meat, and bak choy, as well as sambal. KULON offers a huge bakmi selection, mostly priced under $10. We highly recommend their Bakmi Komplit ($13.80), served with all the trimmings, though their Bakmi Crispy ($8.80) is another crowd fave worth trying, as it comes with a whole fried chicken thigh that’s been marinated in spices. If you aren’t a fan of dry bakmi, the eatery also offers soupy Mie Bakso ($6.20).Read our KULON review."

Our favourite one to go to is 639 Loong Fatt Tau Sar Piah because it feels like you’re taking a step back into the 1960s. The wooden booths and marble table tops that have been there for decades add to the nostalgic charm of this place.Other than their sweet and savoury Tau Sar Piah ($0.90), which are still handmade by the uncles and aunties running the shop, do try their old-school Custard Puffs ($0.90 each) and Banana Cake ($1.10) for flavourful blasts from the past."

This joint has just been nominated for Best Cafe in Queenstown for its day offering, so we’re pumped the doors are now open in the evenings too.Co-owner and executive chef, Matt Tobin (of sister restaurant, Margo’s) and head chef Anton Walden are killing the game with a complete culinary adventure on offer—sweet and sour prawns and pineapple salsa, crispy duck nachos and a fresh green papaya salad to name drop a few.Pull up a seat inside the low-lit bistro or enjoy the heated garden courtyard, order a cheeky cocktail and get your evening grooving. Open Thursday to Sunday from 3pm until late. Image credit: The Sherwood | FacebookThere’s something special about dining at a restaurant and knowing that so much care goes into every dish well before it reaches the plate. The Sherwood is a restaurant at the heart of sustainable practice, and with a mad respect for nature not only does all of its produce come from the organic kitchen garden, local growers and producers but 100% of its organic waste is returned to the kitchen garden.The ever-so-creative seasonal menu offers flavours, colours and textures that reflect the current season, bringing the landscapes right outside the door to your plate. Designed to select a main course and add on a range of sides, we suggest bringing a few friends and trying as much as you possibly can or trusting the chef, you won’t regret either option.If you need a thirst quencher, the bar operates under zero-waste principles too, with 60% of wine bottled in-house—pretty darn cool may we add. Thoughtfulness goes well beyond the plate at Sherwood and if we had to keep eating at one place again and again this may have to be it."

The last time I travelled to Taipei, I stuffed my face silly with braised pork rice bowls, bubble tea, fried chicken, beef noodles and so many more delicious dishes. Not to mention the night markets (pre-COVID-19, at least), which were teeming with yummy local street food.While COVID-19 has certainly made it trickier for us to travel overseas nowadays, you’d be surprised by the number of Taiwanese restaurants, hawker stalls, bakeries and cafes in Singapore that dish out decent plates of Taiwanese cuisine. To start you off, here are 10 authentic Taiwanese eateries in Singapore where you can get your fix of Taiwanese food.Located within Dunman Food Centre, Lin’s Braised is helmed by a single lady, Eileen Lam, who has lived and worked across Asia. After being retrenched due to the pandemic, Eileen decided to bring one of Taiwan’s most iconic dishes to Singapore— lu rou fan, also known as braised pork rice.However, Eileen’s lu rou fan comes with a twist, as she knew she had to adapt the recipe to suit Singapore’s weather and local palate. After much R&D, she eventually decided to add local Hakka flavours into the lu rou fan, such as preserved vegetables and taupok.A must-try is Eileen’s Signature “Hakka” Braised Pork Rice (S$5.80), which came with preserved vegetables, braised pork, beancurd, taupok, egg and pearl rice. Impressively, all of the ingredients are painstakingly made in-house. Yes, including the preserved vegetables!I loved the hearty and comforting mix of flavours, which made this bowl of lu rou fan incredibly easy to eat. There was just enough braised gravy to drench the pearl rice— such that each bite had a good balance of sweet and savoury flavours while ensuring that the rice was not drowning in sauce.271 Onan Road, Dunman Food Centre, #02-29, Singapore 424768

https://eatbook.sg/international-dishes-singapore/,10 Unique Restaurants With Creative International Dishes ...,11 Dec 2020 — ,"Filter By(Change?)Unfortunately for those who love to travel, the current pandemic has left the majority of us stuck in Singapore. To fulfil that wanderlust, take a culinary tour around the city to explore unique international dishes we may not be familiar with. From Russian food, to fusion dishes and flame-grilled steaks, Singapore is a hotbed for foodies when it comes to global cuisines and international dishes if you know where to look.Operated by Russians, Dumplings.ru brings authentic Russian and Ukrainian comfort food to our little red dot. Start with a hearty bowl of Ukrainian Borscht Soup ($9.50), served piping hot and filled with chunks of pork, beetroot and more.They are best known for their colourful Dumplings Combo Platter ($19.90). While we are more familiar with dumplings like gyoza and guo tie, Dumplings.ru’s version isn’t quite the same. Expect chewier skin and bolder flavours, such as the green-hued Minty Ram, stuffed with chewy shreds of lamb and aromatic mint leaves.For something refreshing, try the Salted Herring Salad ($9.90), a typical salad, except with small wedges of beetroot and soft salted herring. We also loved the Medovik ($7.90), a crumbly, biscuit-like Slavic honey cake. Wash all these down with some malty Kvass ($5.90), a beverage made from rye bread, quite unlike any other drink most Singaporeans are familiar with.Address: 32 Maxwell Road, #01-05, Maxwell Chambers, Singapore 069115

https://eatbook.sg/filipino-food/,10 Filipino Food Places In Singapore To Try,,"Filter By(Change?)From their warm company to crazy celebrations, there is much to be loved about our Filipino friends—and their food is surely one that tops the list. With a few restaurants specialising in Filipino food, Lucky Plaza has always been my go-to area to satisfy the lechon crave. But I’ve recently uncovered many other eateries around Singapore that whip up these delicious Filipino fares. Here are 10 Filipino eateries for you to get your hands on legit lechon, refreshing halo halo, and more!Table of ContentsLechón is a Spanish word referring to the famous Filipino roasted suckling pig, and it is also the signature dish at Don Lechon. Served with a heap of rice, their Chopped Lechon ($11) comprises fat and plump chunks of pork that are well-marinated with herbs such as lemongrass and garlic. It even has a faint coconutty taste! Other dishes that we enjoyed at Don Lechon include Lechon Sisig ($11), which is the same lechon chopped up and fried with onions and chillies, and Bopis ($7) featuring beef lungs and pork hearts simmered in a bevy of herbs.Check out our full review of Don Lechon!Address: 511 Guillemard Road, #01-52, Grandlink Square, Singapore 399849

ShareOne of the hottest locations in Singapore, Outram Park is a stone's throw away from some of the city's biggest names in food. Its vibrant nightlife and eclectic mix of both cultural and gastronomical gems makes it a must-visit area when making a trip to the Lion City.Near to Keong Saik, Tanjong Pagar, and Chinatown, exit the Outram Park MRT station and let your senses be enthralled at what this corner of Singapore has to offer.The celebrity chef of Frantzén fame opened his third Asian venture in a shophouse circa 1926. Diners here are offered an aperitif and amuse-bouche on the first floor, before the neo-Nordic, eight-course, seafood-heavy tasting menu with Japanese influences unfolds above — on the second floor. Petit fours and coffee are served in the lounge area on the top level. Premium ingredients from Europe and Japan infuse the dishes with unique character. Reservations are mandatory.Chef Mano Thevar serves a creative multi-course menu rooted in Indian traditions and crafted with European techniques. Signatures such as Chettinad chicken roti or Brittany lobster in curry beurre blanc pack a ton of oomph, all the while maintaining a fine balance with mindful touches. Amuse-bouches and snacks between courses are especially fun, and a vegetarian version of the menu is also available. The bustling and lively vibe makes for a great experience."

But if you’ve grown tired of the endless crowds at Guzman Y Gomez and Chimichangas, here are the top Mexican and Latin American restaurants in Singapore – just in time for Cinco de Mayo. Vamanos! Let’s get munching on tacos, burritos, quesadillas, and more!A neighbourhood taqueria in the heart of Singapore, Papi’s Tacos serves up authentic, fuss-free Mexican fare. Keeping to the informal street dining culture of Central Mexico, the restaurant has gained a loyal following on platforms like TikTok, Lemon8 and Instagram. All this, thanks to Head Chef and Partner, Mauricio Espinoza and his impeccable hospitality practices and simple, yet mouthwatering dishes.  We recommend Tiger Prawn Tacos (S$21) with mango salsa, Crispy Pescado Tacos (S$15) with fried dory fish, and the the Holy Trinity (Small S$13, Large S$29) with chips, fresh tomato salsa and guacamole.Papi’s Tacos has outlets in Seah Street and Tanjong Pagar. Strategically located at Customs House, Super Loco boasts more than just exciting views of the city skyline. At this bayfront cocina, you can munch on tasty bites that honour sustainable and home cooking, and enjoy the company of all of your amigos. Begin your scenic meal with seabass Ceviche (S$18) with mango, serrano chilli, agave, and sweet corn. Then, dive into mains like the Octopus & Chicharron Tacos (S$15) that comes paired with orange salsa. Don’t forget their curated collection of artisanal tequila and mezcal showcased in boozy treats like Blood Orange & Guava Margarita (S$19), as well as Wild Mezcalita (S$21) with artisanal wild cupreata mezcal, Cointreau, lime, and firewater bitters.Super Loco Customs House is located at 70 Collyer Quay, #01-04 Customs House, Singapore 049323, p. +65 9816 0659. Open Mon-Thu 11.30am–11pm, Fri-Sat 11.30am–11.30pm. Closed on Sun. At Nixta, expect to be wowed by warm Mexican hospitality, addictive margaritas and an appreciation for Mexican culture and cooking. The eatery is known for sourcing non-GMO corn from small Mexican farms and its wood-fired rotisserie for that grill-kissed char. Salsas here are also handmade in volcanic stone molcajetes. Chow down on Wood-Fired Oysters (S$32) with charred jalapeño butter & “molcajete” tomato vinaigrette, or go in straight for the banger with the smoky Nixta Signature Spit & Herb-Roasted Chicken (S$40). Wash it all down with signature cocktails or the Nixta Especial Margarita (S$26) with tequila, orange curaçao, and a taijin salt rim."

But if bae wants to try something new, and you’re all out of ideas, Mike’s Caribbean Food can help. This hawker stall is found in Simpang Bedok, and they offer hearty plates that can’t be easily found elsewhere.If you’ve never tasted the dishes from this Caribbean island, owner Michael Francis, or Mike, says to expect “something delicious, something spicy”. And boy was he right.The first dish I tried was Jerk Chicken ($10), which features the meat marinated in traditional Jamaican herbs and spices, including the famous scotch bonnet pepper. The set comes with Rice and Peas ($3 for a la carte) made with garlic, coconut cream, scotch bonnet pepper, and kidney beans. This Caribbean staple is usually served with meat and I found it really delicious with the fragrance of thyme. The chicken tasted like spicy barbeque chicken, but not as spicy as Jamaican food is famed to be. I later learned that since we are so far from the country, Mike had to source high and low for chillis that live up to level of spiciness that Jamaicans are used to."

We stumbled upon a bunch of cool new arrivals, tasty eats and possibly even our newest favorite hangout spots.Chong Pang Market & Food CentreWhere to eatChong Pang Market & Food Centre (104 Yishun Ring Rd.) This bustling market is Yishun’s mainstay for cheap and good hawker staples. Don’t miss the boneless braised duck rice (#01-161), chwee kueh (#01-142) and mee hoon kueh (#01-154).Chong Pang Nasi Lemak This is one of the culinary standouts near Chong Pang so if you’re a nasi lemak fanatic, a pilgrimage here is a must.Sembawang White Beehoon Another cult favorite, this time hidden inside the sleepy Jalan Legundi estate closer to Sembawang.

https://sethlui.com/san-gloo-singapore/,San Gloo: Hidden dessert spot with belgian waffles & 27 ...,,"When the weather becomes unbearably hot, my quest for something refreshingly icy begins. Recently, while browsing Instagram, I stumbled upon the page of San Gloo. It’s an under-the-radar dessert spot tucked away in Junction Nine, Yishun. Their specialty? Korean bingsu and waffles; it seemed like a hidden gem waiting to be discovered.To my surprise, Junction Nine remains relatively unknown to most people, except for the residents of Yishun. Tucked away amidst the residential area, this boutique mall manages to maintain its air of exclusivity as compared to Northpoint City (its more popular counterpart).As I arrived, I was greeted by a small and cute stall front with just 8 tables. However, I quickly learned not to judge a place by its size. The menu offered a wide repertoire of options, ranging from Belgian waffles to Hong Kong-style egg waffles.But what caught my attention were the staggering 27 types of bingsu they had, including an impressive selection of 19 petite varieties (perfect for small eaters like myself).Our dessert adventure began with the Milo Crunch Bingsu (S$8.90). The bowl of frosty ice was surrounded by an army of tiny, round Milo krispies. It was also crowned with a generous dusting of Milo powder, a scoop of chocolate ice cream, and drizzled with condensed milk.I shamelessly slathered extra condensed milk over it and began tucking in.With each delightful spoonful, the mini pearls of Milo bestowed an addictive crunchiness that transported me back to the joy of devouring a bowl of Milo cereal straight from the box."

From traditional hawker favourites to ice cream cafes, there’s always something to eat there any time your hunger pangs strike. Most of the places in this list are a walkable distance away from Yishun MRT station, so dress cool, come hungry, and let’s start exploring these 20 food spots in Yishun and Sembawang.North-dwellers and laksa lovers will surely be familiar with 928 Yishun Laksa. Hailed as one of the top must-try laksas in Singapore, be prepared to join a long queue at any time of day. Here, laksa is an all-day affair.The Laksa (S$2.80 for small) comes in a bowl chock full of ingredients, including chopped bee hoon (rice vermicelli), tau pok (fried puffy beancurd), crabsticks, bean sprouts, cockles and half a boiled egg. Try ordering an extra portion of cockles—they go really well with the mix.The soup is particularly noteworthy; the coconut milk is distinct enough against the spiciness, resulting in a flavourful and slightly sweet broth. It isn’t the spiciest laksa, tending more towards the milky side. Ditch the chopsticks; all you need is a spoon to scoop the bite-sized pieces of chopped bee hoon as you slurp everything up. If the hunger pangs are stronger that day, opt for the large size at S$3.30.928 Yishun Laksa: Blk 928 Yishun Central 1, #01-155, Singapore 760928 | Tel: +65 9731 9586 | Opening Hours: 8.30am – 7pm (Mon to Sat), Closed on Sun"

It doesn’t try to modernise the Polish cuisine as other restaurants do, but instead, it serves homely, hearty Polish meals. It’s what Polish eat everyday.It’s not merely a restaurant. It’s also a wedding hall and hotel with free parking. But as the homely decor (wood everywhere and fireplace) of the restaurant reveals, this is not a fancy place, but it’s typical and down-to-earth.The food here is served in gigantic portions. This is because the place is usually a pit-stop and Poles want to eat a one-dish meal, similar to the concept of don (ricebowl) for Japanese.Sour rye soup in bread bowl – a typical Easter mealSo you can just order their Polish sour rye soup with egg and sausage in bread bowl (żurek staropolski z jajkiem i kiełbasą w chlebie, 13 PLN) and be full. Poles usually eat this on Sundays, as a hangover cure.Warsaw tripe soupFor soup, I had the Warsaw style tripes (flaki po warszawsku, 8PLN), which warmed the stomach, and, typical of Polish cuisine, is sourish.For mains, traditional pork fried in lard (tradycyjny schabowy smażony na smalcu, 27PLN) sounds interesting but we weren’t given that option.Beef cheeks in red wineThe beef cheeks in red wine sauce (Policzki wołowe w sosie z wina czerwonego, 37PLN) comes with Silesian dumplings and pickled cucumber salad). Beef is tough but then, the cuisine is supposed to be homely.Sprinkle sugar on potato pancakes for the sweet-savoury flavour"

Celebrating the Moroccan culture also means that we bring traditional classic and festive dishes within our menu offering. Explore the wide array of vegetable dishes and common meats mainly beef and lamb in within the cuisine, along with chicken and seafood. You will find classic key ingredients like preserved lemons, argan oil, olive oil and dried fruits as the base flavours of the dishes. Here at Tajine, we preserve our own lemon peels and mix our own spice blend to create the perfectly balanced flavour we desire. Taste the flavours of starch staples like Batbout Bread, Semolina couscous, and pastries like Pastillas and Cornes de Gazelle. Tajines are the staple of the cuisine, named after the traditional earthenware which meat or fish is slow-cooked within. Friday couscous is a tradition among Moroccans as a day of sharing, so we have decided that every day is a sharing day at Tajine, dishing a beautiful mound of fluffy hand-rolled semolina with house-made bone broth poured over piles of royal meat cuts. The Méchoui is definitely not to be missed in all Moroccan festivities! A whole piece of lamb shoulder is slow-cooked for a long  time with Ras El Hanout to absolute tenderness and served over a huge pile of Basmati Rice Pilaf  and Dried Fruits. It is a dish that is worth sharing and enjoy even just to celebrate the lengths and efforts taken for its long preparation!Just like the kitchens in Morocco, here at Tajine, we do not handle pork or lard within our restaurant premises.The VenueOlivier BendelCEO, Deliciae Hospitality ManagementRémy CarmignaniChef, Deliciae Hospitality ManagementJaime Ee, The Business TimesEthan Kan , Tatler Asia"

The thought of crispy baguettes stuffed with meat and veggies makes me weak in the knees. Since I’d never tried it before, going to Bánh Mì Saigon checked something off my bucket list. I was skipping from excitement as I made my way through the roads of Ang Mo Kio to find the spot.You’ll need to walk through a hawker centre and eventually, you’ll spot an evident red aura. Amidst all the red paper lanterns, the words Bánh Mì Saigon peek out. Situated in a secluded spot, it shares space with a Vietnamese mini-mart selling traditional tidbits and snacks. I first realised that the food is available only for takeaway. I examined the menu which was initially confusing as the items were listed in Vietnamese. I couldn’t immediately spot the faded descriptions in English beneath them. But once I did, it wasn’t hard choosing my first bánh mì.It was fascinating to watch the assembling process of the sub through the glass box. It also gave me a chance to observe the wide variety of fillings and toppings that go into this Vietnamese dish.My first choice was the Bánh Mì Thịt (S$7.90) with cold-cut pork ham as its main meat filling. It also had the words “special great bánh mì” underneath it so how could I not go for that? There were 13 bánh mì options to choose from, so I took a while to decide on the second one. I finally landed on the Bánh Mì Gà Xé Phay (S$8.90) which came with salt-baked, hand-pulled chicken.Although their sign states the waiting time to be between 15-35 minutes, I waited for only about seven. This was perhaps since it was a slow, weekday afternoon. I was still ravenous and dug into it as soon as I got home.The Bánh Mì Gà Xé Phay had colours popping out, so it caught my eye first. It had red capsicum, finely sliced carrots, cucumbers, hand-pulled chicken, and a whole lot of spring onions."

Picture a crispy and soft baguette, filled with beautiful cuts of meat and various vegetables for the perfect mix of textures, and a creamy pate to bring you the perfect sandwich. Who can say no to that! Well, tucked away at Ang Mo Kio lies Banh Mi Saigon where they serve this scrumptious sandwich with unique cuts of pork! What makes their Banh Mi so unique? Let’s take a look!Banh Mi Saigon is a relatively new stall, having only opened before Christmas last year! Tucked away in a provision shop, the stall is is owned by Nhi, who goes by the name Victoria. She currently runs a chain of Vietnamese provision shops in Bedok and Sengkang, with the Ang Mo Kio branch being the only one to have the banh mi stall.The stall here offers a wide variety, with over fourteen types of banh mi to choose from! Enjoy an array of sandwiches stuffed with barbecued pork, pulled chicken, Vietnamese charcuterie, and assorted cuts of the pig such as ear, nose, and trotter. Definitely something unique that you don’t find at most banh mi stalls!The Mixed Pork (Banh Mi Pha Lau Heo) is served at $6.90, with a mouth-watering mix of chewy and gelatinous pork bits consisting of jellied pork ear, nose, skin, and trotter! The pork bits are braised in coconut water, soy, and caramel for sweetness, with the flavour of the coconut water shining through in every bite!The sandwich also comes with a beautiful spread of chicken liver pate, margarine, pickled carrots and cucumber, and a drizzle of a special soy sauce to finish it. The pork bits have a pleasant sweet-savoury flavour and blend nicely with the flavours of the pate and crunchy vegetables.The standout, however, is definitely the symphony of textures that are simply to die for! Each bite gives you a heavenly mix of crispiness, chewiness, and crunchiness, with a beautiful layer of creaminess from the pate! As the banh mi lies more on the sweet side, one suggestion would be to ask for more chilli for a better balance of flavours! Nonetheless, it’s still a pretty tasty sandwich overall that’s certainly worth a try!As the stall operates out of a provision shop, do note only takeaway is available, which makes it the perfect snack to have on the go! With such unique cuts of pork being served, this banh mi stall is definitely worth checking out! What are you waiting for?

Published by SPH Media Limited, Co. Regn. No. 202120748H. Copyright © 2023 SPH Media Limited. All rights reserved. Gourmet & TravelMustard Seed: Mod-Singaporean flavours in Serangoon GardensChef Gan Ming Kiat makes a heartfelt debut with his long-awaited restaurant in suburban Serangoon Gardens.We love eating with fellow Singaporeans. We love how we can all be strangers obliged to eat together in a communal setting – in more friendly countries, everyone would be best pals by the end of the night, but here, it’s socially acceptable to ignore everyone except the ones you came to dinner with.It adds to the uniquely Singaporean bonhomie of Mustard Seed, the long-running cult pop-up/restaurant-in-waiting that’s finally taken root in the quintessentially suburban Serangoon Gardens estate. If you, like us, had never succeeded in scoring a spot in chef Gan Ming Kiat’s oversubscribed home dining operation, now’s the time to see what the fuss is all about.Still, it’s not a place for impulse dining. The shophouse space fits 13 at most around a counter, and only odd dates are available on the website – your only means of reservation. Everyone is served at the same time at 7.45pm, but doors open at 7pm. It feels like you’ve been invited to Chef Gan’s home but instead of bringing flowers, you pay him S$138 plus service charge – in cash – because his shoestring operation doesn’t take credit cards at the moment.The place is simple but tasteful, and there’s a warm, happy, youthful vibe thanks to the down-to-earth and cheerful charms of Julian – the jovial third wheel to the laconic but earnest Chef Gan and his smiley, winsome girlfriend/chef, Shin Yin. The trio are all ex-Candlenut, which explains the Peranakan influences in the menu, with a slight Japanese accent that Chef Gan picked up in the three years he worked at the now-defunct Goto kaiseki restaurant.Chef Gan has certainly picked a potentially fiddly cuisine to specialise in – his own. Because that puts him in the so-called mod-Singaporean territory – that vague, yet to be defined category that Singaporean chefs who are neither cooking modern European cuisine nor hawker fare are plonked in.(RELATED: The future of Singaporean food: redefining the cuisine)"

SharePrior to the announcement of the full restaurant selection of the MICHELIN Guide Singapore 2023, Michelin is pleased to unveil today the food establishments that have been distinguished with a Bib Gourmand by the famously anonymous MICHELIN Guide inspectors.With the entry of 17 new and 2 promoted Bib Gourmand eateries in Singapore, the total number of addresses offering exceptional value-for-money gourmet experiences in Singapore has reached 79. This is a significant increase from 2022’s selection, which had 67 food establishments. “We are pleased to announce that this year’s selection of 79 Bib Gourmand locations includes 21 restaurants, 53 hawker centre stalls, and 5 street food establishments, making for a diverse variety of casual eats that define Singapore’s street food and local hawker food scene,” said Gwendal Poullennec, the International Director of the MICHELIN Guide. “The inspection team has discovered a great number of hawker stalls with flavorsome dishes from different ethnic groups, each with their own secret recipes. Beyond taste, these gems are also an inheritance of culture, which serves as a strong positioning of Singapore’s cuisine to both locals and tourists.”  The 17 hawker centre stalls newly-awarded a Bib Gourmand are:  Adam Rd Noo Cheng Big Prawn Noodle, located in Adam Food Centre, serves prawn mee using a recipe inherited from the owner’s father. Opt for the “dry” noodles tossed in prawn paste of your desired spice level, alongside a bowl of prawn soup.  Bahrakath Mutton Soup, also located in Adam Food Centre, has been serving its secret mutton soup recipe since 1973. The broth is rich, dense, and full of herbal flavours. Beach Road Fish Head Bee Hoon located in Whampoa Market Place serves sliced fish bee hoon (rice vermicelli) that comes in a flavourful, milky fish stock, with fried garlic bits for extra fragrance and crunch.  Cheok Kee, located in Geylang Bahru Market & Food Centre, is famous for its soy-marinated duck that boasts velvety flesh. The duck sits on a bed of steamed rice perfumed by duck fragrance. It comes with chilli vinegar that aptly cuts through the richness, and an aromatic duck soup made with Chinese herbs.  Du Du Shou Shi located in Jurong West 505 Market & Food Centre carries two varieties of tu tu kueh — coconut and peanut. The steamed rice cake is chewy and springy on the outside; while both fillings are nutty, sweet, and aromatic.  Heng Kee located in Hong Lim Market & Food Centre was founded in the 1970s and is currently run by its second-generation owner. The stall’s hallmark dishes are mild, well-balanced curry broth, custom-made tofu puffs and fish cakes, as well as generous helpings of velvety chicken.Hui Wei Chilli Ban Mian, also located in Geylang Bahru Market & Food Centre, serves ribbon noodles with “soup” or “dry” options. The latter is tossed in home-made chilli sauce and topped with minced meat, meatballs, poached egg, and fried lard.  Ji De Lai Hainanese Chicken Rice located at Chong Pang Market and Food Centre has been a selected stall in the MICHELIN Guide in the previous years. The hawker stall is promoted with a Bib Gourmand recognition for its reasonably priced chicken rice sets that come served with either roasted or steamed chicken, rice, soup, and vegetables.  Kwee Heng located in Newton Food Centre has over 40 years of history, making boneless braised duck that is tender, juicy, and flavoursome. It can be served with rice, congee, or noodles.  Nam Sing Hokkien Fried Mee located in 51 Old Airport Road Market has been serving just one item since it opened in 1960 — hokkien fried mee with prawns. The egg noodles and rice vermicelli are tossed in a rich broth made with prawn shells and tomalley to impart deep umami.No.18 Zion Road Fried Kway Teow located in Zion Riverside Food Centre serves kway teow noodles fried to order, topped with fish cake and cockles. The wok hei is impressive, with robust flavours and a hint of spiciness, while the cockles lend extra umami.Selamat Datang Warong Pak Sapari located in Adam Food Centre is now run by its third-generation owners. This family business is famous for mee soto and mee rebus, with authentic Malaysian flavours. The former is served in broth, while the latter is served in a thick gravy soup.  Singapore Fried Hokkien Mee located in Whampoa Market Place is famous for hokkien mee made with rice vermicelli and yellow egg noodles, which are topped with prawns and squid for umami. Each serving of noodles is made even better with a helping of spicy home-made chilli sauce.  Soon Huat, located in North Bridge Road Market & Food Centre, serves both “dry” or “soup” noodles, topped with butterflied prawns, fish cake, bean sprouts and fried garlic. The delectable prawn soup on the side is also a treat.  Spinach Soup located in Geylang Bahru Market & Food Centre is the place to go for a bowl of comfort. The broth is tasty and sweet, while the spinach remains crisp and fresh.  Tai Seng Fish Soup located in Taman Jurong Market & Food Centre is a third-generation family business, which prides itself on its delicious fish soup made from scratch, served with sliced fish, deep-fried fish, or fish head.  Yong Chun Wan Ton Noodle located at 115 Bukit Merah View Market & Food Centre serves springy egg noodles, best enjoyed in its “dry” form — balanced and dressed in a savoury sweet sauce, topped with wonton with minced pork.

It is also mixed with Chinese chives and bean sprouts. The heart of this dish is lard which makes it super delicious but sometimes for a healthier variation, it is replaced by oil and served with more vegetables instead of proteins. It is often served on a banana leaf to enhance the fragrance with a wedge of lime squeezed on the top.It is a bustling hawker center that comes alive at night. Located in the heart of the city, it offers a wide range of local delicacies such as Hokkien mee, laksa, and chicken rice.

https://hungrybird.sg/2017/05/22/nasi-lemak-in-singapore/,Nasi Lemak in Singapore | Hungry Bird,22 May 2017 — ,"Nasi Lemak is one of the most common meals found in Singapore. You can get them in: Of course each price range has a reason. The basic one is just basic and do not expect meticulous cooking or high quality ingredients. For the $7-$8 range you’re paying for all the meat dishes rather than the Nasi Lemak itself. For the $12+ price range, they typically serve it with traditional selections of sides but offer the best form of each aspect and I really appreciate that. Looking forward to having more good Nasi Lemak around!For this post I will rate them according to satisfaction level taking into consideration the taste as well as how value for money it is.International Muslim Food Stall Nasi Lemak This is an example of what you would get at Changi Village. There are 3 stalls selling the same stuff so just go wherever the queue is. I tried all 3 in one sitting and I didn’t find it particularly nice, nothing worth travelling down for if Changi Village isn’t your neighbourhood. This category would belong the to everyday food sort of thing if you live within 5 minutes walking distance, rather than Nasi Lemak of fine standards. (I mean I already expected this before coming, so just stating objectively.)Satisfaction level: 3/5 Boon Lay Power Nasi Lemak – $4On the other end of the island you have Boon Lay Power Nasi Lemak. I would never go Boon Lay just for this, but they have an outlet in Novena Square 2 which made everything possible. Assuming it’s the same (I wouldn’t know, have not stepped into Boon Lay for years), this one is indeed comparable to Changi Village standard (Westsiders! You have no good reason to go to Changi Village for Nasi Lemak when you have this in Boon Lay.). It’s basically of the same category – great for a everyday cheap meal, but nothing of fine standards. The flavours are pretty much generic of Nasi Lemak, but generic is a good thing. The rice was good, chilli was good, ikan bilis and peanuts really crispy and chicken wing was up expectations. I polished the whole packet and had no regrets over the calories. I even missed the taste enough to buy this a second time within 2 weeks.Satisfaction level: 4/5 Revolution Coffee – $4.90This one at Revolution Coffee had some hype online because it’s supposedly really good, with recipe from a self-taught chef with special interest in Nasi Lemak. I had high hopes for this, going many lengths to get to this super inaccessible cafe just for the Nasi Lemak, but it was sorely disappointing. I seldom ever get disappointed with Nasi Lemak, but even those $2 banana leaf factory packed ones fared better. I would describe this one as “trying to hard but backfired”. They tried to hard to be different – using some different flavours for the chicken and the rice, but it just didn’t work. The rice had some spice flavour like ginger, which distracted the main flavour of coconut, and the chicken was way too oily and sweet. It was as though the kitchen just fried it up again to reheat. Don’t quote me, I don’t know what they really did, but that’s what I perceived from eating it. The proportions of ingredients was strange too – the chilli was way too little, eggs were too much(you can’t see it but those slices were really thick, as if it’s 2 whole eggs here) and ikan bilis was barely there. I am convinced that this place just has good PR done to get rave write ups done on various media hence the hype but you can easily find better Nasi Lemak anywhere else."

https://ieatishootipost.sg/jiali-seafood-soup-from-marsiling-to-aljunied/,Jiali Seafood Soup: From Marsiling to Aljunied,21 Apr 2020 — ,"If you are a fan of Sin Kee fish soup in Marsiling and have felt that the fish soup tastes a little different the last time you visited, it could be because you didn’t realise that the lady who used to own the stall has already moved to this coffeeshop in Aljunied, and is now at Jiali Seafood Soup!Why she would leave her very established business to relocate to a sleepy coffeeshop is a long story which we will not go into details here. But, suffice to say, her business now isn’t as brisk as it was when she was still at Marsiling which is a crying shame because her seafood soup is very good!Her style of fish soup is quite unique and is a style of fish soup made popular by Yan Ji fish soup in Woodlands.  You can find several stalls in the Northern part of Singapore serving this type of fish soup which is characterized by generous chunks of marinated minced pork which is furiously boiled in stock to give the soup its body and robustness.  Then other seafood like fish, scallops, prawns and crayfish are then added to further enhance its sweetness.  The resulting soup is a hearty and flavourful soup that really warms up the tummy and satisfies that umami craving! 4.25/5Aside from the fish soup she also serves ginger braised duck as a side dish.  This is unfortunately not available during the Covid 19 Circuit Breaker period, but it is a nice dish that goes very well with rice!  On Fri, Sat and Sundays, they also make yong tau foo which I haven’t managed to try yet, but given the quality of the meat balls, I am sure they would be great!ConclusionI used to have to travel all the way to Marsiling to enjoy this hearty bowl of fish soup.  Thankfully now it is nearer home!Delivery available for Aljunied, Sims Ave, Geylang Rd, Circuit Rd, Ubi, Eunos and Haig Road areas.  Cost $3-$5. Call Ivy at 92250168 They are also on Grab and Food Panda.NB:  Photos were taken before the circuit breaker period.  This is now only available for takeaway and delivery."

https://www.lifestyleasia.com/sg/dining/food/best-places-to-eat-authentic-nepalese-food-in-singapore/,8 best places to enjoy authentic Nepalese food in Singapore,19 Nov 2021 — ,"Nepal is romanticised for its astounding landscape and resilient people, but its cuisine deserves similar praise.Deceivingly rustic yet incredibly complex, it draws influences from cultures both in and around Nepal, and encapsulates much of what the country is about. For a peek into what makes the place so special, here are eight restaurants where you can eat Nepalese food in Singapore.Nepal is a bacon strip of a land that separates two major Asian powers. To its north is China, while the rest of it borders India. Geographically, the country straddles both the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates, which gives Nepal fertile plains and forested hills in the south, and the Himalayan mountain range up north, including Mount Everest.This diversity also extends to Nepal’s people. According to a 2011 census, the country has 125 distinct ethnic groups that speak 123 languages. Many also have their own religions in addition to Buddhism, Hinduism, Christianity and Islam. The majority of its 26.5 million-strong population reside in the capital of Kathmandu, followed by Pokhara and Lalitpur.The cuisine is equally wide ranging. The food is hearty, with plenty of root vegetables and meats like chicken and mutton. Hints of China appear in dishes like momo, a steamed dumpling, and a noodle soup called thukpa. Spices, lentils and curries reflect a kinship with India. At the same time, uniquely Himalayan ingredients like jimbu, a medicinal herb, are also used.In Singapore, you can try examples from Lomba, which cooks jimbu with chicken and paneer. From Gurkha Palace is a dried meat called sukuti, and Everest Kitchen offers a Newari barbecued chicken. For momo, Malingo cooks them in a range of styles to be enjoyed as bar food.Shish Mahal brings Michelin refinement to its range of Nepalese dishes, while Himalaya Kitchen replaces cheese for mutton in a palak paneer. Look for the fragrant yogi bhuja rice dish at Amber Tandoor, and the crispy chickpea fritters with Nepali spices from Tims.Lomba is a cozy little spot in the well worn Beauty World Shopping Centre. The name comes from the Magar word for “leader”, and the eatery is led by a friendly mother and son team.The restaurant uses traditional oils, herbs, spices and sweeteners from the mountainous land to flavour their food. The butter chicken, for example, is made with an onion like herb called jimbu, and the walnut cake is sweetened with jaggery, an unrefined cane sugar. Other dishes to look out for include chilli momo with vegetables and thukpa. Call to book.Tuesdays to Saturdays, 12pm to 7.30pm
Sundays, 12pm to 4.30pmOpened since 2002, Gurkha Palace is a monument to classic Nepalese food. They have both steamed and fried momo, a meat jerky called sukuti, black bean stew with spices and garlic, as well as basmati rice with saffron and dried fruits. For dessert, opt for the creamy sikarni: yoghurt, cinnamon, fresh fruits, honey, and cashew."

https://sethlui.com/choa-chu-kang-bukit-panjang-bukit-batok-guide-singapore/,"Best Eats in Choa Chu Kang, Bukit Panjang & Bukit Batok",12 May 2021 — ,"Referred to as ‘District 23’ by property agents as well as those familiar with this area/region in Singapore, the housing estates in Choa Chu Kang, Bukit Panjang, and Bukit Batok are very known for their lush greenery as well as for being the quieter, out-of-town housing districts.Many who reside in this region may only know of this place as their bedroom—a place where they return home to sleep after a long day of work. However, it is without a doubt that there are good food places that exist in this district even residents might not know about.With help from Singapore Westies who have struggled to find the best eats, here are 20 foodie places around Choa Chu Kang, Bukit Panjang, and Bukit Batok. Touted by many foodies as the best ‘Chicken Rice in the West’ of Singapore, Ah Boy Chicken Rice truly lives up to its name. For just S$4, you can enjoy their signature Chicken Rice, an excellent combination of tender chicken meat with gelatinous skin crowning the top of a fragrant chicken stock-infused dome of rice. The Chicken Rice here is said to be so good that even Chef Eric Teo himself has raved about this place!Our only gripe is that the chilli sauce is a bit on the watery side. Otherwise, this is definitely a plate that we think is worth the trip to Choa Chu Kang for.678A Choa Chu Kang Crescent, Singapore 681678

InstagramNine Spices pride itself in its nasi rempah—a Malay ‘spiced rice’ that is a unique marriage of biryani and nasi lemak. Cooked in a pressure cooker, the basmati grains of the Nasi Rempah (S$3.90) are well-seasoned with nine spices which include star anise and cinnamon, giving it a fragrant and flowery taste. The well-fluffed rice comes perfectly portioned with a crispy chicken drumstick, two cherry tomatoes, achar and a hard-boiled egg, a great combination of proteins and carbohydrates on the plate. At its price point, the rice-to-chicken ratio is just right providing for the perfect quick lunch or dinner bite for one person.302 Choa Chu Kang Avenue 4, #01-719, Singapore 680302

https://ieatishootipost.sg/esso-food-journeys-telok-blangah-cafe-trail/,Esso Food Journeys: Telok Blangah Cafe Trail,21 Oct 2022 — ,"There has been an explosion in the number of boutique cafes in Singapore in the last decade, so we set ourselves the task of discovering the best places where you go for a nice cup of coffee and something to eat. We are using the term cafe quite loosely.  We are not talking about places that specialize in roasting coffee beans and pulling their espresso through shiny thousand-dollar machines. Instead, we are looking for casual establishments that you can pop in for a hot drink and something to eat at any time of the day. These will include fancy espresso places as well as eateries which brews coffee with a sock or a Coffee dripper.Most importantly, there must be a compelling reason for you to make a special trip to visit, be it for its food, the coffee or just because it’s a place that’s really cosy!We started our journey at Esso Telok Blangah to fill up our car first. This station is a landmark of Telok Blangah, having served residents and commuters at this location for over 50 years! Keep a lookout for this station when you’re in the South to fuel up your car, do some banking and buy your daily essentials! Remember to tap into the Esso App to find out if you can save some money on fuel or get discounts on in-store items! We managed to redeem $4 off $60 worth of petrol and earn Smiles reward points at the same time.Esso Telok Blangah396 Telok Blangah Rd, Singapore 098837Daily: 24 hoursTel: 6271 2705For our first stop, we headed to SAFRA Mount Faber where we discovered a cafe with a treasure trove of antiques that will transport you back to a time when bus conductors were still around.  There are many cafes trying to play the nostalgia card, but Old Habits is the real deal, a bone fide antique shop that also serves food. Donovan, the owner,  started off his collection with a single mechanical clock which quickly became a collection of antique clocks.  Then he got into view masters and soon there was not enough space at home for all his Knick-knacks.  He had initially wanted to open an antique shop but realised that it was not feasible in Singapore and thus the hybrid cafe-antique shop was born.This is the type of cafe which you go to trigger that feeling of nostalgia. There are so many things that would make you feel all fuzzy inside.  From coin phones to metal robot toys to polyvinyl records and, of course view masters.  All of the items in this cafe are for sale — at the right offer price. They serve Western meals here, so expect to get a platter with meat and two veg, as well as pastas and sandwiches. What was really good was the Smoked Duck served with housemade mash as well as the Clam Vongole which has that smokey wok hei flavour the first time we had it. Unfortunately, the wok hei was missing during the time of the filming, possibly because we left it for a bit too long before eating it. They also have a Coconut Kueh Pouffle which is a cross between a bread pudding and a souffle which goes well with a cup of coffee.Old Habits Boutique and Cafe2 Telok Blangah Way, #01-04 Next to the Swimming Pool, SAFRA Mt Faber, Singapore 09880311am – 9pm Daily, Tel: 8864 3343Closed: MondaysAlso within a 5-10min drive from Esso Telok Blangah is Uncle Ho’s Tuckshop which I had blogged about previously. I come here specially for their Bun Cha Hanoi and baguettes. Even though the place is called a “Tuckshop”, it still qualifies as an establishment for our cafe trail since you can order a cup of Vietnamese drip coffee and some food throughout the day. In case, you are wondering, Uncle Ho is not the owner of the shop but refers to Ho Chih Minh, the Vietnamese revolutionary and statesman who defeated the French Union in 1954 and founded communist North Vietnam."

https://citynomads.com/restaurant-review-basque-pintxos-spanish-delicacies-at-the-alkaff-mansion-in-singapore/,Restaurant Review: Basque Pintxos & Spanish Food At ...,20 Jul 2019 — ,"City NomadsPUBLISHED July 20th, 2019 06:00 am | UPDATED February 7th, 2020 12:25 pmWe still remember when The Alkaff Mansion on Telok Blangah Hill was one of the most sought-after venues for the milestones in life. You know, like the first time we scored a date in university. All that came to a brief end in 2016 when their Italian restaurant closed, until the 1-Group, the folks behind The Summerhouse and Monti, decided to revive the spirit of Basque food and Italian living in this Tudor-styled heritage site.The photogenic facade, with two flanking turrets, white stone arches, and European-style fountains, is mostly the same, but it’s a different story inside. The mansion today is a multi-concept F&B destination housing the Basque-centred TXA Pintxo Bar and UNA, which you might remember from its days at Rochester Park. In a way, the whole “house on the hill” spiel bears similarities to the colourful Basque Country, a rugged land with mountains, endless greenery, and a population with a consuming passion for food. Fun fact: San Sebastián, their third city, boasts the greatest number of Michelin-starred restaurants per capita in the world.We start our evening with TXA (pronounced “cha”, which incidentally sounds like the Hokkien word for “noisy”) on the ground floor, which is only joint in town dedicated to the vibrant pintxos experience. If you’re wondering what that means, think hedonistic drinking and uninhibited revelry.The pintxos are made under the expertise of Basque chefs Marta Elvira Segalés and Silvana Pascual Romero, both of whom are graduates of the prestigious Basque Culinary Centre. Served al momento (the Spanish equivalent of “a la minute”), they prepare dishes like Crudiente de Jamon (S$5) — thin crispy Iberico crackers sandwiching a taramasalata-inspired sauce made with mascarpone, lemon zest, and mentaiko.It’s a great snack, but you’ll need the Boquerones con Piperrada (S$3.90) to fill up. Sweet and fragrant piquillo cream is emulsified with onions and slathered on a pile of pickled anchovies with caramelised red and green peppers — the balance is impeccable.Other pintxos we taste include Pintxo Igeldo (S$6.90) — confit tomatoes with vinegary piparra peppers and Basque Country tuna, and Crema de Roquefort Con Manzana Y Nueces (S$4.90), a particularly seductive trifecta of roquefort cream, apple jam, and walnuts. The latter goes particularly well with some txakoli, a slightly sparkling, very dry white wine from northern Burgos.There are also a number of cocktails that use Spanish wine as a base, like the Tinto de Pintxos (S$18), created with red wine, pisco, and sweet vermouth, and The Mansion (S$18), with brandy, Grand Marnier, and cherry liqueur. We don’t know if they taste like the vibrant soul of the Basques, but they’re delicious anyhow.UNA finds a new home on the second floor, and now they’re marrying their Spanish roots to the dynamic individualism of Basque cooking. As always, a lot of the produce are sourced from the Basque and Spanish regions. Octopus is grilled over a charcoal-fired parrilla grill in the Pulpo A La Parrilla Con Papas Arrugadas Y Mojo (S$32), and whole suckling pig is roasted whole with the evergreen Cochinillo Asado (S$42)."

 Lying between the exuberant Mount Faber Park and Vibrant HortPark of the Southern Ridges of Singapore, Telok Blangah Hill Park is a calm, peaceful getaway to enjoy nature with a view. Even though joggers and trekkers may treat it as a mere passageway between two parks, there's much more to it. On one end of Telok Blangah Hill Park is the well-known Henderson Waves, which is a 274 metre long and 36-metre high undulatory structure with unique curved metal ribs, and on the other end is the Forest Walk which is a 1.3-kilometre long metal pathway offering breathtaking, bird-eye views of the forest below. Another trail to not miss in Telok Blangah Hill Park is the Earth Trail which runs parallel to the Forest Walk, offering a view of the forest from ground-level."

There are tables inside and outside the shop though very popular during meal time. Will come back again to try their fish!Staff are friendly and flexible. Wait time is surprisingly fast looking when they are also handling food delivery orders.

Generally food is quite fresh and the hotplate heats up fairly quickly. Soup is on the bland side (corn soup) which is a plus. Environment wise not too crowded and also quite clean. Ala carte spending $19 for 2pax and was quite filling.Food was very fresh, good quality. Orders were delivered really fast once we placed them. Recommend to try Garlic Chicken, pork belly and Garlic pork collar as they are exceptionally fragrant after being bbq-ed. Can also get their platter for 2 as you can get a huge variety of food. Staff were considered quite attentive. Come here if you don't mind the heat as it can get quite humid at times especially at peak hours. Try their Thai Chilli, it's surprisingly good when paired with seafood + pork, as it cuts the grease.Went to this mookata during supper time. Surprisingly many people eat mookata at that time. There are 2 sets to choose but I didnt. So I ordered ala carte which cost us about 40$ for 2 person. Ingredients are up to standard, I liked the salmon. Nicely cut. Porks are well marinated. Definitely will come back again.
