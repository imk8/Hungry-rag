This set features what is said to be Singapore’s first-ever yuzu pork dish, and like the previous set, comes with a good portion of rice and some vegetables.When we wrote our Tonkatsu ENbiton review in May, we found that the yuzu tonkatsu indeed bore the citrusy flavour of yuzu, and was crunchy on the outside but succulent on the inside.

https://eatbook.sg/food-haus/:["Filter By(Change?)Coffeeshops aren’t usually the most stylish places to dine at, but there’s a new kid on the block that’s determined to turn that notion on its head. Enter\xa0Food Haus, a neon-lit, sports-themed coffeeshop in Ang Mo Kio that officially opens on\xa010 March 2023.Its interiors are strikingly colourful for a neighbourhood kopitiam, with cyberpunk-esque signages and sports objects tastefully placed around the place to give it an interesting visual appeal. A few fun examples include shuttlecock ceiling lights, a wall plastered with skateboards, and a bicycle that seems to be fused into the wall. It’s definitely worthy of the ‘gram.As for eats, Food Haus has a diverse lineup of stalls.Bangkok Street Mookata is a name that most mookata fans will be familiar with, given that it has numerous outlets across the country. This is its flagship outlet, so you can expect a stellar Thai BBQ experience. A platter for two here costs $25, while a platter for four will set you back $45.Be sure to check out Tham’s Roasted Delights, a stall opened by an ex-Crystal Jade and Imperial Treasure roast chef. Regardless of whether you get the Roast Duck Noodles ($4.50) or Char Siew Shao Rou Rice ($5.50), you can expect juicy, succulent meat that’s roasted to perfection.For Mala Hot Pot ($2.20 per 100g), Chong Qing Grilled Fish ($25), and other authentic Chinese fare, try Niu Xiao Er Dong Bei BBQ. If you’re in the mood for something out of the ordinary, though, then we recommend ordering the Stewed Pork Ribs with Green Bean ($25), which is pictured above in that massive, attention-grabbing wok.According to the owners, the size of the wok generates more heat, allowing the meat to be cooked at the optimal temperature in the cold Northeast China climate—which is where the dish originated from. This results in wonderfully tender and succulent pork ribs.And that’s not even mentioning the other well-known brands at Food Haus, including Chiangmai Thai Kitchen and Ng Kuan Chilli Pan Mee. It’s a treasure trove of good food.From 10 to 12 March, Food Haus diners will be treated to free coffee and tea. That’s all the more reason to head down to the coffeeshop, especially if you live in the area!For $1.50 truffle XLB, deep-fried bao and more, have a look at our Bei-Ing Dimsum Club review.

https://eatbook.sg/yamato-izakaya/:["Filter By(Change?)Yamato Izakaya has been around since 2018, but we’ve only managed to pay them a visit very recently. Located at the Oxley Bizhub in Tai Seng, they specialise in Japanese fare such as unagi, ramen, teppanyaki, donburi, sushi, sashimi, and yakitori. Don’t let the 10-minute stroll from Tai Seng MRT Station deter you from paying them a visit, though, as what awaits at this Japanese restaurant is well worth the walk.The family-run restaurant houses two specialised kitchens: Man Man Unagi, dedicated to crafting unagi dishes, and Tora Tora, known for their sushi and Japanese donburi. They’re also highly rated on Google, with over a 4.4 star rating from over 2,000 diners.\nImage credit: @yamato_izakayaYamato Izakaya boasts a huge dining space that can comfortably accommodate up to 150 patrons. Their alfresco area is also pet-friendly, and comes with beach umbrellas to keep diners shaded from the sun or drizzle.Get Wok Hei KL Hokkien Mee, Crispy Pork Knuckle And More At This Hip Food CourtThe restaurant’s interior, decked out with red Japanese paper lanterns, carefully selected cutlery, and a life-sized samurai figure at the entrance, showcases the owner’s attention to detail. It felt as though we had stepped into a scene from Spirited Away, with lively conversations filling the air as diners savoured their meals.Most of the unagi dishes at Yamato Izakaya utilise the Anguilla Japonica, a Japanese eel from Japan’s West Hamamatsu that’s coveted for its rich, fatty flavour. From the open kitchen, diners can also watch as the chefs skillfully grill the unagi before dipping it into a house-made sauce.Our dinner kicked off with Umaki ($10.90++), a savoury appetiser comprising soft tamago wrapped over unagi, served with Japanese radish on the side. Here, the richness of the unagi takes centre stage, while the tamago provides a subtle savouriness that complements the eel’s sweet flavour.Next, we were treated to the Unagi Cheese Maki ($26.90++), a fusion dish where unagi maki is served with four-cheese Hokkaido sauce, and crowned with tobiko.For a bowl of hearty noodles, order the Unagi Mazesoba ($27.90++). This dish offered a subtle spiciness, complemented by the unagi’s perfectly grilled, crispy skin. It was served with a side of savoury soup to complete the meal.The highlight of our meal was the Unagi Hitsumabushi, priced at $49.50++ for a large portion. You can savour the unagi in three different ways: as is, with condiments such as sansho pepper powder, or by adding dashi to transform it into an ochazuke. You’re also welcome to experiment and create your own unique combination based on your preferences.Yamato Izakaya also has an extensive drinks menu, featuring sake priced from $23++ per 300ml bottle. We recommend the Homare Aladdin Yuzu-Infused Sake for something sweet and zesty, or the Homare Strawberry Nigori Sake for unfiltered sake with a dash of strawberry juice. If you’re more of a beer fan, opt for the Sapporo Beer Tower instead, currently available at a promotional price of $49++.Additionally, you can receive a complimentary salmon head with each order of a large hitsumabushi, subject to availability.

https://eatbook.sg/meow-mee/:["Filter By(Change?)As a Sarawakian, I’m always on the lookout for authentic Sarawak kolo mee in Singapore. When I first moved here nearly a decade ago, there weren’t as many kolo mee stalls. Now, there’s a fair number of stalls to choose from—219 Sarawak Kolo Mee, Ian-Tau Sarawak Laksa and more. Many of them also offer Sarawak laksa, which is one of my favourite childhood dishes. I recently got to visit Meow Mee, which is helmed by Kuching-born hawkers Eric and Chun Hao.FYI, Meow Mee is named after Kuching’s moniker as the city of cats!17 Malaysian Food Places In Singapore For Curry Chee Cheong Fun And Famous Nasi LemakOn our visit, we had the Sarawak Kolo Mee Original ($5.50) and Red Kolo Mee ($5.50).The Sarawak Kolo Original, with its classic white noodles, was a delightful start to our meal. The springy noodles, despite looking a bit dry at first, proved to be quite moist and came topped with fried shallots and spring onions. I also liked the addition of shallot oil and white vinegar, which added extra savouriness to the dish.While the minced pork was well-seasoned with soybean paste and soy sauce, the char siew was unfortunately too tough for my liking.I was born in Miri, Sarawak, where white kolo mee was more common than the red version. The ones back home were also typically sweeter in flavour. I preferred Meow Mee’s red Kolo Mee was to the original one, as it came with a better balance of sweet and savoury notes. In fact, I actually enjoyed Meow Mee’s rendition a lot more than the ones I had growing up!For the uninitiated, red kolo mee comprises the same noodles as white kolo mee, but with the addition of char siew drippings, imparting its distinct red colour.Meow Mee also offers unique kolo mee variations such as Chicken Cutlet Kolo Mee ($7) and Mala Kolo Mee ($6.50). As a kolo mee purist, I would never be caught trying something that strays from the authentic version of the dish, but I dug into the mala kolo mee with an open mind.Unfortunately, the mala chilli oil was too spicy for me, and I couldn’t enjoy the dish without taking big gulps of water. My colleague, who fared better with spicy food, enjoyed this dish more than I did. It’s a shame I couldn’t enjoy the mala kolo mee to its fullest, though, as it smelled super fragrant—exactly like an aromatic bowl of mala xiang guo.I was also very excited to try their Sarawak Laksa, priced at $7 for a bowl with bee hoon noodles, and $8 for kolo mee. We opted for the latter.Those used to Singapore laksa may not be accustomed to the Sarawak version, which comes with a distinct assam flavour. It’s also not as creamy due to the absence of coconut milk—an ingredient that characterises the local rendition. Our huge bowl featured fairly large prawns that tasted quite fresh, along with shredded chicken and beansprouts for added crunch.Savoury and fragrant, with a hint of tanginess from the squeeze of fresh calamansi served on the side, this bowl of Sarawak laksa immediately brought me back to my childhood. I also helped myself to a dollop of hae bee hiam chilli paste, which added just the right amount of heat to the dish.Meow Mee has recently introduced two new dishes to their menu: Kolo White Wanton Mee ($5) and Seafood Soup ($5.50). The white wonton mee featured white kolo noodles topped with cai xin, char siew, and three small pieces of fried wanton. I would’ve preferred the fried wonton to be bigger in size, as they were quite delicious and hence would’ve added more flavour to the otherwise bland dish.I preferred the Seafood Soup, as it was comforting and made for a good palate cleanser. The clear soup, which was mildly sweet, came with crabstick rolls, prawns, seaweed, fishballs, and meatballs. You can also order this soup with the kolo mee as a set for $7.50.We also got a Platter ($12) to share, which included various fried items such as cheese tofu, handmade fried wonton, and handmade hei zho, AKA Teowchew crispy prawn rolls. While the items were simple, each piece was fried to perfection and had a nice crunch.As a kid, I always enjoyed my kolo mee with a glass of three-layered tea, AKA Teh C Peng Special. It’s made using red tea, evaporated milk, and gula apong, a type of palm sugar from the nipa palm tree that’s native to Sarawak. Similar to gula melaka, gula apong is golden brown in colour, but richer and stronger in flavour than the former. For delivery orders, Meow Mee offers them in cans, which come in Caramel ($2.20) and Pandan ($2.20) flavours. If you’re dining in, you can order the beverage—available with coffee or tea—from the drinks stall next to Meow Mee for $2.30 each.219 Sarawak Kolo Mee Review: Legit Kolo Mee And Kuching Laksa In PunggolMeow Mee’s recent closure of their Bukit Panjang outlet makes this branch their only location. The stall is situated at Kim San Leng Coffee Shop in Geylang East, a nine-minute walk from Aljunied MRT Station. You can easily spot Meow Mee by its animated signboard bearing the Chinese phrase “猫城古早味,” which translates to “traditional flavours of the city of cats.”The coffeeshop itself is spacious and well-ventilated, providing ample seating for groups of different sizes. It’s a popular spot among elderly patrons and those living around the area. If you’re dining with little ones, there’s also a playground right next to the coffeeshop that you can visit after your meal.Despite a few misses, Meow Mee is a decent place to enjoy authentic Sarawakian cuisine in the East. Ian-Tau Sarawak Laksa still remains my favourite kolo mee spot in Singapore, but I’ll definitely consider dropping by Meow Mee due to its convenient location near my office, especially for their delicious Sarawak laksa and red kolo mee!For more delicious Malaysian food in Singapore, head to EatAlley, where you’ll find seven famous KL eateries at Orchard Gateway!

If you’ve yet to try Hunanese food, and are curious to do so, head on down to the newly opened Nong Geng Ji at Raffles Place.How Sichuan Mala And Chongqing Grilled Fish Took Over The SG Food SceneNong Geng Ji has over 100 restaurants in China, and is known for its range of authentic and moreish Hunanese dishes. The popularity of these restaurants is such that hour-long queues are a common sight at certain outlets.Hunan cuisine is, like its Sichuan counterpart, known for its spiciness. Take the best-selling Stir-Fried Pork with Abalone and Chilli ($27.90++) for instance. This dish makes liberal use of Hunan green pepper, adding an addictive spiciness to the pork and baby abalone combo.Another hot meat dish to try is the Stir-fried Beef with Fried Chilli ($28.90++). Here, sliced pieces of beef are stir-fried with dried Hunan chillies, then placed in a hulking bowl for all to share. These dishes are best eaten along with the Wuchang Steamed Rice with Sweet Potato and Red Dates ($7.90++): the fluffy rice grains infused with natural sweetness are a good counterbalance to the spiciness.The restaurant has delectable fish dishes to check out, too, including the Signature Grass Fish Fillet with Chilli ($25.90++), which sees smooth and flaky sliced fish dressed in a hot and numbing pickled chilli sauce.We also recommend the Hengyang Stewed Vegetables ($15.90++), a delightful blend of beef tripe, beef, pig’s ears, and peanuts that creates a harmonious stew filled with rich umami flavour and a medley of different textures.For a 95-year-old breakfast eatery from China, read our Cai Lin Ji review.

We found the fried chicken well-marinated, with a crispy batter coating that wasn’t too thick or jelak.Another form of fried chicken you can indulge in is the Signature XL Chicken Cutlet ($9.50). You get a 300g slab of deep-fried chicken cutlet, paired with your choice of two sides.We found the fried chicken equally tender and juicy, with a sinfully crispy exterior that had a discernible black pepper flavour.There’s also the Signature XL Chicken Chop ($8.90) if you want something heavy, though we preferred the cutlet version as it was more shiok.Sides wise, you won’t go wrong with their house-made Onion Rings, made in-house using fresh onions. These thin shreds are absolutely addictive, and are far superior to the off-the-shelf frozen ones.If you want more carbs, fill up on their range of pasta.

https://eatbook.sg/snack-more/:["Filter By(Change?)Amid rows of packets stuffed with snacks from one’s childhood, it’s easy to feel a wave of nostalgia. After all, as Marcel Proust or the movie Ratatouille showed us, food has the ability to transport us to days bygone. Evoking that sort of emotion is a reason why Gavin Tan, 35, decided to open Snack More, a hole-in-the-wall old-school snack shop that also doubles as a “snack library” of sorts.Located in Jurong East’s Yuhua Market, Snack More is home to practically every childhood snack—iced gems, sugar crackers, kuih bangkit, you name it. Actually, it’s likely that most of us can’t properly name those snacks, even if we are familiar with their taste and appearance. This tendency is what inspired Gavin’s snack library concept, where every treat is labelled according to its product name.Notice how Gavin is wearing a VHS T-shirt. This man loves his nostalgia.“Most shops don’t label their snacks, so it’s up to the customer to recognise what they look like,” explained Gavin. “Because I label each snack, my customers know the name of what they are buying. And if they’ve never tried it before, the name gives them a better idea about its flavour.”He then pointed at a colourful love letter-type snack. “For example, if I don’t label this Rainbow Strawberry Stick, you will never know it has a strawberry filling before eating it!”With the multitude of snacks available at the store, we wanted to know which ones people are most fond of. Gavin noted that the aforementioned iced gems—oval biscuits crowned with icing—are by far the most popular. Other hits include small buns (AKA mini mantou), sultana biscuits, and lemon puffs. Snack More really does provide a comprehensive collection of treats.Of course, Gavin is under no illusion that he’s some kind of snack archivist—Snack More is first and foremost a business. And so beyond just retro snacks, Gavin has cast his net as wide as possible, offering coffee beans, wholesale drinks, dried foods and more. He has also turned to the Internet to broaden his customer base.“I’ve got quite a lot of aunties buying from me every day, but most of them live nearby. People from Punggol won’t be coming here,” Gavin chuckled. “So I’ve been focusing on e-commerce, which has a much larger reach.”Snack More is now on Shopee, foodpanda, and GrabFood, so you can get your retro snack fix from Gavin without travelling to Jurong East. Should you choose to visit this snack library, however, you’ll be rewarded with a trip down memory lane.And for those with young ones, it may be a good idea to bring them along with you.“Some parents bring their kids to my stall and tell them ‘see, these are my childhood snacks!’ Then the children will get curious and want to try those,” Gavin said.If there’s one thing that can bridge generational gaps, it’s the universal love for snacks.For a story about Gen Z farmers in Singapore, read our Yili Farm feature.

We covered the first of these, 3 Meals a Day, in a previous article, and will now discuss the other stall, which is simply named Taste Good.3 Meals a Day: Famous Salted Egg Chicken Rice Stall At Sim Lim SquareImage credit: Setiawaty LukmanOf course, the close proximity of these stalls invites plenty of comparison between the two. Some, such as Google user Andrew Yin, believe that 3 Meals a Day offers a more flavourful salted egg sauce, while others including Setiawaty Lukman suggest that the chicken at Taste Good is juicier and chunker. It seems to be a rather close fight.\nImage credit: @ggrreedyA plate of Salted Egg Chicken w/ Rice at Taste Good will set you back $6. Fans of the stall have praised its wonderfully fragrant and savoury salted egg sauce, which also has a decent spicy kick. This sauce drenches the succulent pieces of chicken, which are fried till wonderfully crispy. If you prefer pork ribs, go for the Salted Egg Pork Ribs w/ Rice ($6.50) instead.\nImage credit: @munchamsterThose looking for a milkier rendition can opt for the Butter Chicken w/ Rice ($6.50). This dish also features fried chicken pieces, but they’re slathered with an addictive buttery sauce instead of salted egg yolk.There are a few other rice dishes worth checking out at Taste Good, too. The Dried Chilli Chicken w/ Rice ($6) is great for those looking for more piquant flavours, while the Ginger Onion Pork /w Rice ($6) is one of the more homely options on the menu. But if it’s your first time at Taste Good, make sure you give their salted egg chicken rice a shot first.For salted egg ayam geprek, read our Mrs Hen review.

What’s even more intriguing is that chef Tham will carve and serve the duck, and its crispy skin, to your table with pancakes, as if you’re dining in a Cantonese restaurant.\xa0There are only around 30 ducks available a day, so be sure to swing by right after lunchtime if you want to bag yourself a portion. Note that, unlike restaurants, Tham’s Roasted Delights does not fry the duck meat for you with noodles or rice. Instead, you just have the meat cut and served with a bit of sauce.\xa0You can also order the Black Truffle Roast Duck ($28 for half and $55 for a whole), but do note that a pre-order of at least one day is required. They’re also said to be the first hawker stall to offer this premium roast meat that’s normally served only at fancy Chinese restaurants!Each duck is coated in black truffle paste before it’s roasted, resulting in blackened, truffle-loaded skin that’s crispy and delightfully fatty.The meat underneath is juicy and tender as well, infused with a faint truffle aroma.If a full duck isn’t something you want or have the stomach space for, don’t worry. The stall still has plenty of other things to offer. Their Roast Duck Noodles ($4.50), for one, stars QQ mee kia and tender, fatty duck slices drizzled in a moreish soya sauce. The Char Siew Shao Rou Rice ($5.50) gives you the best of both worlds—siew yoke with melt-in-your-mouth fat, as well as a cap of crispy skin, and caramelised char siew.Those visiting in the morning can also look forward to the coffeeshop’s newly launched Kaya You Tiao Set ($4). On our visit, the breakfast item was an off-the-menu special, but it should be officially available by the time this article is out.Each fritter is slathered with pandan kaya and a slab of butter. It’s crispy, sweet and savoury, making it the ideal accompaniment to your cup of morning kopi.

https://eatbook.sg/patisserie-woo/:["Filter By(Change?)If you’re a fan of artisanal cakes and pastries, you may have heard of Patisserie Woo. Formerly known as Patissier Woo, the bakery cafe was founded by ex-banker Melissa Woo, and has three takeaway outlets islandwide. Most recently, they’ve unveiled their first dine-in concept at Guthrie House, located just a five-minute walk from Sixth Avenue MRT Station.The new flagship cafe is decked out in pastel hues and elegant floral motifs, making it a suitable place for intimate catchups. While the front of the cafe exudes a semi-luxurious look with plush sofas and marble tables, the back sports a more minimalist aesthetic, complete with larger tables for bigger groups.The entire cafe can also be booked for private events, including birthday parties and baby showers.At Patisserie Woo, they’ve mastered the art of blending classic European desserts with beloved Asian flavours such as yuzu, sour plum, and matcha. A classic flavour is the Meyer Lemon Tart ($9+), comprising a zesty Meyer lemon curd encased in their signature tart crust. In case you’re wondering, those beautiful flower petals on their tarts are not just for show—they’re edible and locally sourced.Another crowd favourite is the Pistachio Tart ($9.50+), featuring house-made pistachio ganache, fluffy pistachio sponge, and a crispy wafer, all encased in a crumbly tart crust and finished with caramelised pistachios.During our visit, Melissa mentioned that their Yuzu Mango Cake ($7.50+) was another popular pick. This citrusy cake features a fluffy almond sponge piped with Koichi yuzu mousse and layered with mango jelly, offering a harmonious blend of sweet and tangy flavours.Chocolate fans can order the Chocolate Banana Parfait ($10+) instead, which sees a moist chocolate sponge topped with fresh whipped cream and banana slices. Otherwise, the Matcha Opera Cake ($7.50+) is also a must-try, starring a soft matcha sponge layered with dark chocolate ganache and rich matcha buttercream.Patisserie Woo has also launched a range of new gelato flavours, all whipped up from scratch and free from preservatives and additives. Their gelato flavours are available on a rotational basis and are crafted in small batches daily.We recommend the Pistachio ($6+) for something nutty and rich, or the Pink Guava & Sour Plum ($5+) for something tangy and refreshing. The consistency of the latter is something between that of a gelato and a sorbet, though it leans towards a creamier texture compared to your average sorbet. It’s also vegan and dairy-free.Try their Sables & Cream ($5+) too, which is the cafe’s take on the classic cookies and cream flavour. Creamy and incredibly milky, this gelato is made with their popular Dark Chocolate Sea Salt cookies that are baked in-house.If you’re looking for a caffeine fix, Patisserie Woo’s got you covered with the usual suspects, including Flat White ($5+) and Long Black ($4+). During our visit, we had the Blueberry & Elderflower Spritzer ($6+), a refreshing concoction made using blueberries and elderflower compote.For more bakes and pastries, check out our best bakeries guide.

https://eatbook.sg/best-korean-snacks/:["Filter By(Change?)Everyone knows that Korea is the perfect destination to shop for snacks, but with so many options to choose from, buying gifts for your loved ones may be more challenging than it seems. Don’t sweat it, for we’ve narrowed down the best Korean snacks you should try the next time you’re in Korea. FYI, our list will introduce snacks that are not as commonly known as the popular honey butter chips. But not to worry, these snacks are readily available at most convenience stores and supermarkets in Korea!Table of ContentsBest Korean snacks to buy for your friends and family1. Yakgwa2.

Crunky Crunch ChocolateGuide to the best Korean snacks\nTable of ContentsImage credit: @platems_Yakgwa (~KRW3,000/~SGD3.10) is a deep-fried cookie made with a variety of ingredients, such as honey, ginger, sesame oil, and sugar syrup. The soft and cookie-like texture makes this snack extra delightful, and you get a good amount of sweetness with every bite. We highly recommend heating it up for a couple of minutes, then pairing it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream—the hot and cold combination is to die for.\xa0Image credit: @7_7hahKnown as one of the most popular snacks in Korea, Homerun Ball (~KRW1,600/~SGD1.65) is a classic that has been around for more than 40 years now. This snack features mini puff pastries with fillings in a variety of flavours such as Chocolate, Custard Cream, Tiramisu, and Milk. It’s so versatile that it can be eaten as a form of cereal submerged in milk, or air fry them for about three minutes for a crunchy yet airy texture—my personal favourite method.\nImage credit: @jin041900Shrimp crackers is one of the many things Nongshim is known for, so it’s no surprise that the recent launch of Muktae Kkang (~KRW1,700/~SGD1.75) took social media platforms by storm. This addictive snack is a winning combination of prawn crackers tossed in a dried pollack seasoning and zhnged up with a chilli mayonnaise flavour. Many netizens have shared online that Muktae Kkang is a three-in-one snack as you get salty, spicy, and sweet all in a bite. It’s also said to be a good pairing with beer, which makes for a perfect midnight movie snack.\nImage credit: @mundimunjiIf you’re partial to cheese, the Baked Yellow Cheese Rusk (~KRW1,800/~SGD1.86) will surely float your boat. These little squares of toasted bread are fully covered in yellow cheese powder, which is said to taste similar to cheddar cheese. You can expect a crunchy texture and a touch of saltiness from the yellow cheese powder. Take note that this snack is only available at the Korean convenience store chain CU, which you can easily find in every corner of the country.\xa0Image credit: @everthine__Mochi fans will love Milk Tteok (~KRW1,800/~SGD1.86), which features two pieces of chewy glutinous rice cakes stuffed with bean paste, and coated in castella powder. This moreish snack comes in two other flavours, namely Strawberry and Chocolate, but the milk flavour is known to be the most popular among Korean patrons.Image credit: @tmtmtm_01Celebrating its 50th anniversary this year is Goguma Kkang (~KRW1,700/~SGD1.75), a crispy sweet potato-flavoured snack coated in sweet syrup and black sesame seeds. The sweetness from the syrup coating is tempered with the sweet potato flavour, and the black sesame seeds add a pleasant nuttiness to the overall taste. You can also find this snack in other flavours, including Corn, Potato, and Onion.\nImage credit: @hwa.ngaengBelow Cream Canele (~KRW3,500/~SGD3.61) is the latest craze among Koreans as it was first introduced by a popular cafe brand, Below. What’s interesting about their canele is that it’s shaped like a mini donut, instead of the cylindrical shape we commonly see. You can get your hands on a variety of flavours, such as Hazelnut, Green Tea, Earl Grey, and Chocolate. Take note that this snack can only be found at GS25, AKA one of the giant convenience chain stores in the country.Image credit: @kkkiii777A popular snack for people of all ages is Butter Coconut (~KRW1,700/~SGD1.75). This snack isn’t too heavy on flavours, and we surmise it will be to the liking of many Singaporeans as the coconutty flavour is prominent. If you want to take it a step further, you can make a sandwich using a slab of butter and two biscuits to create a rich and flavourful combination. Otherwise, we recommend dipping it in a cup of hot coffee!Image credit: @haitai_coFrench Pie (~KRW3,700/~SGD3.82) has been around for more than 40 years thanks to the unceasing support of its patrons. This snack is well-loved for its crispy and buttery pie that pairs really well with the sweet strawberry jam. Besides strawberry, French Pie comes in other flavours such as Apple and Chocolate. We recommend having the French Pie with coffee or tea as they make a great pairing.\xa0\nImage credit: @_.youngleThere’s nothing better than some chocolate when you’re in need of a sugar rush. Crunky Crunch Chocolate (~KRW2,000/~SGD2.06) is the ideal snack to bring around when you’re on the go. Plus, you don’t have to worry about the chocolates melting under Singapore’s unforgiving heat as the chocolate bits are stored in a container. The best part is that you’ll find bits of biscuits and peanuts within each piece, thereby elevating the crunchy texture of the candy!We hope this article comes in handy when you’re in a dilemma about the best Korean snacks to buy on your holiday.

https://eatbook.sg/kemuri-bbq/:["Filter By(Change?)If you love discovering hidden gems in unexpected places, you’ve come to the right place. A little birdie recently told me about Kemuri BBQ, a new addition in the Balestier hood that’s still fairly under the radar—not for long, though. After hearing about their legit house-smoked meats and affordable donburi, we cleared our schedules and dropped by for lunch on a weekday.Here’s a little background: Kemuri BBQ is helmed by Chef Davis Ng (left), a 26-year-old who also happens to be a professional boxer. In full transparency, I first tried their rice bowls at a pop-up during a boxing event a few months ago. Fast forward to today, the young chef has set up his Texan-inspired smokehouse and restaurant at Balestier Plaza!Ajoomma Korean Charcoal BBQ Restaurant Review: Wagyu And Iberico K-BBQ With Free-Flow Sides In Telok AyerVisit for lunch and you’ll be greeted with a smorgasbord of Texan-Japanese donburi lined up on the menu; take your pick from a whopping total of 10 flavours.In any given rice bowl, the star of the show is the meat, painstakingly prepared in-house using their trusty smoker, “Rocky”. Fun fact: Davis spent six months in Autin, Texas, cutting his teeth at the famous Leroy and Lewis Barbecue.Back to the food: we started with a bang with the Smoked Beef Cheeks Donburi ($17.90+/$21.90+). Depending on how hungry you feel, you get to choose between two sizes: medium and large. We went for the medium portion for all our orders.If you love any form of smoke—wok hei included—their braised beef cheeks are to die for. These sizeable slices of beef cheeks were meltingly tender, with just the perfect amount of gelatinous layers that added texture and flavour to each bite. The glorious, abundant char on the edges was the cherry on top.They were also topped with a savoury pepper sauce, which I could do less of as I felt it stole some limelight from the already well-executed meat.If you want something less smoky but no less delicious, I’d recommend the Smoked Beef Curry Rice ($15.90+/$18.90+). Each bowl comprises a generous portion of pearl rice, Japanese curry, potato and carrot chunks, beef brisket, and the same sides offered in every donburi: onsen egg, kimchi, pickles, corn.According to Davis, the Japanese curry sauce is made from the trimmings of the brisket chunks that feature in this dish. The bits are lightly smoked and then incorporated into the sauces for their curry and sukiyaki rice bowls. We noticed that this resulted in a slight smokiness that balanced out the sweetness of the curry.The brisket chunks were also delicious and well-seasoned, though not as melt-in-the-mouth as the cheeks. They held a firmer bite and were slightly leaner, which I personally preferred.Break into the yolk and mix it all together; the creaminess of the egg complemented the flavourful curry sauce well.We were also impressed with the condiments served in each donburi. The kimchi, in particular, added a much-needed tang and crunch to the rich bowls of meat and rice. It’s not house-made but sourced from a Korean restaurant instead.To my surprise, the Bacon Donburi ($15+/$18+)\xa0made it to the top of my list. This was a unanimous favourite at the table, solely for the thick-cut bacon that’s smoked in-house.The smoked bacon strips were the highlight of my entire experience at Kemuri BBQ. Each slice was proper thicc and chunky, boasting just the right amount of fat and meat. They were sufficiently smoky, yet not overly salty, so you could even enjoy them sans rice.The smoking process creates the Maillard reaction, which is responsible for the browning of food—there was a decent amount of char on each bacon strip. The meat was packed with rich, smoky, and umami flavours, rounded out with a subtly sweet fragrance from the Applewood.If you want to go over the top like we did here, drizzle some of your broken yolk on a bacon strip for an extra shiok pairing.Besides the rice bowls, which are available from 11am to 3pm daily, there’s a separate dinner menu served from 5pm.For both lunch and dinner, you can get Tebasaki Wings AKA crispy smoked wings at $15+ for four. We found them to be a tad dry, though with an addictively smoky aroma.BlackGoat Review: XL Fried Chicken Burger, Black Garlic Steak And More By Ex-Michelin Restaurant ChefKemuri BBQ sits in an inconspicuous corner on the ground floor of Balestier Plaza, an old mall that’s rather out of the way if you’re taking public transport. It’s a short bus ride from Toa Payoh, Novena, or Boon Keng MRT Station, though some walking is involved.The air-conditioned eatery sports a no-frills decor with two white tables on one side and a few more counter-seats on the other.

https://eatbook.sg/best-ondeh-ondeh-singapore/:["Filter By(Change?)Whether you call it ondeh ondeh, ondeh-ondeh, or onde-onde, this chewy green kueh is a nostalgic favourite for many of us. Made with glutinous rice and hand-shaped to bite-sized balls, each round is traditionally infused with pandan, hence its appearance. Upon biting, a molten, gooey gula melaka centre is revealed. Fun fact: it originated from Indonesia, and is also known as klepon in Javanese!As someone who grew up eating ondeh ondeh all my life—my siblings and I would often fight over the last ball in the box—it’s taken an unequivocal spot as my favourite Nyonya kueh. Hence, I sought to rank some of the best ondeh ondeh in Singapore, with big names such as Molly’s Kueh and Bengawan Solo in the mix.As with all other handmade snacks, the quality of each ondeh ondeh might differ based on who’s making it for the day. Personal preferences are another key variable. For example, you may not agree with what I deem as the perfect ondeh: soft and chewy with a hint of natural pandan aroma, packed with a rich gula melaka lava middle that isn’t too sweet.To set out this task, I came up with four main criteria: taste, texture, filling, and value.A good ondeh ondeh should be well-balanced in flavour; each component should not overpower in terms of taste. This applies to the skin and the filling—both should complement each other. Bonus points are also awarded if the ondeh skin has a pleasant pandan fragrance.Next, the texture of the skin is important. It should be soft but not mushy, with a slight chew. It should not be too thick either.As for the filling, we’re rating it based on how much you get in each ball, in comparison to the amount of skin. The gula melaka filling should also be fresh and come with a rich depth of sweetness without being too jelak.Lastly, the value-for-money aspect: we’re talking about the price per box in relation to the size of each piece.We also made sure to visit each stall in the morning, before noon. Based on personal experience, ondeh ondeh is best purchased in the early part of the day, as its key ingredients (such as coconut) are prone to turning bad if left out for a prolonged period of time, especially with our humid climate.Ang Mo Kio Nonya Kueh is a familiar name among Hougang residents, having been in the same spot under a HDB block for over 20 years. The hidden neighbourhood gem offers handmade kueh displayed without prices, including Ondeh Ondeh. A box of six goes at $2, making it the cheapest of the lot.Interestingly, most of the ondeh balls in all the boxes were tainted with brown spots from the molten gula melaka filling, suggesting leakage during the cooking process.\xa0 Nonetheless, each piece held a generous amount of palm sugar liquid that burst in the mouth without much effort.\xa0Unfortunately, the filling was way too sweet, whereas the skin had a bit of a weird aftertaste. Also, the kueh skin was on the thicker side, though it was sufficiently soft and chewy.Yet, all that isn’t enough to deter me from buying a box if I’m ever in the area—especially when I factor in its price tag.Taste: 2.5/5\nTexture: 3.5/5\nFilling: 2/5\nValue: 4.5/5Total: 62.5%Address: Hougang Avenue 3, #01-62 Block 7, Singapore 530007\nOpening hours: Tue-Sun 8:30am to 6:30pm\nTel: 6455 4839\nAng Mo Kio Nonya Kueh is not a halal-certified eatery.Another popular Hougang spot is Molly Nonya Kuehs, which has been around since 1971. I’d like to preface that Molly’s regular-sized ondeh ondeh were so popular they had already sold out before we reached the store at 11am. So we had to settle on their XL size, priced at $0.90 each. The golf ball-sized ondeh was hefty and weighed a fair bit. At under $1 a pop, I thought it was a great deal for the portion I got.While the giant ondeh ball didn’t have the usual molten palm sugar filling, the centre was liberally packed with brown shredded coconut. It seems like the coconut had been cooked in gula melaka, as it had a rich depth of sweetness and caramelly flavour, but wasn’t jelak. This was an enjoyable treat at an unbeatable price, and it wasn’t a bad rendition at all—I just wished the skin was a little less doughy.Now I have to try their regular ondeh ondeh to see if it’s worth the hype.Taste: 3/5\nTexture: 3/5\nFilling: 3.5/5\nValue: 4/5Total: 67.5%Address: 104 Hougang Avenue 1, #01-1121, Singapore 530104\nOpening hours: Mon, Sat 4am to 6:30pm, Tue-Fri 4am to 7:30pm, Sun 4am to 5pm\nTel: 6286 4234\nWebsite\nMolly’s Nonya Kuehs is not a halal-certified eatery.Family-run eatery Makko Teck Neo\xa0has been around for over 20 years, dishing out classic Peranakan fare and Nyonya kueh that’s prepared with traditional recipes. Their Ondeh Ondeh costs $3 for a box of six mini balls and comes coated with copious amounts of shaved coconut.I found the kueh skin to be on the chewier end. The balls were also the smallest of the lot, so you were getting less bang for your buck. But this also meant each ondeh had more filling than skin, so the eating experience was very shiok.While the gula melaka was delicious—it had a rich depth of flavour with a caramelly sweetness—I found it a tad too sweet. Also, the palm sugar taste had overwhelmed the pandan flavour of the ondeh skin, though I didn’t really mind it.Taste: 3.5/5\nTexture: 3.5/5\nFilling: 4/5\nValue: 3/5Total: 70%Address:\xa035 Telok Blangah Rise, #01-303, Singapore 090035\nOpening hours: Daily 10am to 9pm\nTel: 6275 1330\nWebsite\nMakko Teck Neo is not a halal-certified eatery.HarriAnns Nonya Table\xa0is a well-known family business that started out as a humble pushcart stall back in the 1940s. We visited their flagship Tiong Bahru Food Centre store, said to have been around since 1950.NGL, $3.80 for a box of six was pretty pricey. Nonetheless, HarriAnn’s Ondeh Ondeh was well-executed—each round was consistently good, with soft and slightly chewy skin, packed with a lava-like filling that came with a crunchy gula melaka in the middle. The palm sugar centre tasted fresh and wasn’t too sweet, though it’s worth noting that one ball had already burst in the box.Taste: 4/5\nTexture: 4/5\nFilling: 4/5\nValue: 2.5/5Total: 72%Website | Full list of outlets\nHarriAnns Nonya Table is not a halal-certified eatery.It doesn’t come as a surprise to me that Bengawan Solo\xa0made it to third place on this list of the best ondeh ondeh in Singapore. After all, I grew up eating Bengawan Solo’s ondeh ondeh as the popular homegrown brand was so readily accessible since they’re found at most neighbourhood malls!\xa0If there’s one word to describe Bengwan Solo’s ondeh ondeh, it’s “well-balanced”. Each round came with a balanced skin-to-filling ratio, with a delicious gula melaka filling that wasn’t too sweet. There was a slightly pandan fragrance that complemented the rich notes of the palm sugar, though I wished there were some crunchy sugar bits within for some textural contrast.10 Best Pandan Cakes In Singapore From $1.50Of course, $4.20 for a box of six is steep, but I think it’s worth the splurge if the cravings hit.Taste: 4.5/5\nTexture: 4.5/5\nFilling: 4/5\nValue: 2/5Total: 75%Website | Full list of outlets\nBengawan Solo is not a halal-certified eatery;I knew I had to place Kim Choo Kueh Chang on the list as I was impressed with their Ondeh Ondeh\xa0when I first tried them last year.

Although it was on the thinner end, the soft and chewy skin held up well against the palm sugar middle that oozed out immediately after I sank my teeth into the kueh. The filling was rich and robust, with palm sugar bits for added texture.My only gripe, if any, was that the pandan fragrance of the skin could be stronger.Check out our Kim Choo Kueh Chang review!Taste: 4/5\nTexture: 4/5\nFilling: 4.5/5\nValue: 4.5/5Total: 82.5%Address: 60 Joo Chiat Place, Singapore 427784\nOpening hours: Daily 9am to 9pm\nTel: 6344 0830\nWebsite\nKim Choo Kueh Chang is not a halal-certified eatery.Kim Choo Kueh Chang: Legendary Nyonya Dumplings And Kueh At Joo ChiatOpen since 1989, Lina Confectionery is an unassuming store that sits on the ground floor of a Bukit Merah HDB block, a couple of units away from Rookie’s Coffee Shop.

https://eatbook.sg/lina-confectionery/:["Filter By(Change?)I love all kinds of kueh. Traditional Nyonya kueh, Teochew soon kueh—you name it, I love it. On my recent venture to suss out the best ondeh ondeh in Singapore, I came across Lina Confectionery, an under-the-HDB gem hidden in the Bukit Merah heartlands.7 Best Ondeh Ondeh In Singapore Ranked, Including Bengawan Solo And Kim ChooAfter finding out that they’ve been around in the same spot since 1989, I knew I had to pay them a visit.Lina Confectionery’s storefront is like a blast from the past. That’s not surprising though, when you take into account that they’ve been there for well over 30 years. Peek inside and you’ll see what looks to be a small office and workstation where kueh is handmade fresh on-site every day. It’s as if nothing has changed over the decades.One of their most popular items is the Bika Ambon ($1.50), casually known as honeycomb cake. This Indonesian kueh is made with tapioca flour, coconut milk, and yeast for a slightly fermented flavour. It’s soft, chewy, and sweet, with a gorgeous caramelised top.The Kueh Kosui ($2.60)\xa0comes highly recommended, too. This gula melaka-infused kueh has a faint pandan fragrance and a wobbly texture.

https://eatbook.sg/jin-yu-man-tang/:["Filter By(Change?)Jin Yu Man Tang Dessert Shop along East Coast that specialises in Chinese desserts. With its hipster decor and quiet ambience, it’s a great place to not only enjoy a sweet treat but also chill with your friends on a lazy afternoon.Desserts today feed our tummies and IG-feed, so it’s no surprise that their Signature Ginger Milk Pudding ($4.70) involves some theatrics. Get your cameras ready as a staff member deftly pours warm milk into a bowl of ginger syrup. It may seem quite straightforward, but the pouring has to be perfectly timed. Cover the mixture with a ceramic plate and allow it to cool for four minutes. Now, the transformation begins. Kiasu as we may be, resist the urge to check on the state of the dessert. Prematurely uncovering it disrupts the cooling process and renders a watery texture instead. If done right, the pudding is as dreamily silky as the softest tofu. Dissolving instantly in my mouth, it coursed through my taste buds with gentle waves of milkiness. As they quickly dissipated, a musky spiciness lingered on my throat.Admittedly, the earthy aftertaste was a flavour I’m not used to. However, it grew on me with every spoonful and I gradually appreciated how it prevented the pudding from being too jelak.Peach gum is uncommon in Singapore, so I was def’ eager to try their Peach Gum + Milk ($4.70). For those who are unaware, peach gum is resin directly harvested from peach trees. Rich in collagen, it’s a natural skin supplement that is often compared to bird’s nest. While peach gum usually carries a floral fruitiness, the ones here had a surprisingly mild taste, since their natural essence had thoroughly infused this dessert. Peachy accents permeated the milk inside out, complementing the creamy notes of the milk.For those who gravitate towards local flavours, their Black Sticky Rice with Coconut Cream + Mango ($5) will be right up your alley. Otherwise known as Pulut Hitam, this dessert is prepared by boiling glutinous rice with pandan leaves. While some grains of glutinous rice coagulated into soft clumps, others preserved their grainy exterior. This created an interesting duality of textures, as every spoonful of rice supplied both chewy and firm bites.A faint pandan scent perfumed the black sticky rice, accentuating its red bean-like sweetness. Thanks to a generous drizzle of coconut milk, a creamy and nutty aftertaste lingered on my tongue. Mango and glutinous rice usually form an amazing pairing. \xa0However, the addition of diced mangoes here backfired, as they overwhelmed the sweet glutinous rice with their tartness this time.On the other hand, their Mango Pomelo Sago ($5) will appeal to fans of old-school Cantonese desserts. A blend of mango puree and milk, this classic was topped with diced mangoes and slivers of pomelo.Uniformly mix the fresh milk with the mango puree and enjoy the thick mango paste gliding over your tongue. The sago pearls stashed within it added a velvety touch which enhanced the smooth texture of the paste.Every mouthful of this luscious paste coated my tongue with sweetness. Just when it seemed a tad cloying, the pomelo eased in and refreshed my palate with its citrusy undertones.\u200cAlas, the diced mango was once again the undoing of an otherwise stellar dessert, as it outshone the other flavours with its astringency. Jin Yu Man Tang is a beautiful juxtaposition of elements. Housed within its white walls are wooden tables placed adjacent to leather chairs. A hanging chair, resting quietly in a corner of the room, faces an assortment of plants.\u200cIt’s a part chic cafe, part Chinese dessert store – a layout that shouldn’t work but does. Couple that with soothing Mandopop songs and lots of natural lighting, and you’ve got a cosy hideout to relax at.The only downside is its inaccessible location, as the place is a 14-minute bus ride from Dakota MRT Station. That being said, if you do make the trip down, you’ll find a wealth of great food options around the area, including Bei-ing Wanton Mee and Strands and Grains.Strands and Grains Review: Cheap And Good Western Food From $5 At KatongLike it or not, we do have a set perception of what constitutes cafe-worthy nosh. Drip coffee and butterfly pea drinks are worthy of the ‘gram, whereas tang yuan and tau suan are often eaten in a jiffy. Perhaps we forget that a simple bowl of red bean soup takes as much preparation as a cafe dish.Thankfully, Jin Yu Man Tang Dessert is taking a good step forward. By providing a comfortable setting to enjoy affordable and classic Chinese desserts, they are setting the groundwork for a greater appreciation for Chinese desserts.Address: 66 East Coast Road, #01-03, The Flow, Singapore 428778\nOpening hours: Daily 11:30am to 10:30pm\nTel: 6214 3380\nWebsite\nJin Yu Man Tang Dessert Shop is not a halal-certified eatery.Photos taken by Pepita Hope Wauran.\nThis is an independent review by Eatbook.sg.SummaryPros\n— Comfortable setting\n— Delicious ginger milk pudding\n— Affordable prices\n— Extensive dessert menuCons\n— Inaccessible locationRecommended Dishes: Ginger Milk Pudding ($4), Peach Gum + Milk + White Fungus ($5), Black Sticky Rice with Coconut Cream + Mango ($4.50)Opening hours: Daily 11:30am to 10:30pmAddress: 66 East Coast Road, #01-03, The Flow, Singapore 428778Get more stories like this.Drop us your email so you won't miss the latest news.Llamas are friends, not food.Eatbook offers honest reviews and recommendations on Singapore food.Eatbook.sg© 2023 - All Rights Reserved.\xa0Eatbook is part of TSL Media Group.Past Contest Winners.\xa0Privacy Policy"]
https://eatbook.sg/yi-zi-wei/:["Filter By(Change?)Note:\xa0The images used in this article were from Yi Zi Wei’s previous location, in Peace Centre, which we reviewed in 2020.Not one to shy away from my cravings, I’m a huge fan of buffets that allow me to choose from a wide variety of food. A good buffet is one that has a welcome amount of food without compromising on food quality, in favour of churning out batches and batches of food for hungry diners. Yi Zi Wei is one such buffet, and its immense variety and commendable quality of food left a lasting impression on me.The 6-in-1 buffet comes with free-flow steamboat, barbecue, Korean army stew, lok lok, mala xiang guo as well as mala soup. The mala xiang guo and mala soup come with a fixed set of ingredients.From 11am to 3pm from Monday to Thursday, their lunch buffet is priced at $23.90+ for adults, and $12.90+ for kids between six and 12 years old. Their dinner buffet pricing applies after 3.01pm, and it’s $33.90+ for adults and $17.90+ for kids. GST is already included in the price, so you’ll only find additional service charge on your bill.Yakiniku-Oh Review: A4 Wagyu Platters From $9.80++ At Somerset\n\nUpon walking into the restaurant, I was greeted by a large selection of meats and seafood meant for our hotpot feast.Since we visited on a cold rainy day, we decided to kick things off with a warm, comforting steamboat, and we got their tomato and mala broth in their duo pot.Tomato is my usual broth of choice in most steamboat restaurants due to its fragrance and natural sweetness, and having spotted bright red tomatoes, I was glad that Yi Zi Wei’s tomato broth was not prepared artificially, as mentioned by the restaurant staff. It had the right balance between acidity and sweetness, and each spoonful was refreshing.Each piece of meat was large, and when cooked, the tender meats offered a nice chew. Unlike most meats at the usual steamboat chains, the thicker cuts at Yi Zi Wei were able to absorb more of the broth, making the meats a tad bit juicier. If required, you can ask for a pair of scissors to cut your meats into smaller pieces.My colleague really loves spicy food, so he clamoured persistently for the spiciest mala broth. Unfortunately, he had to tone down his cravings for the sake of yours truly, who’s a spicy food amateur. Thus, we opted for the mala’s spiciness to be in the middle of the typical mala scale.When the mala broth was added into the duo pot, the harsh, pungent smell of chilli emanated through the air, a fitting prelude for what’s to come. Upon sighting the fiery redness of the broth that reflected off the shiny silvery surfaces of the pot, I started to fear for my tongue and stomach.After I took a spoonful, I felt as though a wave of heat had just washed over me. The broth had a spicy kick that gave rise to a tingling sensation on my tongue, followed by a slight numbness. Despite all that, it wasn’t all too overwhelming. I could still detect some tangy, peppery undertones, though I found the broth to be slightly salty.The prawns were sizeable and fresh, and peeling off their shells to reveal the sweet, succulent meat proved to be an easy task.The plump mussels looked promising as they gave off a nice yellow hue. However, they disappointed in the taste department. They tasted briny and slightly fishy, which highlighted their lack of freshness.The mini octopuses were a bite-sized treat, and we couldn’t stop popping them in our mouths. They were slightly chewy but not too rubbery.To accompany our meats and seafood, we could choose from many different types of sauces and condiments. This section is located right beside the selection of meats and vegetables dedicated to the steamboat.From the classic peanut sauce and sesame seeds to even kimchi, we had an abundance of choices. We do feel that the restaurant should have covered them with lids to ensure they were kept fresh.\xa0A smorgasbord of lok lok was available for our selection at the front of the restaurant. However, I was disappointed to see that there were not many actual meat items on sticks, as I mostly sighted processed food such as fish balls, sausages and crabsticks.Lok lok is usually dipped in soup, hence we immersed the sticks in the boiling broth, before hungrily tugging at the bite-sized pieces.The lok lok didn’t taste special, perhaps due to the simple ingredients available. The steamboat sauces and the broth added a greater depth of flavour to the otherwise bland sticks of food. If you’re not a big fan of meat dishes, perhaps you could focus your appetite on their lok lok selection, which consists of fewer meats.I’m a fan of fried lok lok, and I was elated when I heard it was available as part of the buffet. The fried lok lok choices are limited to those seen in the basket, and they consisted of some items that were not available in the lok lok selection at the front of the restaurant, such as boiled eggs wrapped in bacon.One way to differentiate a good lok lok place from a lacklustre one lies in their sauces. Most lok lok stalls have their own secret blend of sauces, and Yi Zi Wei’s is full of flavour. Dipping the fried sticks of joy into the sauce enhanced its flavour by tenfold, as the crisp, battered ingredients complemented the sweet and spicy sauce. Unlike the traditional lok lok previously, the fried lok lok impressed me with its depth of flavour and additional crunch factor.As if there were not already enough food, bowls of mala xiang guo are available as well. We couldn’t choose the ingredients, and I observed an apparent lack of red mala flakes in the bowl, despite the fact that I requested for a medium level of spiciness on the mala scale.The noodles were springy, and slurping the strands along with the tender meat was satisfying. The only qualm I had was that the mala taste could have been more intense, as the bowl lacked the jolt of numbing spiciness from my usual mala xiang guo experiences.Lovers of the soup version of mala would be happy to know that each steaming bowl of mala tang comes with generous portions of seafood and vegetables. I especially liked the large prawns and clams as they gave the soup a subtle saltiness.\xa0I love Korean barbecue, and I was glad to hear that barbecue is also part of the buffet. The common meats such as chicken, mutton, pork and beef are available, but with a slight twist.Yi Zi Wei’s special barbecue meats stole the show from this point onwards, and they’re actually the restaurant’s selling point. The brainchild of the restaurant owners, their Four Heavenly King dish features four types of marinated pork, namely flaming-hot mala, irresistibly sweet honey, appetising Si Fang, and tingling black pepper.\xa0Ribeye beef is also available for grilling here. This is a stark contrast to many other barbecue restaurants, which usually offer less tender cuts of beef to their customers.As expected, each morsel of beef was tender, flavourful, and had a slight chew to it. The grilling time of beef can’t be too long if you want maximum flavour. The beef should be almost cooked, yet retaining the right amount of moisture such that it’s not too dry and tough.My favourite barbecue meat has got to be their Beef In Beer, whereby tender beef slices are zhnged up with piquant Tsingtao beer and various chillies. Beer is known to break down beef fibres, producing a more succulent, melt-in-your-mouth texture.Upon being grilled, the juicy beef slices gave off an almost smoky fragrance, and the infused Tsingtao beer greatly enhanced the beef’s aroma and flavour. The chillies added a welcome element of heat to the dish, making for an interesting and tasty mouthful.That1 Review: $29.90+ Seafood Bucket And BBQ Steamboat Buffet At GeylangYi Zi Wei has a spacious interior, with wide tables and seats.

Joining the hip neighbourhood is Frites, a new kiosk along Arab Street\xa0that specialises in loaded beef fries.The Muslim-owned kiosk offers four flavours of Loaded Beef Fries ($10): Truffle, Mentaiko, Cheesy, Creamy Onion. We also spotted Swedish Meatballs ($10) on the menu, but the staff informed us that it’s no longer available.The thick-cut fries are fried to order and then topped with shabu-style beef slices. Thereafter, copious amounts of sauce are loaded onto the pile of greasy goodness. There’s so much sauce it spills over the side of the takeout box, creating the perfect drool-worthy shot for the ‘gram.if you’re one of those who always order mentaiko fries at genki, you’ll love this stall which sells HEAPING amounts of mentaiko atop chunky fries blanketed in juicy beef slices🤤🍟 this muslim-owned kiosk specialises in loaded beef fries, offering 4 luscious flavours: truffle, cheesy, creamy onion, and the crowd-favourite mentaiko. #sgfoodnews #neweats #sgfoodies #loadedfries #mentaikofries #hajilane #shabushabu #beeffries #chunkyfries #muslimowned #supportlocal  ♬ Attention – NewJeans  According to the staff, the fries we had tried were from a different supplier than before, so they’re said to be less crispy. This wasn’t an issue during our visit though, as we found them crispy and flavourful enough, with a fluffy interior.The Cheesy Loaded Fries come with warm nacho cheese that’s heated up in a bain marie.The snack is also topped with a dash of paprika for added smokiness.If you love sour cream and onion, try their Creamy Onion flavour.This came with a mild, creamy sauce spiked with onion powder, reminiscent of sour cream and onion-flavoured chips.Then there’s also the crowd favourite Mentaiko flavour, which gives Genki Sushi’s mentaiko fries a run for its money.The creamy mentaiko mayo, paired with the juicy beef strips and chunky fries, made this a winning combination in our books.Do note that Frites is a takeaway kiosk, but if you prefer sitting down, there’s a small table right outside for you to enjoy your fries.

https://eatbook.sg/ah-lim-chicken-rice/:["Filter By(Change?)You may be familiar with traditional Hainanese chicken rice balls, such as those from Hainan Chicken Rice Ball, but here’s one that we think is worth the journey to the East━Ah Lim Chicken Rice━which has adorable handcrafted chicken rice onigiri, and delicious chicken rice.Hainan Chicken Rice Ball Review: Old-School Chicken Rice Ball Stall Opposite Sim Lim TowerEstablished in May, Ah Lim Chicken Rice is managed by three brothers from the Lim Family who are deeply devoted to creating a delicious plate of chicken rice. This dedication shines in their thoughtfully executed chicken rice, where every step in the cooking process is carefully supervised.\xa0Count yourself lucky if you manage to snag their Chicken Rice Onigiri, which is available only on Saturdays! They come in sets of three for $10, and you can choose from three different flavours: Original, Spicy Steamed Chicken, and Egg Mayo.If you’re planning a party, consider their box of 12 ($60)━with four of each flavour━which is an ideal choice for a quick, filling, and fuss-free snack. Make sure to place your order in advance for this box.Onigirazu Don Review: $3.50 Onigiri Sandwiches And Donburi At This Bukit Panjang StallEach onigiri is meticulously handcrafted using Japanese pearl rice, with the rice being densely packed to a precise 120g using an onigiri mould. In fact, Ah Lim told us that just two of these onigiri are the equivalent of a full plate of chicken rice.The decor is not a simple task either. Finding the right shape of corn, crafting the eyes made of seaweed, and pre-cutting the carrot used to create the chicken’s “beard” all take time and attention to detail.Taste-wise, I appreciated that the chicken rice was exceptionally fragrant, thanks to Ah Lim’s choice of ingredients━there are seven ingredients that go into his rice! On top of the usual onion and garlic, he opted for the use of old ginger, which has a stronger and spicier flavour. What’s even more remarkable is that this flavour is achieved without using chicken oil, a common ingredient found in you fan, AKA oily rice. It’s a great option for those who are mindful of their health!While my favourite was the Original, which was packed full of concentrated chicken rice flavour, their Spicy Steamed Chicken onigiri was also pretty impressive. This was laced with their house-made chilli, which gave an immediate, potent kick. I liked that it was spicy, but not overwhelming to the point of being unbearable, making it irresistibly addictive.P.S.: The house-made chilli goes even better with their regular chicken rice.Another option that kids would love is the classic, creamy Egg Mayo which comes with slices of crisp cucumber.Moving on to Ah Lim’s chicken rice, a must-try is the Triple Prosperity Meal ($8.80), which I believe can satisfy two people. This dish showcases all three types of chicken available at the stall━steamed, soya sauce, and roasted━along with a whole lava egg, tau kwa, vegetables garnished with fried shallots, and a few slices of cucumber. There are also three different dips to pair with your chicken: garlic chilli, ginger, and a viscous premium black soya sauce.A notable mention is the well-prepared ajitama, which boasts a custard-like texture and a striking amber-hued yolk that’s achieved through the use of carrot-fed chicken eggs.\nImage credit: @ahlimchickenriceFor me, the most important component of chicken rice is definitely the rice. At Ah Lim, they cook their rice for three hours using Thai Hom Mali rice that has been aged for over a year. This particular variety has a lower amylose content, which makes it better at absorbing the broth and locking in flavour within every grain. The result is well-separated and fluffy rice that’s packed with flavour. However, I much preferred the Japanese pearl rice used in the onigiri, which was even tastier.What sets their chicken apart is the unique light soya sauce blend that they make, which comprises premium light soya sauce infused with a combination of young and mature pandan leaves to impart aroma and a subtle sweetness. This sauce not only adds flavour but also moderates the saltiness of soya sauce, and does not leave you feeling thirsty. The steamed chicken is tender with a gelatinous layer under the skin, which we found has a silky-smooth texture and a glossy sheen.The roasted chicken was succulent and juicy, but it would have been better IMO if the skin had been crispier.The standout for me was undoubtedly the soya sauce chicken, steeped in a sauce crafted from 13 handpicked herbs including luo han guo, or monk fruit. This sauce added a layer of complexity to the dish’s flavour profile, infusing it with sweet, herbal undertones that paired well with the rice.13 Soya Sauce Chicken Rice Stalls For When Hawker Chan’s Queue Is Too Long\nImage credit: Wong Song WeiSpecial mention has to go to their soup, which is served with all dishes. They offer the usual chicken soup as well as a soup of the day. This rotates among a variety of options including sweet corn soup, lotus root soup, black bean soup, white radish soup and more. I loved the chicken soup, which had a simple, clean flavour that cut through the richness of the chicken rice. Unlike many other soups served in chicken rice shops, I appreciated that their soup was robust and bodied, not tasting like plain peppery broth.If you find the Triple Prosperity Meal to be too indulgent, go for their Chicken Rice ($4.20) or Chicken Rice Set ($4.50) instead. Otherwise, they offer Chicken Porridge ($3) and Chicken Noodles ($5) too.\nImage credit: @ahlimchickenriceFor Halloween this year, they’ve spooked things up with this creepy eyeball that could easily pass as a horror movie prop. Drop by this weekend━on 28 and 29 October 2023━and simply say, “Just treats!” to get a free Halloween treat!

https://eatbook.sg/fei-zhu-lok-lok/:["Filter By(Change?)Update: Fei Zhu Lok Lok has moved to Toh Guan Road and Ang Mo Kio.Ask 10 people what they miss most about JB, and nine of them will probably tell you that it’s lok lok. I personally haven’t had many experiences with this street snack, but I can’t deny how addictive these skewered meats and vegetables are. With that, my colleague and I zipped down to Fei Zhu Lok Lok, hoping to relive those carefree times when we could travel to Malaysia as and when we pleased.Phyllis and Jueying are the two pretty best friends behind Fei Zhu Lok Lok. They’re only in their early twenties, joining the list of young hawkers who’ve recently broken out in the industry, such as Sticks ‘N’ Bowls and Mian Zhuang. Sticks ‘N’ Bowls Review: $1 Lok Lok And Mentaiko Salmon Don In Tampines Coffee ShopThe variety at Fei Zhu Lok Lok is pretty impressive, with over 20 items to choose from, and a good mixture of meats and vegetables. Each skewer is priced reasonably at $1. These were well-fried overall, without being too greasy. I also liked the seasoning they used, which was bright, salty, and addictive.Here, the chicken skewer was a touch dry. I preferred the mid wing, which was spicy-sweet, and well-marinated without the need for extra seasoning. It also managed to retain a juicy interior, while being crispy on the outside.Vegetables taste better when they’re deep-fried—there, I said it. Here, I enjoyed the crispy florets of the broccoli, slightly charred from frying. As for the mushrooms, the seasoning used brought out their natural earthy flavour. Meanwhile, I would have preferred the crunchy lady’s fingers on their own, without the slices of ham in between.Fei Zhu Lok Lok has a small selection of seafood skewers to boot, including scallop, fried ebi, and squid. A single scallop here costs the price of two sticks, and while plump and sweet, it’s something I feel you can do without. As for the fried ebi, they could afford to go lighter on the batter, as it stole the limelight from the prawn meat within. If the seasoning isn’t enough, Fei Zhu Lok Lok has four sauces available to dip into. We started with their house-made sauce, which looked like it would be fiery hot, with its bright orange colour, and speckles of chilli seeds within. Surprisingly, this wasn’t that spicy at all—in fact, it was bright, tangy, and slightly sweet. It definitely livened up the pork belly skewer, which we paired the sauce with.\xa0Meat-wise, I found the pork belly rather tough, though it seems like an unavoidable problem due to the cooking method used.The next sauce on the list is an unnamed, mayo-based dip, which happened to be my personal favourite. We paired this sauce with their smoked duck lok lok.This mayo-based sauce was creamy, with citrusy notes that cut through the heaviness of smoked duck. Meanwhile, the smoked duck was fried well, retaining a gelatinous layer of fat on top that was satisfying to bite into.For something more localised, there’s a belacan sauce available. This was the spiciest of the lot, with a robustness from shrimp paste. We had this with cheese tofu, which I wasn’t the biggest fan of, as there wasn’t enough cheese within. Since this is most likely an outsourced ingredient, Fei Zhu Lok Lok can’t be faulted for this. The last sauce we tried on our visit was the Thai sweet chilli sauce, which we dipped our luncheon meat skewer into. This tended towards the sweeter end of the spectrum, and I would have liked it with more spice. While it’s not my favourite, I can imagine it would sit well with children, or diners who can’t take spice.If you’d like some carbs to go along with your skewers, there’s a Shiok Rice ($1) available, slathered with their house-made sauce on top.Noodle-lovers can opt for the Shiok Mee ($1) instead, which sees springy instant noodles topped with the same house-made sauce. Do note that you’ll have to order a minimum of four sticks to purchase the rice or noodles.DLLM Lok Lok Review: Lok Lok Stall With $1 Skewers And Salted Egg Sauce That Opens Till 4amFei Zhu Lok Lok is located in an unassuming coffee shop, tucked within an industrial estate in Tai Seng. It only takes about five minutes to walk here from Tai Seng MRT Station.\xa0The coffee shop is clean and well-ventilated. When the sky turns dark, they dim the space, and put on coloured lights that flicker across the ceiling. Mandopop songs which are popularised by Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, blast from the speakers. These add to the JB vibes, which we so desperately crave, as we’re not able to cross the border anytime soon.Pint And Dine Review: Korean Mukbang Buffet With Free-Flow Korean Fried Chicken, Samyang And More At Tai SengLok lok is not a type of food to blow your mind, but feels so shiok to eat anyway. This stall elevates that, with a good selection of sauces, wallet-friendly prices, and lights and music to boot. Some items can be skipped, but overall, I much enjoyed my time here.

https://eatbook.sg/an-an-shan-shan-seafood-soup/:["Filter By(Change?)Often shortened to A.A.S.S. Seafood Soup, An An Shan Shan Seafood Soup has been an underrated staple of the Bedok area since 2010. Apparently, the head chef had previously worked at the famous Yan Ji Seafood Soup before eventually opening a stall of his own.\xa0When business took a hit during the pandemic years, he had considered shutting his stall for good. A group of young entrepreneurs were such fans of his seafood soup, however, that they offered to take ownership of the stall and its accompanying burdens just so the chef could continue serving it!With our expectations heightened, my colleague and I headed down to Bedok to try this apparently irreplaceable recipe for ourselves.\xa0Yan Ji Seafood Soup Review: Famous Seafood Soup In Marsiling For Over 35 YearsThe most affordable item on their menu is the Seafood Soup ($8.50/$10.50). It comprises three prawns, chunks of dory fish, and minced pork submerged in a flavourful broth. Rice is also available here as an add-on for $1.\xa0For the price, I was surprised to find that the prawns were not only large, but also incredibly fresh. The peeling process was almost effortless, and its flesh was sweet and succulent.\xa0The dory chunks, on the other hand, were firm, springy, and served in fairly large amounts. I didn’t find myself rationing my protein to have with my rice, which is always a plus.The highlight, of course, was the seafood broth. It had a prominent umami flavour and a subtle creaminess that lent it a more full-bodied taste. Due to the cloudiness of the soup, my colleague and I had thought that some kind of milk was added to enhance the flavour. We were surprised, then, when one of the owners informed us that the creaminess was derived purely from simmering the prawns for long hours.\xa0If you’re willing to splurge, consider ordering the Crayfish Seafood Soup ($16/18), an elevated version of the Seafood Soup that comes with a whole crayfish. FYI, the $16 version features dory fish, while the $18 one upgrades it to garoupa.\xa0Taste-wise, this broth had a more pronounced savoury flavour than the first one. We were told that this is because of the crayfish, as it is brinier than prawns.Like the prawns, the crayfish’s flesh came out of its shell easily. In contrast, it’s slightly more flaky than the prawns, with a texture that felt, to me, like a cross between lobster and crab.\xa0The garoupa was also firm and delicately sweet, with no hint of fishiness. Each slice was fairly large and thick, too, with a pleasantly bouncy layer of skin that made it all the more appetising. As someone who doesn’t usually enjoy fish skin because of its slimy texture, I was surprised to find myself devouring the slices whole, skin attached and all.\xa0To top it all off, An An Shan Shan has house-made chilli that is bright and tangy, and pairs nicely with the brininess of all the seafood.An An Shan Shan Seafood Soup occupies a stall in a small coffee shop that’s a six-minute walk from Bedok Mall and a ten-minute walk from Bedok MRT Station. It’s nestled within an HDB estate, so it was a little difficult to locate for a Westie such as myself.At about 11am on a Wednesday, the coffee shop was pretty empty for the entire duration of our meal. Although, I did notice that many of the diners who did drop by were there to patronise An An Shan Shan Seafood Soup.\xa0Prices might seem steep for a hawker stall, but the high-quality ingredients used at An An Shan Shan Seafood Soup, in my opinion, justifies them. My only gripe is that it currently only has one location in Bedok, which is pretty far in the East. One of the owners did tell us that they are considering expanding to other parts of the island, though, so it might only become more accessible from here.\xa0Since you’re in the area, consider checking out Fatty Patty Burger And Grill, a burger joint helmed by young hawkers. Alternatively, head to MZW Bakery for cheap chiffon cakes with unique flavours!Address: Block 418 Bedok North Avenue 2, #01-97, Nature Park Coffee Shop, Singapore 460418\nOpening hours: Tue-Sun 11am to 8:30pm\nTel: 8398 7155\nWebsite\nAn An Shan Shan Seafood Soup is not a halal-certified eatery.Fatty Patty Burger and Grill Review: Vodka Beef Burgers And Whisky Ribeye By Young HawkersPhotos taken by Daryl Lim.\nThis was a media tasting at An An Shan Shan Seafood Soup.SummaryPros– Fresh seafood\n– Rich and flavourful broth\n– Fragrant house-made chilli\n– Generous portionsCons– Might be pricey for some\n– Not the most convenient location\xa0Recommended dishes: Seafood Soup ($8.50/$10.50) and Crayfish Seafood Soup ($16/18)Opening hours: Tue-Sun 11am to 8:30pmAddress: Block 418 Bedok North Avenue 2, #01-97, Nature Park Coffee Shop, Singapore 460418Get more stories like this.Drop us your email so you won't miss the latest news.the horrors are endless but i stay sillyEatbook offers honest reviews and recommendations on Singapore food.Eatbook.sg© 2023 - All Rights Reserved.\xa0Eatbook is part of TSL Media Group.Past Contest Winners.\xa0Privacy Policy"]

Not only is the nasi light yet lemak, but the chicken leg it comes with is also deep-fried on order and well-marinated with lemongrass, turmeric powder, and ginger.

Although the gravy does not include egg like Singaporean-style hor fun does, it is still rich in umami, due to the chicken bones, prawns, and prawn heads that it’s been stewed with.

Served in a claypot with ladies’ fingers and garlic, the pork ribs are drenched in a treacly dark soya sauce. The sauce packs a punch, as it’s cooked with dry chilli, but it also has a hint of umami, due in part to the addition of dried cuttlefish.

https://eatbook.sg/ym-bakery/:["Filter By(Change?) Having been open for four years now in the basement of PLQ Mall, YM Bakery appears to be a well-kept secret of Paya Lebar. Despite the lack of media coverage, the humble store has quietly amassed a host of loyal customers and glowing reviews on Google.\xa0Most recently, though, it garnered attention on TikTok, where users highlighted their value-for-money quiche and tarts—for as low as $3.50, diners can get high-quality pastries made from scratch daily. Hearing all this fanfare, we had to head down to try their bakes for ourselves.\xa011 Hawker Bakeries In Singapore For Black Sesame Financiers, Old-School Doughnuts And More Starting with the savoury items, one of the cheapest options at the bakery is the Spinach And Mushroom Quiche ($3.50). As its name suggests, it features spinach and mushroom in a mixture of egg and milk that’s baked in a pie crust.\xa0The ingredients might appear unassuming, but the quiche was surprisingly moreish. The egg, spinach and mushroom filling was well-seasoned, and the crust was not too dense, with just the right amount of crumble to it.\xa0 I enjoyed the Spinach And Mushroom Quiche, but its more luxe counterpart, the Truffle Parma Ham Quiche ($5), was even better.\xa0Here, prosciutto and truffle accompanies spinach and mushroom, making this quiche more savoury and fragrant than the first one. It is a tad bit pricier than the Spinach And Mushroom Quiche, but I personally wouldn’t mind paying a little more for the more robust flavours of this ham and truffle bake.\xa0\xa0Moving on to the sweets: their best seller is the Lemon Meringue Tart ($3.50), a beloved classic that stars lemon curd filling in shortcrust pastry, topped with fluffy meringue. It’s easy to see why this is their most popular item—it’s not only delicious, but also one of the bakery’s cheapest items.The subtle sweetness of the meringue complemented the tangy lemon curd well, while the crust provided some textural contrast to their smooth and soft textures.\xa0\xa0Next is the Banoffee Tart ($4.70), which blends flavours of banana, coffee and chocolate. The result is a delicately sweet and pleasantly bitter dessert with a soft, creamy texture.Taste-wise, I expected this to be richer than the Lemon Meringue Tart, but was surprised to find that it was pretty light on the palate. Overall, the Banoffee Tart was my favourite item out of the four we tried.If quiche and tarts aren’t your cup of tea, YM Bakery also has a selection of pies and muffins, priced from $1.90. YM Bakery is more of a takeaway counter, but it does have a few small tables in front of the counter for people to dine in. When we were there on a Friday afternoon, many of the customers dabao-ed their orders, so the seating area was not too crowded.\xa0PLQ is directly accessible from Paya Lebar MRT Station, making it a convenient location for those who stay in the East. While it’s not the most convenient location for Westies, it’s worth dropping by.\xa0YM Bakery is an unpretentious, no-frills bakery with a menu full of simple yet delicious offerings. They may not have the most IG-worthy food or decor, but if you’re looking for high-quality bakes and pastries that don’t break the bank, this is it. Given that Paya Lebar MRT Station is just a few stops away from Central Singapore, I wouldn’t mind paying them a visit again very soon.\xa0Since you’re in the area, check out our Paya Lebar Square and PLQ food guide.

https://eatbook.sg/kohaku-sabo/:["Filter By(Change?)The craze over Tendon Kohaku may be over, but the brand isn’t resting on their laurels. New to their group is Kohaku Sabo, or 琥珀茶房 in Kanji—the last two characters, 茶房, read chá fáng in Chinese, and that’s exactly what Kohaku Sabo is: a teahouse. Hopping on the bandwagon after seeing photos of their dishes pop up on social media, we headed down to Chinatown Point to try their fare.The Hainan Story Opens In Chinatown With Chwee Kueh Lasagna And MoreIf there’s one udon dish that you should order at Kohaku Sabo, it’s their\xa0Mentaiko Cream Sauce Udon Ikura Topping ($23.80++). All their sets come with silky-smooth chawanmushi, radish pickles, and a bowl of soup.It’s not spotlighted in the name of the dish, but this mentaiko udon comes with decadent lobes of uni, on top of the copious amounts of ikura that’s spooned over the udon.We were surprised by how the mentaiko cream sauce wasn’t cloying or overly savoury, nor was it too creamy, rendering it jelak—the pops of salmon roe helped.I loved the addition of chiffonaded shiso leaves, which added a herbaceous, slightly minty note to the udon. Be sure to mix the uni into the udon so its briny, sweet flavour blankets each strand.We moved on to the\xa0Carbonara Udon ($17++), which gets you the same chewy, thick strands of wheat noodles, here topped with copious amounts of shaved parmesan, raw egg, and thick slices of fried bacon.I’d recommend sharing this with a friend; whilst creamy and indulgent, it does get rather jelak.The chewy thickness of the udon does hold up well against the rich, cheesy and savoury carbonara sauce, I have to admit. And for more plus points, there was a sufficient amount of it to evenly coat every last inch of noodle.Another signature dish at\xa0Kohaku Sabo is Ikura Salmon Cutlet with Avocado on Flavoured Rice ($24.80++), which is presented with a mini saucepan of tartare sauce with a soft-centred egg, a little bowl of ikura, as well as a dressing that was aromatic with sesame oil.You’re instructed first to break up the egg and incorporate it well with the tartare sauce.Then, dole it out on the bowl, top with ikura, and finish with the dressing before tucking in.It’s a visually stunning bowl of rice, somewhat like a zhnged-up poke bowl with a battered and fried cutlet of salmon that’s still rare on the inside—if you love your food to be full of varied textures, you’ll enjoy this.There is really quite a bit going on in the bowl—you could consider mixing it all up, or mixing and matching to fill each spoonful. There are cubes of avocado, sliced cherry tomatoes, and thinly sliced purple cabbage to balance out the creamy, tangy egg with tartare sauce. Some of our colleagues, upon tasting this dish, commented that it was a bowl of Filet-O-Fish.The Sweet Potato Tempura & Ice Cream ($9.80++) dessert on the menu bears a striking resemblance to a similar dessert served at Tempura Motoyoshi Imo in Tokyo, Japan, but the one to go for is\xa0Sweet Potato Cream Brulee ($12.80++).Imagine an ultra-smooth, fragrantly steamed sweet potato—on par with the famous Don Don Donki version—topped with custard and sugar, then bruleed for that crackling layer of smoky sweetness.It’s paired with vanilla ice cream, which we didn’t end up bothering to eat, and slices of sweet potato crisps. In short: focus on the main affair on the plate.This Restaurant Has Legit Taiwanese Mee Sua And Braised Pork Rice In ChinatownKohaku Sabo is located on the second floor of Chinatown Point, which is centrally located right above\xa0Chinatown MRT Station, which you can get to on both the Downtown Line and North-East Line. The cafe is done up to resemble a Japanese teahouse, with wooden rafters, paper window details, and backlit murals. However, we did find the space a little tired and dingy-feeling, with the service area visible and the kitchen door opening into the dining space.Chinatown Point seems like an odd choice for this teahouse concept, but its central location makes it a very accessible option if you’re looking for some modern Japanese nosh and sweet treats. Prices here are reasonably affordable for what you get too, and portion sizes for the main dishes are on the generous side. Even if you don’t have a sweet tooth, you ought to give the Sweet Potato Cream Brulee dessert a shot.For something different in the Chinatown area, consider heading to Ah Zhong Mian Xian for legit oyster mee sua, or Jiakali for Indian-Chinese curry!Address: 133 New Bridge Road, #02-34, Chinatown Point, Singapore 059413\nOpening hours: Daily 11:30am to 10pm\nTel: 6443 4366\nWebsite\nKohaku Sabo is not a halal-certified eateryJiakali Review: Extra Spicy Indian-Chinese Curry Rice Stall In ChinatownPhotos taken by Chew Yi En.\nThis was a media tasting at Kohaku Sabo.SummaryPros– Mentaiko Cream Sauce Udon Ikura Topping was affordable, especially with uni\n– Sweet Potato Cream Brulee was very smooth and enjoyable\n– Portions are generousCons– Carbonara Udon was jelak\n– Cafe felt a bit dingyRecommended dishes: Mentaiko Cream Sauce Udon Ikura Topping ($23.80++), Ikura Salmon Cutlet with Avocado on Flavoured Rice ($24.80++), Sweet Potato Cream Brulee ($12.80++)Opening hours: Daily 11:30am to 10pmAddress:\xa0133 New Bridge Road, #02-34, Chinatown Point, Singapore 059413Get more stories like this.Drop us your email so you won't miss the latest news.Feed me.Eatbook offers honest reviews and recommendations on Singapore food.Eatbook.sg© 2023 - All Rights Reserved.\xa0Eatbook is part of TSL Media Group.Past Contest Winners.\xa0Privacy Policy"]

https://eatbook.sg/butter-by-two-men/:["Filter By(Change?)Two Men Bagel House is on a roll: Two Men Rice Bar, their rice bowl concept in Tanjong Pagar, opened last month, and over the weekend, they launched yet another concept—Butter By Two Men. Housed in Trifecta, Singapore’s newest and perhaps hippest sports facility in Somerset, the entire menu at Butter By Two Men revolves around butter, if you haven’t already guessed.Two Men Rice Bar Review: New CBD Cafe By Two Men Bagel House With Kong Bak Mantou And Loaded Rice BowlsEvery item on the menu at Butter By Two Men is prepared with one of nine house-made butters:\xa0Smoked Maple,\xa0Salted Gula Melaka, Sriracha Honey, Garlic, Caesar, Caramelised Onion, Smokey Tomato, Spicy Takana, and Spicy Peanut. If you’d like to try them in their purest form, go for a\xa0Butter Flight ($10), which gets you three butters of your choice, plus a plain, sliced and toasted bagel, croissant, or a pancake.They all taste remarkably different, but my favourites were the Spicy Takana, where takana is a peppery-tasting pickled Japanese mustard and Salted Gula Melaka, studded with chunks of actual, crunchy gula melaka.Where Two Men Bagel House specialises in bagelwiches, Butter has diversified the spread to include croissantwiches and butter jacks—fried pancake rolls. I dove straight for their\xa0Heritage ($15)\xa0croissantwich, a no-brainer for its local brekkie-in-one interpretation.There is a\xa0huge, thick slab of that salted gula melaka butter that won my heart, plus house-made pandan kaya, pastry creme, almond flakes, and quarters of Hanjuku egg in a pastry that’s supplied to them by Mooi Patisserie. I couldn’t imagine finishing this all by myself, but the custardy kaya and savoury egg, with the cold slab of butter were a hit combination.Of three butter jacks on the menu, we opted for\xa0Lox N’ Roll ($15), where a crepe-like pancake is rolled with garlic butter, smoked salmon, slaw, pickled cucumber, capers, and a Sumac red onion salad. Sumac, in case you didn’t know, is a spice powder derived from a berry. It’s got a slight smoky, earthy flavour, with a citrusy sweet-sharpness not unlike lemon.The crepe is made fresh daily, but not to order. I enjoyed how it was nicely thin, such that the medley of ingredients were able to stand out—kudos to the team for balancing all of it, in spite of how many different elements were going on in the same wrap.Then, Two Men Bagel House’s signature bread rolls appear on the menu in three variations:\xa0Poo Bear ($19), Sweet Chicks ($18) and Sup’ Beef ($20). Here, you don’t get to choose your bagel; there’s only plain ones available.Poo Bear was a unique combination of spicy peanut butter, Spam, scrambled eggs, pork floss, garlic aioli, and—check this out—condensed milk. Because we took a pretty long while before digging in, the scrambled eggs had lost their creaminess, but we were surprised by how well the sweet and savoury ingredients worked together, so the overall bite was not too sweet nor savoury. I’d definitely recommend having this ASAP so the eggs are as creamy as they were intended. Plus, you can never go wrong with Spam and eggs.P.S.: I went back for Sweet Chicks and it was as much of a blast, if not more. Think juicy, deep-fried chicken thigh dashed with sriracha honey butter for a sweet-spicy kick, and added zing from spicy aioli, refreshing slaw, pickled cucumber, and melty double cheddar.At this point, the aforementioned items are only available on Butter’s day menu, which runs from 8am to 4pm daily. At 5pm, they switch to a dinner menu, headlined by three butter rice dishes, and three butter noodles. Each butter rice dish starts with a base of Japanese rice, cooked with dashi and butter for a most tasty treat.Choosing was tough, but we wound up with\xa0Locomo ($24), where it’s paired with a beef hamburg blanketed in buah keluak demiglace, drizzled with sour cream, and matched with house salsa, Asian greens, and a sunny-side-up.Slicing into the hamburg patty revealed a perfect pink doneness, and an oozing core of caramelised onion butter, which added loads of extra flavour, and juiciness.It’s a close fight with the buah keluak demiglace—where buah keluak is more of an acquired taste, this was tempered down to a milder, chocolatey, and easily acceptable flavour, which my colleague, who’s never had buah keluak before, found surprisingly palatable.I really enjoyed how the heavier beef and demiglace were given balance with the salsa and slaw, rounding out the plate. My only qualm was with how this is a dinner-only dish.The soy milk broth of\xa0Snowcapped ($20) is made in-house: a reduction of soya bean milk that’s sieved and thickened with butter, and served cold with egg noodles. These are closer to ramen, with a chewy springiness to them. Served on the side is house-made chilli oil, which you can get more of if you want more of the spicy oomph.An onsen egg is nestled on top of the noods, with takana, scallions, Romaine lettuce, cucumber, and a wedge of lime that, squeezed on the noodles, adds a bright edge.Give it a really good mix to properly enjoy this cold dish. It may seem a little on the steep side, price-wise, but the portion makes up for it.For proteins, you get house-made char siew. I did think that maybe thicker, juicier slices might go better, but the thin, well-charred pork delivered on flavour nonetheless.Also on the dinner menu are a selection of side dishes, of which we picked\xa0Crunchix ($15),\xa0Buttercups ($12) and\xa0Corn A’ Nation ($10).Not your usual karaage, Crunchix is topped with a brown butter chilli crunch that has a Sichuan pepper kick to it.When I first tried the crunch, I’d thought, “Ugh, mala,” but having it with the juicy fried chicken made me eat my words.Corn A’ Nation gets you a whole bowl of corn kernels tossed in Caesar butter, with a buttery crumble, and umami savouriness from shio kombu.Meanwhile, salted gula melaka butter gave the charred Brussel sprouts of Buttercups a mellow sweetness, and the crunchy pecans were a nice touch, unlike your typical walnuts or almonds.Only available before 4pm is\xa0Creamy Thai Tea ($8): don’t skip this thinking it’s regular cha yen. Instead of condensed and evaporated milk, this concoction has a house-made butter espuma! The tea flavour could be stronger, IMO, but the slightest tinge of salt from the butter made this indulgent drink worth the calories.Gyutan-Tan Opens At Ngee Ann City With Outlet-Exclusive Afternoon Tea And Gyutan Hamburg CurryThe vibes at all of Two Men Bagel House’s establishments are hip and vibey; you can expect no less at Butter By Two Men, fitting right in with the skate shop it shares the space with, as well as the surf pool right outside. Choose to dine in air-conditioned comfort within the cafe itself, sit on the steps outside, or get your food to go, and enjoy it anywhere within the Trifecta complex.Trifecta is located just above Somerset MRT Station, across from Orchard Gateway, making Butter By Two Men extremely accessible, and right in the heart of Orchard Road.10 Orchard Gateway Food Places For Cheap Wagyu Donburi, Hotpot Buffet And More‘Tis not your usual cafe grub at Butter By Two Men. The nett prices and large portions make it that much more attractive. I only wish the full menu were available throughout the day, so I might have the rice bowls and noodle dishes whether it’s at lunch or dinner.

https://eatbook.sg/hundred-acre-creamery-tampines/:["Filter By(Change?)Singapore is currently having record-high temperatures that have me sweating off my sunscreen as soon as I apply it, and unfortunately, I don’t have enough time off to escape to the Arctic Circle. On the bright side, we have tons of artisanal ice cream shops providing some sweet relief from the heat such as Hundred Acre Creamery, which not only has interesting handcrafted ice cream flavours, but also delicious, mochi-like pandan waffles and unique Vietnamese coffee.This is Hundred Acre Creamery’s second outlet—the original outlet is a well-known haunt run by a lovely Vietnamese couple along Sunset Way. If the cafe’s name rings a bell, that’s because it is a homage to the Hundred Acre Wood, home of everyone’s favourite honey-loving bear, Winnie the Pooh. You’ll find references to the childhood character scattered throughout the homely cafe.\xa0To start, we got the signature Coconut Pandan Waffle ($7), which is said to be crispy on the outside and mochi-like on the inside, though it’s not actually a mochi waffle. For ice cream, we decided to indulge our inner child, choosing the popular Chrysanthemum Honey ($5.50) to represent Pooh’s honey obsession and the vegan-friendly Ispahan Sorbet ($4.50), which reminded us of Piglet’s pink colour.\xa0The waffle is served hot off the waffle iron, causing the ice cream to melt rather rapidly. Cutting in and pulling it apart definitely showed that it had a bit of a stretch, though I wouldn’t say it was as mochi-like as people have claimed online. I did like that it was slightly chewy and had a noticeable pandan fragrance, which paired well with the gula melaka sauce and the ice creams.\xa0As for the ice cream, I was surprised to find that I didn’t enjoy the honey chrysanthemum, despite being a fan of both honey and chrysanthemum flavoured foods. It had a slightly musky aftertaste to it, and I wasn’t sure if it came from the honey, chrysanthemum, or both. I did appreciate that the honey and chrysanthemum aroma was apparent, as well as the ice cream being creamy and interspersed with tiny chocolate chunks for texture.I far preferred the Isaphan sorbet, which was a refreshing blend of raspberry, rose, and lychee. It’s lighter body paired better with the heavier waffle and gula melaka sauce, with an addictive tangy undertone I couldn’t get enough of. To be fair, my go-to ice cream is raspberry ripple from the roadside ice cream uncle, so I may be biased in this aspect.\xa0This Cosy Eatery Has Fried Ice Cream And Rice Paper Pizza In An Ang Mo Kio Void Deck Coffee-based treats such as tiramisu and affogato rank highly on my personal list of best desserts, and a Vietnamese coffee-based affogato is something I cannot resist. Hundred Acre Creamery’s basic Coco Affogato ($8) mixes their coconut sorbet with a small amount of black Vietnamese coffee, which you can pour in yourself.I always thought that strong robusta-based blends such as Vietnamese coffee or our local kopi would make for a good affogato, as they are typically already paired with sweet creamers such as condensed or evaporated milk. Along with the sweet satisfaction of proving my theory right, mixing together the sorbet and coffee produced a deliciously creamy treat with both the distinct flavour of sweet coconut and fragrant aroma of fresh coffee.\xa0Finally, we had the Vietnamese Egg Coffee ($6). This was the true reason I was willing to travel all the way to Tampines instead of the Sunset Way branch, as their Vietnamese egg coffee was a Tampines-exclusive. True to tradition, it’s served in a small bowl of hot water to maintain the coffee’s temperature, though you can also order it iced like their other drinks.You don’t typically find egg coffee in Singapore, and contrary to popular belief, it doesn’t actually involve cracking an egg straight into coffee. The egg is beaten into a creamy yellow foam with condensed milk and sugar, kind of like dalgona coffee. Covered by a dusting of cocoa powder, the egg creme was thick and sweet with a very rich taste. I quite enjoyed this unique cup of coffee, but couldn’t help but think that compared to other Vietnamese coffee I’ve had, the brew here wasn’t as gao or strong.\xa0The Tampines outlet is a small, cosy cafe under a HDB that is the perfect chill spot to hang out with your friends, partner, or family. It takes about 13 minutes of walking from Tampines West MRT to get there. Not the most convenient, but the promise of sweet relief after walking around in this heat would definitely motivate you to get there way quicker.Some chill was exactly what I needed in this weather, and Hundred Acre Creamery delivered in that aspect with its vibes and ice cream. I also liked the Vietnamese coffee on offer which sets it apart from other ice cream and waffle stores around, and the egg coffee while not gao enough for my tastes is definitely a unique drink to try. It’s just unfortunate that it’s in Tampines and hence rather out of my way, but it’s definitely worth a visit if you’re an Eastie.\xa0For more cosy Vietnamese cafes with unique ice cream, check out F.I.C (Fried Ice Cream and Viet Bites)\xa0next to Mayflower MRT Station.
