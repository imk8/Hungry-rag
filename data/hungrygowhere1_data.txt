https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/old-school-bubble-tea-brands/:['My love affair with bubble tea bloomed in the early 2000s with the likes of green apple ice blended and blue coral milk tea from a neighbourhood bubble tea shop.I later moved on to the more premium pearl milk tea from Cup Walker in Sengkang — a weekly indulgence whenever I visited a friend who lived nearby. My relationship with Cup Walker was short-lived, though, as I stopped frequenting the town.But bubble tea lingered in my life through entrants such as Koi, Gong Cha and Playmade. Enticed by exciting new spins on the beloved Taiwanese classic, higher-quality offerings and fresh handmade pearls (gasp), I moved on quickly.Up until a month and a half ago.On National Bubble Tea Day, which fell on April 30, my fellow bubble-tea-loving editor and I were brainstorming topics to cover when we wondered aloud: Wait, what has become of the bubble tea brands of our childhood?Cup Walker, Happy Cup, Sweet Talk, Quickly, Cool Station and Milk Girl — these were brands we grew up with.But where are they now and, more important, do their drinks taste like they did before?If you’re already feeling a tinge of nostalgia, don’t worry — we did some sleuthing (and taste-testing, of course).Here’s a closer look at three old-school bubble tea chains that have stood the test of time.\xa05 Sengkang Square, 01-02\nOpen: Daily (10am to 11pm)With Cup Walker being such a core memory of my childhood, I was most excited to see if the drinks I loved were still as comforting as I remembered them being.Founder Thomas Lim, in his 50s, started Cup Walker in 1998 after seeing the bubble tea buzz in Taichung, Taiwan, and the success of his family’s bubble tea shop in the Yizhong school district of the central Taiwanese city.Since Cup Walker’s launch 24 years ago, Lim acknowledges: “It does feel like we’ve almost been eliminated. The industry can be quite harsh. Bigger brands tend to be perceived as better, and it’s easy for smaller businesses to get left behind.”Cup Walker’s branch in Sengkang still stands in its original spot.Lim says that business isn’t as good now, though the store still gets its share of returning customers who remember the brand from their childhood and prefer the taste of its drinks.It isn’t just the taste that hasn’t changed.The prices, too, have stayed virtually constant for two decades. But Lim says he had to raise them recently, no thanks to rising manpower costs. Even so, you can get a decent cup of pearl milk tea for S$3.Lee Qian Yi, 33, an academic based in Perth, Australia, decided to give Cup Walker a go on her last visit back to Singapore because she was curious to know whether its drinks tasted the same.Not only was Cup Walker a convenient distance from her place, she found the prices affordable compared with other chains. On its taste, she says: “The pudding milk tea tastes the same as it did more than 10 years ago.”Civil servant Adrian Tay, who has for 17 years been buying Cup Walker’s pudding milk tea from its Heartland Mall store, which closed in mid-2022, echoed this sentiment. “I prefer Cup Walker’s milk tea, as it’s aromatic, milky and sweet. Plus the taste is very, very consistent,” said the 42-year-old.After hearing both wax lyrical about the pudding milk tea, I couldn’t help but get it myself.The milk tea base was reminiscent of my childhood, but it was the pudding that was the game-changer. It reminded me of a less sweet and firmer version of Japanese custard pudding.Perhaps that’s the vintage appeal of Cup Walker — its unchanging offerings, retro menus and wallet-friendly prices. Even though the years have passed, and we’ve all grown up and moved on to brighter and shinier things, some things haven’t changed.Cup Walker staff’s recommendations: Pudding milk tea (S$3 or S$4), honey oolong tea (S$3.20 or S$4.20)\xa0442 Pasir Ris Drive 6, 01-38\nOpen: Daily (6am to 10pm)Some might recall this old-school bubble tea brand mushrooming in neighbourhoods in the early 2000s. While Sweet Talk doesn’t have a consolidated store listing, checks online show that the brand still has shops in such areas as Hougang, Pasir Ris and Jurong.Aside from bubble tea, Sweet Talk offers other drinks, including soya milk and lime juice. Some of its stores even stock soya beancurd, tea leaf eggs and fried snacks.Its bubble tea prices appear unchanged, with its pearl milk tea being sold at S$1.60.In spite of changing palettes, Sweet Talk has its fervent fans.Located along a busy public housing walkway, its Pasir Ris Drive 6 branch saw a constant stream of customers when I paid it a visit.On the way home with his takeaway lunch, Ong Jing Long, a 25-year-old home-based business owner, says he’s patronised Sweet Talk from as early as 2009.“I buy Sweet Talk because it’s affordable,” adds Ong, who visits the store once or twice a week and usually buys flavoured teas. “Compared with other bubble tea shops, there’s a more old-school feel. In terms of taste, there isn’t much of a difference.”I agree. Having had a lot of Sweet Talk’s drinks as a child (out of pure convenience, since it was practically everywhere when I was growing up), I immediately recognised the familiar, cloyingly sweet taste of my pearl milk tea on the first sip.So no, Sweet Talk hasn’t adjusted the taste of its drinks.You’ll definitely still enjoy Sweet Talk if you’re looking for an affordable sweet beverage that reminds you of your childhood, or a quick reprieve when you need an ice-cold beverage on a sweltering day.Sweet Talk staff’s recommendations: Pearl milk tea (S$1.60), mango sago ice blended (S$3.20)\xa0100 AM, 02-27B, 100 Tras Street\nOpen: Daily (10.30am to 10pm)If this were a high-school reunion of old-school bubble tea brands, Happy Cup would be the schoolmate that vanished and returned with a new look and attitude.With its flagship and only store occupying a prime spot in the 100 AM mall in Tanjong Pagar, you’d be forgiven for thinking that Happy Cup was a new kid on the block with its polished decor, fancy Teapresso machine and large cylinders stocking premium tea leaves.On the contrary, the brand burst onto the Singapore market in 1996, making it one of the first few bubble tea brands here since the Taiwanese staple was introduced to our shores in 1992.At its peak, Happy Cup had 45 stores islandwide — more than what Gong Cha and Chicha San Chen each have at present. Before its relaunch, Happy Cup closed its last shop in Singapore in 2007, after the initial bubble tea wave burst in Singapore.Jessica Rosie, founder and chief managing director of Happy Cup, says the business was rebranded in 2020 to promote a healthier lifestyle.“Happy Cup wanted to come up with a unique way of catering not just to the millennials, but other generations as well. Our motto is healthy, fresh and tasty.”Despite its fresh look and direction, Rosie says that the business chose to retain the brand’s name because “we believe every cup that you hold in your hand makes you happy, just like the Happy Cup back in 1996”.The store has drawn new fans among the Gen Z crowd.Student Cody Ang, 20, lives in the north of Singapore but makes a monthly trip to Tanjong Pagar to satisfy her Happy Cup cravings — particularly for its taro boba.She chanced on Happy Cup in 2021 while at 100 AM and knew that it was an old-school brand given a new lease of life.Stacked up to the more popular bubble tea brands, Ang says: “If I were to go for cold brew tea, I will definitely opt for Happy Cup. I like the light but refreshing tea leaf taste in their tea. Their quantity and quality are worth the price.”Rosie says the brand taps the finest and freshest tea leaves, and doesn’t use creamers and syrups in its products. The Happy Cup website also states that its tea undergoes “a 373-step cycle of tests to ensure pesticide-free tea standards”.I often found the powdered creamers used by most bubble tea chains heavy and artificial in taste, so the use of fresh milk in my pearl milk tea (made with Ceylon red tea) was a welcome change.The tea was fragrant, fresh and yet not overpowering. While my dairy-sensitive stomach may have regretted it a little later, my taste buds didn’t.My only gripe, if at all, was that the prices (about S$6 for a drink with a topping) were steep compared with what I was accustomed to paying.But considering I could consume my premium drink in the cool comfort of Happy Cup’s city-centre store while I finished some work, that felt like a reasonable trade-off.Happy Cup staff’s recommendations: Taro fresh milk with small taro balls (S$6.30), osmanthus oolong tea with honey aloe vera (S$6.30)\xa0Cup Walker, Sweet Talk and Happy Cup are on the GrabFood delivery service.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/2280burger-gourmet-burgers/:['By no means your average junk-food joint, 2280Burger opened in late 2021. A production facility turned eatery, its functional interior belies all the work that’s been done to get the “perfect patty”.\xa0Meant to be an affordable offshoot of BurgerLabo — its more upscale sister restaurant — the gourmet beef patties here are made of Scottish breed Aberdeen Angus neck cuts (numbered 2280 by butchers). They are unlike what you’d get at BurgerLabo, where the patties are shaped from two types of meat: Ground cuts of Aberdeen Angus and Toriyama wagyu.\xa0Owner Ken Loon, of Naked Finn and Magic Square fame, has kept the space intentionally bare, just like its concise menu comprising three burgers, fries, a milkshake, housemade iced lemon tea, and beer. Ordering is done via self-service touchscreens at the front of the shop.\xa0All the austerity, it seems, is to complement its main purpose of production, while creating an extra revenue stream. It’s a business-savvy move — and we’re not complaining. The more artisanal burger joints, the better for our stomachs.\xa0Hidden in Henderson Industrial Park, the unexpected site for a burger joint makes sense when we find out the main purpose of the space — a production facility for BurgerLabo. Loon, an entrepreneur, is no stranger to starting newfangled concepts, including chef incubator Magic Square.\xa0News of 2280Burger started popping up on social media in early December 2021, with reviewers charmed by its odd location and burgers. Of course, it helped that these were the same hands making those juicy S$25 ones at BurgerLabo.\xa0\xa0The instinctive answer to this would be to say that the double patty beef burger (S$13.50) was the highlight.\xa0On the contrary, it was the fish burger (S$15) that stole the show. Steep price tag aside, its iteration of McDonald’s Filet-O-Fish is what dreams are made of.\xa0Using seasonal catch, cod was served on the weekday we visited for lunch. Coated in a brown crisp batter, the slab of cod was cooked just right and still juicy when we bit into it. Sandwiched between soft buns, it’s slathered with slightly chunky tartar sauce.\xa0We also loved the milkshake (S$6.50), even though it was pricey for a small cup. Still, the flavour of the day — strawberry — was a lovely blend of sweet and tart with the consistency of a slushie. It was the cold, sweet end to the meal we deserved.\xa0Those much-raved-about beef patties were seasoned just right, thanks to its housemade beef garum (a fermented sauce).\xa0Yet, texturally, they were not what we expected. Perhaps due to the cut of the cow, it wasn’t fatty enough and had chewy bits of gristle, which made for a rather strange mouthfeel.\xa0A bigger disappointment was the housemade iced lemon tea (S$3.50). Completely devoid of sugar, it was diluted and flavourless.\xa0Is it conducive to conversation? Music plays softly over the speakers, but the lunch crowd can get rather noisy in the small space.Is a reservation necessary? The eatery takes only walk-ins.\xa0How to get there? Take the train to Redhill MRT station and get on bus service 145, which will drop you in front of 213 Henderson Road, where the burger joint is located.Things to note:\xa0HungryGoWhere paid for its meal at this eatery for this review.\xa02280Burger by BurgerLabo is on the GrabFood delivery service.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/plant-based-eco-friendly/:['As global temperatures rise and natural disasters become more common, we as consumers are awakening to how we can do our part for the environment. In addition to bringing along reusable containers and cutlery, some of us are opting for more plant-based options to lower our carbon footprint.\xa0Many others have opted out of using disposable cutlery with food deliveries. Based on Grab’s 2021 Environmental, Social and Governance Report released last month, its waste management programme saw a total of 774 million cutlery sets being saved across the region last year.To help the eco-conscious consumer, we’ve rounded up five F&B places in Singapore that are actively practising sustainability in their own ways.\xa024 Keong Saik Road\nOpen: Monday to Saturday (12pm to 10pm)A long-time purveyor of the plant-based movement way before the trend caught on here, this small cafe has been the go-to place for gluten-free and vegan cuisine since 2013.\xa0Positioning itself as a farm-to-table eatery, its 100 per cent plant-based menu might seem a tad intimidating for the sceptic. Still, there’s clever use of fresh vegetables, nuts and housemade condiments for a tasty meal that’s gentle to the environment.\xa0The patty in its smoked stacked burger, for example, is made from 10 ingredients such as broccoli and green beans, shiitake mushrooms, flaxseed, and brown rice flour to recreate the bite of a real meat patty.\xa0Adopting the philosophy of the Pure Food movement, Afterglow’s dishes are free from eggs, dairy, refined sugar, and artificial sweeteners. This includes a raw crispy lasagne made of zucchini sheets, walnut “minced meat” and an assortment of vegetables.\xa0Last year, it launched Zerah Patisserie offering the likes of chocolate salted caramel date tarts and passionfruit lemon olive tarts that are entirely plant-based as well.\xa0\xa0Orchard Central, 02-16, 181 Orchard Road\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (10am to 10pm)Contemporary vegetarian and vegan restaurant Real Food is where you can find an extensive selection of Eastern and Western-inspired dishes. It even goes the extra mile to list the health benefits of the ingredients on the menu as well as a breakdown of their nutritional value.\xa0With floor-to-ceiling windows, wooden bookshelves and colourful furniture, its Orchard Central space also comprises a retail area with various plant-based and organic dry goods and condiments.\xa0Apart from the soups, noodles and pizza offered on the dine-in menu, it also provides takeaways from its Slow Bakes and Real Easy Kits menus. The former is a bakehouse where you’ll find sourdough and naturally leavened soft buns and loaves, while the latter comprises four types of baskets filled with homemade sauces, fresh produce and bread.For hot food takeaways, the restaurant works alongside barePack, a Singapore-based startup that enlists the help of establishments with reusing containers for delivery.\xa0\xa0\xa0InterContinental Singapore Robertson Quay, 02-07, 1 Nanson Road\nOpen: Wednesday to Sunday (4pm to 10.30pm)In the final instalment of pastry chef Janice Wong’s guest chef and bartender series, two women championing a vegan-friendly six-course degustation menu are at the helm of the newly rebranded Mallow.\xa0In charge of the cuisine is Danish-American chef Christina Rasmussen, who was the head forager at the famed Michelin-starred Noma restaurant in Copenhagen. Applying her ethos of minimising her carbon footprint, the menu is kept free of dairy, meat and seafood.\xa0Instead, all courses from the Taste of Mallow menu are made with vegetables and plants that are foraged or sourced locally and regionally. The result? Tasty morsels that don’t compromise on flavour. Her take on tacos, for example, uses wild pepper leaves as wraps holding confit carrots cooked in miso and hazelnut dukkah (an Egyptian condiment).\xa0\xa0To complement the food, head bartender Sasha Wijidessa shakes up tipples that don’t shy away from fermentation and funkier umami notes. After residing in Copenhagen for a couple of years, she’s returned as Asia brand manager for Empirical, a Danish “flavour company” specialising in distilling memories and experiences into beer, spirits and pastes.\xa0So it’s no surprise that her cocktails use Empirical products such as Ayuuk, a spirit distilled from pilsner malt and purple wheat flavoured with smoky Pasilla Mixe chillies. She uses it in Orange Julius, a play on the fruit juice that also contains apricot, egg yolk and, well, orange juice.\xa0\xa0Nordcom 2, 03-25, 2 Gambas Crescent\nOpen: Tuesday to Friday (3pm to 5pm); Saturday (1pm to 2.30pm)From what started as a project in 2017 by then Singapore University of Technology and Design student Augustine Tan, Ugly Food’s current iteration has taken the form of a grocery store.\xa0An organisation with the sole aim of reducing food waste, the young team behind it runs educational workshops and runs corporate social responsibility initiatives with corporations, on top of operating the store.\xa0By taking in perishables that are blemished, close to their expiry date or from a surplus that would be otherwise thrown away, the e-store and brick-and-mortar space sell them at clearance prices and promotional bundles. This way, they’re able to reduce waste at the source, while providing independent farmers with extra income.\xa0In an effort to reduce plastic waste, Ugly Food has also teamed up with lifestyle app Muuse to store fruit and vegetables in reusable containers.\xa0\xa022 Martin Road, 01-00\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (7.30am to 5.30pm)A cafe, roaster and coffee academy born from a partnership between Five Senses Coffee Australia and the Spa Esprit Group, this company of serious coffee fiends has pushed for sustainability in the business from day one.\xa0“Sustainability (to us) means responsible business practices at different steps of the supply chain, and upholding the integrity of truth in our actions and decisions,” a spokesperson for Common Man Coffee Roasters tells HungryGoWhere.\xa0Acknowledging the importance of having a good relationship with coffee producers, Common Man makes it a point to work directly with the same folks who process the beans from start to end. “(It) allows us to appreciate the role and impact the industry has on their day-to-day lives,” added its spokesperson. But first, they have to meet a few criteria, such as show evidence of on-the-ground support and economic growth opportunities for their communities.\xa0Back at its Martin Road store, where customers flock to on weekends for brunch and a cup of joe, staff members keep coffee grounds for compost, biofuel and body wash.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/slake-critics-review/:['EDITOR’S NOTE: Slake announced on June 17, 2022 that it would be ceasing operations on June 20, 2022. The pandemic hasn’t been kind to districts known for their nightlife, and The Riverwalk on Upper Circular Road — formerly home to a string of restaurants and a club — has seen better days. A relative newcomer to the area is Slake.The eatery took the place of Jumbo Seafood restaurant late last year, bringing along its laidback vibes and affordable mod-Sin (modern Singaporean) dishes from Opera Estate in eastern Singapore.Three times larger, this version of Slake — which is now under the Jumbo Group — is more well-dressed than its maiden store, with exposed brick walls, neon signs, a large mural, and automated rattan fans.That said, some elements such as its utilitarian furniture and empty fish tanks — remnants of the past restaurant — make for an odd inheritance that doesn’t quite cohere with Slake 2.0.When we popped by for dinner on a weeknight, it turned out that reservations weren’t needed, with just three other tables occupied.Founded by chef and serial entrepreneur Jeremy Cheok in 2014, Slake (named after 1 Swan Lake Avenue, where it was originally located) earned a steady following as the neighbourhood restaurant dishing out contemporary Singaporean cuisine in the quiet suburb of Siglap.Serving up familiar flavours in new formats, its bestsellers included chye poh (salted white radish) fries (S$12) and gula melaka (palm sugar) and assam brussel sprouts (S$14).One of the few establishments that pivoted to online deliveries even before the pandemic cut a swathe through the F&B scene, Slake gained even more popularity for its novel takeaway concepts. These include Kiap (generously portioned Asian-inspired tacos), bak kwa (barbecued pork) crispy rice bars and make-it-yourself “damn easy” Hokkien mee.In March 2021, Slake shuttered its flagship restaurant in Siglap but continued doing collaborations with Timbre X, a restaurant and bar. It later announced its reopening at The Riverwalk in December last year.\xa0There are lots of dining options in and around Boat Quay, but if you’re looking for a no-frills joint for big groups that won’t break the bank, this gastrobar is the place to be.Possibly a reflection of Cheok’s generation, tunes of the 1990s and early 2000s dance through the store, and Tiger and Guinness are available on tap (the only way the stout should be served, according to him).The nostalgia-tinged fare was, indeed, fun to revisit.The Slake nasi kerabu (S$19) was essentially a souped-up version of fried rice comprising tasty morsels of beef-fat brown rice with cubes of chicken breast, an assortment of vegetables and rocket leaves.The cold rendang custard (S$9), a charcoal-coloured egg custard topped with cold prawns tossed in a rendang marinade, was reminiscent of tapas restaurant Lolla’s uni (sea urchin) pudding.Even the snack options, especially the battered pig ears (S$14), were a delightful departure from your average bar grub. Fried, crispy and a little crunchy within, the pig ears came with a wedge of lime and went perfectly with a cold beer.Transplanting the easygoing personality of Slake from a sleepy residential estate to the heart of a nightlife district doesn’t quite come together.In an area where people dress up to see and be seen, the gastrobar seems a tad out of place: There isn’t a wide selection of alcohol and the decor doesn’t offer much for the ‘gram.Nosh-wise, Slake’s offerings provided a comforting familiarity, though some dishes didn’t live up to our expectations. The crispy silkie chicken (S$26), promising an eccentric take on the fluffy, feathered fowl, arrived in an unappetising fried black batter.Not the typical plump chicken we’re used to having, there were more bones than meat and the accompanying nuoc mam gastrique, a play on the sweet-and-spicy Vietnamese dipping sauce, tasted no different from water mixed with salt.Is it conducive to conversation? Slake’s wait staff are attentive and friendly but not intrusive. We have a feeling that being a little raucous would also be tolerated here.Is a reservation necessary? It usually isn’t crowded, but if you’re going in a big group, do make reservations to be safe.How to get there? It’s across the street from Clarke Quay MRT station.Things to note:HungryGoWhere paid for its meal at this eatery for this review.

Let the conversations unfold late into the night, accompanied by some comforting hot brews.What to order: Smakagers (S$24 for a box of eight), passion-and-verbena tart (S$8.50)\xa058 Seng Poh Rd, 01-15\nNearest MRT station: Tiong Bahru\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (9.30am to 5.30pm)A Japanese tearoom by day and Kappo-style (Japanese for “cutting and cooking”) omakase by night, Sevens Kissaten is an oasis in the busy Tiong Bahru district.\xa0Wooden furniture, Japanese lanterns hanging from the ceiling and large glass windows lend the cafe a bright and airy look.\xa0Those with a sweet tooth will love the wide selection of artisanal desserts that range from matcha monaka (Japanese rice cracker with matcha ice cream and red bean mochi crepe) to wasanbon (a fine-grained Japanese sugar) pudding.\xa0Wash all that down with a hot mug of lavender yuzu hojicha or sakura spring sencha.\n\nWhat to order: Matcha monaka (S$9), wasanbon pudding (S$9)\n\xa065 Tras Street\nNearest MRT station: Tanjong Pagar\nOpen: Monday to Thursday (9am to 6pm); Friday to Sunday (9am to 9pm)\xa0Glorious and oozing with soft cream, the cream puffs at Baristart Coffee are pure sensory overload. Freshly made using premium Hokkaido Biei Jersey Milk, these large puffs’ crisp brown exterior encases a brilliantly rich and smooth custard cream.At this Hokkaido-based concept cafe in the south of Singapore, another ’gram-worthy dish is the shiro kuma (“white bear” in Japanese).

And joining the count at the end of last year is Cotta, a small gelato hideout on the second floor of a shophouse.\xa0With all the activity along the street, it’s easy to miss the plain wooden door (with a mirror hung on it) and the big round lamp above that says “Cotta”. But it’s precisely why it makes such a good place to pop into before or after a filling Korean dinner.\xa0The rotating selection of gelato offers unique flavours such as roasted corn or muscat grape sake. The handful of baked desserts mostly stays the same.\xa0On the more savoury side, Trio is a dome-shaped treat made with gorgonzola and parmigiano cheese garnished with shavings of tete de moine (a semi-hard Swiss cheese).\xa0What to order: Trio (S$11), Cotta waffles (S$7), goma matcha gelato cookie (S$7)\xa0Leckerbaer, Sevens Kissaten and Baristart Coffee are on the GrabFood delivery service.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/s17-community-kitchen-nasi-padang-peranakan/:['Walking past Block 57 Lengkok Bahru, strains of jazzy music fill the air and tendrils of green adorn a wooden trellis at the shopfront of S17 Community Kitchen.The staff, donning bright-blue shirts emblazoned with the words “Unconditional Love”, go about their work with a smile and greet customers like old pals.The customers, in turn, chat leisurely and exchange friendly banter while tucking into comforting plates of nasi padang.This is no ordinary kopitiam (coffee shop) in the heartlands — but a space with a mission of bringing the community together.In the heart of Redhill estate, S17 Community Kitchen is nestled among blocks of one-room rental flats, occupied mostly by seniors living alone.It began operations in November 2020. By day, the modest culinary powerhouse turns out plate after plate of much-vaunted nasi padang. By night, it morphs into a Peranakan eatery.The man behind it is Raymond Khoo of volunteer group The Saturday Movement, which has been serving the Lengkok Bahru community for the last 11 years.Khoo, 59, ran The Peranakan, an authentic Straits cuisine restaurant formerly located in the Orchard Road shopping district.Every week, S17 Community Kitchen provides seniors and needy families living in and around Lengkok Bahru with about 500 meals.On Saturdays, volunteers from The Saturday Movement go from door to door offering bread and fruit to beneficiaries.When Singapore entered a partial lockdown at the height of the pandemic in April 2020, The Saturday Movement had to stop its befriending programme, where seniors gathered for a meal at a neighbourhood void deck.Although business at The Peranakan nosedived that period, Khoo pushed on with the food distribution exercise. The group doubled down and provided some 1,000 lunch and dinner meals from The Peranakan daily.Despite their best efforts, the food would sometimes arrive cold. Some residents also preferred to eat at different times, while others had various dietary preferences.“I’ve seen a lot of instances where beneficiaries get free food, but the quality isn’t always there. If I were a resident and received a food packet full of soggy vegetables, gravy spilling all over, it’s very disheartening,” says Khoo.That was when he realised the urgent need to provide a space closer to the community.When an opportunity came to rent a coffee shop at Block 57 Lengkok Bahru, Khoo jumped at it.And S17 Community Kitchen was born.The space allows Khoo and his team the flexibility of offering beneficiaries coupons that they can redeem for hot meals any time they want.\xa0Seeing the community kitchen as an “incubator space”, Khoo invited nearby rental flat residents who were keen on trying their hand at running a business to hone their entrepreneurial skills over six to eight months.The hope was to give everyone an opportunity to venture into F&B, because the costs can be high.Tenants pay half the usual rent, with Khoo subsidising the rest.Rental flat resident Yusfiati, who goes by a single name, had been working as a cleaner for nine years before she took on the job at the nasi padang stall.“It’s different from cooking at home… It’s a challenge, but I try my best,” said the single mother of two.Aside from cooking up a storm and dishing out sumptuous local delights, the 45-year-old volunteers with The Saturday Movement and enjoys connecting with fellow Lengkok Bahru residents.In all, S17 Community Kitchen has 10 crew members, including rental flat residents in their 70s and 80s.\n\nA seasoned restaurateur, Khoo taught them everything from managing customers, costs and cleanliness to using the point-of-sale system.For Khoo, taste is everything. For instance, he brought in kerisik, a paste made of grated and toasted coconut, to make the nasi padang dishes more flavourful. \nOn Khoo’s recommendation, I ordered a helping of chicken satay and the rendang “Sedap Set”, which came with a hearty serving of tender beef rendang, potato begedil and vegetables topped with a dollop of sambal goreng.The refreshing chendol was a sweet ending to the meal and a godsend on a hot weekday afternoon.It’s no wonder that a steady stream of customers throng the coffee shop at lunchtime.To keep the business and programmes humming, Khoo pumps in S$12,000 to S$15,000 from his own pocket every month. The community kitchen is neither linked to nor supported by any government agency.The kopitiam doubles up as a help centre of sorts, too, Khoo jokes.A familiar face in the neighbourhood, he’s become the go-to “general secretary” whom residents consult on government letters, bills and other miscellaneous matters.Every Monday, Wednesday and Friday, seniors visit the community kitchen to mingle over free coffee, Milo and snacks such as macaroni soup and pastries. The idea is to engage the community, so that they will take more proactive steps to “engage among themselves”, says Khoo.For instance, he’s seen older residents who previously kept to themselves start making plans to go to the market together.When night falls, the kopitiam takes on a whole new identity and transforms into Rumah Peranakan, a restaurant that celebrates the rich heritage of Peranakan food.Vibrant batik tablecloths run the length of the tables and the chandelier-shaped lights cast a soft, warm glow.Helming the restaurant is chef Gabriel Chong, a third-generation Peranakan with more than two decades of F&B experience and a fierce passion for food.Among the standouts are the ayam buah keluak, a traditional Peranakan chicken dish cooked with tamarind gravy and buah keluak nuts.This was followed by the udang nenas (a light curry of prawns and pineapples), the vegetable of the day, and a delicious dessert of nangka pengat (jackfruit in coconut cream) with mung beans.For some residents in the area, S17 Community Kitchen has been a much-needed lifeline.After her husband died from a fall at home last year, Tio Guek Eng, 70, had been whiling away her days by herself and passing the time watching TV.On some days, the boredom and loneliness became too much to bear, she says.She now goes about her days with a newfound purpose working at S17 Community Kitchen.From 7.30am to 1.30pm, Tio has her hands full chopping vegetables, washing the dishes, and cleaning and clearing plates for about S$6 an hour. Her meals and drinks are provided.It’s back-breaking work, but she’s motivated by Khoo’s social mission.The days go by faster now, she says. Her daughters, who live separately, also have peace of mind, as people at the kopitiam can keep a watchful eye on Tio’s well-being.“The staff and volunteers here have a lot of heart and sincerity,” says Tio. “They take care of the old people.”Khoo plans to start a vegetable garden near the kitchen to encourage farm-to-table dining and help residents save on buying vegetables from the market. Residents will grow fruit, herbs and leafy vegetables such as Chinese cabbage and choy sum.In July, he plans to open an ice-cream cafe in the same block that, by night, transforms into an experimental R&D space for chefs to work on new concepts and host dinners.Profits from the dinners will be funnelled back into The Saturday Movement’s work.“Many people want to donate, but they don’t always see where the funds go. Here, you can see the real impact on the people,” he says.\xa0S17 Community Kitchen is on the GrabFood delivery service. You can also book a ride there.57 Lengkok Bahru, 01-489\nOpen: Monday to Saturday (8am to 4pm, 5pm to 9pm)57 Lengkok Bahru, 01-489\nOpen: Monday to Saturday (8am to 4pm, 5pm to 9pm)AuthorEe Ming is a storyteller with a love of photography, insightful reads, films, and offbeat and obscure places.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/true-cost-singapore/:['We Singaporean diners are a hard lot to please. So, when a restaurant like True Cost Singapore introduces a novel concept, it’s a given for it to be met with some scepticism on social media.Operating on a payment system that levies an entry fee — S$5 to S$15 before GST, depending on the time of day and day of the week — the eatery offers food and drinks at extremely reasonable prices (also before GST).\xa0It all sounds like a good deal —\xa0restaurant-standard fare at wallet-friendly prices. The menu, where wines and spirits dominate, even states how much you would pay at other joints in comparison.\xa0We didn’t bring out the calculator at dinner, but the price point for dishes and cocktails (which could do with a heavier pour) seems generally value for money. A range of wine labels is listed without their vintages, however, making it tricky for tableside sleuthing (yes, we tried).\xa0With an already-confusing concept, it didn’t help that True Cost Singapore seemed rather disorganised and unprepared for its opening. Its website was incomplete and the opening hours were wrongly listed on Instagram (when we checked on July 6). It got us wondering if it was a real, functioning restaurant or an elaborate public relations stunt.\xa0Thankfully, it proved to be bona fide when we headed there for dinner in the middle of last week. And though the eatery was evidently facing teething problems — our table got sent food we didn’t order four times, there was a gaping hole in the toilet floor covered by a wooden board, and the music was too loud — we got fed in the end. Originally from Moscow, the True Cost brand operates in a more casual format — as a bar and grill — in the Russian capital. Drawing mixed reviews on TripAdvisor, the Russian outfit mostly operates in the same way as the Singapore outpost, where you pay an entry fee for supposedly cheaper grub.\xa0The Singapore store has pitched its marketing efforts at a social-media-savvy audience, especially on TikTok, where you may have first heard of it.\xa0During our visit, we spoke to a chatty chef consultant who was previously tenured at the Moscow eatery.\xa0We asked how the fare offered in Moscow differed from the Singapore branch’s. He says the food industry is more competitive in the Russian capital. Procuring ingredients, by contrast, is much easier on our geographically gifted tropical island. With floor-to-ceiling glass windows and a large al fresco area, True Cost Singapore has a pretty panoramic view of Nicoll Highway below. Foliage-patterned chairs and big straw hats give the place a resort feel. And when the sun goes down, low-hanging lamps flood the main dining room in warm light.It was a welcome sight in the labyrinth that’s Suntec City. When we were there, the crowd was a mix of young working adults and people in their 30s.Most patrons ordered the bone marrow (S$14.25), as we did, which came as two forearm-length bones with a hand-sized flatbread. Drizzled on the bone marrow was a chilli oil that tasted like Lao Gan Ma, a brand of chilli sauce, and on the side was a delicious cheese dip made of parmesan, Philadelphia cream cheese and sea salt. Another sizeable dish was the crab lumaconi (S$12.75), giant pasta shells tossed in a tomato base with shredded crabmeat. We wished there was more of the sauce and crabmeat, but we generally enjoyed this hearty offering and slightly al dente lumaconi.\xa0We almost missed out on getting desserts, thinking that there was nothing impressive about the two options: A salted caramel cheesecake (S$9.05) and napoleon cake (S$10.55). At the recommendation of the chef consultant, however, we ordered the napoleon cake, which turned out to be one of the better dishes of the night.\xa0A mille-feuille of puff pastry layered with cream, then powdered with sugar, this dessert has French origins. It later became a Russian national dish.While the food wasn’t too shabby for a new, shortstaffed joint, there’s still some way to go before it hits the mark for restaurant-standard fare.\xa0The style of cuisine could also do with some fine-tuning, as it’s now a vague, uncategorisable genre — a mishmash of east and west with some bits of local flavour and Russian fare thrown in.The yellowtail crudo (S$7.65) was below par, with thick cuts of the fish that were fibrous (perhaps due to how it was sliced). Precisely because of the dish’s simplicity, it would have benefited from a more proportionate ratio of vinaigrette to fish.\xa0The smoked cheese salad (S$12.45) was disappointingly mediocre for the price. The crumbly cheese atop a spinach and tomato salad in a soy sauce, garlic and shiso dressing had no smokiness at all.\xa0The octopus with potato mousse (S$19.85), another simple dish that was quite popular with the crowd, was also unremarkable. Unlike the charred, smoky and tender variations found in Spanish restaurants, the tentacle was overcooked and rubbery. And the potato mousse tasted starchy.\xa0Food aside, the eatery’s floor staff appeared inexperienced and at times confused, though they were always warm and apologetic.Is it conducive to conversation? No. It was a pity that the eatery was blasting music at club-like decibels.\xa0Is a reservation necessary? You probably won’t need a reservation, but if you’re going in a big group, there’s no harm in making one.\xa0Takeaway recommendations? None of the dishes are made to travel well. It’s best to dine in.\xa0How to get there? Alight at Promenade MRT station and walk towards Suntec City Tower 5. True Cost Singapore is located at the Sky Garden between Towers 5 and 1. Take the outdoor escalator for the quickest way up.\xa0Things to note:\xa0HungryGoWhere paid for its visit to this restaurant for this review.Book a ride to True Cost Singapore.\xa0Suntec City, 03-302/303, 3 Temasek Boulevard\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (12pm to 11pm)Suntec City, 03-302/303, 3 Temasek Boulevard\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (12pm to 11pm)AuthorYawen has written a lot about food in her previous roles as the editor-in-chief of Wine & Dine and later as the associate digital editor of The Peak.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/mr-holmes-bakehouse-myp-centre/:['Barely a year in the Singapore market, Mr Holmes Bakehouse opened its second store here in early May.\xa0On the ground floor of MYP Centre, a rather nondescript building opposite The Fullerton Hotel, the bakehouse lends a splash of pink to the drab, grey office tower.\xa0For a brand oozing with such vibrant and young energy, this store in the CBD seemed a little out of place serving office workers dressed in formal wear. But perhaps youthfulness is a state of mind, as the good-humoured middle-aged staff members at Mr Holmes will tell you.The daredevils of viennoiserie, and trademark owner of the term “cruffin” (a croissant-and-muffin hybrid), Mr Holmes Bakehouse was established eight years ago in the United States. Its founder Aaron Caddel quickly made the pastry store Instagram-famous for its cruffins.\xa0The San Franciscan bakery, distinguishable by its pink neon lights and white-tiled walls, later made inroads into places such as Los Angeles and Seoul, South Korea.But like many other eateries, it wasn’t spared the ravages of the coronavirus pandemic. Last year, it declared bankruptcy and shut some of its branches in the US and abroad.\xa0Caerus Holding, a Singapore lifestyle company responsible for brands such as the Lady M and Leckerbaer confectioneries, runs two outlets in Singapore — the first at Pacific Plaza mall and the second at MYP Centre.\xa0On our second visit to Mr Holmes Bakehouse in two months, I was determined to be more adventurous with our picks.\xa0With a preference for savoury food, I was pleased to see a wider range of savoury options on the menu at MYP Centre. When we visited, four new sandwiches, such as the spam & egg w/ kimchi croissant (S$13) and chicken fajita (S$13), were exclusive to the MYP Centre store.\xa0The highlight, however, was the cheesy garlic gorilla bun (S$5.80) that was warmed up in the toaster. Fluffy and cheesy with ample garlic, it was a warm welcome on the rainy morning of our visit. Better yet, it’s a pastry you can take home, reheat and enjoy later.The only sweet treat we ordered was a coconut cream cruffin (S$6.50), which was our least favourite. Mr Holmes’ stuffed viennoiserie can’t be reheated, so the flakiness of the pastry was less than ideal.\xa0Furthermore, the cream it was stuffed with comprised desiccated coconut, which gave it a lumpy and undesirable mouthfeel. My companion and I also thought it was too sweet to finish.Its cruffin flavours are updated monthly, though. Do check with the store for the latest variations.To mark the launch of the store, Mr Holmes Bakehouse teamed up with Two Men Bagel House. The bakehouse used bagels from the popular joint in its Pigs n Figs (S$16) creation, while Two Men Bagel House offered its interpretation of Mr Holmes’ cruffins.\xa0Pigs n Figs — which is no longer available — was a foolproof combination of a plain bagel, cream cheese and fig jam. While it was priced similarly to the bagels from Two Men Bagel House, it didn’t come close to the bagel joint’s regular offerings.\xa0Unlike the generously stuffed bagelwiches there, Mr Holmes’ creation looked nothing like it did in photos on social media. Absent was the stack of ham and in its place were unevenly cut slices that, at best, folded over to make two layers of ham.\xa0So lacking in ham it was that, with the ample spread of cream cheese and fig jam, we could barely taste the saltiness of the cured meat.Is it conducive to conversation? Absolutely. Hip-hop music plays softly in the background and, when we visited, the store wasn’t playing high-energy K-pop.Is a reservation necessary? No. We don’t imagine it’d be crowded on weekdays, given its location. But if it is, there’s always the takeaway option.\xa0How to get there? It’s a three-minute walk from Raffles Place MRT station.Things to note:\xa0HungryGoWhere paid for its visit to this eatery for this review.\xa0Mr Holmes Bakehouse\xa0is on the\xa0GrabFood delivery service.

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/authentic-korean-eateries-singapores-south/:['This is the first instalment of a five-part series on authentic Korean eateries in Singapore. Here, we check out places in the south of Singapore.It’s no secret that southern Singapore is dotted with Korean eateries, primarily along Tanjong Pagar Road and Amoy Street. It’s easy to get overwhelmed with the array of options available, so we’re here to help you sieve out some of the most authentic Korean eateries in Singapore’s south.\xa0593 Havelock Road, 01-03\nNearest MRT station: Tiong Bahru\nOpen: Tuesday to Thursday (11.30am to 4pm); Friday to Sunday (11.30am to 9pm)The Butcher’s Dining is a Korean butchery with an all-day dining concept that’s available on weekends. South Korean butcher Heba Kim, who’s also the head chef, runs the space.More than just selling meat that’s great for barbecue, The Butcher’s Dining has meal kits that allow you to prepare wholesome Korean meals such as japchae (stir-fried glass noodles) at home. It also exclusively stocks items such as drinks and condiments from artisanal Korean food brand Myeongin Myeongchon.The eatery’s dining area is spacious, clean and minimalist — unlike the usual cramped and dim Korean BBQ restaurants most of us might be used to. Expect a mix of Western and Korean dishes such as the TBD cheese burger, bossam (steamed pork) and dongaseu (fried pork cutlet). Dongaseu is a Korean take on Japanese tonkatsu, and typically comes whole — not sliced — and doused with a thick, sweet demi-glace sauce. The Butcher’s Dining’s version is huge, crispy and yet extremely tender.What to order: TBD cheese burger (S$18.90), old-school Duroc pork cutlet (S$25.80)\xa064 Peck Seah Street\nNearest MRT station: Tanjong Pagar\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (11.30am to 3pm, 5pm to 10pm)I had my first taste of jjajangmyeon as an exchange student in South Korea on Black Day (April 14) — the antithesis of White Day on March 14 and Valentine’s Day on Feb 14 — when singles commiserate over their relationship status by having black bean noodles. Since then, I’ve been looking for jjajangmyeon in Singapore that tasted exactly like that. Of course, it helped that there’s been a jjajangmyeon boom of Korean-Chinese restaurants in Tanjong Pagar.While many have set up shop along the more prominent Tanjong Pagar Road, Itaewon Jjajang sits quietly along Peck Seah Street, near Tanjong Pagar MRT station. True to its name, the eatery specialises in jjajangmyeon and the usual Korean-Chinese fare of jjamppong (seafood noodles) and tangsuyuk (sweet-and-sour pork). It also serves a variety of Korean favourites such as soups and stews.Star dish aside, what stood out about its authenticity was its variety of side dishes — kimchi, yellow radish, white radish, and spicy Sichuan vegetables.If you’re up for a spice challenge, get its jjamppong seafood noodles that come with varying levels of spiciness (up to level three), or kkanpunggi and yuringi — both deep-fried chicken, the former with hot pepper sauce and the latter with hot chilli and sour soy sauce.What to order: Seafood jjajangmyeon — portion for two persons (S$30), tangsuyuk (S$27)\xa088 Tanjong Pagar Road\nNearest MRT station: Tanjong Pagar\nOpen: Sunday to Thursday (12pm to 11pm); Friday and Saturday (12pm to 12am)You haven’t had Korean food till you’ve tried the quintessential Korean street food tteokbokki (rice cakes doused in a spicy red pepper sauce) and odeng tang (fish cake soup). The borders may have reopened and an air ticket to South Korea is within reach, but if you want to have an authentic dose of Korean bunsik (street food) in Singapore, Redholic is your best bet.It has four main flavours for its hotpot base — original (red pepper sauce), jjajang (non-spicy black bean sauce), carbonara, and rose, a combination of red pepper paste and carbonara sauce or a creamy base that’s been trending recently in Korea. You can pick the ingredients you want or choose from its pre-selected plain, beef, chicken, or pork sets.Apart from a rice cake hotpot, add fish cake soup and some deep-fried fritters — known as dwigim — to your meal for a well-rounded Korean street food experience. If everything gets too spicy for your liking, here’s a tip: Order some coolpis, a peach yoghurt drink, to cool your taste buds. That’s exactly what the Koreans would do — and trust me, it really helps.What to order: Plain tteokbokki — portion for two persons (S$31.80), fish cake soup (S$16)\xa048 Tras Street\nNearest MRT station: Tanjong Pagar\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (5pm to 1am)When I first heard of Mul Gogi Korean BBQ, I thought it was a grilled seafood joint, since the Korean term “mul gogi” typically refers to fish and means “water meat”. What I didn’t expect, but was pleasantly surprised by, was that its name refers to how the restaurant ages its meats — in water, for about a week. This process of wet aging tenderises the meat, as the enzymes in the trapped meat juices break down collagen between muscle fibres.Tenderness aside, Mul Gogi also serves generous cuts of meat that are skilfully cooked over a uniquely shaped grill that resembles the Hong Kong egglet snack. The restaurant is small, so the crew members are attentive to every table, stopping by every few minutes and even setting a timer to ensure you don’t end up with overcooked meat. If you don’t know which meat to start with, it has set meals from S$63 for a pork and chicken set that also includes steamed egg and a stew or cold noodles.What to order: Mul Gogi whole beef ribs with bone — 180g (S$41), kimchi pancake (S$21)\xa065 Tanjong Pagar Road\nNearest MRT station: Tanjong Pagar\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (11.30am to 1am)I found out about Charim Korean BBQ via TikTok. Former Apple employee Ryu Jiah left her dream role in Big Tech to help her mum fulfil her lifelong dream of setting up a restaurant. Yet, grappling with dining restrictions late last year meant the business took a hit, so Jiah banked on TikTok to drive footfall.Going viral may have been the start, but Charim continues drawing crowds for its quality meats, unique DIY sushi offering as well as attentive service. Atypical of Korean BBQ restaurants, Charim offers set menus that include meats, a stew and steamed egg.Daughter Jiah makes her rounds of the restaurant armed with a cooking thermometer to measure the temperature of the cast-iron pan before she grills the meats, ensuring that they’re well-cooked. I also loved that Charim offers a DIY sushi set of neatly shaped mounds of sushi rice to accompany the meats — a fuss-free way to get your carbs.What to order: Set A — pork belly, sliced pork belly and pork neck, with stew and steamed egg (S$65), DIY sushi rice (S$5)\xa0Redholic and Charim Korean BBQ are on the GrabFood delivery service.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/kfc-satay-crunch/:['Fried chicken fans can get their hands on a new seasonal flavour, the Satay Crunch, at KFC’s Singapore stores from Wednesday (July 20).\xa0The fast-food joint’s latest special — available for a limited time — is part of the many National Day-themed F&B promotions sweeping the island. Singapore celebrates its 57th birthday on Aug 9.Each Satay Crunch piece is glazed with a turmeric marinade, then battered and fried. As a result of the marination process, it will be mildly spicy and have a slight yellow tint.Diners have the option of coating it in the accompanying KFC satay sauce with crushed peanuts, which the fast-food chain says imparts a sweet, savoury and smoky flavour. If you wish, extra sauce is available at S$1.50 a portion.Despite its name, the Satay Crunch recipe is not the same one that was released in Australia late last year. That iteration, dubbed Kentucky Fried Satay Chicken, was created with MasterChef Australia star Sarah Tiong.\xa0According to KFC Singapore, this is Satay Crunch’s first outing ever, and it has been in development since mid-2021.Unlike satay, which is grilled over smoking charcoal, the Satay Crunch is deep-fried in KFC’s usual style.It also doesn’t come on a wooden skewer. Instead, the Satay Crunch is similar in size and shape to the fast-food chain’s signature offerings.Solo diners can choose from an a la carte option of two Satay Crunch pieces with a portion of Satay Sauce (S$8.20) or a two-piece Satay Crunch meal with regular sides and a drink (S$8.95). There’s also a more hefty two-piece Satay Crunch box (S$10.95) that comes with two regular tenders, in addition to regular sides and a drink.\xa0\xa0For sharing, there’s a Buddy meal (S$20.95) comprising five Satay Crunch pieces as well as two portions of sauce, regular whipped potato, coleslaw and Coke Zero. Or go for a family-sized Feast (S$39.95) with eight pieces of Satay Crunch chicken with four portions of sauce, nine nuggets, two medium whipped potatoes and a serving of popcorn chicken.As with other seasonal promotions, diners can opt for a mix of chicken flavours. So feel free to include your favourite KFC signatures of Original or Crispy in your meal, if the craving strikes.The Satay Crunch is available in KFC stores, for takeaways or via KFC’s delivery app.\xa0KFC is on the GrabFood delivery service as well.

And of course, the wholesome fresh bakes and sweets. Follow the cafe on social media to find out when its next pop-up market is, too!Have a try of its forest berries sourdough waffles — a unique pairing of torched berry meringue, oat-almond crumble, compote, fresh berries, and yoghurt gelato — while sipping away on oat masala chai.What to order: Granny’s apple tart (S$12), forest berries (S$17)\xa020 Siglap Drive, 01-01\nNearest MRT station: Kembangan\nOpen: Wednesday to Sunday (10am to 5pm)If we could stress-eat without limits, brownies would be the answer to a bad day. Specifically, Dr Kitchen’s brownies.Starting off as a home-based business during the pandemic, it has since expanded its operations to a brick-and-mortar bakery in Siglap. Each brownie is lovingly made from scratch using Valrhona Guanaja 70 per cent dark chocolate, so it doesn’t come off as too sweet.One of the most sought-after flavours is the hazelnut Nutella brownie, which comes with a beautifully molten Nutella centre. Other favourites include the sea salt and speculoos brownies.

Elevated pavements on dark-grey gravel and a backlit mountainscape bring a little of the outdoors in to complement the cafe’s recognisable industrial decor.Its offerings are equally photo-ready: The extensive dessert selection includes entremets, plated desserts and Swiss rolls. For a light and simple finish, we’d recommend the hojicha Swiss roll filled with purple sweet potato and hojicha cream, or the bellini, a white peach mousse with champagne jelly, raspberry and vanilla sponge.What to order: Hojicha swiss roll (S$6), Japan — choya pebbles, hojicha ice cream, matcha crumble, and dark chocolate snow (S$16)\xa0217 Lavender Street\nNearest MRT station: Bendemeer\nOpen: Hours differ (see website)For the most part, Haus217 functions as an event space for weddings and the like.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/heritage-restaurants-singapore/:['It’s not every day that you get hit by shrapnel from a bomb and live to tell the tale. But this happened to a service staff member at heritage restaurant Ananda Bhavan during the Japanese occupation from 1942 to 1945 while he was working at its original Ellison Building store.Today, this anecdote is still being passed down through the generations of staff at the Indian restaurant, which began operations in 1924.In an age when eateries open and close in Singapore at a rapid clip, a handful of heritage restaurants\xa0have kept the lights on for decades — some of them older than independent Singapore.We speak to the second- and third-generation guardians of three heritage restaurants here, and ask them what’s kept them successful over the years, how things have changed, and about their hopes and plans.\xa0The oldest Indian vegetarian restaurant in Singapore, Ananda Bhavan has been in operation for 98 years.Viren Ettikan, its chief executive and the grandson of founder Kulanthaivelu Muthusamy Kaunder, tells us that his family used to live in the unit above the original store at Ellison Building, which lies at the junction of Bukit Timah Road and Selegie Road.It had to move out of the building in 2018 owing to the construction of the North-South Corridor, which will connect Singapore’s northern region to the city.The heritage restaurant has five outlets, four in Little India and one at Changi Business Park. Its store at 58 Serangoon Road is the oldest.Viren’s late father and uncle took over the business after his grandfather’s demise.The 38-year-old tells us that his late uncle K Ramachandra was “very passionate about automation, technology and fusing it with the business”.Ramachandra encouraged automation in the kitchen to improve productivity, and in 1996, introduced a self-service ordering system, which was relatively uncommon in Indian restaurants then.To this day, the restaurant’s openness to technology is evident — it rolled out a robot waiter at its Syed Alwi Road branch last year.Viren, who joined the business in 2009 after serving in the army, says Ananda Bhavan has relied primarily on word-of-mouth recommendations and hardly does mass marketing.He believes customers return because of its sincerity and dedication to quality. He says: “We understand what the customers want and, though ingredients can be expensive at times, we don’t take shortcuts.”“You cannot cheat customers because they know the taste. If there’s anything wrong with the food, they can tell,” Viren adds.That’s also why he’s put in place feedback channels on platforms such as messaging service WhatsApp, so that customers may provide Ananda Bhavan with suggestions on improving its dishes.The restaurant also keeps tabs on the latest food trends and recently introduced truffle masala thosai at its 24-hour Syed Alwi branch to appeal to the younger generation. The dish was introduced in the thick of the coronavirus pandemic to bring in more Singaporeans, since tourist traffic nosedived.Trendy flavours aside, Ananda Bhavan also rolls out new dishes on occasions such as National Day. Viren points to its vegetarian version of chicken rice, which was a hit with customers in 2020.Despite these innovations and new dishes, Viren says the eatery has kept to its old recipes and the menus have remained largely unchanged. Most of his chefs have also been with the business for decades.While it may be a grand dame nearly a century old, Ananda Bhavan is constantly on its toes.“I’d like to run the business to a point that it’s able to keep up with the times and ensure that our founders’ philosophies are maintained… and, for the next generation, that (the philosophy) is followed,” Viren says.\xa058 Serangoon Road\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (7am to 10pm)\xa0For Cedric Tang, managing director of Ka-Soh restaurant, it’s the taste of its food that has kept customers coming back for decades.“If I get my taste correct, I don’t have to worry about people not wanting to come back,” the 37-year-old tells us, as we dig into Ka-Soh’s signature fish soup, which has a milky, sweet taste despite not containing milk.Instead, it boils fish bones for hours to achieve the robust flavour.Ka-Soh, which shares its heritage with Swee Kee Eating House, traces its roots back to 1939, when Cedric’s grandfather Tang Kwong Swee dished up fish soup at his first restaurant at Great World Amusement Park (the present-day Great World City).The older Tang went on to run a roadside hawker stall on Chin Chew Street in Chinatown selling the same dish. He later saved enough to start Swee Kee on the same street.Cedric says Swee Kee gained popularity in the 70s and 80s as Hong Kong celebrities would visit the restaurant after their concerts and filming because it opened till late. Fans visited the restaurant in hopes of spotting their favourite stars.Swee Kee relocated from Chin Chew Street to Amoy Street in the 90s.The moniker Ka-Soh came about because a waitress at Swee Kee, known as “Ka-Soh”, had built a reputation for her fiery temper and no-nonsense attitude towards customers. Hence, people started using the term Ka-Soh when they planned to visit the eatery.Cedric’s father Tang Tat Cheong caught on to this and decided to introduce the brand Ka-Soh in 1995. This was to position it as the premium version of Swee Kee — which at that time was more hawker-style — and introduce more seafood dishes.For a long while, Swee Kee and Ka-Soh operated in tandem. Swee Kee faithfully served the Central Business District crowd from its Amoy Street store, while Ka-Soh catered to patrons from its space at Outram’s Alumni Medical Centre, and later, at Greenwood estate.But the pandemic and manpower issues took a toll on the business. Swee Kee shuttered in 2021, and more recently, Ka-Soh’s Outram store closed last month.Cedric and his brother Gareth Tang, 39, soldier on.In the second half of 2021, the brothers pooled their expertise — Cedric in public relations and marketing, and Gareth in IT – to develop a delivery website from scratch.The site sold frozen versions of Ka-Soh’s signature fish soup and other popular dishes, such as pork spare ribs and prawn paste chicken.In doing so, the brothers wanted to not only bring Ka-Soh’s comfort food to people in their homes, but reach out to others who may not have heard of Swee Kee or Ka-Soh.“We were lucky… that people were familiar with our brand. The thing about our brand is that we don’t have to do too crazy things. We just need to remind people that we’re still here,” Cedric says.Since he entered the business full-time in 2018, Cedric added two dishes to Ka-Soh’s menu — pork lard fried rice, which was served exclusively at its now-shuttered Outram branch, and prawn noodle soup, a spin on its regular fish soup.Ka-Soh is recalibrating its resources after the recent closure of its Outram branch and has paused the sale of its frozen items and pork lard fried rice for the time being. Cedric is optimistic, though, that he’ll bring both items back soon enough.He hopes fish soup will someday be recognised as an iconic Singaporean dish, joining the ranks of other Singapore delights such as chicken rice.In the meantime, he wants people to continue remembering Ka-Soh for its food: “I hope people will like the food that we serve.”\xa022 Greenwood Avenue\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (11.30am to 2.30pm, 5.30pm to 9.15pm)\xa0As I sit down with chef Jumrin Isrin at Warong Nasi Pariaman’s store on North Bridge Road, it’s clear he’s extremely passionate about the heritage restaurant’s nasi padang.The 68-year-old, who has worked at the eatery for more than three decades, tells me a few times during our interview: “You must try our food!”Jumrin’s late parents founded the restaurant, which specialises in nasi padang, in 1948 after coming from Pariaman in West Sumatra, Indonesia.Not much has changed since, Jumrin tells us, save an expansion of its shop space to occupy the unit next door.The 20 or so dishes that the restaurant serves daily are made with recipes passed down from Jumrin’s parents, which have stayed the same since day one.“We go for quality. We don’t go for quantity,” he says. “That’s why you see we cater only for lunchtime. We cook limited dishes. We finish, we go.”Jumrin says he was lucky to have entered the business when his parents were still alive, so they could pass down the recipes to him. He joined them in his 30s after working in hospitality, as his parents were getting older and needed someone to step up to cook.Thankfully, Jumrin enjoyed cooking.The heritage restaurant’s signature dishes that Jumrin cooks daily include beef rendang and ayam bakar (grilled chicken), both of which are still made traditionally using a charcoal stove.“Our beef rendang is one of the best,” he tells me confidently.Jumrin worries about finding a replacement for his stove, known as an anglo, but remains firm that the restaurant uses traditional cooking methods to bring out the “right taste”. This is despite others having advised him to use a combi oven to speed things up.Budgets are also tight. So improvements in the shop are kept to a minimum, with the main digitisation effort so far being its payment system.There’s a constant stream of customers as we chat.“If you give them good food, give them quality food… they will remember you,” Jumrin says. Its customer base appears to be largely older, but I also spot occasional young patrons. Jumrin says it’s likely their parents introduced them to the eatery.The sprightly chef reaches the restaurant at about 5 every morning — except on Wednesdays when the restaurant is closed.I ask what keeps him going. “When you tell me the food is good, I feel good. All tiredness is lost,” he replies with a smile.\xa0738 North Bridge Road\nOpen: Monday and Tuesday (7.30am to 3pm); Thursday to Sunday (7.30am to 3pm)Ananda Bhavan and Ka-Soh are on the GrabFood\xa0delivery service.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/ground-floor-coffee/:['It’s hectic when I arrive at Hasif’s family home in Pasir Ris, just past 11am on a Saturday. There’s someone dropping off Sheng Siong groceries on his doorstep and an infant wailing in one of the back rooms. In the middle of the living room, the 31-year-old is pulling shots and making coffee magic.This is Ground Floor Coffee, a new heartland coffee takeaway business that’s gone viral on TikTok in the past few weeks.The idea is simple: Place your coffee order online, and when it’s ready, pick it up at Ground Floor Coffee’s minimalist takeaway window — one that happens to be an actual window of a flat owned by Hasif and his wife Rashidah, 29.\xa0They asked HungryGoWhere not to use their full names for privacy reasons.\xa0\xa0The concept is novel. Freshly brewed specialty coffee is typically the preserve of hipster coffee houses, not home-based businesses like Hasif’s, which opened on June 24.\xa0The operating hours are also hard to nail down. Hasif brews the coffee whenever he has some downtime from his photography business doing branding shoots for small businesses. These hours are posted to Ground Floor Coffee’s Instagram account the day before.The specialty here is a lavender latte (S$6), made not with generic store-bought syrups, but homemade essence from leaves. It’s not easy, says Hasif, and has taken much experimentation in terms of temperature, volume and brewing duration to arrive at its present iteration.\xa0Besides that, there are various drinks including latte (S$4), dark mocha (S$6) and pure chocolate (S$5).There’s also kek gula hangus (S$2.50) — caramelised sugar cake — that is made in-house by Hasif’s mother-in-law and goes well with the coffee.All in all, Ground Floor Coffee has intrigued Singapore’s coffee aficionados, spurring some customers to make trips down from across the island. There are even those who have placed orders via courier services such as GrabExpress, all in the name of getting a taste of Ground Floor Coffee’s brews.\xa0In total, it makes 40 cups of coffee daily.The man behind the sensation didn’t quite expect the warm reception when he launched it.\xa0“We didn’t know (our customers) were doing it for TikTok. Because I’m busy doing the shots, and they’re doing their videos outside. At the end of the day, my brother said: ‘Eh, this one — your coffee, right?’” Hasif recalls.\xa0“I just went: ‘Oh my God.’”Now, orders come in via Instagram direct messages, where they are responded to almost immediately and jotted down on small, yellow post-it notes for Hasif’s attention.\xa0The waiting time varies depending on the volume of orders, but customers don’t seem to mind. Most of them live around the area and would happily pop by for a quick pickup when their order is ready.Dlyla, 19, a Temasek Polytechnic student and Ground Floor Coffee customer, believes there’s a sense of camaraderie among Hasif’s patient clientele. As they await their coffee, they chit-chat about the brand and its unique concept, fostering a kampung spirit, she says.\xa0Ground Floor Coffee is well-situated, with a window overlooking a small road that paves the way for transport drop-offs and coffee pickups by riders. The Housing and Development Board (HDB) flat also shares a wall with the block’s void deck — a spacious public area with plenty of picturesque spots for chilling out and cool Instagram shots.\xa0According to customers, there’s a dearth of specialty coffee shops in the area, so Ground Floor Coffee’s brews are a welcome addition.\xa0Hasif may be the face of Ground Floor Coffee, but it’s really a family business.\xa0Its logo had its origins as a simple sketch by Rashidah, and has the brand’s initials hidden within it.\xa0Rashidah is an integral part of the process, taking orders and handing out drinks alongside her husband. He’s also involved his mother-in-law, a reticent lady who’s been pleasantly surprised by how quickly her bakes sell out. Hasif’s third brother pitches in as well.Hasif’s daughter Lana, a vivacious four-year-old, greets me at the gate. She’s a bundle of energy, chattering about her favourite My Little Pony characters, before darting around the living room, bouncing onto a sofa, and upending a stack of building blocks on the floor. A few metres away, the adults work with quiet efficiency.Hasif jokes that his daughter serves as Ground Floor Coffee’s customer service agent, regularly engaging with customers and their kids when they come by.\xa0She doesn’t seem bothered by the uptick in activity and coffee smells.\xa0Both father and daughter had a habit of making coffee together before Ground Floor Coffee took off. At that time, it was mostly pour overs — the coffee machines are a shiny new addition and a recent investment for the business.Like any young child, however, Lana needs her parents’ attention. Rashidah occasionally steps away to tend to her and Rayyan, the couple’s nine-month-old son. This can be a challenge for them, especially when the orders pile up.Their privacy has also been affected, with the uncertainty surrounding Ground Floor Coffee’s operating hours leading to prospective customers knocking on their door at all hours to place an order.As with any new business, Ground Floor Coffee is in its teething phase. The direct-message ordering system works, but is less than ideal.On the back-end, it’s hard to track incoming requests, and sometimes, the couple loses orders in the deluge of messages.As the business grows, Hasif hopes to improve the process. He’s working with a Singapore company to build an ordering system, slated to be ready by the end of July.This, alongside more manpower, ingredients and equipment, will require more funds. So far, Hasif has already invested about S$2,000 in two 58mm single-grouphead espresso machines to get things moving.\xa0His immediate goal for now is to break even, which may take time. “We are just doing what we can, with what we have,” he says. There are also grouses to contend with — folks who have reported Ground Floor Coffee for what they deem rule infringements.Hasif maintains that everything’s in order. Ground Floor Coffee is registered as a business with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority, and operates within the rules set by the Singapore Food Agency and Urban Redevelopment Authority.\xa0He acknowledges that Ground Floor Coffee operates in a grey area that appears to be unique to its concept. Other home-based businesses would hang their products on their gates, hand them to customers at their door, or use delivery services.\xa0“This whole idea of using the window as a pickup point, I think, is quite new. So when people saw us using the window, they misunderstood the concept. They started calling it a cafe.”But it’s the same as any other home-based business, he says.On account of the gripes, Hasif refrains from accepting orders on the spot — hence the insistence on online orders — to prevent any misunderstanding.He’s been fielding a lot of questions about the longevity of Ground Floor Coffee, but he doesn’t have plans to start a cafe. The concept revolves around the takeaway window of an HDB home after all.“The whole branding really ties in with how we’re staying on the ground floor and we sell coffee. It cannot be Level 2 Coffee, right?” he quips.\xa0Book a ride to Ground Floor Coffee. Alternatively, engage a courier for a coffee pickup via GrabExpress.214 Pasir Ris Street 21, 01-268\nNearest MRT station: Pasir Ris\nBrewing hours: Check its Instagram page214 Pasir Ris Street 21, 01-268\nNearest MRT station: Pasir Ris\nBrewing hours: Check its Instagram pageAuthorJia-En has worn several hats in her career — first writing TV scripts, then food and lifestyle stories at Wine & Dine.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/sonnys-pizza-boat-quay/:['Philadelphia has its Philly cheese steak, Baltimore has its crab cakes and Boston has its clam chowder. As for the Big Apple, no dish is as synonymous with the city as the New York slice. And I’ll be darned if Sonny’s Pizza at Boat Quay isn’t a great place to find one.You won’t get dollar slices here like in New York — though we heard prices have more than doubled there since inflation hit — but we are in Singapore after all. A hefty slice from a 12-inch pizza will set you back around S$8, with the meatier ones topping out at S$9.I can think of restaurants that would charge the same for a lot less. Then again, Sonny’s is more reminiscent of those old-school neighbourhood pizzerias so characteristic of New York than a classy joint with full wait service.The kitchen is half-open, the small space dominated by a glass pizza display, a stainless steel prep table, and a double-deck gas oven near the back — a pleasing red-orange burn charring up the pizza doughs already inside. There isn’t much in the way of seating, with a few small wooden tables and stools lining up the side.Sonny’s Pizza is the baby of chef Son Pham, who brings with him years of experience in kitchens from New York to Tokyo and, most recently, in Hong Kong. Toss in his Vietnamese roots and American upbringing, and you’ve got a full palate of flavours ripe for experimentation in this exciting grab-and-go concept.If you’re looking for an artisanal pizza restaurant with gourmet pies and Michelin-quality table service, this isn’t it.Sonny’s is about taking the most straightforward of ideas — the New York pizzeria — and rolling out a menu of deliciously creative but still-simple pizzas that are some of the best I’ve eaten in a long time. Plus, the small team, including Son himself, takes good care of you.\xa0Sonny’s makes its dough using a low-gluten 00 flour and fresh beer yeast, resulting in a pie that’s equal parts crispy and chewy. It’s the perfect base for the flavours Son has created.There’s the delish Vietnamese-inspired Saigon Stunner (S$9 a slice), dressed in a basil pesto that has wilted in the heat, with umami fish sauce and a handful of torn betel leaves, a slightly herby, bitter and peppery thing that cuts the salty mozzarella cheese and sauce.The Pepperoni (S$8 a slice) is very good as well — greasy but not unctuous with its salty and spicy salami. The sausage is smaller, like coins, than what I’m used to, which might be why the edges are crisp and curved up.Both pizzas go nicely with Sonny’s Hot Honey, a glorious sauce that’s more umami and sweet than spicy.Then, a pizza of caramelised onions, bechamel sauce, bacon, topped with dollops of hollandaise sauce, turns up and we are impressed again. The Good Morning (S$9 a slice) pizza offered us the warmth of breakfast during dinner, and we are all for it.We also tried something called The Supreme (S$9 a slice). It’s basically an upgraded version of Sonny’s sausage pizza (fior di latte mozarella, peppers and Italian sausage), with olives and ham added in. It’s not an unusual flavour, and somehow more balanced and flavourful than many we’ve eaten.You don’t need to drink to have fun here, but should you choose to imbibe, Sonny’s also doubles as a craft beer bottle shop.The fridges near the entrance are stocked with an excellent selection from around the world, including Singapore set-ups such as Sunbird Brewing Company and Brewlander.What’s particularly interesting is the curation of Hong Kong craft beers such as the Black Kite Pumpkin Spice Latte (S$13), a rich and creamy milk stout with notes of chocolate, malt, and yes, pumpkin spice.Pair this with the Old Bay Wings (S$10), crispy things that are breaded, fried and dusted with Old Bay, an addictive mix of celery salt, black pepper, red pepper flakes, paprika, and many others. Coincidentally, Old Bay comes from Son’s home state of Maryland.\xa0When we visited, the Special Hawaiian (S$8 a slice) was a recently added flavour that’s okay, showcasing decent tang from the tomato sauce and chunky pineapples as well as tasty bites of shoulder ham.Yet it didn’t stand out like the others we tried — to be fair, this comes from a person who has yet to find a Hawaiian pizza that he likes.There are also other flavours such as a five cheese pizza and a vegetarian pie. We’ll be back to this unmissable pizza hideout next time, perhaps with the fam in tow.\xa0Is it conducive to conversation? Sonny’s is great for a quick pizza and beer, but the small space and lack of ample seating make it difficult to have long conversations.Is a reservation necessary? This is a fuss-free pizza joint that doesn’t take reservations.How to get there? It’s located near the start of Circular Road closer to Elgin Bridge, a short walk from Clarke Quay MRT station.Things to note:HungryGoWhere paid for its meal at this restaurant for this review.Sonny’s Pizza is on the GrabFood delivery service.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/cupfy-bubble-tea/:['Hong Kong bubble tea brand Cupfy is launching seven new flavours at its first dine-in store in Singapore.\xa0Available from Wednesday (July 27) at its store in One-North, the new range includes a sparkling tea series of four flavours (pineapple, golden grapefruit, virgin mojito, and sour plum), two winter melon drinks, and a cold-brew coffee with calamansi to help you beat the heat.\xa0A golden oolong tea with oat milk, topped with rose-infused foam, will be available from September.\xa0Cupfy made its foray into Singapore in March and started operations at its brick-and-mortar space at Makan@Grab on April 25.\xa0Out of the seven new flavours, the sour plum sparkling tea (S$5.80) is Cupfy founder Amy Ip’s favourite. A refreshing thirst quencher, it’s made with housemade plum jam and green tea, and brewed with cold water instead of the usual hot water.Another highlight is the winter melon fresh milk with grass jelly (S$6), which is reminiscent of a Singaporean hawker staple: Hei bai, made with soya milk and grass jelly.\xa0To celebrate the launch of its new beverages, customers who order a drink from its sparkling tea series from July 27 to Aug 31 can enjoy a 50 per cent discount on their second sparkling tea.If you’re dining in, drinks will be served in tall glasses — a good option if you’re looking to feature them on your Instagram feed.Otherwise, takeaway and delivery orders will come in biodegradable paper cups and tapioca straws. A pro tip: Bring your own cup to receive a 20-cent discount on your order.Cupfy,\xa0a play on “cup-free”, prides itself on being a health- and eco-conscious brand.Speaking in a mixture of English and Mandarin at a media event on Monday, Ip, 49, says its ingredients are carefully sourced from around the world and handpicked to ensure their suitability.The brand’s house tea leaves are from Nantou, Taiwan, and were not easy to get — Ip had to brave a horde of wild monkeys on a mountain in Lugu, Nantou. Its milk is from Europe and whipped cream from France.Its toppings are also made from scratch in-house. The grass jelly, for example, is smoother than traditional variants. Ip says the ones in Hong Kong are traditionally harder and more bitter.\xa0The oat milk, which is used in Cupfy’s oat milk series, is also housemade, and does not contain additives or preservatives. This also has other benefits, including cutting paper waste and packaging.Everything ties back to Ip’s original intent. She noticed that more young people in Hong Kong were being diagnosed with diabetes and wanted to provide a healthier alternative to bubble tea, a typically sugar-rich beverage.\xa0Cupfy was thus born in 2019.Health-conscious customers can ask for maltitol, a diabetic-friendly sugar substitute, in their drinks. Otherwise, raw cane sugar is the default, and it is used in lower quantities than other bubble tea brands on the market.Ip hopes to make a positive impact on consumers and the environment by passing her tea know-how to the younger generation.“I built this business with my children in mind. When they were younger, they loved milk tea and I wanted to make sure that they had good, nourishing options to drink.”Cupfy is on the GrabFood delivery service. You can also book a ride there.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/no-harm-done-coffee-pods/:['As with many caffeine addicts out there, coffee is my morning must-have. Whether it’s coffee pods, 3-in-1 kopi packets or takeaway coffee in a styrofoam cup, I opt for the easiest way to get my caffeine hit.\xa0It was thus a slightly sheepish encounter when I met Simon Lieberum, 38, co-founder of No Harm Done, a homegrown coffee startup promoting zero-waste and sustainable living.While I try to use reusable coffee cups and recycle whenever possible, it’s a challenge to shake off the habitual use of aluminium coffee pods on an almost-daily basis.Lieberum says: “Generally, aluminium coffee pods are not very sustainable at all. Especially (given) how it’s sourced, it causes a lot of damage to the environment. (It’s) a step before you can talk about recycling a capsule, (because) just producing it is extremely harmful.” So, what are the alternatives?\xa0Lieberum first came to Singapore from Germany in 2013 and has two children with his wife, a Singaporean.The idea for No Harm Done started when the couple was gifted a coffee machine. As they used the machine, the pods piled up, and it got Lieberum thinking about how the pods affected the environment.He explored sustainable options, such as refillable pods, but didn’t find them a truly viable replacement.Solutions like these are a great effort in the right direction, says Lieberum, but few people stick to them in the long run.\xa0“(Refillable coffee pods are) very inconvenient. Also, the coffee quality isn’t necessarily there — not every coffee, and every combination (of) grind, size, roast, (and) intensity, is suitable for an espresso machine.”\xa0What No Harm Done seeks to do instead is provide greener options to complement prevailing consumer behaviours.“It’s very difficult to take something away from people that they’re very comfortable with,” he says. “(Since) you’re used to (coffee pods), stick to your habits\xa0 — just use a sustainable alternative instead,” he adds.\xa0Lieberum recognises the concept of environmentally friendly pods is not new but is confident that No Harm Done’s take on it is an Asia-first when it comes to being completely biodegradable and plastic-free.It’s been working with German company Terracaps to produce the pods — a partner carefully chosen for its carbon-neutral footprint and transparent sourcing habits.Most capsules on the market — including No Harm Done’s initial product — include an aluminium lid, a component born out of necessity in this tropical climate. Otherwise, the Arabica coffees quickly turn sour, Lieberum says.It’s been a long journey spanning several years for the small team at No Harm Done to do away with such materials.“It took many iterations and burned most of our paid-up capital to try different variations, compostable films and so on, to get to the point where we are now.”\xa0According to Lieberum, No Harm Done’s finally hit the jackpot and settled on the best version yet. A new line of fully plant-based capsules, made from vegetable fibre and plant starches, is due to hit the stores in October. These are not only aluminium-free and plastic-free but certified home-compostable.\xa0For Lieberum, it’s also about embracing Asian coffee and tea drinks, and taking them into the modern era.His love affair with kopi began with an aunty — a kopitiam aunty, that is. “(When I first arrived), I just asked for an iced latte to-go, and then she gave me the Kopi-C in a (plastic) packet. It was just so weird, and I just loved it.”He believes coffee is an indelible part of Singaporean culture. “(It’s) part of the fabric of identity, in a way, and then (gets) lost when you leave the hawker centre.”“If you want it for the home or the office, there’s nothing (that you can buy).”No Harm Done was thus born — promoting, in Lieberum’s words, “Asian coffees and locally inspired beverages in planet-friendly packaging”.Its product line includes the usual suspects — organic coffee, espresso and the like — but also has flavours such as Singapore Kopi-O and cha yen, a Thai iced tea.\xa0Besides its work in producing sustainable pods, No Harm Done’s coffee also uses fewer raw materials.“In each capsule, we work with around 5g of coffee, which is extremely little. If you go into a coffee shop and order an espresso, you might use up to five times more.” This translates to a lower carbon footprint per cup.The team also uses secondhand packaging for its retail and e-commerce shipments, often giving new life to unwanted boxes and parcel wrappings from neighbouring offices and warehouses. Singapore startup Tria, which produces sustainable foodware, is one of its go-to partners for boxes and paper products.No Harm Done also makes a point of working with vulnerable populations. For example, the beans used in some of its flagship coffees are supplied by fair trade coffee farmers in Doi Chaang, Thailand.“We were always on the lookout for coffee farmers, where a substantial cut of the product and earnings stay within the community. We spoke to many and I think (with the Doi Chaang farmers, it was) just a good match.”The farmers also lend their expertise in roasting coffee beans, so the beans come as a finished good, rather than just a raw commodity, says Lieberum. “We’re definitely paying significantly above market prices (for the coffee beans).”\xa0And because profits ultimately go back into nurturing and educating the community, No Harm Done is happy to continue its current business model.Closer to home, No Harm Done offers job opportunities to the elderly. Jannica Chye, 64 — affectionately called “Aunty Jannica” by the team — starts her morning packing e-commerce orders into boxes, readies them for shipping, and is often done for the day by lunchtime.Says Lieberum: “If (the elderly) still need to work, then it’s good to have an environment where it’s not too stressful. One where part-time (work) is an option, where it doesn’t matter how good your English is, or how well you can hear, or how fast you can pick up information — as long as the order is packed with the right product, in the right box.”\xa0No Harm Done ships out 400 coffee orders every month, mainly from regulars and referrals from various channels, including its website and e-commerce platforms.Two more Asian-inspired flavours are also slated for launch by year-end.“Our idea for the next year is to start venturing into other Southeast Asian countries — probably Malaysia and Indonesia, with their strong coffee culture,” says Lieberum.No Harm Done is on the GrabMart delivery service.AuthorJia-En has worn several hats in her career — first writing TV scripts, then food and lifestyle stories at Wine & Dine.

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/authentic-korean-west-singapore/:['This is the final instalment of a five-part series on authentic Korean eateries in Singapore. Here, we check out places in the west of Singapore.Western Singapore isn’t top of mind when you think of authentic Korean food, but tucked within a condominium at Jalan Jurong Kechil is a seafood restaurant selling raw octopus, just like how you’d find it at Jagalchi Market in Busan, South Korea.We uncover a few more places in the west serving up authentic Korean nosh that will leave you feeling as though you stepped right into a restaurant in the Land of the Morning Calm.\xa0Hillview Community Centre, 01-04, 1 Hillview Rise\nNearest MRT station: Hillview\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (11.30pm to 3pm, 5.30pm to 9pm)Dining at Wang Family Kitchen is reminiscent of my meals at the school canteen during my exchange semester in Seoul. I didn’t know what was being served till the day of each meal, I was served a plethora of side dishes along with my mains, and everything looked as though it’d been cooked up by a Korean ajumma (older lady).While Wang Family Kitchen used to serve its dishes buffet-style, it now offers you a single set of dishes at a fixed price — with no refills for its banchan (side dishes). Should you prefer mains such as kimchi stew, you can order them, depending on availability. They come with rice, five side dishes and dessert.As the menu changes every day, it’d be good to check its Instagram page before heading there, so you have an idea of what’s being served beforehand.What to order: Daily dine-in set (S$17.90), kimchi stew (S$18.90)\xa0Vision Exchange, 02-43, 2 Venture Drive\nNearest MRT station: Jurong East\nOpen: Monday to Saturday (11.30am to 2.30pm, 5pm to 10pm)Just a stone’s throw from Jurong East MRT station, Ahtti Korean Restaurant is a quaint eatery tucked away at the Vision Exchange office building selling Korean fried chicken.What I love about the eatery is that it doesn’t just offer the usual flavours of yangnyeom (spicy), original, honey butter and ganjang (soy sauce). It also serves padak or spring onion (an absolute Korean favourite) and two spicy variations — chilli padi, which is spicy level one, and hotdak, a staggering spicy level three.With so many fried chicken varieties, everyone’s bound to find his or her favourite. But if all else fails, Ahtti also serves standard Korean dishes such as zzolmyeon (spicy chewy noodles), stews and pancakes. If you’re adventurous, you might even want to try its grilled chicken gizzard.What to order: Chilli padi wings (S$19), zzolmyeon (S$9)\xa0The Hilford, 01-52, 182 Jalan Jurong Kechil\nNearest MRT station: Beauty World\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (11am to 3pm, 5pm to 10.30pm)Pohang is a seaside town in South Korea well-known for its seafood. It’s no surprise then that Pohang Seafood & Butchery in Jalan Jurong Kechil specialises in seafood — live octopus (or san-nakji in Korean), to be precise.It’s certainly rare to find san-nakji in a Korean restaurant in Singapore and seeing it served here gives me major Busan flashbacks. San-nakji is often eaten in Korean seafood restaurants, and the tentacles are served live, raw and chopped up — topped with a drizzle of sesame oil and seeds.Aside from its star dish, Pohang has Korean sashimi sets, known as hoe. While Korean sashimi looks similar to its Japanese counterpart, it’s usually consumed with spicy dipping sauces ssamjang or chojang.What to order: Flatfish set (S$150 for two persons), big dumpling and pork collar kimchi stew (S$48)\xa0JCube, B1-11, 2 Jurong East Central\nNearest MRT station: Jurong East\nOpen: Monday to Thursday, and Sunday (11.30am to 10pm), Friday and Saturday (11.30am to 10.30pm)Dookki is an all-you-can-eat Korean tteokbokki (rice cake) restaurant that has two branches in Singapore, so westies can have their fill at Dookki’s JCube outlet. Don’t strike it off as just another chain restaurant in a mall — it’s an authentically Korean eatery that’s opened outposts in various Southeast Asian countries, such as Malaysia and Vietnam.Its name stands for “two meals” in Korean, where the first meal is rice cake and the second is kimchi fried rice, fried with leftover rice-cake sauce from your first meal.Dining at Dookki is a well-rounded experience: Apart from rice cakes, you get to choose what items you want in your pot, customise your sauce, and lastly, cook your own fried rice (or have the crew members do it for you!).What to order: Buffet (S$10.80++ for kids 110cm to 130cm tall, S$18.80++ for adults)\xa019 Lorong Kilat, 01-02\nNearest MRT station: Beauty World\nOpen: Monday to Saturday (12pm to 2.30pm, 5.30pm to 12am), Sunday (5.30pm to 12am)Woorinara is an authentic Korean food mainstay that has been around for years, serving residents living around Beauty World. It isn’t as fancy as some of the newer restaurants around, but once you step inside, you’ll feel as though you’ve entered a quaint restaurant in Seoul — complete with an all-Korean service crew.The food is homely and its flavours are true to what you’d find in Korea. As with most generic Korean restaurants, Woorinara has an extensive menu cutting across the standard Korean dishes of rice, noodles, pancakes, meats, and stews. But what I like most is its generous servings of side dishes, which are a welcome change from the standard three or four you’d get at most Korean eateries in Singapore.What to order: Beef and pork barbecue set (S$55), jokbal — pig’s feet (S$40)\xa0\xa0Ahtti Korean Restaurant, Pohang Seafood & Butchery, Dookki, and Woorinara are on the GrabFood delivery service.

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/authentic-korean-eateries-east-singapore/:['This is the fourth instalment of a five-part series on authentic Korean eateries in Singapore. Here, we check out places in the east of Singapore.Braised duck soup and spicy raw-fish soup aren’t commonly found in Korean eateries in Singapore. But we scour the corners of the east and bring you a list of places where you can find these dishes and more.\xa0Arc 380, 01-02, 380 Jalan Besar\nNearest MRT station: Bendemeer\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (11.30am to 2.30pm, 5.30pm to 10pm)Songane is a family-run restaurant tucked away on the ground floor of Arc 380, a building close to Bendemeer MRT station. For now, Songane doesn’t take reservations, so be prepared to wait for a while if you’re heading there.The restaurant specialises in Korean barbecue, but what really got me excited was its naengmyeon (cold noodles) and oritang (braised duck soup) — which aren’t often found in Korean restaurants here. They also make great accompaniments to a Korean barbecue meal.Aside from oritang, it has ori jumulleok (spicy roast duck) on its menu. Depending on your preference, you can take your pick between a stew and a stir-fried version. But be warned — both can be quite spicy!What to order: Braised duck soup (S$18), naengmyeon (S$17)\xa0200 Jalan Besar\nNearest MRT station: Jalan Besar\nOpen: Monday, and Wednesday to Sunday (12pm to 3pm, 5pm to 11pm)If the queue at Songane is a tad long and you’re still craving Korean nosh, walk about five minutes down the Jalan Besar stretch and you’ll come across ReplyK1988. If you’re a K-drama fan, then the restaurant’s name would probably ring a bell. It’s named after Reply 1988, a popular coming-of-age drama set in the 80s.The restaurant features retro green accents and arched glass panels. Regulars of this restaurant not only swear by its food quality but its service — where crew members change out your grill or mesh, depending on the type of meat you’ve ordered.Its affordability has also fuelled its popularity. Its pork set for two costs S$58 and includes three types of quality Duroc (an older breed of domestic pigs that consistently yields high-quality meat) pork cuts, a soup, and free-flow side dishes.What to order: 1988 pork galbi — grilled pork short ribs marinated in Korean soya sauce (S$26.50), gopchang jeongol — stew with beef intestines, vegetables and udon (S$54)\xa0East Village, 01-66, 430 Upper Changi Road\nNearest MRT station: Tanah Merah\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (11am to 3pm, 5.30pm to 10pm)Dalcomhan Bam Korean Restaurant (not to be confused with Dal Bam in Tanjong Pagar) is a small Korean eatery tucked away in East Village near Simpang Bedok. True to its name, which means “sweet night” in Korean, it’s been the fuel and highlight of my busy weeknights since I chanced upon it on GrabFood.Dalcomhan Bam serves homey, authentic Korean grub, which genuinely looks and tastes like it came out of a Korean mum’s kitchen. Aside from the usual Korean favourites of pancakes, stews and barbecued meat, Dalcomhan Bam shines with its street food offerings of regular kimbap, cream cheese apple pie roll and egg rolls. The best part is all these are below S$10 each.If you live in the area or work close by, the restaurant also has lunch promotions on weekdays and weekends (11am to 3pm), serving sizeable portions of Korean stew and hotplates from S$9.90.What to order: Kimchi cheese kimbap (S$10.90), Bossam — a boiled pork dish (S$26)\xa0The Venue Shoppes, 01-24, 2 Tai Thong Crescent\nNearest MRT station: Potong Pasir\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (11.30am to 2.30pm, 5.30pm to 10.30pm)There are many elements to getting Korean fried chicken right — from the juiciness to the crunch and even the glaze. 88 Chicken sits surreptitiously on the ground floor of The Venue Shoppes and excels at all of the above.The restaurant serves generous portions of white radish to go with your fried chicken — reminiscent of how it’s done in Korea.With such good chicken, it’s no surprise 88 Chicken sees a sizeable queue at mealtimes. If you live nearby, you’ll be glad to know it offers delivery and pick-up options.What to order: Soy wings (S$10 for a half-portion), army stew (S$22 for a small portion)\xa0Katong Shopping Centre, 01-41/42/43, 865 Mountbatten Road\nNearest MRT station: Paya Lebar\nOpen: Monday, and Wednesday to Sunday (12pm to 10.30pm)Hoe (pronounced “huey”, as in tau huey), or Korean raw fish, is one of my favourite Korean dishes. But it’s extremely hard to find outside Tanjong Pagar.It’s not quite the same as sashimi; it’s consumed differently (usually wrapped in lettuce) and served alongside other types of raw seafood.When I chanced on Golden Ocean Korean Seafood & BBQ, it truly felt like a hidden find. Golden Ocean serves authentic, decently priced raw-fish sets along with other Korean favourites such as stews and pancakes.Other uncommon Korean dishes on Golden Ocean’s menu include mulhoe (spicy raw-fish soup) and hoe-deopbap (raw fish with rice and vegetables). The selection of dishes at Golden Ocean — backed by the chatter of Koreans — is a testament to the authenticity and taste of the food it serves.What to order: Mulhoe (S$25 for an individual portion, S$100 for a sharing portion), hoe-deopbap (S$30)\xa0ReplyK1988, Dalcomhan Bam Korean Restaurant, 88 Chicken, and Golden Ocean Korean Seafood & BBQ are on the GrabFood delivery service.

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/authentic-korean-eating-spots-singapores-north/:['This is the third instalment of a five-part series on authentic Korean eateries in Singapore. Here, we check out places in the north of Singapore.From skewers to fried chicken to black bean noodles, we explore the nooks and crannies of Singapore’s north and find you the most authentic food spots that serve you more than just the usual Korean barbecue and stews. A flight to South Korea may take only six hours, but here are five eating places you can cover in the same amount of time — without having to leave the island.\xa0Causeway Point, B1-K11, 1 Woodlands Square\nNearest MRT station: Woodlands\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (11am to 8.15pm)If you’ve been watching one too many K-dramas, you’d probably know that South Korea is famous for its streetside food stalls. 9pm Kkochi is a snack stand in Causeway Point mall that tries to replicate this concept, albeit in a more Singaporean manner of being a kiosk in a shopping centre.For the uninitiated, “kkochi” means skewer in Korean and typically refers to marinated meat on a stick. It makes a convenient snack when you’re pressed for time or if you’re craving a quick protein fix. Aside from meat skewers, 9pm Kkochi serves trendy Korean street food such as cupbab (rice in a cup), corndogs and good ol’ spicy rice cakes.What to order: Corndog (S$5.90), honey garlic popcorn chicken in a cup (S$5.90)\xa0136 Marsiling Road\nNearest MRT station: Marsiling\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (11am to 9pm)One of my biggest gripes when I craved authentic Korean fried chicken in Singapore used to be that I had to have it at restaurants. What if I wanted just two pieces to satisfy my chimaek (a portmanteau of chicken and maekju — Korean beer) craving?Waker Chicken has changed that, with seven Singapore stores situated at highly accessible coffee shops. North-siders, you no longer have to head to Tanjong Pagar for Korean fried chicken, as Waker Chicken has a branch in the heart of Marsiling.Two Singapore-based Koreans, Noh Tae Woo and Kim Jinho, started the brand. Kim has loved his fried chicken since childhood, so you can be assured of crispy, fried goodness in every serving.I love that it offers classic flavours such as original, soy sauce and sweet spicy, but also serves a honey butter option — a flavour that was all the rage a few years ago in Korea. Nonetheless, I have to say it’s the original and soy sauce varieties that go best with a refreshing pint of beer — even better if you can pair them with a bottle of Hite or Terra.What to order: Honey butter whole chicken (S$28), soy sauce four-piece tenders (S$6.50)\xa0Koufu HQ Food Court, 01-02, 1 Woodlands Height\nNearest MRT: Admiralty\nOpen: Monday, and Wednesday to Sunday (11am to 3pm, 5pm to 8.30pm)I discovered O.bba Jjajang at Tanjong Pagar several years ago, but the recent craze and crowds have made it extremely difficult to get a table without a considerable wait. So it was a pleasant surprise to learn that the brand recently set up an express concept in Woodlands (which, I hope, signals the start of more express stalls to come).On account of its location within a food court, O.bba Jjajang Express keeps its prices affordable with portion sizes that are comparable to its Tanjong Pagar outfit. Despite its smaller space, it still sells favourites such as tangsuyuk (sweet-and-sour pork), kimchi fried rice, spicy seafood noodles, ramyun (instant noodles), and dumplings.What to order: Jjajangmyeon (S$7.50), tangsukyuk (S$13)\xa0473 Fernvale Street, 01-05\nNearest MRT: Sengkang\nOpen: Monday, and Wednesday to Sunday (5pm to 10.30pm)If you find its name familiar, you may have come across its pull-up challenge on social media last year, when it offered free meals and discounts based on the number of pull-ups completed. Michin still organises fitness challenges monthly, but even if you don’t win a free meal, its buffet prices are affordable — S$11.95 for kids below 12 and S$22.95 for adults.While the Korean barbecue and hotpot combination reminds us more of Thai mookata, Michin earns a spot on our list because of its quality meats and variety of seafood items.What to eat: Buffet (S$11.95 for kids below 12, S$22.95 for adults)\xa07 Ang Mo Kio Street 66, 01-13\nNearest MRT station: Yio Chu Kang\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (11am to 3pm, 5pm to 10pm)It’s been a few years since I visited the Land of the Morning Calm, but stepping into Nayana immediately reminded me of the Myeongdong shopping district, where music blasted as I shopped and dug into Korean street snacks. If you’re a K-pop fan, you’ll love this eatery for its looping K-pop playlist and authentic Korean nosh — whipped up by a Korean executive chef, no less.A cross between a cafe and a restaurant, Nayana’s interior is quaint and minimalist, albeit decked out in idol merchandise. With its cafe vibes, it’s a perfect hangout for a leisurely weekday lunch.But do note that the establishment functions more like a restaurant — as opposed to a fast-food joint or cafe — and cooks all your food to order. So be prepared for a slight wait for your food. In the meantime, enjoy the music.What to order: Hotplate chicken dakgalbi — spicy marinated chicken (S$32.90), Nayana fried boneless chicken in sweet chilli, cheezy or original flavours (S$9.90 for six pieces)\xa09pm Kkochi, Waker Chicken, O.bba Jjajang Express, and Nayana Kpop Cafe & Restaurant are on the GrabFood delivery service.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/mr-holmes-bakehouse-pacific-plaza/:['Almost a year after it made its foray into Singapore, Mr Holmes Bakehouse, the original cruffin makers from San Francisco, has been refreshing its melange of baked goods every month.\xa0In a wildly competitive market where home bakers and independent bakeries go head-to-head with the big names, well-established bakeries have their work cut out for them.\xa0When we visited Mr Holmes Bakehouse — decked out in its signature pink and white hues — on a Friday morning in April, the K-pop blaring through the store was a decibel too loud against the rare picture of calm along Scotts Road.\xa0They say the early bird catches the worm. In this case, showing up early at the bakery meant we got a full display of cruffins, croissants, donuts and pastries to pick from.\xa0But the visual feast was a double-edged sword.\xa0With cruffins coated in fine sugar and croissants half-dressed in a glaze, most of what was on display (except the plain ones) couldn’t be reheated, we were told. So we had to contend with imagining how the flaky pastries would’ve tasted fresh from the oven.The daredevils of viennoiserie, and trademark owner of the term “cruffin” (a croissant-and-muffin hybrid), Mr Holmes Bakehouse was set up in the United States eight years ago. Its founder Aaron Caddel quickly made the pastry store Instagram-famous for its cruffins.\xa0The San Franciscan bakery, distinguishable by its pink neon lights and white-tiled walls, later made inroads into places such as Los Angeles and Seoul, South Korea.But like many other eateries, it wasn’t spared the ravages of the coronavirus pandemic. Last year, Mr Holmes Bakehouse declared bankruptcy and shut some of its branches in the US and abroad.\xa0Caerus Holding, a Singapore lifestyle firm responsible for brands such as the Lady M and Leckerbaer confectioneries, runs two\xa0Mr Holmes Bakehouse stores in Singapore — the first at Pacific Plaza mall and the second at MYP Centre, a commercial building.The small al fresco seating area, though marred by shaky tables, faces the street and is a prime spot for people-watching as you tuck into a flaky matcha croissant (S$5) and raspberry mocha cruffin (S$6.50).\xa0Though both seemed to have lost their crisp, likely from sitting in the open for too long, the sweet glaze on the croissant had a distinct taste of matcha — proof that the bakery didn’t scrimp on premium matcha powder. The cream that flowed from the cruffin was a perfect mishmash of chocolate and espresso, with a slight tartness from the raspberries.\xa0While the sweet treats are enticing, don’t overlook the savoury bakes, even though they’ve been chucked to the back of the display. The spinach artichoke bun (S$6.50), sold as a slice, looked nothing like a bun — but it was a cheesy, salty respite from the pastry-induced sugar rush.\xa0The revived Mr Holmes Bakehouse holds much promise given its repertoire of baked goods, but it hasn’t quite lived up to the high bar that the original chain had set. It may be ’gram-worthy, but it runs the risk of becoming passe when its intended audience outgrows the hot pink shades and neon lights.\xa0There’s nothing quite like the crunch of biting into a well-made pastry, so the bakery should think of ways to serve all their baked goods warm and crispy.\xa0And yes, we know pastries run the show here, but the iced latte (S$7) and chai latte (S$7.50) we ordered were unremarkable. Our hope is that the team could go further to enlarge its selection of drinks beyond the basics — from espresso to hot chocolate — that are on offer now. It could team up with a coffee roaster and roll out monthly specials, so that there’s more to look forward to.Is it conducive to conversation? It’ll get busy on weekends. So if you’re looking for a place to give your friends the lowdown on that secret you’ve been keeping in for a month, come by on weekdays when it’s much quieter.\xa0Is a reservation necessary? Mr Holmes Bakehouse doesn’t take reservations for now. If seats are hard to come by, get a cruffin to go and have it by the pavement.\xa0Takeaway recommendations? You can order from its website and schedule a pick-up to avoid queuing. If you’re doing this, we’d suggest getting the plain baked goods, if you’re planning to reheat and eat them later.\xa0How to get there?

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/authentic-korean-eateries-central-singapore/:['This is the second instalment of a five-part series on authentic Korean eateries in Singapore. Here, we check out places in central Singapore.If you want to avoid the crowds that throng southern Singapore in search of some of the most authentic Korean food you’ll find on our island, then central Singapore’s your next-best bet.We tell you where to find a homely jjajangmyeon restaurant and unearth a few unexpected heartland finds serving up Korean street food and comfort dishes.\xa0275 Thomson Road, 01-07\nNearest MRT station: Novena\nOpen: Monday, and Wednesday to Sunday (11.30am to 2.30pm, 5pm to 8.30pm)Calling itself the most authentic Korean-Chinese restaurant in Singapore, Mukjja may be a relatively new name to most. But years ago, it served up bowls of jjajangmyeon (black bean noodles) and jjamppong (seafood noodles) at Clarke Quay’s Central mall under the name Tae Woo Ban Jum, developing a reputation for its authentic nosh.The family behind the original restaurant resumed operations in Novena in 2020 with the name Mukjja, which means “let’s eat” in Korean.Revisiting Mukjja felt like a homecoming of sorts, seeing the same side dishes and tasting the familiar, comforting bowl of black bean noodles. This time, aside from the noodles, I’ve developed a newfound appreciation for its fried chicken dishes — kkanpunggi (spicy fried chicken with garlic sauce) and yuringi (fried chicken with hot soybean sauce) — which are guaranteed to spice up any Korean-Chinese meal.What to order: Jjajangmyeon (S$11), kkanpunggi (S$32)\xa0209 Upper Thomson Road\nNearest MRT station: Upper Thomson\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (11.30am to 2.30pm, 5pm to 9.30pm)If you’ve visited South Korea, you’ll know that some of the best, homiest Korean food can be found in the most unassuming restaurants. Parker is one such eatery; even its retro signboard and strikingly green interior are atypical of those you’ll find in Korea.The Korean couple behind the eatery arrived in Singapore in 1999 and started Parker in Boat Quay, before moving to Thomson, where they have been operating since. Their son Park Jin Sub runs the front-of-house, waiting tables while his parents cook — whipping up dishes with recipes handed down through two generations back in Korea.What to order: Dak ganjeong — chicken with sweet-and-spicy sauce (S$20 for a small portion), LA Galbi — marinated beef ribs (S$42)\xa0Jubilee Square, 01-13, 61 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 8\nNearest MRT station: Ang Mo Kio\nOpen: Monday to Friday (1pm to 9pm), Saturday and Sunday (11am to 10pm)Named after South Korea’s calling code, 82Bunsik is a quaint cafe in Ang Mo Kio Central selling simple Korean street food, namely corndogs, rice cakes and croffles. Croffles are a cross between a croissant and waffle, and have been quite popular in Korea.You might baulk at the idea of shelling out close to S$5 for a corndog, but 82Bunsik proudly makes them using handmade yeast dough. The cafe ages the dough for a day after making it fresh daily, giving the corndogs a delightful crunch.We also love that the cafe sells the trendy croffle snack in injeolmi (Korean sweet rice cake) flavour, typically found only in bingsu or shaved ice snacks here. If you love your Korean street snacks and injeolmi, you know where to go!What to order: Original corndog (S$4.50), injeolmi croffle (S$5.50)\xa0Thomson Plaza, 01-96, 301 Upper Thomson Road\nNearest MRT station: Upper Thomson\nOpen: Monday (11.30am to 8.30pm), Tuesday (11am to 8.30pm), Wednesday to Friday (11am to 9pm), and Saturday and Sunday (10.30am to 9pm)At first glance, Kong Cafe might look like a regular coffee spot with its minimalist aesthetic, but look closely at its menu and you’ll see a medley of Korean and Western dishes. Owner Hanna Mi serves both all-day brunch and authentic Korean dishes in an east-meets-west concept at Kong Cafe.It might be a peculiar concept, but hey, we’re not complaining — after all, it might be among the few Korean eateries in Singapore where you can have coffee, lunch and dessert in one place. It’s also a great location to dine at if you have a group of friends who are undecided about what to eat.What to order: Rarabokyi — rice cakes, instant noodles, fishcake, mussels, and egg in a spicy sauce (S$26), honey butter wings (S$15)\xa0190 Lorong 6 Toa Payoh, 01-516\nNearest MRT station: Toa Payoh\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (11.30am to 9.30pm)Young Korean chef Anna Lee runs Han Kki and dishes up home-style Korean food at affordable prices in the heart of Toa Payoh. Despite its small space, the eatery has an extensive food selection.Expect to find barbecued chicken, pork and beef — all marinated in-house — and seared to perfection. The best part is everything’s done in the kitchen, so you get your Korean barbecue fix sans smoke in your hair and clothes. Enjoy your soju and maekju (beer) here with your food — just be mindful of its closing time of 9.30pm.What to order: Marinated grilled beef ribs (S$18), army stew (S$14.50)\xa082Bunsik, Kong Cafe and Han Kki are on the GrabFood delivery service.

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/thai-eateries-singapore-east/:['This is the fourth instalment of a five-part series on authentic Thai eateries in Singapore. Here, we check out places in Singapore’s east.The Land of Smiles may be a short flight from Singapore, but there’s no need for the hassle of booking an air ticket and accommodation when there are plenty of authentic Thai eateries here.Apart from the quaint cafes and hidden hawker gems that the east is known for, here are five Thai food spots that will whet your appetite.\xa0136 Bedok North Avenue 3, 01-166\nNearest MRT stations: Bedok and Bedok Reservoir\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (11.30am to 3pm, 5.30pm to 10pm)Situated along Bedok North Avenue 3, Nangfa Thai Kitchen is a Thai restaurant opened by an ex-franchisee of Nakhon Kitchen.Bringing over the same culinary team from the original Nakhon Kitchen Bedok store, the crew executes familiar Thai dishes with great skill and efficiency.We love Nangfa’s take on the pad thai — wok-fried white rice noodles with dark sauce and spices, served with an assortment of toppings such as pork slices, prawns, beansprouts, and chilli flakes.There are plenty of side dishes to choose from, including deep-fried pork with garlic (S$6.50), homemade Thai fishcake (S$6.50) and pandan-leaves chicken.What to order: Pad thai (S$6.50), pandan-leaves chicken (S$6.50)\xa001-01, 218 Bedok North Street 1\nNearest MRT station: Bedok\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (11.30am to 11pm)Spicy Thai-Thai Cafe has all the makings of an authentic Thai restaurant. This casual eatery executes its dishes perfectly with the use of charcoal — instead of a regular stovetop — to cook its soups and steamed dishes.It even imports tea leaves from Thailand to create its thirst-quenching Thai iced tea. With both mookata and a la carte Thai dishes under one roof, Spicy Thai-Thai Cafe has an extensive menu of dishes.Its signature lala (clams) bee hoon features an addictive, peppery kick and comes with a generous portion of clams. Enjoy other dishes such as its fried donut-shaped prawn cakes (S$6 for two pieces) and deep-fried kang kong (water spinach).\xa0What to order: Deep-fried kang kong with special Thai sauce (S$12), lala beehoon (S$18)\xa029 Bendemeer Road, 01-01\nNearest MRT station: Boon Keng\nOpen: Saturday to Thursday (6am to 1.30pm)\xa0My first taste of Thai wanton mee was ironically not in its motherland — it was in Canada. When I returned to Singapore, I searched high and low for a similarly toothsome bowl of wanton mee.Enter Kin Moo, a store that rose to fame with its signature Thai wanton mee (also known as baamee keow haeng moo dang). The flavourful springy noodles are tossed in pork lard oil and a special sauce.The pork collar char siew — lightly charred for a caramelised finish — is tender and juicy. The bowl is then topped with fried pork lard bits, fried garlic, spring onions, and cilantro.\xa0Apart from its wanton mee, its tom yum noodle dry (S$5) is a must-have. Featuring housemade tom yum sauce, this is a spicy, sour and savoury bowl of noodles that might prove to be addictive.What to order: Thai wanton mee (S$4.50), pork knuckle noodle (S$5.50)\xa04 Changi Village Road, 01-2086\nNearest MRT station: Pasir Ris\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (11.30am to 3pm, 5.30pm to 9.45pm)Pranakorn is helmed by head chef Yongpeerakun (aka Kaopan), who was born and raised in Chonburi, Thailand. Pranakorn is the old name of Bangkok, which happens to be 80km from Yongpeerakun’s hometown.\xa0Determined to pave its own way, Pranakorn does not offer the usual pad thai or pineapple rice. Instead, a less common spread of Thai delights takes centre stage.Yongpeerakun uses moo daeng (minced pork) in many dishes here as an ode to her hometown. Its signature Thai-style stick noodle with minced pork in tom yum soup includes smooth Thai noodles in hot and sour soup with a generous serving of minced pork. A dry version is also available if that’s your cup of tea.What to order: Steamed whole sea bass with chilli lime dressing (S$30), Thai-style stick noodle with minced pork in tom yum soup (S$6.80)\xa0Golden Mile Tower, B1-63, 6001 Beach Road\nNearest MRT station: Nicoll Highway\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (12pm to 6am)Mookata, originally from northern Thailand, is loosely translated as “pork skillet”. The iconic mookata dome-shaped skillet allows for the best dining experience of both barbecue and steamboat.If you’ve got a mookata craving, Siam Square Mookata in Golden Mile Tower is probably the place to visit, given its popularity. Its ingredients are delivered to your table in plastic stackable plates — a space-saving ingenuity when you’re bound to rack up orders.What keeps me coming back for more is its variety of housemade chilli sauces; one to be paired with seafood, one with meat, and the last being sweeter and less spicy.\xa0What to order: Smoked duck (S$2.80), pork belly (S$1.80)\xa0Darren Tan contributed to this guide.\xa0Spicy Thai-Thai Cafe, Kin Moo, Pranakorn, and Siam Square Mookata are on the GrabFood delivery service.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/daejim-modern-korean-pojangmacha/:['Daejim reimagines traditional Korean pojangmacha street food and Korean barbecue, offering freshly grilled seafood, meats, makgeolli (sparkling white rice wine), and soju cocktails in a chic store. Pojangmacha is a form of commercial establishment based out of a small tent or street stall found in South Korea.A new entrant to the Tanjong Pagar neighbourhood, it sets itself apart with a menu that shares an equal emphasis on fresh seafood flown in from Korea and top-quality meat. The store’s interior is modern with an industrial look that’s accentuated by stainless steel furniture.One of first things to order at Daejim, officially open on Sept 1, has to be the seafood set — comprising Japanese oysters, Australian scallops, live Korean abalone, Korean squid, and Korean grilled mackerel (S$118). It’s a standout choice with shellfish that’s impeccably tender and sweet, grilled right at the table by affable staff.Another must-try is the ganjang gejang (S$40) — soy-marinated raw crab — that’s not shy on umami.If you still prefer a meat selection, Daejim offers a variety that will leave diners spoilt by its quality meats. The kkotsal (S$45) — prime cut boneless short rib, or “flower meat” in Korean — has an almost-buttery texture, thanks to its intricate marbling.Its signature dwaeji galbi (S$25) — marinated pork finger rib in special sauce — was juicy, succulent and flavourful, owing to the cut of premium Jeju black pork. All of Daejim’s BBQ sets include Korean steamed egg, a choice of soup (kimchi jjigae; sundubu jjigae — Korean spicy tofu stew; or doenjang jjigae — soybean paste stew), cream cheese croquettes, and a cheese fondue.But what’s a Korean BBQ experience without banchan (side dishes)? Daejim offers a varied spread that comprises octopus legs, seaweed, japchae (stir-fried glass noodles), homemade kimchi, egg rolls with chives and carrot, and sausages.As a complement to the barbecue, we highly recommend the kimchi jjigae — kimchi soup with rice cakes, tofu and pork belly (S$18). Tangy and savoury, it’s a comforting accompaniment that’s brimming with rice cakes, soft tofu and even pork belly chunks.An equally satisfying alternative is the sundubu jjigae — spicy tofu soup with seafood broth, with enoki mushrooms, zucchini, prawns, and mussels (S$18).For beverages, this Korean BBQ joint takes drinking up a notch, with a large selection of alcohol, such as soju, makgeolli, beers, liquors, and even a selection of signature cocktails, on top of non-alcoholic beverages. Some recommended cocktails include the blood orange squash (S$18) and soju de coco (S$18).As part of its launch in September, Daejim is offering a promotion: Get four BBQ cheese scallops with every order of the BBQ set for the whole month. Diners are encouraged to make reservations.\xa0Book a ride to Daejim.4 Craig Road\nNearest MRT station: Tanjong Pagar\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (12pm to 3pm, 5pm to 2am)4 Craig Road\nNearest MRT station: Tanjong Pagar\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (12pm to 3pm, 5pm to 2am)AuthorDarren finds delight in the simple pleasures of life, which include his work, music and taking time to savour and document the diverse array of food around him.© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/joo-chiat-caphe/:['If you’re observant enough, you may have noticed a handful of Vietnamese eateries along Joo Chiat Road — a stretch of shophouses occupied by retail stores, cafes, pet grooming centres, and boutique gyms. But out of all the units, Joo Chiat Caphe stands out not only for its banh mi-focused menu but because it’s one of the few Muslim-friendly banh mi stores in Singapore.Unlike the dressy interiors of its cafe neighbours, Joo Chiat Caphe sheds the need for modern fixtures and fills the space with simple stools and tables to accommodate brisk meals. Both passersby and diners have a front-row view of the banh mi being assembled, lending to the eatery’s charm.\xa0Those familiar with the area would recall the space being occupied by Nam San Mackerel Otah. The Muslim-owned otah business started in 1999.The shop space then gave way to Joo Chiat Caphe in January this year, combining the sale of otah with Nam San’s owner’s dream of opening a banh mi shop.Nam San’s otah is sold at the eatery — as an a la carte menu item and a banh mi ingredient.\xa0My virgin visit to Joo Chiat Caphe saw me ordering the banh mi with honey-glazed grilled chicken thigh with homemade chicken pate (S$7.50) and earthquake banh mi (S$8.80) — comprising pickled salad, cucumber, lettuce, chicken cold cut, grilled chicken thigh, lemongrass beef patty, chicken pate, Vietnamese mayonnaise, chilli, and coriander.\xa0My order proved to be a lucky stab in the dark that led to an early assumption that these were the best choices in the house.The earthquake banh mi brought an abundance of ingredients and flavours — a symphony of sweet, tangy and savoury — and could easily be one of the most mouthwatering solutions to a dreadful hangover.For something a touch sweeter (and just as succulent), the honey-glazed grilled chicken thigh married perfectly with the freshness of the cucumber and coriander. While scarfing down the rest of the banh mi, I was repeatedly impressed by how fresh and clean it all tasted — leaving me with an empty basket in under 15 minutes.Within a month of my first visit, I returned to give the classic chicken cold cut with homemade chicken pate (S$5.80) a whirl. It didn’t make my heart sing like the honey-glazed grilled chicken thigh did, but as the cheapest banh mi on the menu, it was a commendable sandwich.The hot drip Vietnamese coffee (S$4.50), with its intoxicating aroma of roasted coffee beans, did a terrific job of jolting me from the midday lull.If you’re wondering how long you should allow the moistened coffee grounds to fully express, I’d suggest putting away at least half a banh mi before removing the drip and stirring the condensed milk at the bottom (as I did).An honourable mention must go to the mackerel otah (S$1.50) by Nam San Mackerel Otah. Wrapped in banana leaves, it had a distinct smokiness and spice that added character to the humble otah — winning my seal of approval.\xa0If you’re someone who favours crunch over milder textures, there’s a reasonable appeal in the battered crispy fish fillet with honey mustard (S$7).\xa0For me, however, the paltry single fish fillet with vegetables failed to satisfy. Its main downfall was its size. I was disappointed that there wasn’t enough fish. Of course, that would translate to higher costs, but it’d be a few extra dollars I’d be willing to fork out.\xa0Is it conducive to conversation? The space isn’t enclosed. Though loud chatter won’t necessarily create a din, the whir of the many large fans may be distracting if you’re having an intimate conversation.Is a reservation necessary? The eatery doesn’t take reservations, but it’s free seating and there are usually seats available.How to get there? From Eunos MRT station, hop on bus service 13 for two stops before walking 10 minutes down Koon Seng Road towards Joo Chiat Road.\xa0Alternatively, bus service 33 stops a few metres from the eatery.Things to note:HungryGoWhere paid for its meal at this restaurant for this review.\xa0Joo Chiat Caphe is on the GrabFood delivery service.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/koal-shaw-centre/:['We’re just eight months into 2022, and we’ve already seen plenty of fine-dining and premium restaurants mushrooming in Singapore. Yet it seems the Les Amis Group has done things a tad differently.\xa0Koal is the group’s latest foray into affordable dining on an open-flame grill. Nestled in the heart of Orchard Road at Shaw Centre, and taking over the space that used to be Peranakan eatery Indigo Blue Kitchen, the restaurant first greets us with an eclectic mix of bold, earthy tones and cheeky neon signs, bathed in the intimate glow of warm red lighting. The menu is kept relatively simple, with meats such as Iberico pork chop, chicken leg and grass-fed ribeye, as well as side dishes designed to complement the meats, such as charred broccoli and red skin potato salad.\xa0If you’re having dinner there, there are also seafood options such as grilled tiger prawns and grilled sashimi-grade salmon fillet.\xa0All meats are served with your choice of sauce: Yakiniku no tare with confit garlic, pickled green peppercorn sauce, or sesame chimichurri.Finish off your meal with a choice of dessert, such as hojicha and whisky tiramisu, or makgeolli and strawberries.\xa0Head chef Chong Jun Xiang is no stranger to the Les Amis Group. He’s built an impressive repertoire at the likes of one-Michelin-starred Alma by Juan Amador, Gattopardo (a Michelin Guide restaurant), Lemak Boys, and the private member’s club 1880 — all before turning 35. But it was his most recent gig as head chef of Indigo Blue Kitchen that exposed him to Les Amis founder Desmond Lim’s vision.\xa0Lim has said that fine dining is not a money-making industry. Koal — which opened in December last year — was created as part of the Les Amis founder’s vision to expand the group’s mid-market concepts such as Lino and Peperoni Pizzeria. Chong was chosen to helm the restaurant as part of another passion project of Lim’s — nurturing a new generation of chefs in Singapore.\xa0And it appears this has, indeed, benefited Chong. Last year, Chong, along with his classmates Daniel Gan and Martin Tan from the Culinary Institute of America’s Singapore campus, set up Lemak Boys. It was a pet project that ran within the grounds of Indigo Blue Kitchen, selling local favourites such as nasi lemak and laksa.\xa0But we digress. Back to Koal.\n\xa0Skimming the menu, it’s obvious that the restaurant specialises in two main meats — Iberico pork and steak.\xa0We plumped for the Australian grass-fed ribeye (200g, S$30) first, which came out tender and charred to medium-rare perfection, with a sprinkling of salt flakes and cracked black pepper.Next, we chose the restaurant’s recommendation for pork, the Iberico pork chop, bone-in (230g, S$28). This was served fresh off the grill, beautifully pink on the inside, and with a delightfully smoked exterior.\xa0Both meats were served pre-sliced, so we could pop the bite-sized morsels straight in, without the hassle of cutting anything up.A surprising win for the restaurant are the two sauces that were served complimentary with the meats.The yakiniku no tare sauce was exquisite and lent a sweet dimension to the pork, with its dash of aromatic confit garlic.But the real winner of the night was the sesame chimichurri sauce. The freshly chopped parsley, mixed with lemon and olive, added a nice touch of zest and spice to the steak, and we scraped the saucer to wipe out every drop of it at the end of our dinner.Overall, my companion and I were unanimous in our view that Koal has its main courses down pat.\xa0And at S$30 or less for most cuts of meat, its affordability can’t be ignored. Combine that with the quality of the meat, and it’s a no-brainer that we’d definitely be back soon to try the other cuts on the menu.Apart from the meats, the charred broccoli (S$8) was a pleasant and affordable side dish. Served grilled with soy pickled onions, sesame dressing and bonito flakes, it put an Asian-inspired twist on our meal with the perfect hint of spice.We also liked the general ambience of the restaurant. The tables are well-spaced for privacy, and the dim, warm red lighting added a splash of romanticism to the experience.The wait staff were also friendly and attentive, and the food arrived promptly.Although the meats were cooked to perfection, we felt the seafood paled in comparison.The grilled tiger prawns (S$20), though beautifully plated, were unfortunately overcooked and rubbery.The white wine butter sauce was too heavy on cream and butter, overwhelming the dish. The bed of grilled lettuce, fresh tomatoes and marinated ikura gave the dish a nice texture and crunch, but were also smothered by the sauce. We ended up having to scrape the sauce off the ingredients, so that they’d not be overpowered.We were also a tad disappointed that the restaurant’s most popular dessert, the freshly fried donuts, seemed to have been removed from the menu.Our next option, the makgeolli and strawberries (S$12), was sold out as well, and we ended up forgoing dessert entirely. (A colleague who visited the eatery after we did, however, had the white chocolate and wasabi tarts — S$9 — which were a delightful marriage of moderate sweetness with aromatic whiffs of wasabi.)\xa0Though the seafood and (lack of) desserts were a letdown, Koal is a place we’d revisit for its main draw: The cuts of meat. And we can vouch that it doesn’t compromise on the quality of the cuts, and the flavour pairings with the sauces were exceptional.The next time, though, we’d definitely skip the seafood and go straight for the meats.\xa0\xa0Is it conducive to conversation? Yes. We’d highly recommend it as a date spot, as the tables are well-spaced for private conversation and music plays softly in the background.How to get there? Shaw Centre is a short, sheltered underground walk from Orchard MRT station. If you’re taking the bus, there are plenty of bus stops in the area, next to nearby shopping complexes Ion Orchard and Wheelock Place.Things to note:\xa0HungryGoWhere paid for its meal at this restaurant for this review.Book a ride to Koal.Shaw Centre, 03-09/10/11, 1 Scotts Road\xa0\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (11.30am to 2.30pm, 6pm to 10pm)Shaw Centre, 03-09/10/11, 1 Scotts Road\xa0\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (11.30am to 2.30pm, 6pm to 10pm)Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/karens-diner-singapore-pop-up/:['You’ve seen the Karen memes splashed all over the internet — a reference to an angry, entitled and sometimes racist middle-aged white woman often using her privilege to “speak to the manager”. (Case in point: Singapore’s very own “MBS Badge Lady” brazenly going around Singapore without a mask at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic).\n\nBy May 2023, Singaporeans can experience being served by Karens in an interactive theatrical dining experience like no other. At Karen’s Diner, expect obnoxiously rude service and cheeky insults from potty-mouthed servers and where customers can complain their hearts out. \n\nThe pop-up in Singapore will mark Karen’s first foray into Asia. Not much has been said of it yet, though Shelley Allen, a spokesperson for Karen’s Diner, has confirmed to HungryGoWhere that it\xa0will be held at a “secret location in Singapore” that can’t be disclosed for the moment.\xa0“We are hoping Karen’s will begin in Singapore mid-next year. However, we do not have exact dates in place yet,” Allen adds.“The majority of our Karens are pop-ups (and) have ended up doing extremely well and have stayed more longer term. This also could be a possibility for Singapore.”On Aug 31, a day after this HungryGoWhere article was published, The Straits Times reported that the Karen’s Diner pop-up may not be coming to Singapore yet.When asked, Allen says: “It isn’t in Singapore yet, but we’re in the works of getting it to Singapore. Nothing has changed.”A full menu will be available soon, but expect classic American fare such as handcrafted burgers, wings, fries, shakes, and cocktails.The 1960s-style Australian chain opened in Sydney, Australia in October last year, and has since expanded globally to places such as the United Kingdom and the United States. It’s also become a TikTok sensation for its notoriously terrible service.\nThe menu features tongue-in-cheek menu items such as the Cheesed Off Karen, which comes with double egg, halloumi and fried halloumi chips on a tomato-relished milk bun. Our personal favourite dish name is Karen’s Best Breast, featuring grilled chicken breast, with bacon, Swiss cheese, avocado, and peri-peri mayo.And if your name is actually Karen, you’ll get a free drink upon showing proof of identity.All the banter is done in the name of good fun, though. Its house rules state that there should be no racism, sexism, homophobic comments, body image comments, and sexual comments towards staff.We’re already steeling our nerves as we book a slot for a trashy good time and a dose of sarcasm on the side.Allen, the spokesperson, adds: “Singapore is an amazing city and we aim to get Karens globally into as many amazing cities as possible.”Darren Tan contributed reporting.\xa0AuthorEe Ming is a storyteller with a love of photography, insightful reads, films, and offbeat and obscure places.

(It’s a 15-minute walk from the nearest bus stop, so your best bet would be to get a Grab ride in.)Complete with Japanese red lanterns and even a torii (Japanese gate), Ku-Kai’s yakitori (grilled skewers) chef can be seen behind a clear panel as he grills skewers of meat and vegetables over charcoal.Come by in the evening as the air cools for the skewers and hearty agemono (fried snacks), such as mentaiko (pollock roe) fries, crispy fried chicken and aburi shimesaba (torched vinegared mackerel).

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/kfc-cheesy-zinger-meltz-taste-test/:['Everyone was eagerly anticipating the return of KFC’s Meltz — albeit by a different name this time around. On Wednesday (Sept 7), KFC rolled out its Cheesy Zinger Meltz and we were curious enough to order the Cheezy Zinger Meltz Box (S$9.95) and have the first bite of this upgraded Meltz creation for lunch.Unlike its poster images, the Cheesy Zinger Meltz wasn’t as thick as we had expected. It was a letdown at first glance.We proceeded with our first taste and were greeted by a satisfying cheesy chew — an instant redemption from our initial impression.The tang of diced tomatoes against oozy cheese was much appreciated. Without it, the cheese would’ve been cloying.KFC says it uses crunchy and spicy Zinger fillet in the new product.Unfortunately, we couldn’t detect much spiciness or crunch. It would’ve also been better if the tortilla wrap had been toasted a little longer, so that it could survive the condensation inside the box and not become flimsy too quickly.Was it filling? Not really, but therein lies the appeal of ordering the Cheesy Zinger Meltz Meal (S$8.20) or the Cheesy Zinger Meltz Buddy Meal (S$19.45).Our overall impression of the Cheesy Zinger Meltz may not be a fantastic one. But for those who are fond of the original Meltz, this revamped edition is sure to please you.KFC’s Cheesy Zinger Meltz is available at all its stores — except those at the Singapore Zoo and Singapore Polytechnic — or via its delivery service.KFC is on the GrabFood delivery service.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/titus-low-only-creamery-ice-cream/:['The highly anticipated Only Creamery — co-founded by influencer Titus Low — opened its doors on Tuesday (Sept 6).\xa0The gelato cafe — a collaboration with Hundred Acre Creamery — made waves even before it started operations. This was thanks to a viral hiring notice for a managerial position paying up to S$4,500 a month and, of course, Low, who shot to fame after a brief stint on online subscription platform OnlyFans.If you’re curious about the managerial post, it was filled even before the notice went viral. The new manager will be working alongside Low and the team behind Hundred Acre Creamery — Edmund Ang, 30, Linh Tran, 31, and Justin Heah, 30.\xa0Although Low, 22, has other ventures, this is his first foray into F&B.\xa0As the majority shareholder, he forked out a significant portion of the six-figure sum that went into starting the cafe and spent the last half a year working with Hundred Acre Creamery on the launch.\xa0He tells HungryGoWhere that he’ll try to be at the cafe often, but it’ll mostly be run by his staff while he works behind the scenes on marketing.Only Creamery has a wide selection of dairy-free sorbets and gelatos, in such flavours as hojicha mochi, peanut butter banana and soursop mint sorbet (from S$5 a scoop).\xa0Located along a row of shophouses in Chinatown, the space, which spans about 1,000 sqf, can comfortably hold up to 60 patrons indoors — perfect for get-togethers with large groups of friends.\xa0Low says he’s always wanted to muscle into F&B, but found it difficult to set foot in the saturated industry.\xa0He was spurred by his desire to create a cosy space that his friends could enjoy.\xa0“I love ice cream. Having desserts, and particularly ice cream, is such a simple and universal way for me and many people to feel good after a long day,” says Low.\xa0“I want to share (that) with more people and create an inclusive space for everyone to feel that very simple happiness, regardless of who they are.”A similar vision drives the team at Hundred Acre Creamery. Seeing the joy that gelato has brought to their customers made them realise how meaningful their work is.\xa0“We’re creating a space where people can come and enjoy themselves,” says Ang.When things have stabilised, the team plans to expand its menu to include savoury items, such as chicken and waffles, as well as other light snacks. But it might be a while before you see these items on the menu.\xa0Says Low: “We only want to sell what we like, so when we’re confident about (the food), we’ll sell it.“The main thing is still the ice cream — we don’t want to take that away.”Aside from enlarging its menu down the line, the team intends to expand its operations and open stores in heartland locations, too.\xa0To make its products more accessible to consumers, the hope is also to sell the Only Creamery brand of gelatos in retail stores and even internationally someday.Only Creamery’s ice cream is churned in-house daily using fresh and premium ingredients.Besides crowd favourites such as roasted pistachio (S$6) and honey chrysanthemum (S$6), it’ll introduce new flavours every month.\xa0While HungryGoWhere was there, we tried Only Creamery’s coconut pandan waffle (S$8) with dark chocolate sorbet (S$6) and coconut sorbet (S$5). Although sorbets are typically dairy-free and have an icy texture, Only Creamery’s versions were extremely rich and delicious, with a creamy texture.\xa0The two flavours made a great pairing, as the decadence of the chocolate sorbet was balanced out by the refreshing coconut sorbet.\xa0If you’re not a fan of waffles, try pairing the gelato with a rosemary cone (S$1.50). It’s incredibly fragrant and ideal for those who enjoy something a tad more savoury.\xa0Some menu specials include its freshly brewed tea pot for one (S$6) and lava cake (S$10), both of which are not available at Hundred Acre Creamery.\xa0Low is also developing a special blend of artisanal fruit tea, Love by the Moon, for the cafe.If you’re not a tea drinker, Only Creamery also offers Vietnamese drip coffee (from S$5). The thick, flavourful brew is traditionally served with condensed milk, but those on a dairy-free diet can ask for oat milk or have the coffee without add-ons.\xa0Book a ride to Only Creamery.36 Temple Street\nNearest MRT Station: Chinatown (take Exit A)\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (12pm to 11pm)36 Temple Street\nNearest MRT Station: Chinatown (take Exit A)\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (12pm to 11pm)Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

The ever-reliable original coconut shake is a crowd favourite that’s sure to quench your thirst in Singapore’s sweltering heat.For those who are more adventurous, the bubble dragonfruit coconut is an exceptionally fruity number, combining naturally sweet coconut water and the sweet-sour notes of dragonfruit.You can also choose your desired level of sweetness — from zero to 100 per cent — for selected drinks and add toppings to all Mr Coconut drinks from just 50 cents.What to order: Original coconut shake (from S$5.60), bubble dragonfruit coconut (from S$6.10)Few people would know this, but Paris Baguette was founded in 1988.

Try the Chicken ‘N’ Watermelon ‘N’ Waffles, Mac & Cheese and soda combo that comes with a choice of two soft drinks.Ideal for sharing between two, make it a truly indulgent meal by adding on the YB Chicken Wings.

Well, now you have the opportunity to try it out by ordering from Como Cuisine.The eatery prides itself on using as much organic produce as possible and sourcing the freshest in-season ingredients to create delectable recipes from around the world. Its lobster briyani comes with sustainably farmed Canadian lobster, aromatic basmati rice, raita, pomegranate, and guava salad.It also serves a delightfully rich snapper curry that’s cooked with ample coconut milk and uses tomatoes, tamarind and okra (ladies’ fingers).

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/hole-in-the-wall-cafes-singapore-west/:['This is the fifth instalment of a five-part series\xa0on hole-in-the-wall cafes in Singapore.With the west being home to several tertiary institutions, looking for a cafe to have a quiet cuppa can be challenging, because you might have to jostle with throngs of students knee-deep in schoolwork, especially close to exam season.That’s when these hole-in-the-wall cafes in Singapore’s west will save the day. You’ll most likely get a seat at these five coffee houses during off-peak hours.\xa08 Biomedical Grove, 01-06\nNearest MRT station: One-North\nOpen: Mondays to Fridays (8am to 4pm)Little Big, as it’s affectionately known among regulars, is a small coffee house in the middle of futuristic buildings at the One-North business park. With machines and its counter taking up more space than tables and seats, it has competitively priced coffees (starting from S$2.50 for an espresso shot) and food.The cafe serves cold, not iced, versions of its drinks in reusable glass jars, which not only look great but are environmentally friendly. As someone who loves my coffee strong, and preferably not watered down, I wholeheartedly approve of this version.They roast the beans every Monday and Wednesday, which means you’ll get them almost fresh throughout the week. For online orders, make sure to place them before noon to get your coffee delivered the next day.What to order: Cold white or black (S$5.50), coffee milkshake (S$6.50)\xa0104 Faber Drive\nNearest MRT station: Clementi\nOpen: Monday to Wednesday (11am to 9.30pm), Friday to Sunday (10.30am to 9.30pm)Nestled within Faber Hills Apartments is Jovis Cafe, a quaint, unassuming joint that looks as though it came right out of a Hallmark Christmas movie.The apartment complex may not be the easiest to locate, but once you’ve found it, Jovis Cafe isn’t hard to spot with its recently refurbished baby-blue exterior and larger-than-life signboard.Unlike cafes with floor-to-ceiling windows, you can catch a glimpse of the goings-on inside Jovis Cafe only through small window panes — much like peering into someone’s home — adding to the cosy and hidden vibes of the place.The cafe prides itself on being study-friendly, providing free Wi-Fi and power sockets for those seeking a place to work or study at (as long as you spend at least S$10). It’s also family-friendly with board games, books and magazines.What to order: Jovis chicken chop (S$12.90), popcorn latte (S$5.50)\xa0109 Clementi Street 11, 01-03\nNearest MRT station: Clementi\nOpen: Daily (8am to 5pm)Started by Lee Hee Wei, winner of the Singapore National Barista Championship 2013, Olla has come a long way since its mobile coffee cart days and is now one of the many cafes to visit in Singapore’s west.Arguably, this coffee house does sit quite prominently along the row of stores but still maintains its unpretentious and welcoming air. Having been around for three years, it’s a spot where you’ll find residents in shorts and flip-flops enjoying their coffee with open-faced sandwiches.What to order: Sunrise — soft brioche buns with scrambled eggs, cheddar, hot sauce and caramelised onions (S$8.50), magic – a double ristretto with milk (S$5.50)\xa0105 Clementi Street 12, 01-02\nNearest MRT station: Clementi\nOpen: Monday to Friday (10am to 6pm), Saturday and Sunday (9am to 6pm)Hidden within Burnt Cones Gelato, a gelato-and-waffles store along Sunset Way, is Sudden Coffee Roasters, an in-house small-batch coffee roaster, serving up fresh brews to go with your gelato scoops.We can’t think of a better combination than coffee and ice cream. You can get the best of both worlds in the form of an affogato, where two robust shots of coffee are drizzled over Burnt Cones’ gelato. If you’re game, opt for more adventurous gelato flavours such as scamorza (smoked cheese) to go with your coffee.What to order: Black or white cold brew (S$6 to S$7), affogato (S$10)\xa0Star Vista, 01-07/10, 1 Vista Exchange Green\nNearest MRT station: Buona Vista\nOpen: Daily (10am to 7pm)If you’re a music lover, you’d certainly have heard of or been to Swee Lee, a music store that turns 76 this year.Calling itself the largest music store in Asia with outlets in Malaysia, Indonesia and Vietnam, its shop at Star Vista mall includes the Singapore branch of Swee Lee Social Club. A cafe and event space, it plays host to music and live events for the community.Get the waffles with caramelised banana — our favourite. Perfectly browned on the outside and warm on the inside, the waffles also come in cookie crumble or caramel crunch flavours. On occasion, you’ll even get limited-edition drinks to mark album or song releases.What to order: Caramelised banana waffles (S$15), Bitter Sweet — a sparkling iced black coffee with yuzu (S$6)\xa0Sudden Coffee Roasters (listed under Burnt Cones) and Swee Lee Social Club are on the GrabFood delivery service.

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/hole-in-the-wall-cafes-singapore-east/:['This is the fourth instalment of a five-part series\xa0on hole-in-the-wall cafes in Singapore.If you’re an “east side, best side” kind of person, then you’re in luck because we’re filling you in on some of the best hole-in-the-wall cafes in Singapore’s east.From a literal hole-in-the-wall cafe where the only service touchpoint is a small window to an all-black coffee bar that serves up hip-hop vibes with your cuppa, you’ll enjoy seeking out these spots as much as you’d enjoy what they’ve to offer.\xa0136 Bedok North Avenue 3, 01-152\nNearest MRT stations: Bedok and Bedok Reservoir\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (10am to 7pm)True to its name, Percolate Coffee has percolated into the hearts of many caffeine fiends with its unassuming vibes and good brews since it opened in 2014.Amid the flurry of new cafes sprouting in Singapore’s east, especially in the trendy Joo Chiat area, it’s easy to miss a cafe tucked away on the first floor of a Housing and Development Board block.For a cafe to survive this long is surely a feat, much less one in the heartlands.Operating from a now-expanded space since its launch, Percolate also has a larger food menu these days. We spied distinctive croissant flavours such as fishcake laksa and grilled unagi.What to order: Cold brew cheng tng (S$8.50), curry egg mayo croissant (S$7)\xa0283 Joo Chiat Road\nNearest MRT station: Eunos\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (8am to 6pm)Kohi first caught our eye because we’d never seen a cafe quite like it in Singapore — one that’s operating out of a small yellow window facing an alleyway, reminiscent of a McDonald’s drive-through window.Except the only probable thing both have in common is the colour yellow.Originating from Bangkok, Kohi Roastery had a soft launch earlier this year and allowed customers to pay as they wished. Now that it’s officially in business, the cafe has shifted its approach and is accepting only cashless payments at fixed prices.If grabbing a coffee and having it by the road isn’t your thing, Kohi shares a space with Crane, a co-working facility where you can sit. Alternatively, check out the ‘gram-worthy Peranakan shophouses along Koon Seng Road as you sip your coffee.What to order: Kohito — iced black, fresh milk and mint (S$7), coco espresso — coconut water and espresso (S$7)\xa0Bayshore Park Condominium, 01-01, 54 Bayshore Road\nNearest MRT station: Bedok\nOpen: Monday to Friday (9am to 5pm), Saturday and Sunday (8am to 5pm)Heading to, and eventually finding, Alto Cafe is an adventure in itself. It may be situated within Bayshore Park Condominium, but it’s its covert location that lends this cafe its charm.Perhaps it’s the cafe’s proximity to East Coast Park, but its interior gives off strong Bali vibes — something we weren’t quite expecting from a cafe in a condominium compound. It also has an extensive menu covering the brunch gamut from toast to breakfast sets and even pasta. Besides the cafe’s Instagrammable interior, its dishes are also visually appealing and taste just as good.To access it, tell the security guard you’re visiting the cafe. But hey, if all else fails (or if you want to save yourself some steps), the cafe offers delivery via GrabFood.What to order: Shakerato — double espresso shaken with a tinge of sugar and ice (S$4.50), shakshouka — Mediterranean stewed tomatoes, capsicums, sourdough, feta, and poached egg (S$15)\xa0184 Geylang Road\nNearest MRT station: Kallang\nOpen: Sunday to Thursday (9am to 6pm); Friday and Saturday (9am to 9pm)Breaking the minimalist Scandinavian mould is Geylang Drip City, a hip-hop-inspired coffee house that’s set against an all-black interior — certainly one of the coolest cafes in Singapore’s east.Have your caffeine fix on the dark terrazzo island bar counter. Offering single-origin African espressos, the cafe has cheekily named its items after hip-hop songs and other icons, and has cold brews called Drizzy, Weezy and Oatkast.For a space that comes across as too cool for school at first blush, Geylang Drip City is a spot with swagger, but it’s also unpretentious. The crew are friendly and funny (check out their memes on Geylang Drip City’s Instagram page).What to order: Egg08 & heartbreak — scrambled eggs and toast (S$11), Drizzy white cold brew (S$7)\xa0Solaris @ Kallang 164 (West Wing Lobby), 02-K1, 164 Kallang Way\nNearest MRT station: Geylang Bahru\nOpen: Monday to Friday (8am to 4pm)Fuelling the caffeine-starved at the Solaris @ Kallang 164 building, Musketeers Coffee is one of the few cafes in that area.Spreading its wings from a coffee cart to a permanent space at the west wing lobby of the building, the cafe offers a signature brew, Accident white coffee, that is bolder in flavour compared with your typical white coffee. It came about unintentionally from an experiment that made use of espresso shots instead of filter-brew beans.The duo behind the cafe are co-founders Julien Lew and Jairus Poon, who also do latte art workshops and offer a subscription service for their bottled drinks.What to order: Accident white coffee (S$7 for one, S$30 for a bundle of five), Too Cheez – cheese toastie (S$4)\xa0Percolate, Kohi Roastery & Coffee Bar, Geylang Drip City, and Musketeers Coffee are on the GrabFood delivery service.

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/hole-in-the-wall-cafes-singapore-north/:['This is the third instalment of a five-part series\xa0on hole-in-the-wall cafes in Singapore.Third-wave coffee places and cafes in central Singapore might be more common than in the outskirts in the north, but things are slowly changing.From void decks of Housing and Development Board flats to the vicinity of an airfield, these five hidden cafes in Singapore’s north have their unique charms that set them apart from the rest.\xa0Northpoint City (South Wing), B2-151, 1 Northpoint Drive\nNearest MRT station: Yishun\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (10am to 9pm)Founders Kayson Chan and Andrew Tjoa, the same people who brought you Aroma Truffle chips, opened this coffee joint in May 2021 during the pandemic. With no experience with coffee or F&B, the pair sourced single-origin beans grown by small-time farmers throughout the world.We like that the cafe isn’t just for coffee addicts. You can still get your caffeine hit with options such as Uji matcha latte and Kagoshima houjicha. Or get the best of both worlds with the spreeze, its take on the local yuanyang drink. An infusion of tea and coffee, it comes in flavours such as dirty earl, perky peppermint and vineyard peach.What to order: Dirty earl spreeze (S$5.90), Kagoshima houjicha (S$4.90)\xa0Canberra Plaza, 03-08, 133 Canberra View\nNearest MRT station: Canberra\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (9am to 5pm)Starting out at the National University of Singapore, this five-year-old social enterprise now has eight stores and pop-ups in unexpected places: It can be found within a music conservatory, hospital and historic building, for example.Led by a team of young adults, it’s achieved B Corp status for hiring people with disabilities and special needs as well as sourcing from sustainable coffee producers.Its outlet on the top floor of Canberra Plaza comes with a spacious seating area for the kids to play at while parents caffeinate. We hear there’s even a kid-friendly menu.What to order: Timeless Yuanyang (S$7), turkey ham & cheese croissant (S$6)\xa0813 Yishun Ring Road, 01-01\nNearest MRT station: Khatib\nOpen: Monday and Tuesday, and Thursday to Saturday (12pm to 7pm); Wednesday (12pm to 8pm)This cafe run by seniors is a hidden gem in Khatib. At a void deck behind the MRT station, Sasco@Khatib is staffed by seniors from the Sasco@Khatib Senior Activity Centre in an effort to keep them alert and active.On the menu are sweet treats from Japanese bakery Asanoya and ice cream from plant-based cafe Smoocht. Most of the items are priced reasonably and uniformly (individual items at S$3.50 and sets at S$6.50) to make it easier for elderly staff to remember. Make sure you’ve spare change, as the cafe accepts only cash or Nets.What to order: Smoocht ice cream (S$3.50 for a single scoop), melon pan bread (S$3.50)\xa01230 Upper Thomson Road, Springleaf Nature Park\nNearest MRT station: Springleaf\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (8am to 6pm)Originally set up as an oasis in the city, Lowe’f Artisanal recently moved from Queen Street to Springleaf Nature Park. Now surrounded by greenery, it continues to be one of the rare cafes in Singapore’s north that serves as a place of respite with fresh cups of joe and sourdough straight from the oven.It might be a little hard to get to, but you’ll avoid the Botanic Gardens or Bishan Park crowds completely. The good news is that the cafe is only a six-minute walk from the Springleaf MRT stop along the Thomson-East Coast Line.What to order: Good Morning burger (S$10), sourdough loaf (S$18.20)\xa0Maj Aviation Building, 01-01, 80 Seletar Aerospace View\nNearest MRT station: Yio Chu Kang\nOpen: Tuesday to Thursday (10am to 10pm); Friday to Sunday (10am to 11pm)Cyclists from this part of the island don’t have to travel to Wheeler’s Yard for a cyclist-friendly cafe. Mostly known to folks in the area, Soek Seng 1954 Bicycle Cafe is situated at Seletar Aerospace View.True to its name, you’ll find plenty of vintage two-wheelers and some four-wheelers here.And if you’re seated outside, feel the roar of aircraft flying overhead. Coupled with its secluded location, this is one of the cafes in Singapore’s north that will truly make you feel as though you’re out of the bustling city.What to order: Unatamadon — eel-and-egg donburi (S$9.80), rainbow cheesecake (S$8)\xa0Aroma Coffee, Foreword Coffee Roasters and Lowe’f Artisanal Bakery Cafe are on the GrabFood delivery service.

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/hole-in-the-wall-cafes-singapore-south/:['This is the first instalment of a five-part series on hole-in-the-wall cafes in Singapore.If you work in the city area and must have your morning coffee before staring down an intense workday, then you’d be familiar with the daily toss-up between missing your daily cuppa (no thanks to peak-hour queues) and simply accepting the reality that you’d arrive late to work — all in the name of snagging that cup of joe.Trust me, I’d faced the “is this cuppa worth my being late?” dilemma too many times.Enter hole-in-the-wall cafes — coffee places so hidden that you’d probably spend more time finding them than standing in a queue. To save you some time, here are five hole-in-the-wall cafes in Singapore’s south to satisfy your caffeine needs.\xa030 Raffles Place, B1-11\nNearest MRT station: Raffles Place\nOpen: Monday to Friday (8am to 5pm)Alchemist’s sixth outpost is reminiscent of its first outlet at International Plaza — small, simple and dedicated to fuelling office workers with potent brews.Tucked away in the basement of CIMB Plaza (formerly Change Alley Mall) and imbued with a dark Victorian theme, you probably wouldn’t have known Alchemist had set up shop in the heart of Raffles Place unless you followed the scent of freshly roasted beans from the first floor down.If you’re in a hurry, its standard Black and White coffees are good to go. But if you have more time to spare, its pour over, which the baristas spend a good two minutes and 15 seconds brewing, is well worth the wait.What to order: Pour-over coffee (S$6 to S$8)\xa0146 Jalan Bukit Merah, 01-1092\nNearest MRT station: Outram Park\nOpen: Tuesday to Friday (8am to 3pm); Saturday and Sunday (8.30am to 4.30pm)Situated on the ground floor of a mature public housing estate, Round Boy Roasters stands out among the older shophouses with its modern, industrial vibe and pick-up boxes — which resemble letterboxes — on its exterior. Founded by a group of friends, the establishment has grown from a shop to a full roastery and cafe supplying coffee to caffeine lovers and several cafes.The team’s passion for coffee is evident throughout the space, where you can pop in, grab a coffee and have a chat with them about coffee. Pick up a tip or two on how to choose your beans, which machines and grinders you should get, or even sign up for a workshop with them. If you’d rather skip to the good part, they also sell bottled ready-to-drink coffee concentrate, in addition to the fresh brews you can find at the shop.To use one of its cute pick-up boxes outside the cafe, arrange for self-collection when ordering from its online store.What to order: Espresso (S$4.50), White Widow ready-to-drink coffee — slow-steeped cold brew mixed with milk (S$7.50)\xa0Fu Yuen Building, 01-00, 75 Beach Road\nNearest MRT stations: Bugis, Esplanade\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (8am to 6pm)Located in the lobby of Spa Club on Beach Road, Fahrenheit Coffee blends in surreptitiously with the spa’s reception area. But step through the spa’s doors and you’ll catch a whiff of coffee beans mingling with the gentle, relaxing scent of a spa establishment.Fahrenheit Coffee serves coffee from beans roasted by Community Coffee, which sources its coffee from businesses that value social responsibility.The tranquillity of the cafe lobby is a stark but welcome respite from the busy Beach Road traffic. If you wish to take your to-go coffee up a notch and enjoy a leisurely afternoon in one of the most laidback cafes in Singapore’s south, the place also serves up sweet treats such as kardemummabullar (Swedish cardamom buns) and caneles in assorted flavours.What to order: °F Cold Brew (S$8), kardemummabullar (S$6.50)\xa075 Duxton Road\nNearest MRT station: Tanjong Pagar\nOpen: Monday to Friday (8am to 7pm); Saturday and Sunday (9am to 7pm)When it comes to hole-in-the-wall cafes in Singapore’s south, Monument Lifestyle truly takes the cake. Its cafe component sits at the back of a retail store of the same name, hidden behind shelves stocking everything from clothes to candles and snacks.Monument is a hot favourite among office workers in the area, many of whom get their coffee to go. So the cafe is usually quiet, save the post-lunch crowd.Besides turning out robust coffees made with San Franciscan-roasted beans (the only one in Singapore to do so), Monument dishes out New York-style bagels from bagel joint Schmear, which once occupied a space at Sentosa Cove. Californian coffee and New York bagels sound quite the killer combo to start your mornings with.What to order: Bagel (S$4.50) with schmears (S$2.50) in assorted flavours such as sundried tomato, and garlic and herb\xa027 Purvis Street, 01-02\nNearest MRT station: Esplanade\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (8am to 5pm)Pinhole Coffee Bar isn’t quite as hidden as its name suggests, but you’ll be forgiven for missing it at first glance, because the cafe’s Chinese signboard isn’t even its own. The only indication that the place houses a cafe are its patrons sitting on the tastefully mismatched wooden furniture outside, sipping coffee.The minimalist coffee bar’s sweet spot between the bustling neighbourhoods of Bugis and City Hall means that it sees a fair stream of busy office workers checking in for their morning brew.I like the coffee bar’s elongated counter set-up, which promotes seamless interaction with the baristas. Order its signature Hello, Good Morning, a tasting flight comprising a cold brew, single-shot espresso and latte, and the friendly Pinhole crew will even take you through the tasting order and each drink’s backstory.What to order: Hello, Good Morning tasting flight (S$7) and lemon loaf (S$5.50)\xa0Alchemist, Round Boy Roasters, Fahrenheit Coffee, and Monument Lifestyle at Duxton Road are on the GrabFood delivery service.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/grab-foodie-awards/:['Singapore’s food delivery scene has certainly evolved in the last few years, especially since the Covid-19 pandemic — becoming an indispensable part of Singapore’s food-and-beverage industry.\xa0With that, it’s high time that restaurants, cafes and essential workers in the F&B industry — who have worked tirelessly to keep Singapore fed, particularly through pandemic restrictions — have their day of recognition.Grab is rolling out the inaugural Grab Foodie Awards, which aim to celebrate and acknowledge the relentless commitment and hard work of its merchants.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/tiong-bahru-bakery-siglap-punggol/:['Popular Singapore bakery Tiong Bahru Bakery honours its 10th year with the opening of its 10th store, located in Siglap. The Siglap outpost is housed in an apartment building — 77@East Coast.This latest outlet features an all-glass facade, allowing plenty of natural light to illuminate the dining space. Diners can also unwind in one of the booth corners — decked in wooden furnishings — for casual catch-ups.Founded by master baker Gontran Cherrier, the homegrown brand started in 2012 and operates under the Spa Esprit Group. It debuted in — you guessed it — Tiong Bahru and its latest store is the first in Singapore’s east.While there will be plenty of Tiong Bahru Bakery staples such as its award-winning croissants, kouign amann, sourdough breads, and artisanal coffee to choose from, the Siglap store will also feature exclusive dishes and drinks.These include egg mayo and smoked salmon pain feuillete (S$11) — flaky laminated bread filled with housemade egg mayo, smoked salmon spread and Tsukemono cucumber — and curried chicken rillette and mango-chilli sandwich (S$11).If you’re looking for a new thirst quencher on Tiong Bahru Bakery’s menu, look to either the black sesame oat latte (S$6.20) or Your Royal Ryeness milkshake (S$9.50). The innovative sourdough-based milkshake incorporates cold-brew syrup from Common Man Coffee Roasters — a fun way to get your dessert and caffeine fix in a single drink.Elsewhere, Tiong Bahru Bakery has opened yet another new outlet at Punggol’s Waterway Point mall in northeast Singapore, just weeks after unveiling its Siglap outlet.The new store is centred on an all-day-dining concept, with an inviting interior, a counter showcasing its bakes, and shelves offering various merchandise.On top of an all-day menu, the Waterway Point branch offers some of the newer menu items that debuted at its Siglap outlet, including the egg mayo and smoked salmon pain feuillete and black sesame oat latte, in addition to its fan favourites.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/ooze-by-whiskdom/:['If you love baked goods of all kinds, you’ve probably heard of Whiskdom, a small, independent bakery that started out as a home-based business on Instagram. During the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, it went viral for its lava brownies, gooey cookies and a customer waitlist a mile long. (In August 2020, there was a two-and-a-half-year wait for a box of its bites).The Whiskdom team has been keeping busy since then. In addition to regular pop-ups at weekend markets, it has since launched two brick-and-mortar stores.Its latest, Ooze by Whiskdom, is an ice-cream cookie-wich cafe located in the heart of town. It opened its doors recently on Sept 3, having moved from its previous location in Havelock.\xa0The new Orchard concept serves up its signature chunky cookies with a side of milky ice-cream.Diners start the process by selecting their favourite cookie. It’s lightly toasted until warm, before being cut into two to reveal its oozy centre.Next, take your pick from eight ice-cream flavours. Besides run-of-the-mill flavours of vanilla, chocolate and strawberry, you’ll find more unusual ones, such as butterscotch peanut butter, watermelon soursop and white chrysanthemum with cocoa nibs.Finally, finish your sweet treat with a choice of two toppings.Each cookie-wich costs S$12.90.For my taste test, I was recommended the Chunky Chocolate Chip cookie, paired with a scoop each of French vanilla and triple dark chocolate ice-cream.Whiskdom’s take on the cookie-wich — or ice-cream sandwich — is more gooey than most. The warmth of the freshly heated cookies softens the ice-cream, so digging in is easy. You’ll need to use a spoon, though, as it’ll be too messy to pick up.\xa0I felt the cookie could have been toasted for slightly longer, so that the molten centre would mix more freely with the melty ice-cream. In its current state, the cookie core was certainly moist but not lava-like.When asked, Whiskdom declined to reveal where its ice-cream is sourced from.Drinks-wise, the Whiskdom Galaxy (S$6.90), a strawberry soda with agar jelly chunks, is a refreshing choice after the creamy dessert.The full range of Whiskdom’s signature lava brownies (S$6.50) and gooey cookies (S$6.50) is also available for sale here as an a la carte option, subject to availability. Diners can also get a scoop or two of ice-cream (from S$4.90) to go.Decked out in its usual blues and pastel pinks, Whiskdom’s 30-seat dining space is situated just across from the service counter. It’s certainly an upgrade from its North Bridge Road outlet, which has limited seats.Guests are welcome to make themselves at home — be it on any of the plush stools or the comfortable couch at the end.You can also sight Flourfly, the brand’s adorable bunny mascot, on cutlery, posters and even on the cafe’s retro-pink trash bins.According to staff, footfall has been brisk so far, with many curious passersby peeking in to enquire about the wonderful fragrance of freshly baked cookie dough.Whiskdom is on the GrabFood delivery service.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/fangko-coffee-and-beer/:['Nestled within the greater region of Clarke Quay, HongKong Street is home to some of Singapore’s finest restaurants. Like the street’s signature architectural mish-mash of styles, the food options here run the gamut.\xa0On the odd-numbered side of the street, there’s Gully Kitchen & Bar, a libation Mecca offering street food from around the world; Italian restaurant Amo; and Willow, a Singaporean-owned contemporary Pan-Asian outfit.\xa0Directly opposite all this culinary pomp and pageantry is where you’ll find Fangko+ Coffee and Beer — a blink-and-you-miss-it type of joint that strives to bring a touch of casual realness to the area.\xa0From the tail end of this short 170m street, Fangko+ dishes out plates of Indonesian cuisine, which many have opined to be surprisingly value-for-money — especially given its locale.\xa0\xa0It’s a bit tedious to trace the origins of Fangko+ Coffee and Beer. From what I gather via its Instagram page, the eatery had its roots on the second floor of Oxley Tower, along Robinson Road, back in September 2019.\xa0There, it rode out the Covid-19 circuit-breaker storm, serving coffee and muffins to what little there was of the CBD crowd before breaking ground at its current home.\xa0Its move from the CBD to Clarke Quay also brought about a change in customer profiles. From harried workers with precious little time for a quick meal, Fangko+ now serves a rotating roster of hotel guests, residents from homes by the Singapore River, and groups of weekend cyclists.\xa0Online, FangFans (my moniker for Fangko+ diehards) couldn’t rave enough about the Smash Chimken (S$12.50).\xa0I had mine with Indomie and sambal chilli at a beginner spice level of one — it goes up to 12 for those with tongues of steel. Not that level one isn’t at all spicy — it just won’t make you utter the Creator’s name in vain. The chilli paste is made with bird’s-eye chilli (chilli padi), so proceed with caution, please.\xa0But spice levels aside, I understand the collective love for this dish. The Indomie is parboiled to just enough bounce, with each strand lovingly and liberally coated with kecap manis. Combine this with the lightly fried chicken and tahu-tempeh mix, and you get a dish that’s humble but chock-full of Nusantara flavours. Still, if you find your tongue burning from all that heat, I highly recommend the gula melaka coffee (S$5.50), a bottle of cold milk with espresso and palm sugar that makes the spice a tad more bearable. If you’re on a vegetarian schedule, the Vegan Chimken (S$9) is an option. The dish replaces chicken with fried tofu and delicately spiced tempeh — both thick-cut for a satisfying bite.\xa0This is topped with a sunny-side-up egg, and goes best with a drizzle of kecap manis and steaming hot rice. It’s simple, divine and proof that food doesn’t need to be ostentatious or overly photographed to be enjoyed.\xa0\xa0I wanted to like the nasi lemak prawn belado (S$14) more (especially given the price), but I couldn’t. The whole presentation was too timorous and, at parts, restrained.\xa0The rice was fragrant but lacked a confident creaminess to it. The shrimp were briefly grilled and could have spent a longer time on the stove for a more decisive char.\xa0The only thing here I thoroughly enjoyed was the sambal belado. It’s sweet, spicy and intoxicatingly savoury.\xa0Still, would I have been more satisfied with the fried ayam berempah (spiced chicken) version? Perhaps — but where’s the challenge in that?There’s also the homemade tahu isi (S$10 for five pieces) that I’m in two minds about. While the filling of soft strips of cabbage was juicy and flavourful, I thought the fried egg mixture was a tad too oily, leaving a slick of grease on the lips.\xa0A friend who makes this at home recommends a fresh oil change when frying, though I’m not sure how feasible this is in a retail kitchen.\xa0\xa0Is it conducive to conversation? It can get loud if the restaurant is packed, as is expected in a small space like this.\xa0Is a reservation necessary? Fangko+ Coffee and Beer doesn’t accept reservations.How to get there? It’s across the road from Clarke Quay Central mall.\xa0HungryGoWhere paid for its meal at this restaurant for this review.\xa0Fangko+ Coffee and Beer is on the GrabFood delivery service. You can also book a ride there.\xa0\xa020 HongKong Street, 01-03\nOpen: Sunday and Monday (8am to 5pm), Tuesday and Saturday (7.30am to 8pm), Wednesday to Friday (8am to 8pm)20 HongKong Street, 01-03\nOpen: Sunday and Monday (8am to 5pm), Tuesday and Saturday (7.30am to 8pm), Wednesday to Friday (8am to 8pm)Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/small-tables-ipoh-food/:['Small Tables debuts in Orchard, opening its doors on Sept 3 at Pacific Plaza. The up-and-coming sidewalk cafe overlooks the shopping belt (specifically Scotts Road) and serves up signature Ipoh dishes and beverages by executive chef Sandra Sim, who learnt the recipes from her previous trips to the Malaysian city.She also runs Ladyboss Dining Club, a private dining endeavour doing modern Chinese omakase that has been fully booked for the rest of 2022.Featuring a modern minimalist interior, the dark interiors and furnishings, together with a curated playlist of lo-fi music, create the perfect ambience for dining and catch-ups.There are 26 dishes on the menu that hail from Ipoh, the capital city of Perak.Start with the Hakka yong tau foo (Ipoh Big Tree style) comprising vegetables stuffed Hakka-style with a paste of fish and pork, served with a savoury dip of chilli and spices (S$16). Perfectly crisped from the deep fry, it’s good for when you have the munchies and a great way to eat your daily portion of vegetables. Another great starter is the Ipoh chee cheong fun (S$12). Unlike the kind found at hawker centres here, the soft and silky rolls of steamed rice flour come bobbing in a bowl of sauces — special chilli sauce, Ipoh curry and cut green chilli. Topped with fried beancurd skin and fried curry leaves, the entire dish is a wonderland of textures and flavours.There’s also a street food favourite, pork belly satay (S$16), with a peanut sauce for dipping. Using a fattier cut, the smoky, sweet and savoury chunks of lightly charred meat are an upgrade from the leaner pieces of mutton and chicken found at our famous satay street at Lau Pa Sat.Another street food snack is the otah, which is also given the gourmet treatment here. The whole fish otah (S$28) includes an entire fish that’s stuffed with fish otah paste. Don’t fret — the fish is deboned, so you won’t have to worry about the bones. But we have a feeling that it’ll be the signature Ipoh curry mee (S$20) that diners will come to Small Tables for. Its take on curry mee has significantly less coconut milk and the curry takes on a much darker hue. It is topped with the works — poached chicken, char siu, crispy siu yoke, braised pig’s ears, pig’s skin, poached prawns, beansprouts, mint and curry leaves, and quail eggs.Better yet, each bowl is customisable. Firstly, you can choose from a range of noodles: Ipoh hor fun, yellow noodles, bee hoon, Nakaki (konjac) noodles, or you could even mix two varieties. And for curry, you can opt for soup, dry or non-spicy. Be warned: The eatery means it when it says it’s spicy. And, of course, don’t leave without trying the famous hot Ipoh white coffee (S$7.50) the city is known for. Coffee beans are roasted with palm oil margarine and the coffee is served with thick condensed milk.Book a ride to Small Tables.Pacific Plaza,\xa0 01-09/10/11/12, 9 Scotts Road\xa0\nNearest MRT station: Orchard\nOpen: Monday to Thursday (11.30am to 10pm), Friday and Saturday (11.30am to 11pm), Sunday (11am to 10pm)Pacific Plaza,\xa0 01-09/10/11/12, 9 Scotts Road\xa0\nNearest MRT station: Orchard\nOpen: Monday to Thursday (11.30am to 10pm), Friday and Saturday (11.30am to 11pm), Sunday (11am to 10pm)AuthorDarren finds delight in the simple pleasures of life, which include his work, music and taking time to savour and document the diverse array of food around him.© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

That’s so 2021.\xa0\xa0The selection at Bamboo Bowls features eight city-specific options, each curated by chefs intimately familiar with Asian flavours (though, of course, not necessarily of the region).They pride themselves on a menu that’s more than 50 per cent organic, completely sugar-free, 100 per cent unprocessed, unrefined and based on a whole-food plant-based framework.Bamboo Bowls also serves only ethically sourced meat options and offers low-carbohydrate alternatives for each bowl.The first bowl I tried was the Saigon (S$15 with pork, S$10 plant-based), crafted by Bjorn Shen, chef-owner of Artichoke, and fashioned after a Vietnamese bun.There are a lot of fresh and herbaceous overtones here, helped in no small part by a garden of leafy herbs such as mint and parsley — all organic. It’s served cold with lemongrass tofu, tossed in a dressing of Vietnamese fish sauce, which I thought could have been more robust in flavour. This would be good for people who are watching their weight.What I liked more, however, was the Bangkok (S$15 with chicken, S$10 plant-based), created by Bamboo Bowls culinary director Justin Hammond.There’s a plethora of flavours and textures here, which excites me. It all starts with a punchy red coconut curry that is creamy with just the right touch of heat, so that it’s approachable.It comes served with a honeyed butternut pumpkin, cashews, delightfully spiced mushrooms, and slices of lemongrass chicken that, though generous in cut, could have been given a bit more love with a flavourful brine.\xa0Elsewhere, the Seoul (S$15 with prawns, S$10 plant-based) by Jay Morjaria, chef-owner of Jae restaurant in London, promises exciting flavours but feels a little peculiar in execution. I chalk it up to the coconut and lime gochujang tempeh that was bursting with tropical overtones and should be fried, not braised.On its own, tempeh has such a distinct taste that demands a more assertive flavour pairing — the gochujang simply won’t do. Thankfully, the prawns were fat and cooked impeccably, although not enough to make me come back to this bowl.I had high expectations for the Bombay (S$15 with lamb kofta, S$10 plant-based), chiefly because Singapore’s F&B darling, chef-owner Mano Thevar of contemporary Indian restaurant Thevar, created it.I found it perplexing, though, that the basmati rice was dry, crumbly and in desperate need of more water and time in the rice cooker.Because what good is a comforting and delightfully nutty corn and chana dal khichdi (a classic Indian rice dish), if not eaten with fluffy basmati? What for a sweet pumpkin vada (a dish served in the shape of a ball), if not paired with tender rice grains?There’s also a great balance of acidity from the kachumber raita (a condiment containing yoghurt, vegetables and spices) and a savoury gaminess from the lamb kofta. Still, pity the basmati.\xa0Is it conducive to conversation? The staff members here are of minimal help since everything is processed via the app. It’s good for the self-professed introvert who uses lunch as a time to decompress. What few seats there are would set you up for a little midday tete-a-tete.Is a reservation necessary? No. You can order your bowls in advance and come by when it’s ready for collection.How to get there?

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/mcdonalds-samurai-burger-returns/:['The legendary sweet-savoury Samurai burger has returned on Thursday (Sept 22).\xa0McDonald’s first teased its fans via Facebook last Saturday, with a post captioned: “Prepare your appetite Singapore! It’s almost time to listen to your inner warrior. We’ll see you real soon.” The post garnered more than 680 reactions and 280 shares as of 4.50pm on Thursday.Fans can choose between the grilled chicken or beef patties. It is available as a single-patty (S$9.00) or double-patty meal (S$11.00). Upsize your meal for an extra 90 cents, and you can get your hands on the addictive seaweed McShaker fries (UP: S$3.90).\xa0HungryGoWhere did a taste test on the relaunched Samurai beef burger (single-patty) meal on Thursday. As we unwrapped it, a familiar sight — the famous overflowing sweet teriyaki sauce — greeted us.The beef patty within was juicy and we enjoyed every bite. Only a few slices of lettuce were scattered between the buns, though, which made it look rather sloppy and underwhelming. We also tried the yuzu cream cheese pie (S$1.80), and it was love at first taste. We liked that it was not too sweet, and the zesty yuzu sauce and thick cream cheese complemented each other pretty well. A truly underrated item on the menu, it left us wanting seconds.The Samurai burger is available for a limited time every year.McDonald’s is on the GrabFood delivery service.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/okashi-gaku-cake-in-a-can/:['From going crazy over pretty sandos to visiting omakase restaurants, Singaporeans are Japanophiles through and through. Now there’s one more thing to add to the list — a cake-in-a-can vending machine from patisserie Okashi Gaku.\xa0Having gone viral last year when the novel concept was launched in Sapporo, Osaka and Tokyo, these conveniently packaged parfaits can be found at the entrance of Eat at Seven in Suntec City from Friday (Sept 16).\xa0Born from the success of Gaku’s late night pop-up store Parfaiteria Bel, the canned cakes are made in Japan, then imported to Singapore weekly. The vending machines keep them at 0 to 3°C, and once dispensed, they can be kept for a week in the fridge.Okashi Gaku’s original and most popular flavour of strawberry shortcake (S$11.80) will be sold alongside the likes of mango and passionfruit fuwa (S$9.80) and custard pudding (S$5.80). It will also have three Singapore-exclusive flavours: Mango and chocolate (S$9.80), matcha (S$8.80) and tiramisu (S$8.80). One thing that stood out to HungryGoWhere was the uneven cream-to-cake ratio across many of the canned cakes. Nevertheless, the whipped cream — churned from whole fresh milk — was light and airy, which made it rather enjoyable. The OG strawberry shortcake can is Okashi Gaku’s bestseller — and for good reason. The fluffy chiffon cake is layered with whipped cream, fresh chunks of Hokkaido strawberries and strawberry puree.This was our favourite because it wasn’t too sweet, and allowed the delicate sweetness and tartness of the Hokkaido strawberries to come through. Our only gripe was that getting a full scoop of every ingredient might require some dexterity, as it was packed so full (a happy problem).Leaning towards a heavier flavour profile, the tiramisu consisted of a rich mascarpone cheese, light whipped cream and sponge cake soaked in espresso. The mascarpone masked most of the coffee’s bitterness, though it can get overwhelming quickly. So we recommend sharing it with a friend.\xa0Compared with the shortcake and tiramisu, the matcha and mango and chocolate cakes were rather forgettable. The least sweet of the group, the matcha parfait contains a classic Japanese combination of azuki and matcha cream. We enjoyed the slight bitterness from the matcha powder but wished the matcha flavour was stronger.\xa0Mango and chocolate, on the contrary, was great for those with a sweet tooth but unfortunately didn’t include any bits of the real fruit. Instead, we found almond florentine and a fruit-flavoured jelly mixed in. A note, too, that these Japanese cakes are slightly marked up in Singapore. The original strawberry shortcake, for instance, retails for 1,100 yen (S$10.80) in Japan.\xa0Despite its shortcomings, the novelty of having your cake in an aluminium can is worth a try, particularly for the ’gram.\xa0Book a ride to Suntec City to check out the Okashi Gaku vending machine.Suntec City, 03-306/307, 310-316, 3 Temasek Boulevard\nNearest MRT stations: Esplanade (take Exit A) and Promenade (take Exit C)\nOpen: 24 hoursSuntec City, 03-306/307, 310-316, 3 Temasek Boulevard\nNearest MRT stations: Esplanade (take Exit A) and Promenade (take Exit C)\nOpen: 24 hoursAuthor© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/grab-driver-food-esso-savings/:['Every time Grab driver Tan Choon Lye ventures into a new hawker centre, he’s on the prowl. He scans the venue expertly, observing which stall draws snaking queues and sussing out the various food options. He makes a mental note, and the next time, returns to the same place during off-peak hours.A driver for the last 24 years, Tan has ventured to all corners of Singapore in search of the best hawker fare. As a result, the avid foodie has amassed a near-encyclopaedic knowledge of Singapore’s most famous eats, underrated finds and best-kept secrets — no mean feat in this food-obsessed city-state.“There are some people who eat to live, but for me, I live to eat,” says the 57-year-old, who has been driving with Grab since 2014.In late August, Tan took us on a food trail around his Jurong neighbourhood in a trusty Toyota he rents from Grab’s rental arm, GrabRentals.Energetic, friendly and chatty, Tan tells us he enjoys the freedom of driving around the island and meeting people from different walks of life. His daily routine involves hitting the roads from 10am till nighttime on weekdays, and sometimes, till 3am on busy weekends.Whenever he picks up tourists in his car, he’s happy to give them the low-down on tourist-friendly spots to visit, such as Lau Pa Sat and Tiong Bahru Market, which he feels are gateways into Singapore’s multicultural cuisine.Throughout the day, Tan keeps up a running commentary on where to find the best claypot rice, char kway teow, chwee kueh, curry fishhead, Nyonya food, and laksa, rattling off street names and famous hawker centres, such as the ABC Brickworks Market & Food Centre and Ghim Moh Market & Food Centre. Even on his days off, Tan often takes his friends out to enjoy a meal.Tan may come across as an unlikely food influencer, but we like how unassuming and authentic it is. (He jokes that participating in this story might raise his star power and get him noticed by national media network Mediacorp.)Here’s how our day went, as Tan proudly shows us around his home turf.150 Jurong East Avenue 1\nOpen: 24 hoursThe day starts with a heavy downpour. We meet Tan at Grab’s One-North headquarters, before setting off on our journey to Esso Jurong East.Under the\xa0Esso Smiles Loyalty Program, when motorists top up their fuel, they can\xa0accumulate\xa01 Esso Smiles point with every litre of Esso Synergy petrol pumped.Members can use 750 Esso Smiles points, in exchange for S$30 instant fuel redemption. On top of that, they can get 35 per cent bonus Esso Smiles points with more than 250L of Esso Synergy petrol pumped in a month.Members can also save more with the occasional fuel e-vouchers available via the Esso app.Private-hire car drivers who are Esso Smiles Private Hire card members have also been enjoying a 22 per cent upfront fuel discount since Aug 1. That’s an increase from the previous 21 per cent.Spending long hours on the road can take a toll, so Tan typically keeps some snacks on hand in the car if he feels peckish.\xa0Esso Smiles members can use 180 Smiles points for S$5 instant mart redemption.They can redeem rewards and track their points seamlessly via the Esso app.651 Jurong West Street 61, 01-01\nNearest MRT station: Pioneer\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (6pm to 11am)To Tan, breakfast is the most important meal of the day, so he usually has a hearty one to power him up for the long drive.We make our way to Bai Li Xiang Economic Bee Hoon, or more endearingly nicknamed Ah Lian Bee Hoon after the notoriously unfriendly owner.A late-night supper stomping ground for Nanyang Technological University students since the 80s, it’s also a frequent breakfast spot among residents.We arrive at 10.30am, just in time before the stall closes.Under the golden glow of the stall lamps, the ingredients look absolutely sinful. You can almost feel the oil clogging up the arteries.Tan orders a plate laden with golden-brown bee hoon and fried mee, deep-fried and well-marinated chicken wings, fish fillet, and fried egg (S$4.50), accompanied by a dollop of chilli.After studying the plate intently, Tan says that just by looking at the colour of the dish alone, he can tell if it’s worth the hype. In his view, the stall offers “moderately” decent fare, but he’s had tastier nosh elsewhere, he says cheekily.Boon Lay Place Market and Food Village, 01-106\nNearest MRT station: Lakeside\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (6.30am to 3.30am)\xa0When it comes to his favourite cuisine, it’s Malay food, hands-down.Tan is eager to let us try Boon Lay Power Nasi Lemak, which he proclaims is the best nasi lemak in the west.Plenty of others seem to think so, too. Around lunchtime, the massively popular spot attracts a long queue of workers and residents, but the line moves forward with clockwork efficiency. There are many accolades plastered over its storefront.We hear from Tan that the peak times are past midnight, satisfying the late-night cravings of nocturnal creatures.There are eight options on the menu, ranging from the chicken set and the otah set to the fish fillet set and ayam berempah set.Tan ordered the pricier saba fish set (S$6) for us.We tuck into a generous helping of rice with the fragrance of coconut, along with saba fish that’s fresh and tender, fried egg, liberal sprinkles of ikan bilis and peanuts, and the magic sauce — sweet yet spicy sambal that delivers a kick.My only gripe is that the rice’s a tad too dry, but overall, it’s a solid dish through and through.Over lunch, Tan muses on the lengths he has gone to for food. Once, he queued at a Michelin-starred hawker stall for an hour and a half, and forked out S$10 for the bak chor mee dish — the first and last time he would do so.“At the end of it, it tasted very normal… My heart was very pain. That was the most foolish thing I ever did in my life. I wanted to cry,” he jokes.The conversation moves to the origins of how the Michelin Guide came about. Though the guide’s now known as the authoritative voice of dining, not many people know the backstory of how brothers Andre and Edouard Michelin in France founded their world-famous tyre company and how the guide was used as a marketing tactic to sell tyres.Given Tan’s experience as a driver, it all feels very apt.303 Jurong East Street 32, 01-96\nNearest MRT station: Chinese Garden\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (7am to 11pm), closed on the last Tuesday of each monthWhen teatime rolled around, we were well and thoroughly stuffed from breakfast and lunch. Still, we soldiered on for this assignment.Operating as a standalone restaurant since 2008, Enaq The Prata Shop struck upon a winning prata recipe that sets it apart from the others — by a mile. As a result, people from all walks of life flock there to have a taste. Case in point: We spotted groups of professional movers and gym bros fuelling up.When the plain prata (S$1.30) and onion prata (S$1.80) were freshly served to us, we unanimously declared that this food stop was the real star of the day.Our teeth sank into the thin, crisp exterior and yet fluffy interior, which had an artisanal puff-pastry-like texture.Unlike other pratas, which feel heavy and drenched in oil, Enaq’s was light and easy on the palate. We were content to enjoy the prata on its own without dipping it in curry, savouring its faint sweetness while washing it down with a thick and frothy teh tarik (S$1.20).Interestingly, Enaq also serves prata with a tasty sambal sauce.“I was so full earlier, but having this makes me feel like I can actually go for another round,” Tan admits sheepishly.He’s already marked this down as a go-to rest stop for future visits, though he declares he’ll come by no later than 8pm for health reasons.Enaq’s offerings include a variety of other prata options, murtabak, thosai, Maggi goreng, roti john, biryani, and rice sets that look equally delicious.For those reluctant to travel all the way to the west, there’s a second branch at 21 Ghim Moh Road to satisfy your cravings.10 Jurong West Avenue 1\nOpen: 24 hoursWhen all’s done and dusted for the day, Tan gets an instant foam car wash at Esso Jurong West.Members can redeem it for 250 Smiles points.Very much stuffed, Tan bids us farewell, adding that he plans to work off the calories by swimming and brisk walking.\xa0All food merchants listed in this article are on the GrabFood delivery service.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/butter-bean-debuts-croissants/:['Butter Bean is usually known for its thick toasts and sandwiches, but the halal-certified eatery has recently launched a range of sweet and savoury croissant sandwiches in conjunction with its second birthday! Available since Sept 22, there are seven different flavours of croissants available. Each is prepared fresh in-store daily.If you prefer a more savoury option, opt for the CFC (crispy fried chicken) Croissant (S$5.90) or BFF (battered fish fillet) Croissant (S$5.90), both of which come with a nice crunch to every bite. Or try the Omu Cheese Croissant (S$5.50) for a more creamy mouthfeel.The HungryGoWhere team tried the BFF Croissant. It comes with Butter Bean’s signature battered fish fillet, an omelette, butterhead lettuce and cheese.\xa0The battered fish fillet was clearly the star of the dish, with a crunchy exterior that encased soft and flaky flesh within. It went well with the tasty omelette and crispy croissant. Finished with Thousand Island dressing, each mouthful presented a variety of textures and flavours, and it was overall a satisfying meal.If you prefer something sweet, try the Mt Kaya Croissant (S$3.80), which has slivers of butter within each croissant and a generous amount of kaya drizzled atop. Or you can opt for the PB (peanut butter) Croissant (S$3.80) or the Milo Dino Croissant (S$3.80).Our favourite is the PB Croissant. It is topped with a generous layer of peanut butter and houses salted butter, crushed roasted peanuts and sugar. Both savoury and sweet, it felt like we were munching on min jiang kueh (a traditional peanut pancake), but with a twist.To celebrate its second anniversary, Butter Bean is running a bundle promotion for its croissant sandwiches.

By 10am, there were about 50.\xa0The pop-up will be situated at the museum’s outdoor Rain Oculus until Dec 29.Some came well-prepared with portable fans and umbrellas to provide reprieve from the heat. Thankfully, the line snaked along the lily pond, which had seats for fans to rest their feet while waiting. Only 200 people are allowed in the queue at any point in time.We spoke to a pair of friends, Jaz, 21 and Isabel, 20, who came at 5.30am and were the first in line. “We have been wanting to try (Miracle Coffee) for very long,” said Jaz, adding that she was a big fan of Lin. “We wanted to go to Taipei to try it, but Covid-19 hit and we didn’t get a chance.”\xa0Graduate student Louise Zhang, 22, woke up at 6am and travelled from her home in Boon Lay to Marina Bay Sands for the opening, in hopes that she would catch a glimpse of Lin.\xa0“I’ve been a member of his official fan club for seven years,” Zhang said. “I have been to all Miracle Coffee outlets in Shanghai and Taipei.”As the outlet in her hometown, Shanghai, had recently closed, she was excited to hear that Miracle Coffee will be opening in Singapore while she completes her studies here. She also wanted to share about it on her social media pages, given that fans in China have caught wind of the opening and it was gaining buzz.Although Lin did not expressly state whether he would be at the kiosk for the opening event in the days leading up to it, he posted an Instagram photo at about 8am on Friday showing him holding a cup of coffee, with a caption: “Good morning Singapore, coffee is served!”And fans were duly rewarded, as Lin later made a special appearance behind the bar, brewing a cup of hand-poured coffee and enthusiastically speaking about the process behind the brews.\xa0He also mentioned that you may be able to catch him at the pop-up, provided his schedule allows.On Wednesday, organisers of the pop-up concept announced a queue-management system for crowd control.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/limited-edition-magnum-chocolate-tigerlily-patisserie/:['It’s chocolate mania this October with Magnum’s collab with the popular Tigerlily Patisserie in Joo Chiat. Three limited-edition Magnum-inspired desserts will be available for pre-order from Saturday (Oct 1). \n\nTo celebrate the launch of its new Magnum Cookie Mix, Magnum has joined hands with Tigerlily to bring the rich flavours of Magnum to dessert lovers.\nFirst up is the Magnum Croissantwich. \n\nA flaky elevation of the old-school roadside ice-cream sandwich, the Magnum Croissantwich wedges Magnum’s new White Chocolate & Cookies slab between a U-shaped croissant. It’s topped with chocolate sauce.\xa0 The next contender is the Cookies & Cremeux.\xa0Referencing the classic creamy insides and crunchy chocolatey outsides of Magnum, the base features cookie-chocolate cremeux encased in vanilla mousse and salted chocolate feuilletine.\xa0It’s topped with a whipped chocolate-chip ganache, with a hidden brownie centre for the perfect contrast. The last goodie is the Magnum Cookie Melt, an imaginative take on “ice-cream swordplay”, where a stick of Magnum’s Chocolate & Crunchy Cookies is shoved into a chocolate-chip cookie mound.\xa0The cookie is freshly toasted for an oozy, milky and chocolatey bite.\xa0Taken together, it’s a truly decadent feast of sweetness. Out of the three, HungryGoWhere enjoyed the Cookies & Cremeux the most. It was thoughtfully crafted and appeared to be a deconstructed version of a Magnum ice cream.Speaking at a media event on Friday, Maxine Ngooi, Tigerlily’s co-owner and executive chef, said the tie-up was an exciting challenge for the team, especially as the patisserie doesn’t typically serve ice cream.“We know that Magnum is all about seeking true pleasure and we really resonated with that idea of seeking true pleasure in our desserts,” she said.The tie-up comes as Magnum earlier this week launched its Magnum Cookie Mix, which includes both the Magnum Mini Chocolate & Crunchy Cookies and the Magnum Mini White Chocolate & Cookies.\nFrom Saturday, customers can pre-order the limited-edition bundle via Tigerlily’s online store on a first-come, first-served basis. This bundle (S$28) includes a box of Magnum Cookie Mix ice cream, one Magnum Croissantwich, one Cookies & Cremeux and one Magnum Cookie Melt.Separately, you can get the Magnum Croissantwich (S$8), Magnum Cookie Melt (S$8) and Cookies & Cremeux (S$12) a la carte.\n\nThe pre-ordered sets and a la carte orders are available for dine-in or takeaways at Tigerlily’s cafe from Oct 4 to 18 as well.\xa0Book a ride to Tigerlily Patisserie. 350 Joo Chiat Road \nNearest MRT station: Dakota\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (9am to 5pm)350 Joo Chiat Road \nNearest MRT station: Dakota\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (9am to 5pm)AuthorEe Ming is a storyteller with a love of photography, insightful reads, films, and offbeat and obscure places.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/foodie-opinions-grab-foodie-awards/:['In our little foodie island nation, we may not always have a view on the latest global incident or Hollywood celebrity spat. Yet we’d always have a favourite bubble tea store, fast-food chain, chicken rice auntie, or cai png uncle.Singaporeans are generally a reticent bunch.\xa0But mention your favourite chicken rice — even if it’s with the slightest of acquaintances — and, often, that sparks a fire of some sort. The next thing you know, you’re engaged in an intense conversation about levels of oil, types of chilli and chicken-skin texture.I can’t recall the number of times I’ve bantered with my Grab or taxi drivers, and they’d swear their favourite char kway teow stall is the best on the island.And, oh boy, I haven’t even brought up that inevitable line: “Oh, that famous stall? Standards have dropped — it used to be so much better. Now, so-and-so stall is the best around.”This cuts across all types of food.\xa0Aside from the age-old debate between global beverage giants Coca-Cola versus Pepsi, or fast-food behemoths McDonald’s vs KFC, there are endless conversations to be had about the best coffee joints, late-night haunts, chai tow kway (fried carrot cake) stalls… the list runs on.At times, there’s even a level of personal pride when one uncovers a hidden gem before it gains popularity.\xa0For me, there’s a mild dilemma about talking up yet-to-be-uncovered hawker treasures. What happens if word gets out and foodies descend on my go-to tze char stall? In the end, though, the desire to share good lobang (deals) always wins, and I end up telling everybody I know about good food whenever I find it.\xa0After all, we want our favourite stalls to thrive, right?In navigating conversations with fellow foodies, some pastures are less controversial than others.If it comes to a toss-up between coffee and tea, most folks will generally accept that a certain beverage is, well, not exactly their cup of tea.\xa0By contrast, some might take it as fighting words if you said “chicken rice is awful”, or worse, “I eat roti prata only with sugar, instead of curry”.Anything comparing Singapore food to their Malaysian equivalents would also fall in this category.All in all, food opinions truly vary across the board, and debates can get incredibly impassioned.I, for example, favour Ya Kun Kaya Toast’s gao (thick) coffee, thinly sliced toasts and perfectly poached eggs all day, every day. My friends, meanwhile, throw their support behind Toast Box’s thick toasts and slate of well-loved local favourites.I’ve also sat through debates about the best supper dim sum joints.\xa0“Swee Choon!”\xa0“No way — Kimly’s the best!”Friends can be equally split over their bubble tea preferences.\xa0Some prefer LiHo’s modern teas topped with cheese foam, whereas others would plump for Koi The (better known simply as Koi) and Gong Cha — considered by some as the OG of specialty bubble teas.(Read on to the end of this article to pay homage to your favourite eateries and win GrabFood vouchers!)Some dramatic dust-ups go beyond just food — even transcending generations and occasionally making national headlines.Take the tugs of war between noodle shops Eng’s Wantan Noodle and Eng’s Char Siew Wantan Mee. Or the rivalry between biryani restaurants Victory and Zam Zam.If the similarity in the names of the Eng’s shops confused you, don’t worry — you’re not the only one.\xa0Meanwhile, the tussle between Victory and Zam Zam — household names in their own right for their delicious biryani — has gone on for a century. The two eateries are located next to each other along North Bridge Road.\xa0Never mind how these cases panned out, you’ll find die-hard supporters on each side of the fray.\xa0Our competitive food scene has grabbed attention beyond Singapore’s borders, too.Earlier this year, filmmaker David Gelb — the creator of Chef’s Table and director of Jiro Dreams of Sushi — enshrined one such conflict as part of an Apple marketing blitz for the iPhone 13 Pro.\xa0The micro-documentary Poached delved into the “chicken rice war” at Chinatown’s Maxwell Food Centre. It featured Michelin Bib Gourmand recipient Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice and Ah Tai Hainanese Chicken Rice, started by a former head chef of Tian Tian.Perhaps it’s time to put some debates to bed.Swee Choon, Kimly and other Singapore favourites are competing for the title of Best Late Night Eats in the inaugural Grab Foodie Awards, while LiHo, Koi and Gong Cha are in the running for the Best Bubble Tea Award.\xa0Indeed, there are award categories for nearly every food opinion — from the best eateries for early risers to the best places to order from when you’re hosting a party.So, rally your bubble tea mates, hawker kakis and potluck friends. Harness your joint voting power to show your favourite eateries some love for feeding us — particularly through the last couple of challenging years — and you might walk away with S$30 in GrabFood vouchers.\xa0Which translates into more food, of course.But back to our little foodie wars.\xa0Chalk it up to personal identity (“eastside is the best side”), nostalgia or personal preference — honestly, there’s no rational science about it.\xa0I guess that just means we’ll never run out of things to talk about.This article was written in partnership with Grab.From the best bubble tea in town to your go-to for a healthy lunch: We want to know!Voting for the Grab Foodie Awards is under way.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/penny-university-leaves-east-coast-premises/:['Well-loved cafe Penny University will be moving out of its East Coast premises after 10 years. Thankfully, this is not goodbye; it will be relocating to Bugis, said its founder Mouss Kamal in Instagram posts from the cafe’s account on Monday (Oct 3). Its last day of operations at East Coast Road is this Sunday.Mouss cited the need for a bigger space and rental costs as some reasons behind the move. Its new space will be in a shophouse at 17 Jalan Klapa in Bugis, a spot that was previously occupied by another F&B restaurant, The Beast, that vacated in November 2021. Mouss did not state when it will start operations in the new venue.Penny University is one of the pioneers of Singapore’s cafe scene. In his emotional announcement that spanned three Instagram posts, he recounted the cafe’s humble beginnings in 2012, as well as the highs and lows it experienced in its 10-year journey. He also expressed gratitude to the community for its warm hospitality and the precious bonds forged over the years.“We started with just a simple coffee bar, a few loose tables and a couple of booth seats. Our only philosophy was to bring our community together over great coffee. That’s all it was. Sometimes customers even brought their own chairs!”\xa0Members of the East Coast community decided to come together and support the cafe, donating furnishings such as antique chairs, tables, lamps and even a bicycle. The cafe decided to build on this community spirit, sourcing their ingredients and other necessary materials only from suppliers and craftsmen in the east.Mouss said: “Customers became regulars. Regulars became friends. Friends became close friends. Staff became family. It’s so heartwarming, too, to see children of our customers growing up over the years, some even joining to work with us.”\xa0And Penny University has indeed come a long way, blossoming with the community’s support. Although Mouss said he “felt awfully bad” that it could only provide toast and eggs in the early days when people asked for food, over time it became a full-service cafe offering all-day breakfast and brunch as well as curated bistronomy cuisine in the evenings.\xa0It’s clear the cafe will be leaving behind a heartbroken group of loyal customers. Several customers commented on Mouss’ posts, reminiscing about their visits to Penny University. As of Oct 6, Mouss’ series of Instagram posts have amassed more than 2,500 likes in total.One Instagram user, @van.prak, remembered she was “so excited that a good coffee place was finally opening” in the Telok Kurau area.\xa0She added: “You gave me the first coffee for free — and it was so delicious. (It was) the best I’ve had in Singapore. I kept coming back. I no longer live in Singapore but will really miss Penny University on my visits home. Best of luck with the move!”Another user, @saoirseaarakyda, said that she met her husband for their second date at Penny University in 2012. She said: “We enjoyed it. Love the ambience, love the smell of coffee… Best memories.”Still, every ending is really just an opportunity for a fresh start. Mouss said that this was not farewell, but “the beginning of our new chapter”. He also urged people to come say hello at its new home in Jalan Klapa.Penny University is on the GrabFood delivery service.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/onalu-bagel-haus/:['Onalu makes an excellent case for democratising savoury bagels.I mean, have you seen the prices of the ones sold at OG bagel joint Two Men Bagel House? With many items priced upwards of S$15, they make me wonder: “I love bagels, but do I love them that much?”Of course, it would be unfair to compare and pit one bagel house against another without due consideration of what they use as filling. At Two Men, the focus is on smoked meats — fierce, unrelenting, intensely flavourful.In stark comparison, Onalu leans more towards simple and accessible ingredients (think honey-baked ham, eggs and mushrooms) in a bagel that won’t cost you an arm and a leg.Still, even if you can (or should), I would suggest careful consumption of these delightfully dense bagels, especially if you’re watching your weight. After all, one bagel equals about 3.15 slices of white bread.I reckon that’s what makes it the perfect breakfast fare but a less ideal option for lunch — especially if you want to avoid the post-meal slump.Regardless, eat it whenever, I say — breakfast, lunch, teatime, dinner.We are, after all, in the process of democratising these lovely bun adjacents. Plus, it’s 2022. Why be limited by social constructs of mealtimes?\xa0There’s not much backstory here, except that a recent menu revamp saw Onalu making its bagels in-house.This on-site advantage means it’s now poised to serve different bagel flavours, offering almost limitless possibilities that would keep bagel lovers happy.Onalu is located within the grounds of the Singapore Management University (SMU), at the School of Accountancy building. But, on the day of my visit, there were more lecturers and adults than students during lunch.\xa0What Onalu lacks in budget-friendliness (for students, that is), it more than makes up for with bagel options that veer into a value-for-money type of overkill.Take, for instance, The Big Breakfast (S$15) that’s large and in charge, and takes no prisoners for being so ridiculously indulgent.Stuffed between my choice of charcoal bagels are bacon, honey-baked ham, hash browns, scrambled eggs, cheddar and Monterey Jack cheese, and a secret sauce.Two kinds of cheese. Two cured meats. Two carbs.I dare anyone say this is insufficient. Conversely, it can be overwhelming, but together, it teeters between being sweet and savoury at the same time.This could easily last an average office worker until teatime.If the idea of a hearty start to the day scares you, then perhaps the BEC (S$11) would suffice. It stands for Bacon, Egg and Cheese, so no surprises there what to expect when you chomp down on this number.Still, surprises abound.Here, it’s in the form of a maple aioli that reminds me of the short-lived McGriddles. It goes so well with the blend of savoriness from the processed bacon, creaminess from the cheese, and the silky flavours of softly curdled scrambled eggs.Onalu says this is the bestseller — I’m hard-pressed to find reasons to dispute this claim. It’s the perfect breakfast food.Somethin’ Fishy (S$12), meanwhile, took me completely by surprise. Surely there’s something fishy going on here. It’s not the taste but the price point.It astounds me how a bagel this generously packed with Norwegian smoked salmon is priced at S$12. If you have strong and impassioned feelings for smoked salmon (or salmon, period), forget all other options and go straight for this.With this much oily fish goodness packed in one bagel, something has to give — no pleasure is an island, after all. Not even food.Knowing that the salmon here can get too fishy for its own good, Onalu has included herbaceous scallion cream cheese and strips of red onions to cut through all that indulgence.Throw in capers and dill for a touch of acidity, and all is right with this bagel. And the world, of course.\xa0If I were to be exacting, the only gripe I have at Onalu, minor as it sounds, is the way the sunny side up and portobello mushroom from the Porter’s Belly (S$11) are arranged in my cheese bagel.They come served side by side so that I get only the mushroom or the egg for most bites. That little gripe aside, everything else in this vegetarian-friendly option is, like everything else, yummy.I especially liked the inclusion of the garlic aioli against the caramelised onion jam, underscoring the complex and poetically conflicting flavours Onalu serves up — on a budget.\xa0Is it conducive to conversation? Yes. It’s better indoors, though, without the excited chatter of university students.Is a reservation necessary? Onalu Bagel Haus doesn’t accept reservations.How to get there? It’s located within the compounds of SMU, just behind bus stop 04121.\xa0HungryGoWhere paid for its meal at this eatery for this review.\xa0Onalu Bagel Haus is on the GrabFood delivery service. You can also book a ride there.60 Stamford Road, 01-11\nOpen: Monday to Friday (9.30am to 7pm), Saturday and Sunday (9.30am to 6pm)60 Stamford Road, 01-11\nOpen: Monday to Friday (9.30am to 7pm), Saturday and Sunday (9.30am to 6pm)Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

This marks the Japanese discount store’s 13th outlet in Singapore.\xa0The store joins a slew of new openings in Northpoint recently, such as Poulet, Hot Tomato and The Original Boat Noodle. Its launch on Thursday drew large crowds, who formed long queues to enter the supermarket.As Northpoint is located close to the Mandai Wildlife Reserve, home to the Singapore Zoo, River Wonders, Night Safari and upcoming Bird Paradise, Don Don Donki’s new Northpoint City outlet has adopted a safari theme.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/wagatomo-tanjong-pagar/:['If you’re looking to treat yourself to a fine meal without breaking the bank, head to Wagatomo — a new Japanese restaurant in Tanjong Pagar.The establishment is helmed by chef Tomoyuki Kiga, 36, who also recently opened Gyu San, a specialty wagyu butchery and sando shop just across from Wagatomo, in August.Chef Tomo, as he prefers to be called, has lent his name to the venture, and will be spending most of his time here. Meanwhile, chef Linh Lam — one of Singapore’s few female butchers — will manage the butchery.The menus at Wagatomo run pricier than most, but remain fairly affordable for a semi-fine-dining restaurant, especially given its luxe offerings.Donburi lunch sets catering to the business crowd are available at various price points, depending on your choice of bowl. These are composed of a house salad, rice bowl and a monaka dessert (a wafery confection with housemade matcha ice cream, mochi and yuzu azuki red beans). Donburi options range from a vegetable yasai don of charred shishito peppers, baby carrots, shiitake and broccolini (S$28) to a decadent A5 Wagyu don (S$62) with miso confit garlic for that added kick of umami.As the sun sets, the restaurant’s offerings shift towards specially curated dishes and award-winning sake, umeshu and craft beers. Diners will have the choice of an eight-course omakase menu (S$128), which includes scampi ochazuke (tea over rice) and A5 satsuma gyu tri tip from Kagoshima, Japan.\xa0Regardless of the time of day, Wagatomo’s offerings are underpinned by an a la carte menu of modern Japanese fusion flavours.For starters, I’d suggest beginning your meal with a refreshing Momotaro tomato salad (S$16) to whet your appetite.Then, move on to the headliners: The A5 Wagyu pizza (S$32) topped with thinly sliced wagyu, pickled myoga (Japanese ginger flower), ponzu mayo and yuzu kosho cream, as well as\xa0 raw Hokkaido scallops (S$27) soaked in light ponzu and vinegar. Handle the pizza with care — the thin crust is wont to crumble slightly. The ponzu mayo, finely piped in little dollops atop the meat, is pleasantly tart and lifts the saltiness of the wagyu sashimi. (If you like, the sashimi can be torched aburi-style on request).At Wagatomo, the main courses are delicately grilled with a deft hand over bincho coals and oak wood. This includes the ume miso-glazed Duroc pork chop (S$42), which comes with a side of apple fennel slaw to cut the richness of the grilled meat.Dessert-wise, I’d go with the monaka (S$9), if you’re looking for something traditional with a modern twist. Alternatively, chef Tomo’s rendition of the mille-feuille (S$12), a layered puff pastry with figs, chestnut cream and salted vanilla ice cream, is a good choice.Book a ride to Wagatomo.Guoco Tower, 01-12, 5 Wallich Street\nNearest MRT station: Tanjong Pagar\nOpen: Mondays to Saturdays (11.30am to 2.30pm, 5.30pm to 10.30pm)Guoco Tower, 01-12, 5 Wallich Street\nNearest MRT station: Tanjong Pagar\nOpen: Mondays to Saturdays (11.30am to 2.30pm, 5.30pm to 10.30pm)AuthorJia-En has worn several hats in her career — first writing TV scripts, then food and lifestyle stories at Wine & Dine.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/meokja-by-jungga-launches-restaurant/:['When Jung Sangwoo first started dating his wife, Singaporean Nurul Afrah, in 2017 after they met in Incheon, South Korea, he discovered a huge gap.Halal food options were lacking in Incheon, and the pair found it hard to find appropriate eateries to go for meals together. Typically, Korean broths are made by simmering bones from non-halal sources, and pork also features quite heavily in many Korean dishes.\xa0Determined to find more ways for them to share meals together, Jung, who was a cook at a restaurant in Incheon, decided to whip up Korean dishes for her using Muslim-friendly ingredients.At the end of 2018, Afrah, who was studying there, returned to Singapore after her father passed away. Jung decided to move to Singapore to be with her. They got married a few months later.\xa0As a new Muslim-revert, Jung struggled to find halal Korean options in Singapore. Finding himself increasingly missing the authentic dishes of his homeland, he decided to continue working on Muslim-friendly Korean dishes to satisfy his cravings.\xa0After years of experimentation and serving his creations to Afrah and her family, Jung felt that he finally perfected his recipes.\xa0In 2021, the husband-and-wife duo decided to launch Meokja by Jungga as an online home-based business, serving Korean favourites such as budae jjigae (army stew) and jjajangmyeon (noodles in black bean sauce), using only Muslim-friendly ingredients.\xa0Fun fact: Meokja means “let’s eat” in Korean. Afrah had to quit her job as a senior teacher in a pre-school to support the new business venture.In just one year, the online business grew to encompass about 10,000 followers on Instagram. Bolstered by the strong support received, Jung and Afrah felt it was time to set up a physical cafe offering a complete Korean dining experience.\xa0Meokja by Jungga’s physical iteration was born, opening its doors to customers last Sunday (Oct 9). Located at GR.iD, near Dhoby Ghaut, the cafe offers an extended list of items from its original online menu.New on the menu is the bibim guksu (S$6.90 during weekday lunches; S$9 otherwise), a cold noodle dish popular in Korea. Served in a metal bowl, the noodle is seasoned with a sweet tangy sauce and served with chopped crunchy carrots and sliced seaweed. This vegan-friendly cold dish is a refreshing treat for Singapore’s hot and humid weather.\xa0The cafe also features set meals, such as the JjamJja set (S$34 during weekday lunches; S$37 otherwise.) It comes with the aforementioned jjajangmyeon and jjamppong, a noodle dish with spicy seafood soup, as well as a sweet-and-sour chicken tangsuyuk as a side. Each set comes with two drinks, too. For light bites, the crowd favourite kimbap (S$4.90 for weekday lunches; S$7 otherwise) is sure to tantalise your taste buds. Each kimbap comprises a seaweed roll stuffed with rice, eggs, sausages, fresh radish, spinach and carrots, then sliced into bite-sized pieces.\xa0The launch of Meokja by Jungga has been successful so far, with the cafe receiving “an average (of about) 100 groups daily” in the first three days of operation.\xa0Nonetheless, the achievement comes on the back of plenty of challenges, such as renovation delays and difficulties importing made-in-Korea furniture for the dining area due to shipping restrictions. They also had to invest quite a bit of their own money.Jung said: “The opening journey was not the easiest, especially financially. We are not a big corporation with oceans of funds.” They managed to open the cafe after relying on their savings, loans and proceeds from the home-based business, he added.To make matters worse, both of them fell ill just before the opening. Despite being sick, the pair postponed the opening only by a day, as they felt that “the show must go on”. They didn’t want to disappoint fans who have been eagerly anticipating the cafe’s opening, he said.Meokja by Jungga started from a love story, as well as a genuine desire to offer more Muslim-friendly Korean options to people in Singapore.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/krispy-kreme-minions-donuts/:['Krispy Kreme’s new Minions-themed donuts have gotten us ba-ba-bananas! The giant donut chain released the exclusive collection on Friday (Oct 14).The tie-up between Krispy Kreme and Minions will feature three characters from the famous animated movie — Bob, Otto and Stuart. Each donut is priced at S$4.20.They are priced a tad higher than other Krispy Kreme donuts, which typically range from S$2.80 to S$3.90.The Minions-themed donuts do look as good as what you see in Krispy Kreme’s promotional posters. Save a few minor smudges, each donut is glazed nicely with a striking yellow banana-flavoured icing. The eyes are skilfully crafted and well-positioned firmly on top.We took our first bite and were instantly hit by the strong flavour of banana from the glaze. The glaze’s texture is quite creamy, so much so that you may be tempted to lick it all off before your second bite.Fun fact: Bananas are the Minions’ favourite fruit!The Minions-themed donuts are filled with dark chocolate, for a classic dessert combination of bananas and dark chocolate. Sweet with a slight bitterness, it cuts through the cloying sweetness of the glaze.As for the eyes, yes, they’re edible and crunchy, but that’s about it. We anticipated mini Oreo eyes — similar to the collection released in Jakarta — but found that they’re basically made up of coloured sugar, with no flavourings added. Kids will probably still love to munch on them, though!\xa0Overall, we feel the Minions-themed donuts are worth buying, even at its slightly steeper price. It definitely left us wanting more.Krispy Kreme is on the GrabFood delivery service.

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/golden-mile-complex-stalls/:['Working in Bangkok as a young chef in a Thai-Chinese restaurant, Somsak Chomprach often dreamt of charting a new path in a foreign land. He cobbled together some savings and left home for Singapore. \n\nIt was here where he cut his teeth as a chef at the now-shuttered Big Splash for some 30 years, before finally setting up a tiny Thai restaurant in a corner of Golden Mile Complex in 2000. \n\nToday, Somsak is the proud owner of the iconic Beerthai House Restaurant, a stalwart that continues to draw crowds from faithful customers who have returned for no-frills, affordable and authentic Thai cuisine through the years.\n\nSomsak’s tale is one of many origin stories you’ll find in abundance at Golden Mile Complex, affectionately known as Singapore’s “Little Thailand”.Located between Nicoll Highway and Beach Road, Golden Mile Complex was built in 1973 and was developed as part of the Singapore government’s urban renewal scheme in the 1960s.\xa0Envisaged as a strata-titled mixed development, the 16-storey Brutalist-style building was one of the first in Singapore to integrate shops, offices and residences into one building.Apart from the many Thai eateries that have mushroomed in the complex, it’s home to many tour agencies that specialise in bus tours to Malaysia, remittance centres, clothing stores, occult stores, and the like.Home to a thriving Thai enclave, Golden Mile Complex is a space that throbs with character and life, neon lights and nostalgia. With clouds of smoke rising and greasy smells from the mookata (a style of Thai barbecue that uses a dome-shaped skillet) restaurants and thumping bass from KTV clubs, a visit to the complex promises an assault on the senses. \n\nYet it’s the grime and imperfections — a far cry from the modern and glitzy shopping malls — that lend the place a charm you can’t find elsewhere in Singapore. \n\nFor years, the fate of the ailing building, along with the rest of its inhabitants, has hung in the balance. In May, it was announced that the conserved Golden Mile Complex was sold en bloc for S$700 million to a consortium comprising Perennial Holdings, Sino Land and Far East Organization.\xa0The trio said in a statement that the existing building would be “sensitively restored”, with special attention paid to retaining its key features and signature terraced profile.\nLong-time regular Calvin Chan, 44, and his family have made it part of their weekly ritual to head there for their mookata fix for the last 10 years.\xa0They enjoy the generous platters of seafood and marinated meat, while his Vietnamese wife likes to buy ingredients from the supermarket. Their 11-year-old son lets out a dismayed groan when he hears of the en-bloc news and exclaims: “Faster tell me where the new outlet opens!”\n\nThough Chan admits that the building is falling apart and full of “weird smells”, there’s a quaint charm that he can’t quite put a finger on. \n\nHe says: “The vibe here is different from other places. You (seldom) see a complex where they let you do the mookata out in the open and the whole building smells like it. There’s only a place like this in Singapore.”In September, we took a trip down to Golden Mile Complex to speak to the business owners about their last days here. Most have made peace with the news and are busy planning their next steps.\xa0\xa05001 Beach Road, 01-94/96\nOpen: 11am to 9.30pmUnlike the ubiquity of most chain restaurants, part of the charm at Beerthai House Restaurant is its strong family spirit, imbuing the place with plenty of heart and warmth.It’s here that we meet Simachat Chomprach, the daughter of Somsak.\xa0Just 24 years old, she and her older sisters helm the daily operations and marketing of the business. This spans both Beerthai House Restaurant and Beerthai House 2, which can seat more than 100 people. Meanwhile, her father, brother, aunt and cousins take the reins in the kitchen.\n\nOriginally frequented by Thai foreign workers back in 2000, the eatery has slowly carved out a reputation for serving solid Thai zi char among Singaporeans and even the Myanmar community. Its extensive menu spans more than 100 items.Its signature dishes include boat noodles (pork and beef), papaya salad, mango salad, steamed fish with lime sauce, pandan chicken, prawn cakes, and claypot prawn tang hoon.But insiders will tell you that what makes the place most special are off-the-menu items, exotic street food such as fried duck bill, and the ability to customise your dish. \n\nIt also prides itself on authenticity, such as pairing its Thai basil fried rice with the less commonly seen bamboo shoots.\n\n“I always tell customers if it’s less spicy, no chilli, it’s not nice; the taste is different,” says Simachat, a business management graduate from the Singapore Institute of Management.\n\nEven as a young child, she was unfazed by the dangerous and seedy image of Golden Mile Complex. After all, it’s the only home she has known. So when the news of the en bloc broke, it came as a huge blow.\n\n“It’s a pity because we have been here a really long time and we’re very familiar with this place. The whole building is Thai. It’s considered a very friendly mall, and we’re more like friends with everyone. It’s our safe place. Once we move out, it won’t be like this anymore,” she says. Still, they’re excited that this marks the beginning of a new chapter for the restaurant. \nThey’ve already secured a small unit at the nearby City Gate mall to cater to the office crowd and another one on Kitchener Road.\n\nIn a major move, they’ll be opening their main branch in a shophouse in the Bugis area after Chinese New Year, which falls in January next year. \n\nThough it’s done with some trepidation and the prospect of steeper rent, the move will give them more ownership over the space than being in a commercial mall subject to strict management.\nThe menu will remain the same and they will try to keep prices low, says Simachat.\n\n“We’re not sure what the crowd is going to be like, but we’re hopeful that we’ll continue to see our loyal customers supporting us,” she adds.\xa05001 Beach Road, 02-64\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (10am to 8pm)Despite being situated in an inconspicuous corner outside the Thai supermarket on the second floor, the unassuming Golden Banana draws a non-stop stream of customers eager to snap up its delectable selection of gloriously fried goodies. \n\nThink fried banana fritters, sweet potato balls, fried yam and fried sweet potato in sizzling vats of oil — a spectacle to behold. It’s simple, but hits the spot.\xa0Interestingly, founder Saelee Pornjit’s (informally known as Jitty) story reads like a tale of the unlikely entrepreneur. \n\nFormerly a secretary at a law firm in Golden Mile Complex, she was first approached by the folks at the Thai supermarket to open a stall there. In 2011, she tried her hand at selling Thai bubble tea. \n\nThen she started to experiment with selling fried bananas, continuously tweaking the recipe based on customers’ feedback.To her surprise, the business exploded in popularity. “We just (did) more and more until no time to do bubble tea,” says the 56-year-old with a laugh.Unlike the Singapore-style goreng pisang, the Thai fried banana fritters are larger and sweeter. The secret is in the flour and the exact temperature of the oil, she reveals. Every day, the shop gets through at least 20kg of flour. \n\nAnd once the store is open, the crew are on their feet non-stop from 10am to 8pm. \n\nThe top-selling items of banana and sweet potato balls are in such high demand that Pornjit’s team has no time to focus on cooking the other items, such as yam and sweet potato.For now, she plans to secure a unit at the nearby City Gate at the end of the year, though she’s unsure if the crowds will return. \n\n“I feel quite sad… Now I’ve a lot of customers and suddenly no more this place. It’s a pity that we’ve to start all over again in a new place,” she says. \xa05001 Beach Road, 01-91\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (12pm to 4pm, 5pm to 10pm)The people behind Tha Chang Noodle Bar wanted to start their business on a high. But they found their plans derailed by the heightened alert dine-in bans against the backdrop of Covid-19. Just when things started to pick up and they were on the verge of expanding, they suffered a second blow — the news that Golden Mile was going en bloc.\xa0 \n\nOpened in April last year, Tha Chang Noodle Bar was founded by Thai friends Anna Phusanisa and Maysa Dusita, who were brought together by their love of cooking authentic dishes from their homeland.They were eager to let Singaporeans have a taste of the Thai boat noodle, a traditional food sold off boats at floating markets in Thailand. It’s also commonly found in Bangkok’s famed neon-lit Victory Monument boat noodle alley.\n\nThe pair studied under a veteran Thai chef with more than 20 years of experience to create a mouthwatering broth that balances sweet, salty, sour and spicy notes, and a hint of charcoal as well.\xa0We wash down the spiciness with a refreshing matcha cream cheese drink made from tea leaves sourced from Chiang Mai. \n\nThe eatery also offers a range of Thai cuisine, such as the omelette crab bomb, fermented grilled pork skewers, larb Isaan (Isaan-style meat salad), muu nam tok (Isaan Thai pork salad), tom sap (hot and spicy sour pork rib soup), and more. \n\nThe team also noticed that Singaporeans are more adventurous and willing to try more exotic items on their menu, such as raw prawns, says Dusita, who oversees kitchen operations.For now, the team is in the midst of searching for a new space.\nPhusanisa’s husband Shawn Chio,\xa0who helps with marketing, says: “We’re still waiting to see where most of our Thai neighbours will relocate, so we can continue to be near the Thai community.”But beyond the good food, it’s clear that the present iteration of Golden Mile Complex occupies a special place in people’s hearts and will be sorely missed when it’s gone.\xa0Beerthai House Restaurant and Tha Chang Noodle Bar are on the GrabFood delivery service. You can also book a ride to Golden Mile Complex.\xa0AuthorEe Ming is a storyteller with a love of photography, insightful reads, films, and offbeat and obscure places.

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/singapore-specialty-coffee-houses/:['It’s International Coffee Day on Oct 1 and it’s apt that we celebrate the lifeblood of Singaporeans — coffee.\xa0From sock-strained kopi-O at Singapore kopitiams to the third-wave coffee movement that spread from Melbourne, the brew has become recognised as something of an art form.\xa0Part of that movement involves baristas having an intimate knowledge of where the beans are from and a concern for sustainability, which results in high-quality specialty coffees.\xa0As any slight difference in the beans, how they’re processed, roasted and brewed can alter the product drastically, it pays to have control over the entire process to decide how much flavour and aroma a cup of brew will have.\xa0Here are five specialty coffee houses in Singapore that take on the task of roasting their coffee beans to fine-tune the brew they serve.\xa0\xa014 Upper Cross Street, and Far East Plaza, 02-94, 14 Scotts Road\nOpen: Operating hours vary across storesAs co-host to an upcoming home brewers competition called So You Think You Can Brew? and a popular co-roasting space used by several coffee houses, The Community Coffee certainly lives up to its name.The roastery highlights different sources of coffee beans according to theme, and this year, it’s focusing on Peruvian-grown beans.\xa0The beans come in small packets available for purchase via its physical outlets or its website, and include instructions on the best way to extract the flavours.Folks here prefer to hand brew their coffee and only serve it hot as they believe that’s the best way to experience the changing flavour profile as it cools. You will still, however, be able to order its espresso-based drinks iced.\xa0What to order: Flat white (S$5), hand brew (from S$6)\n\xa07 Jalan Klapa\nOpen: Wednesday to Monday (10am to 6pm)It never gets boring at Double Up Coffee. Only two years old, the specialty coffee house rode through lockdown and earned a steady group of regulars with its kitschy graphics and fun attitude.\xa0Collaborating with the like-minded younger generation of F&B entrepreneurs such as Two Men Bagel House and SWRL.CO to host community events, the store has hosted workshops on filter coffee, and offered customers pizzas and even massages.\xa0Keep an eye on its Instagram page to get in on its next collaboration.It also doesn’t hurt that its delicious pour over coffee is priced from a reasonable S$7. While most places source their beans from Central America, South America and Africa, Double Up Coffee brings in less common beans from Thailand and Indonesia occasionally.\xa0While the baristas here don’t have their own roaster, they co-roast their beans using the equipment at The Community Coffee.\xa0Aside from buying its coffee beans in-store or from its website, you can also find them stocked at certain cafes such as One Man Coffee and House Downstairs.\xa0What to order: Pour over coffees (from S$7), single shot espresso (S$3.50), kombucha (S$7)\n618 Serangoon Road, 01-01\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (10am to 6pm)Puck Provisions is one of the few coffee houses in Singapore with its own roasting machine tucked away at the back of the store. Barely a year old, it’s situated on the ground floor of a shophouse with a long counter along the length of the space.The house-roasted coffee beans hail from Ethiopia, Brazil and Peru, and are sold in packets in store or available online for pick-ups.\xa0Caffeinated beverages aside, Puck Provisions has fully committed to an entirely vegan food menu.\xa0The menu features bakes such as vegan banana bread (S$5) and salted maple blondie (S$4.50), and yeggs & luncheon burrito (S$9). You’ll also find the occasional vegan condiment and kombucha for sale.What to order: Hot white with oat milk (S$5.50), pour over coffees (from S$6), yeggs & luncheon burrito — vegan eggs, plant-based luncheon meat, hao gan ma (vegan chilli cause), vegan curry sauce and greens (S$9), sus spice blueberry pancakes — cardamom-infused blueberry compote with vegan pancakes (S$8)\xa0124 Bukit Merah Lane 1, 01-144\nOpen: Tuesday to Friday (10am to 5pm), Saturday and Sunday (10am to 6pm)Hidden within the old-school neighbourhood near Alexandra Food Village is another new entrant to the coffee scene, Rookie’s Coffee Shop, which emerged this year.\xa0Opened by Junior Lim, a barista with three years’ experience at places such as Kurasu and Little Big Coffee as well as the 2019 Singapore Aeropress Champion, the specialty coffee house has quickly amassed a small following for its cosy and warm atmosphere.\xa0Although the beans for its coffee line-up are presently sourced from other local coffee houses, Lim told HungryGoWhere that it would be serving its own roasted coffee beans come late October.\xa0Unlike most other specialty coffee houses that brew using the Hario V60 method, he uses an Aeropress method of brewing, a technique he knows best.\xa0Unique to the store is Lim’s iced bandung espresso (S$6.50), an espresso-based beverage mixed with rose syrup and milk born from his love of bandung. The rose syrup adds a touch of sweetness, and is great for those who don’t typically drink coffee.\xa0What to order: Aeropress coffee (from S$7), iced bandung espresso (S$6.50), lemon bar (S$4.50)\xa08 Biomedical Grove, 01-06\nOpen: Monday to Friday (8am to 4pm)Little Big Coffee Roasters may be hard to locate amid the grey office buildings, but it’s definitely worth the effort for its affordable coffees. A regular cup of hot black will set you back only by S$3.\xa0\xa0It fires up a roast twice a week, on Monday and Wednesday, to ensure the shelves are well-stocked with freshly roasted beans for cafes and caffeine lovers alike. The current line-up includes beans from small farmers in Myanmar, an origin that you don’t normally find in Singapore.Its coffee beans can be bought online and delivered to your home or purchased in-store.\xa0And, as you’d expect from all respectable coffee connoisseurs, the brew isn’t served with ice here. Instead, it’s served chilled in a reusable jar (S$5.50).\xa0Those working in its vicinity may be glad to hear that the roastery and specialty coffee house also serves bagels (from S$3.50) and other baked goods for a quick lunch grab or teatime pick-me-up.\xa0What to order: Hot black (from S$3), coffee milkshake (S$6.50), hand brews (from S$4.50)\xa0The Community Coffee is on the GrabFood delivery service.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/beach-road-scissors-cut-curry-rice-vivocity/:['Beach Road Scissors Cut Curry Rice has long been a household name, serving up flavourful plates of curry rice that cater to night owls looking to satisfy their rumbling bellies.The atmosphere in its original Jalan Besar outlet can be described as no-frills and unpretentious, and the food presentation is fuss-free, almost messy. Ingredients are piled onto plates of rice, cut with a pair of scissors (hence its name), and then drenched generously with its two-sauce recipe.On Oct 13, the heritage brand opened a new outlet in VivoCity — its third location in Singapore (it has one in Upper Thomson and one within Hawkers’ Street at Ion Orchard mall) and its first-ever standalone mall outlet.The new location is markedly different from its original. It boasts a comfortable, clean and air-conditioned environment, albeit with a nostalgic design — think retro signboard and vintage wall tiles — in keeping with its history.The family-run business was established in 1930, beginning as a humble food stall at the now-defunct Clyde Terrace Market serving modest meals of rice, curry and chap chye (mixed vegetables) at affordable prices. It has since gained a following and established itself as a go-to supper spot.Unlike the outlet at Ion Orchard, which offers a limited selection of dishes, the VivoCity one serves up the full range, displayed behind its typical glass casing. The ingredients are similarly doused in its two-sauce mix — comprising its original fried braised pork sauce and curry sauce.Benjamin Goh, the fourth-generation owner of Beach Road Scissors Cut Curry Rice, told HungryGoWhere he took over the reins because of his love for curry rice and family heritage.While he acknowledged that prices at the VivoCity outlet are slightly higher compared with the others owing to increasing costs for rental, utilities and manpower, he said the brand’s intent was to provide an opportunity for customers to enjoy their food in comfort.He also hopes this outlet would expose the younger generation, as well as tourists, to the taste of authentic scissors cut curry rice.Quality, he added, will not be compromised, and there will be some outlet-exclusive items, such as its sharing platter (S$16.80) meant for two, featuring all its signature dishes — pork chop, chicken chop, braised pork belly, curry chicken, cabbage, eggs and rice.Other special features include a more visual menu, comprising photos of set dishes for easy ordering, and a soup of the day (S$4.50) that was reintroduced here after it was previously discontinued at other outlets due to Covid-19 regulations.To ensure consistency, its main curry paste and the spices of its fried braised sauce are prepared in the Thomson and Jalan Besar outlets.They are refrigerated and delivered twice weekly to Beach Road Scissors Cut Curry Rice’s VivoCity outlet to ensure freshness. The cooks will then add coconut milk and other ingredients to produce the signature two-sauce mix. They will also prepare the other dishes on-site.HungryGoWhere tried Set D, which came with pork chop, chicken chop, cabbage, egg and rice (S$8.50), as well as the soup of the day (winter melon soup).We found the gravy fragrant, and not too spicy or salty. The generous coating of it over our rice and other ingredients made every mouthful rich and flavoursome.The chicken chop was thick and juicy, while the pork chop was thin and tender. Both of them were skilfully fried to perfection, sporting a crispy breaded crust. We loved the soft and subtly seasoned chap chye that gave a different texture and helped to cleanse the palate with every bite.The winter melon soup was a good companion to the rich curry rice. With melt-in-your-mouth winter melon pieces, pork-rib flesh that slid off the bone, and a clear yet umami broth, this was an unexpected winner.\xa0Beach Road Scissors Cut Curry Rice is on GrabFood.

The event was, however, cut short because of the pandemic and it went on a hiatus for about two years.For its second venture, Chatuchak Singapore will return to its previous location — the Grandstand South Carpark in Bukit Timah.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/babba-jalan-riang/:['EDITOR’S NOTE: Babba closed on Oct 30, 2022.\xa0It’s a good thing that I was blithely unaware Babba was opened by the same people behind The Brewing Ground, one of the best places in the east that serves some of the most robustly flavoured classically cafe fare I’ve tasted.This lack of prior knowledge proved to be great for impartiality because I’m confident that had I known this little nugget of information, I would have broadly excused any shortcomings of a bad day in the kitchen. As expected of me, I assure you my review here is impartial.But I digress.\xa0According to its website, Babba is “inspired by a Baba (Peranakan) and a baba (爸爸) who holds himself to high standards of excellence, unshaken by whatever the world throws at him, was always loving on people with food, consistently dedicating himself to his own standards of excellence and providing not just his family, but the rest of Singapore, with Peranakan dishes passed down from generations before”.Located in the private estate enclave of Jalan Riang, within walking distance of Serangoon MRT station, Babba is not just a Peranakan outfit. It’s also a transformative one.This translates to different menus throughout the day — a twist on the traditional at brunch and an authentic Peranakan feast for dinner.On the night of my visit, Babba was the only restaurant opened along that stretch. This, I reckon, made for good business, as evidenced by the bustling dinner crowd celebrating birthdays, and scores of couples — mostly casually dressed — dropping by for a quick dinner date.\xa0Dinner starts with an appetiser of Nyonya otah (S$12), served wrapped in attap leaves with much less char on the exterior than I’d have preferred.Inside, the wide rectangle of fish paste is good for a party of three, although it did veer on being a tad salty. Overly generous seasoning aside, the otah was suitably fragrant and spiced and, if anything, a decent iteration of a classic.The ayam panggang (S$28) draws due attention with its bold char and shimmery skin from the kicap manis glaze. This was my favourite of the night, although I wouldn’t mind if it was brined slightly longer so that the inside matches the flavourful outside. Grilled chicken on its own has so little going for it, so it’s imperative that every element of the dish is executed with finesse and that, I believe, starts with a heroic brine.But that aside, the skin was a delight, equal parts sweet and slightly spicy. It’s what all grilled chicken should aspire to be. You know what they say — when in doubt, kicap manis. Always.Mains come by way of a bowl of beef rendang (S$28) cooked with incredibly soft beef shin chunks with a balanced rempah and a slightly wet gravy in a rich hue of earth — just the way I like it. This was rich but not overindulgently, making judicious eating a guilt-free affair.The babi pongteh (S$26), by contrast, was a sharp departure from the rich flavouring of the rendang, offering a vastly different spice palette paired with an intoxicating cinnamon aroma that lingers. It sets itself apart from similar iterations with the use of Iberico pork belly that lends a sultry fattiness to the dish.\xa0A word of advice: Let this sit for a while. Like most dishes in the Peranakan and Malay repertoire, it gets better with age.Still, what would make me come back to Babba are its desserts — the two I had were impeccable works of art and a great show of balance of textures and flavours. There’s the pulut hitam (S$10) that took so much of my breath away with its keen navigation and understanding of the balance of sweet black glutinous rice and salty coconut cream. Served with a scoop of coconut sorbet, this was impressive for something so traditional. But it’s the homemade banana cake (S$13) that made me gasp and clutch my proverbial pearls in awe. Here, the dense cake is filled — and I mean filled to the brim — with soft, gooey and intoxicatingly sweet bananas. Dip that in the salted gula melaka sauce and combine it with a generous spoonful of coconut sorbet, and call it a night.\xa0The chap chye (S$15), which comes with braised cabbage and carrots cooked in a savoury taucheo gravy, was a valiant attempt that falls slightly short. To be honest, I’ve had more umami and briny chap chyes, but this works just as well.I particularly liked the addition of black wood ear fungus, which absorbed all that precious taucheo gravy with nary a hesitation.Still, Babba is one of those places that I can confidently rank as above-average, almost reaching my standards of the pinnacle of excellence but missing the mark ever so slightly.Everything was objectively good, which, for a Singapore restaurant, would suffice and is what would ensure success in a saturated space.\xa0Is it conducive to conversation? The restaurant employs professional soundboards that suspend from the ceiling throughout the space. So, even if it’s full, it’s possible to carry on a conversation in soft, hushed tones.Is a reservation necessary? A reservation is not needed, but recommended.How to get there? It’s a 10-minute walk from Serangoon MRT station.HungryGoWhere paid for its meal at this restaurant for this review.\xa0Babba is on the GrabFood delivery service.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/clinton-st-baking-company-singapore/:['The Clinton St Baking Company — renowned for its stacked pancakes — has received “overwhelming support” since announcing last week it would close its only Singapore store on Aug 30. Patrons have since completely booked out the place until its last day, though the eatery has set aside some seats for walk-in customers.A representative at its Singapore store, who declined to be named, told HungryGoWhere on Friday (Aug 19) that it was closing because its landlord wants the Purvis Street space back. It has no plans to reopen in Singapore for the time being.“We’re very thankful for your support over the past years and heartened that customers enjoy our place,” said the representative.\xa0In a social media post on Wednesday, the bakery said its reservation slots were full for the rest of August. “As much as we would like to serve all of you within the short time we have left, it is proving difficult due to our limited seating capacity,” it added.\xa0It advised walk-in customers to avoid the peak period of 11am to 2pm.\xa0The representative added: “Since our reservations are full, we are seeing more walk-ins on off-peak hours. We encourage diners walking in to come during off-peak hours for a higher chance of getting a table, as the place is full during peak hours or lunchtime.”Serving good ol’ American breakfast classics since 2001, Clinton St Baking Company also has stores in New York City, Tokyo and Dubai. It opened its Singapore outpost in 2015.\xa0\xa0Diners from near and far have been streaming into the bakery for a taste of its offerings, before it shuts for good.\xa0Marketing manager Carrie Sim, 33, said: “The Chicken and Waffles are one of the best in Singapore, in my opinion. The portions for the Spanish Scramble are so generous and the ingredients used so fresh, and the pancakes with warm maple butter are very fluffy and delicious.”Even visitors from overseas have returned.\xa0Jason Baird, 43, a pharmaceutical and biotech consultant from the United States, dined at the bakery about seven years ago when he was in Singapore for a business trip.\xa0“I came back again during this trip and didn’t know it was closing. I really like the eggs benedict, how the menu is specialised and the food quality is good. Plus, it’s in a convenient location. I will definitely miss these.”A pair of food bloggers who go by the Instagram handle @jenpaieats have tried all of Clinton St Baking Company’s pancake offerings — blueberries, banana walnut and chocolate chunks — on their “countless visits” since 2018.“We’d definitely miss having their soft and fluffy pancakes topped with fresh blueberries, and dousing them in warm maple butter. One of the best pancakes we’ve had so far — and their maple butter, we could literally put it on everything,” they said.“We only learn to appreciate what’s good when we’re about to lose it. We’ve been on a quest ever since they announced their closure to find some that taste as delicious.“But so far, nothing has matched the flavours of those transcendental pancakes and their trademark syrup.”When HungryGoWhere arrived at the eatery at 8.45am on Friday, two-thirds of the seats were occupied, with the crowd increasing steadily until we left at 10.30am.We ordered its signature blueberry pancakes with warm maple butter (S$21). The pancake batter was soft and moist, and didn’t crumble from cutting but still melted in the mouth. The blueberries and jam struck the perfect balance between fruity-sweet and sour, while the warm maple butter had an indulgent maple fragrance.We also got a cappuccino (S$6.50) that was foamy, aromatic and gave us the caffeine hit we needed for the day.The eatery serves all-day breakfast and still has limited walk-in slots until it dims its lights on Aug 30.Clinton St Baking Company is on the GrabFood delivery service.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/cabin-crew-fnb-places/:['When global travel came to a standstill during the Covid-19 pandemic, thousands of airline workers and cabin crew found themselves grounded.Many of them had to adapt quickly, taking on temporary roles as safe-distancing ambassadors and swabbers, and even venturing bravely into entirely different industries.We speak to four former flight stewards and stewardesses who found success in the F&B sector, and an owner of a cocktail bar where half the team are ex-cabin crew.\xa0465 Crawford Lane, 01-08 (starting operations in July 2022)\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (10am to 4pm)Chanel Li has always loved the aviation industry. She attended kindergarten at Changi Airport and played on conveyor belts at the check-in counters while her mother, a former flight attendant, clocked long hours at the airport as a cabin crew manager.So when Li landed her first job as an air stewardess with low-cost carrier Scoot straight out of polytechnic, it was a dream come true.With her flying career on pause, the 24-year-old set up Whisking Bakes as a full-fledged home-based business despite having no F&B experience. By the end of 2020, she was doing so well that she was making 20 to 25 cakes a week. She would deliver the cakes personally on weekends.She found her niche making orh nee tart balls — a buttery, melt-in-your-mouth pastry wrapped around creamy, fragrant yam filling inspired by the Teochew yam paste.Business skyrocketed so spectacularly that she had to rent a central kitchen at Tai Seng and tap a pool of 25 staff members to help make the bakery’s new range of mooncakes and burnt cheesecakes. In January alone, they made an eye-popping 59,000 tarts.In July, Li will start a 26-seat cafe along Crawford Lane.It was a steep learning curve at the beginning, but what helped was being young, energetic and openly “shameless”, jokes Li.She approached other entrepreneurs in their 20s for advice and created a Telegram channel (@hbbcommunity). With some 800 subscribers, it’s where people trade tips on everything from where to find the best flour to delivery hacks.\xa0Open: By appointment and subject to availability.A Singapore Airlines (SIA) steward turned mixologist, Andrew Pang found himself in a unique position to offer help at the peak of the pandemic in 2020.The 37-year-old co-founded the Cabin Crew United Facebook page to help match jobseekers with hospitality roles and in any other way possible, including delivering a crash course in digital marketing.At one point, the Cabin Crew United team garnered more than 600 job listings, besides the usual safe-distancing ambassador roles. “It was a small win in a climate of constant bad news,” he recalls.Pang was also involved in setting up the now-shuttered Kevin Khoo Bistro, which opened to great fanfare in late 2020 with its distinctive concept of being largely staffed by grounded SIA crew.Right now, he’s a brand ambassador with F&B company Suntory and a consultant to various bars and restaurants.He also opened Lim Bae (a play on lim peh, meaning “your father” in Hokkien, combined with bae, a millennial term of endearment). It’s an intimate home bar in Bishan, where R&D work and “focus-group discussions” are done before the tipples go out into the market officially.Here, Pang dreams up bespoke concoctions based on customers’ requests. These include the Singer in a Smoky Room, a gin-based cocktail inspired by American rock band Journey’s song Don’t Stop Believin’.In time, he hopes to hold cocktail mixology workshops. “With the pandemic, it’s created an appetite for novel dining experiences such as private dining, and we’re excited to be a part of this movement to champion a stronger cocktail culture in Singapore,” he says.\xa0Rest Bugis Hotel, 8 Jalan Kubor\nOpen: Sunday to Thursday (11am to 6.30pm); Friday and Saturday (11am to 8.30pm)Two years ago, former SIA stewardess Kittiya Ratanajirasas (better known as Kitty) began her baking journey with no oven and barely any equipment, making crepe cakes in a pan.When the pandemic hit, the 37-year-old had just returned to flying after having her second child. Taking to baking to pass the time, the Thai national came up with the idea of creating Thai tea crepe cakes draped in Thai milk tea sauce.The cakes were a roaring success. Today, Kitty and her husband, Philip Yap, 39, helm Two Bake Boys, a boutique cake shop with an impressive social media following. They have two outlets: a drive-through at CT Hub 2 in Kallang and a cafe at the Rest Bugis Hotel.Named after her two young sons, Two Bake Boys also lets customers personalise cake slices in flavours such as Thai green tea, honey yuzu, taro, and lychee rose.\nThe cafe’s dine-in menu is a riff on inflight menus with items such as Business Class Breakfast, which includes scrambled eggs with German pork sausage, greens and sauteed mushrooms with brioche.As for customer service, Kitty takes that upon herself by training her staff with the poise and composure she’s learnt from her days of flying.Though Covid-19 has set her life on an entirely different trajectory, she has no regrets about this new career path.“I want my story to be an inspiration to other people. I know it’s not easy. Every day is a new learning experience, and I have to keep moving forward for the future.”\xa0One Raffles Place, 01-03\nOpen: Monday to Saturday (5pm to 12am)When entrepreneur Saurabh Kale was looking to launch his speakeasy cocktail bar Taylor Adam — one of three “Covid-19 baby” restaurants he started in the pandemic — the 42-year-old found himself fielding referrals from friends suggesting that he hire staff from the ailing airline industry.It was a fitting one, given that the theme of travel features prominently at the bar. \n\nHidden behind a bespoke tailor in the CBD, the signature cocktails here are inspired by historical events and moments in pop culture — from the civil war between England and Scotland (Over the Sea, a scotch and bourbon tipple) to a playful homage to the Beatles in the 60s (LSD, a cocktail). Today, around half the team are former cabin crew, many of whom are veterans with two decades of experience. A first for both Saurabh and his staff, working in a bar took a little training and acclimatisation.“On the ground, it’s very different from in the air. Unlike a flight where you serve in phases and more people, here you have to engage more deeply with customers, to tell a story over a prolonged period, to sense the mood and understand the nuances of when to interrupt a conversation, for example. It’s a completely different ball game,” says the former banker.As the dust from the pandemic settles, Saurabh says he is looking forward to making sure that everything stabilises in this uncertain climate.In late March, the bar launched its Chapter 2 Menu: Pride of the East, which follows tales of trade and travel around British trade routes in Asia.\nWhisking Bakes is on GrabMart.AuthorEe Ming is a storyteller with a love of photography, insightful reads, films, and offbeat and obscure places.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/yumeno-suteji/:['There’s nothing quite like unwinding amid the lively atmosphere characteristic of an informal Japanese bar, or izakaya. Though there are plenty of such watering holes in Singapore, Yumeno Suteji, which opened its doors at Funan mall on Oct 10, takes it up a notch by adding live music to the mix.\xa0The name Yumeno Suteji can be translated to “dream stage” in English. It’s aptly named, given that the bar’s main focus is on its live music. Different bands will play a mix of rock and English, Mandarin, Cantonese and Hokkien pop music from 4pm until 11.30pm daily. But that wouldn’t be the end of it — a DJ will take over the tunes with some house music until the izakaya closes at 2.30am.\xa0While providing live music is not typical of a conventional izakaya, Yumeno Suteji, in many ways, still offers a fundamental izakaya experience. Its dimly lit interior, wall murals and rowdy vibe invite a party atmosphere.\xa0It also serves alcoholic drinks such as beer, sake and highball, as well as light snacks for sharing with groups.As with most alcohol spots, there is always happy hour.\xa0To celebrate its opening, Yumeno Suteji will be offering a one-for-one promotion on its beer towers (from S$98) and sake (from S$20) from 4pm to 7pm.\xa0It’s quite a bang for your buck, considering the usual happy hour is a two-for-one promotion that applies only to its Carlsberg draught and Asahi white draught tower.\xa0Upon browsing its menu, you may find yourself overwhelmed by the sheer volume of options available. The menu comprises salads, bar bites, sashimi, skewers, ramen, donburi, and much more.\xa0Aside from popular items such as mentaiko fries (S$10), chawanmushi (steamed egg, from S$5) and tori karaage (fried chicken, S$12), Yumeno Suteji serves more unique items such as the Surame ika (S$22), a charcoal-grilled squid. The item that really impressed us was the hotate (S$15 for two), a dish consisting of grilled scallops with mentai mayo and mozzarella cheese. The cheese and mayo added a rich dimension to the dish, while the scallop tasted refreshing and sweet.\xa0We also recommend trying the tamagoyaki (S$8), a Japanese rolled omelette. Not only does it check all the boxes for a good tamagoyaki — light, fluffy and sweet — its exterior is also blow-torched to give it a nice char. The omelette ended up with a crispy exterior while maintaining its soft, cloud-like texture within.\xa0For something more filling, opt for the niniku chahan (S$8). The Japanese-style garlic fried rice is reminiscent of the ones served at teppanyaki restaurants with a strong flavour and a hint of sweetness.\xa0That said, our dining experience at Yumeno Suteji was far from perfect. We visited a few times throughout the opening week, and found the quality of its food inconsistent. Some dishes were overcooked, yielding a tough and rubbery squid or a dry tori momo (chicken skewer, S$5.90 for two).\xa0\xa0It didn’t help that the service left much to be desired as well. Our food took around 30 minutes to be served, and many items were out of stock. On one occasion, one of our dishes was cancelled by the kitchen with no prior notification.\xa0Yumeno Suteji has great potential with its live music performances and expansive menu. Its convenient mall location also makes it a good spot for office workers to let their hair down after work.But between its sluggish service and inconsistent food, it may find itself in a situation where it gets outshone by other izakayas.\xa0We’d chalk its poor performance up to teething issues, but we hope to see the bar do much better in terms of service and food quality on our next visit.Funan Mall, 01-19/20, 107 North Bridge Road\nNearest MRT station: City Hall\xa0\nOpen: Monday to Saturday (12pm to 2.30am), Sunday (12pm to 11.30pm)Funan Mall, 01-19/20, 107 North Bridge Road\nNearest MRT station: City Hall\xa0\nOpen: Monday to Saturday (12pm to 2.30am), Sunday (12pm to 11.30pm)Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/sembarang-nasi-lemak-cafe-opens/:['Singaporeans can never get enough of the beloved nasi lemak, can’t they? Lee Syafiq, founder of gourmet burger joint Ashes Burnnit, certainly thinks so. On Monday (Oct 17), Syafiq opened his latest concept, Sembarang Nasi Lemak cafe, to celebrate our devotion to this dish.Sembarang Nasi Lemak is the third F&B brand launched by Syafiq, after Ashes Burnnit in 2019 and Maison Sucree bakery in 2020. The new Muslim-owned cafe is located at the same unit where the now-defunct Maison Sucree used to be, at 63B Lengkok Bahru.As his first two forays focused mainly on Western or fusion dishes, it may seem peculiar that Syafiq has decided to focus on traditional Malay cuisine — specifically the well-loved dish of nasi lemak — for his latest F&B venture.The idea did not come from a mere whim, though. Syafiq told HungryGoWhere that the concept was born after he studied new trends in the market, especially among the younger generation and millennials.He found that “a good majority of them love a good plate of nasi lemak at any time of the day, be it breakfast, lunch or dinner”.To cater to this segment, he decided to start a cafe that sells this dish — albeit with a twist. He’s serving his nasi lemak with one-of-a-kind signature ikan bilis that he hopes is intriguing to their palate.Compared with the standard ikan bilis side dish, which comes with nuts, chilli and anchovies, Sembarang Nasi Lemak’s version comprises a variety of ingredients, such as tempeh, nuts, curry leaves and a splash of sweet soy sauce.\xa0Specially crafted by a family member from Indonesia, the signature ikan bilis promises richness in flavour and texture — a perfect side dish to the aromatic coconut rice and spicy sambal of the nasi lemak.As the time-pressed younger generation prefers fuss-free choices, he is rolling out five variations for greater convenience. These are the chicken cutlet (S$6), chicken wing ($5.50), fish fillet (S$5.50), selar fish (S$6) and Sembarang combo (S$7.50) sets. Each set comes with the signature ikan bilis, omelette, sambal and fresh cucumber slices. Customers can also add on available Padang dishes.Besides making tweaks to his food, he has also adopted a more youthful and modern shopfront, and plans on using social media to appeal to the segment.Though Sembarang Nasi Lemak is targeting youth, the cafe is an ode to the traditional food recipes from his family, too. For instance, Syafiq said the nasi lemak rice used by the cafe was based on his grandmother’s recipe.Typical nasi lemak rice is made by mixing coconut milk with water, along with pandan leaves. By contrast, the basmati rice used by Sembarang Nasi Lemak is cooked with a mixture of seven herbs and spices that are sauteed beforehand. Passed down through generations, this unique method enhances the aroma and locks in the flavours, so the rice is fragrant and flavourful.\xa0As Syafiq showcases his family’s version of the nasi lemak via the new cafe, he hopes it can preserve his family recipe, while generating fresh interest in this cuisine.“With the new generation becoming more experimental with their taste buds, Sembarang Nasi Lemak hopes to keep traditional Malay cuisine alive, while adding our own little spice and flair to make it a fresh, new and exciting experience for everyone,” added Syafiq.Book a ride to Sembarang Nasi Lemak.63B Lengkok Bahru, 01-362\nNearest MRT station: Redhill\nOpen: Monday to Saturday (8am to 7pm)63B Lengkok Bahru, 01-362\nNearest MRT station: Redhill\nOpen: Monday to Saturday (8am to 7pm)AuthorAzhar loves to connect with people through his work and stories.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/mondays/:['The premise of Mondays cafe is hard to place. Its social media accounts are of no help either, offering little by way of gastronomical philosophy and even less of the type of cuisine it serves.\xa0Perhaps we could attempt to gain some insight from its Instagram profile’s subtext — coffee, canele, brunch. We often don’t find these things spoken of in the same breath (except for coffee and brunch). I reckon placing caneles on such a pedestal means the folks there are serious about French pastry.\xa0Mondays (or “Mondays..” as it is known officially — yes, with two dots) is the third culinary endeavour of the team that brought us steakhouse and dessert bar Asap & Co and smokehouse-cafe Cherry & Oak.\xa0While the group’s first two brands focused squarely on smoked meats, Mondays looks poised to take on the area’s cafe-centric mise en scene.\xa0Here at Jalan Klapa, Mondays joins a bevy of casual-dining establishments in the area, such as Working Title, Tipo Gnocchi and Afterwit Bar de Burrito.\xa0There’s also famed cupcakery Fluff Bakery just around the bend and artisanal coffee joint Double Up Coffee directly opposite.\xa0To say that the competition at this Muslim-friendly locale is stiff would be understating the obvious. This isn’t the place for experimentation — this neighbourhood means business.\xa0Knowing that I’m due for a visit to Mondays, well-meaning friends with first-visit advantage shared concerns about the restaurant’s skillet fancy. Everything is served on a cast-iron skillet, hot dish or otherwise, they tell me, waiting for a reaction.\xa0“And the food isn’t cooked with the skillet, Zat. It’s just plated on it,” they added.\xa0Curious, I ordered the Corsican peach & burrata (S$23), a cold appetiser plated on an equally cold skillet. Here, a white, round Italian soft milky cheese is served alongside baked yellow peach Corsica, semi-dried tomatoes, crushed pecan nuts, and a bright balsamic berry dressing.As an appetiser, it’s the kind of thing a child could eat and be occupied for a minute or two. The caramelised peach helps bring out the overtures of sweetness that gel so well with the creaminess of the burrata.\xa0Still, I would have liked the whole thing even more, had the kitchen seasoned the burrata with a dash of salt and pepper.\xa0I’m also not a fan of the slice of sourdough that it comes with, untoasted and far too soft to play nice with the other things on the skillet. It should have been toasted to a crisp for a much-needed textural variation.Mains come by way of a miso Pacific cod (S$32) that I ordered to see if fish this delicate would stand up to culinary scrutiny. I’m happy to report it does. But for this price, it needed more. Much more.Thankfully, the thick steak of cod is elegantly marinated and gently cooked, such that it remains flaky and firm to the bite. It comes served on a room-temperature skillet with creamy and bright lemon-creamed leek. It was a bold accompaniment to the fish, though it almost veered on being too much for cod this delicate.This dish also comes with a slice of untoasted sourdough bread — wholly unnecessary and, by now, seemed like a culinary crutch, as if to say: “When in doubt, sourdough bread.”\xa0Some cold soba noodles served with a savoury soy sauce dipping would work better.\xa0I also got the spice spatchcock (S$19), which was more delicious than its less delicious-sounding menu description. There’s only so much a person can imagine with “spices marinated half spatchcock, baby carrot, cherry tomato, tzatziki sauce”.Still, the chicken was seasoned generously with bits of salt on the skin, which makes it such a delight. The tzatziki sauce that comes with it is also pleasantly tart and makes an excellent accompaniment to the richly spiced poultry.\xa0For dessert, I ordered the deconstructed tiramisu (S$9), much to the annoyance of my dining companion, who tells me she has exacting standards for the Italian classic. I got it simply because, well, it’s deconstructed. How very 2021.But my shady misgivings gave way to praise as I took a spoonful of this pleasantly plain dessert.\xa0This is the kind of dessert that works. The espresso in which the ladyfinger biscuits were dipped was bold. The mascarpone cheese was whipped till light, luscious and delicately sweet on the tongue. One could hardly complain.The wait for the caneles (S$4 for one) is unacceptable. We are told that it’s not yet ready when we arrive (with no promises it would be by the time we left) because it’s made fresh to order. Many places make food fresh to order — this is inexcusable.Perhaps sensing my annoyance, 45 minutes into the meal, a server swung by bearing good tidings. The caneles are ready and will be served in 10 minutes. “We make them fresh, so it needs time to cool,” she tells me, a little too hopeful.Ten minutes later, no caneles are in sight. “I’ll have the caneles now,” I tell another passing server. Perhaps they forgot that I ordered it, I reasoned.\xa0Still, no caneles.We decide to wait it out. There’s a poster outside the cafe telling patrons to break their caneles in half and dip them into coffee. “Caneles are better with coffee,” the restaurant declares. The French would protest.The coffee offerings here, for a place that prides itself on the beverage, is perfectly acceptable, though I’m not particularly a fan of the beans I had during my visit. Too sour and acidic for a smooth White.\xa0The pricing schematics are also peculiar. There’s a Black priced at S$4 for a hot cup and S$6 for an iced version. It’s the same with the hot White (S$5) and an iced White (S$7). A S$2 top-up for ice seems rather excessive in these austere times.\xa0And what of the caneles, you ask? After a good 25 more minutes, two plain caneles appear in all their dark, caramelised glory.\xa0They were decent — crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, as all good caneles should be. But were they worth the 35-minute wait? I highly doubt it. Is it conducive to conversation? Yes. Seats are well-spaced.Is a reservation necessary? Mondays doesn’t accept reservations.\xa0How to get there? It’s a short equidistant walk from Bugis or Lavender MRT stations.\xa0HungryGoWhere paid for its meal at this cafe for this review.\xa0Book a ride to Mondays.8 Jalan Klapa\nOpen: Tuesday to Friday (10am to 9pm), Saturday and Sunday (9am to 9pm)8 Jalan Klapa\nOpen: Tuesday to Friday (10am to 9pm), Saturday and Sunday (9am to 9pm)Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/annas-opens/:['A lovechild of the pandemic, sourdough loaves have enjoyed renewed interest among foodies since two years ago. None of us were spared from photos and videos on our social media feeds from friends growing their mother culture, giving it nicknames and treating it as part of the family.\xa0It’s not the naturally leavened bread’s first time in the limelight. Sourdough has long been a star in the healthy, slow food movement, and is purported to be healthier with an excellent source of antioxidants and prebiotics.While our love for the bread shows no signs of abating, the country’s infatuation with it has culminated in Anna’s, an F&B lifestyle concept that will open in Punggol on Saturday (Oct 22).So how, exactly, does this F&B lifestyle store based on sourdough work?Founder Anna Lim — who is also the co-founder of The Soup Spoon — says the store hopes to “engage with (the) growing community of diners” who are seeking a more holistic and healthier lifestyle.\xa0The space aims to provide an all-in-one experience for diners to eat well and learn more about the sourdough-making process and its benefits. It houses a cafe (where all dishes served will contain a sourdough element), a retail space and an open kitchen.\xa0Anna’s 78-seat outdoor patio is surrounded by lush greenery and hydroponic planters growing herbs and vegetables used in its menu. Here, diners can enjoy the morning breeze or admire the picturesque sunset.\xa0For those who prefer an air-conditioned environment, there’s also an indoor dining area that can hold up to 30 seating customers.\xa0At present, Anna’s is in the process of receiving its halal certification.If you visit Anna’s early in the morning, we’d recommend having the big breakfast (S$26). Fill your bellies with a hearty platter of Italian-style chicken sausages, housemade beans with sweet onion jam, crispy hash browns, cherry tomato confit, and a medley of mushrooms. Paired with Anna’s house sourdough, this classic breakfast is sure to keep you satiated until your next meal.\xa0The red sea prawn aglio olio (S$32) is a must-try for lunch or dinner. It comprises fresh red sea prawns, cherry tomatoes, tangy green chilli pesto and garlic confit tossed with housemade sourdough pasta. Unlike regular pasta, the sourdough pasta is lighter and much easier to digest.\xa0A spice lover’s dream, it’s topped with sourdough crackers, freshly grated parmesan cheese and a sprinkling of lemon zest. For small groups or peckish eaters, the vegetarian-friendly drips and drops diversity board (S$18) consists of mushroom parfait with smoked maple syrup, cultured butter, beets and miso hummus, along with six slices of Anna’s house sourdough, malted rye and flavoured sourdough of the day.The experience does not stop there for customers of Anna’s.\xa0After a nutritious meal, patrons can get up close to the slow-proofing room, where up to 800 loaves of sourdough can be viewed through a glass window as they mature. The dough is left to sit for 16 hours prior to baking.A retail section will also allow guests to buy their pick of ancient grains and dried botanicals, such as spelt berries and rye berries displayed in 12 huge grain silo dispensers from Germany.\xa0Those looking to learn more about prebiotics and baking with sourdough may also browse the array of recipe books on display — all from Lim’s personal collection. Should any of the books catch your eye, you are welcome to speak to the staff, who will pre-order the book on your behalf.Book a ride to Anna’s.Oasis Terraces, 01-04, 681 Punggol Drive\nNearest MRT station: Punggol\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (8.30am to 10pm)Oasis Terraces, 01-04, 681 Punggol Drive\nNearest MRT station: Punggol\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (8.30am to 10pm)AuthorAzhar loves to connect with people through his work and stories.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/good-chai-people-katong/:['Not being a coffee drinker comes with many disadvantages, especially if you’re looking to take on the brunch circuit. So I was pretty excited to try out Good Chai People, a Katong cafe that specialises in a beverage that’s mildly caffeinated, which I could partake in.\xa0Chai, meaning “tea” in Hindi, is black tea spiced typically with black peppercorns, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and ginger.\xa0There are up to 11 versions of chai found on the menu here, with sticky chai latte (chai sweetened with, in this case, coconut sugar) being the cafe’s signature drink.\xa0Aesthetically, Good Chai People has all the makings of the ’gram-conscious consumer’s latest haunt, with a striking coral-coloured doorway and fluted glass windows on either side. Large communal wooden tables, indoor plants, arched entryways and a long tiled counter make the cafe fit right in with the rapidly gentrifying Katong area.When my companion and I visited at 10am on a wet Thursday, I steeled myself for a queue of hungry brunchers. But it was, thankfully, peaceful.\xa0With only three other groups around when we were seated and jazz music playing over the speakers, it was a moment of tranquillity in which I could see myself hunkering down with a hot mug of chai, head buried in a good book.Opened by radio DJ Darren Wee in September, the cafe takes over Ampang Niang Tou Fu along East Coast Road. No stranger to the F&B industry, Wee intends to foster a sense of community with Good Chai People, including “host(ing) speakers and talks, with subjects related to wellness, health, environmental issues, etc”.\xa0In keeping with that spirit, the cafe shares its space with Nine Wicker Avenue, a candle store. Apart from vegan hand-poured soy candles, the boutique offers a selection of wellness products including skincare, crystals and essential oils.\xa0But, of course, the tea is the highlight at Singapore’s first chai specialty cafe. Concocting a milder iteration of Indian-style chai, its spiced black tea takes inspiration from its Australian counterpart, which is “less spicy (and) slightly less sweet”.\xa0To get the right balance — one that would satiate chai lovers and, at the same time, be palatable to those trying chai for the first time — Wee spent a considerable amount of time in R&D.\xa0He tasted more than 12 black teas from four suppliers to decide on the organic Sri Lankan orange pekoe-a (a grade of Ceylon tea) that the store uses. Its chai is also vegan-friendly, using plant-based milk — mostly oat milk — and coconut sugar.\xa0\xa0And it’s not just for black tea that Good Chai People goes to considerable lengths for. The other substitutes in the various types of chai are sourced with equal care. The organic green tea in the pink chai (S$8) comes from Jeju Island, a Unesco World Heritage site, and its hojicha in the hoji-chai latte (S$8) is made from premium kaga-boucha tea from Japan’s Ishikawa prefecture.\xa0All its tea suppliers also support the Ethical Tea Partnership, an industry-wide initiative that aims to improve sustainability in the tea industry.Although its chai is milder than I’d prefer, Good Chai People makes up for it with a moderate variety of options. Even an experienced chai drinker like me was tempted to try them all.\xa0Exercising much restraint, I chose three from the menu. The cafe’s signature sticky chai latte (S$7) was warm and milky, but surprisingly less sweet than the salted maple chai (S$6.50) — my favourite of the bunch.\xa0Mixed with Himalayan salt and drizzled with maple syrup, the salted maple chai was a delicious meeting of sweet and savoury. The tinge of salt accentuated the complexity of the spice blend and each sip of the tea was laced with the woody aroma and sweetness of maple syrup.\xa0The drinks come in a hot or cold option, but they’re mostly recommended to be drunk hot and freshly made.\xa0Only one chai is prepared cold — the triple citrus spiced chai (S$8), made with orange pekoe-a, pineapple juice, and orange and lime slices, then sweetened with coconut sugar. Served in a tall glass and metal straw, it reminded me of a non-fizzy kombucha.\xa0\xa0For food, we opted for the GCP bacon wrap roll (S$22), one of the four brunch items on the menu. While lacking in the looks department, the pockets of creamy scrambled eggs, herb cream cheese, streaky bacon and homemade chilli jam were enough to satiate the two of us. (The oat milk in the chai can fill you up fast.)\xa0Taste-wise, the eggs were done well, but nothing else stood out. All in all, the basic flavours and presentation didn’t seem enough to justify its price. For that amount, I’d expect at least a premium ingredient or two in the mix. And no, the few edible petals don’t count.\xa0To see how chai spices would translate in dishes, I also got the pumpkin salad (S$14). More generosity could have been afforded on the spice front with the chai lemon vinaigrette that, for all intents and purposes, was a tasty vinaigrette. Yet it did not taste like chai at all. There were also some glaring omissions between what was listed on the menu and what arrived on the plate. The vegan-friendly pumpkin salad was missing balls of burratina and couscous, and the baby corn wasn’t roasted.Another item, the fried baby corn (S$12), was shown to come with a sriracha mayo dip, which didn’t show up. Thankfully, the furikake-topped side dish was sufficiently flavoured.Like the pastries, Good Chai People’s cakes, muffins and tarts are all baked beforehand and kept in a glass display cabinet by the counter.\xa0Note that you’ll have to request in the comments box on the digital ordering page that you’d like your desserts to be served at the end of your meal.The lychee rose cake (S$9) was sitting a little too long in the fridge. When it arrived at our table, the layers of cream in between were too hard.\xa0It softened after five to 10 minutes in the open, but that was too much time to wait for a mediocre slice of cake that could do with a stronger rose fragrance and fresher bits of lychee.\xa0Is it conducive to conversation? Yes. The space is divided into various configurations, such as communal tables, window seats and sofa seats for small and larger groups.Is a reservation necessary? It should be fairly quiet on weekdays, but you might want to make a booking if you’re coming on a weekend in a bigger group.Takeaway recommendations? Absolutely take away the chai, and bring your own sippy cup.\xa0How to get there? There are three bus services from Kallang MRT station: 12, 32 and 13.Take note:\xa0\xa0HungryGoWhere paid for its meal at this cafe for this review.Good Chai People is on the GrabFood delivery service.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/forty-hands-cafe-closure/:['Forty Hands, a 12-year-old stalwart of Singapore’s cafe scene, will close its doors for good from Monday (Sept 12). Sunday is its last day of operations.\xa0In a social media post earlier this week, Forty Hands announced the impending closure of its Tiong Bahru and East Coast stores.It thanked its fans and regulars for their unwavering support and “the privilege of building countless friendships with many who have walked through our doors”.Its sister brand, Common Man Coffee Roasters, will continue operating its three Singapore stores at Joo Chiat, Stanley Road and Martin Road, as well as its Malaysia outpost in Kuala Lumpur.Little has been said of why Forty Hands is closing, and management and staff remained tight-lipped when approached by HungryGoWhere.\xa0In its post, however, the brand did hint that something was brewing in the future but remained cryptic: “If the future is made of the same stuff as the present, you may just find our next big brew shining in the distance.”At its East Coast store on Friday, there was little sign that its residence would soon be over.It was quiet and peaceful, but the premises filled up quickly during lunchtime despite the rain.A steady stream of takeaway orders, tidily packed in brown paper bags, crowded its display countertop awaiting collection.Despite the cafe’s impending closure, it’s business as usual for the Forty Hands team.\xa0Outlet manager John Chin, 26, remains upbeat and says staff members will transit to another brand under its parent group Spa Esprit.Spa Esprit manages F&B and lifestyle brands including Tiong Bahru Bakery, Tippling Club, Browhaus, and Strip.Chin, who has been a part of the team for the last three years, says: “It’s been a great team here and we’ve a great culture. We love working together and we definitely hope to be able to work together again in the future.”He adds that the crowd has certainly swelled in the last week since the announcement, with many fan favourites such as Big Boy Breakfast (S$27), kong bak pau (S$12) and grilled chicken avo toastie (S$21) selling out quickly.It’s the same picture at its main Tiong Bahru store along Yong Siak Street, says Chin.Jac Chua, a Forty Hands regular, laments the loss of her favourite stinky har cheong gai chicken waffles (S$20) — fermented prawn-paste fried chicken — which was unfortunately sold out at its eastside outlet by the time she arrived.\xa0“I used to make the trip down to their first outlet in Tiong Bahru,” the 35-year-old recalls fondly, adding that she eventually made the switch to visiting the East Coast store when it opened in 2018 out of convenience.\xa0Besides its delicious roasts, Forty Hands is best known for its Australian-inspired brunches and all-day breakfast meals.\xa0With cafe classics such as smashed avo on toast (S$21), crunchy dark chocolate granola (S$18) and broccolini and quinoa salad (S$20), it’s been a go-to for leisurely brunches and lunch dates among Singaporeans since its inception in 2010.I had the eggs benedict (S$21) with roasted, non-spicy potato wedges, bacon and sauteed spinach.\xa0The eggs were poached just right and oozed satisfyingly over lightly toasted brioche, mixing with the accompanying hollandaise for a delicious bite. For a heavier meal, go for the juicy steak option by topping up an extra S$2.I would advise arriving early to avoid the peak mealtime crowds — and to be sure you can get your hands on your favourites while they’re still in stock.40 Hands is on the GrabFood delivery service.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/grabfood-rider-heartbreak-melts-ice-cream-cafe/:['“I want to die rich,” Goh Yong Wei says candidly when I ask if he enjoys being an entrepreneur. Despite it being my first time speaking to him in person, the 30-year-old is warm.Notwithstanding his reply to my earlier question, making money isn’t the ultimate goal for Goh, co-founder of the Heartbreak Melts Ice Cream Cafe in Ang Mo Kio. The entrepreneur wears many hats: He has been a GrabFood delivery rider since September 2018 and is the president of the National Delivery Champions Association.The National Trades Union Congress founded the association in 2020 to represent delivery riders. It has more than 1,000 members. As a member of the founding team, he seeks to improve and roll out policies in Singapore relating to issues such as delivery rider insurance and safety training.A typical week for Goh sees him hustling between food deliveries, churning ice cream at his cafe and attending meetings with the association. He’s refreshingly honest about the cafe’s slow sales but remains positive about the future.Goh has a diverse portfolio of work experiences. His resume includes stints as a web developer at Amazing Borneo Tours in Malaysia, web editor at Singapore Press Holdings’ Chinese news division, as well as cameraman and editor at audio and video production studio Fluttersound.He also ran a printing business from 2014 to 2018 before poor sales forced him to shut it down.“I was young and naive. I partied, travelled and anyhow spent money, (and) never saved,” Goh recounts. It was then that he decided to take up food delivery.Asked why he turned to delivery, Goh says the vocation is appealing, given his love for riding motorcycles. It also allows him flexible working hours.Two years ago, he met with an accident that resulted in a broken right arm. The coronavirus pandemic also crippled the economy then, which only made things tougher.To busy himself during his recovery, he began making ice cream at home. With no professional culinary training, he turned to video-sharing website YouTube and put his recipes through a process of trial and error until he got them right.Through consistent effort, Goh became better at making the dessert and eventually started a home-based business selling ice cream via Instagram. As the business grew, he thought about opening a cafe with a theme that was personal to him: Heartbreak.Wanting to avoid the trappings of minimalistic, laidback cafes, he went in a completely different direction — one that reflected his love life and the rejections he endured.To help bring his business venture to fruition, he approached \u200b\u200bMabel Yee, a long-time friend whom he met more than 10 years ago.Yee, 29, agreed to become a partner.Heartbreak Melts Ice Cream Cafe was thus born. The vegan ice-cream store opened in the heart of Ang Mo Kio in February.Why vegan ice cream? Both co-founders are lactose-intolerant, so they wanted to create ice cream that everyone could enjoy.Upon entering the cafe, customers are greeted by an interior that’s replete with colourful furniture, soft toys, hashtagged phrases, and memes of Goh splashed across the walls and ceiling.For instance, I notice a giant teddy suspended from the ceiling. Yee chimes in to explain that it’s a not-so-subtle suggestion for what to do with soft toys from one’s exes.There are also memes of Goh arranged across the wall in a strategic fashion to form the word “idiot”, expressing how one might feel after the end of a relationship.Goh says fellow food delivery crew gifted him almost all the plush toys on display.“Practically all the soft toys are given by friends mostly working in food delivery. Some of them love playing with claw machines while waiting for orders or food to be ready. And they are just very good at playing,” he says.It’s apparent that the cafe is more than just a place selling ice cream, but somewhere Goh can express his thoughts and feelings, and share fond memories with customers.“In 2017 and 2018, I was struggling with my printing business. I felt lost and wasn’t mentally doing well. So I decided to delete all online materials that I had access to and wanted to start afresh. It was a good decision — to leave as much of my past behind, to have a clean start,” he says.I ask how he feels about the memes of himself being on display for everyone to see.He replies: “I like humour. It’s my coping mechanism.”Goh takes pride in the memes as they were his original ideas, and at one point, received quite a lot of views on sites such as 9GAG, Facebook and Reddit.He sees the cafe as his second chance as a business owner after his printing business flopped.“This is my second shot at doing business again. So these two years, if it works out, I’ll be very happy. If it doesn’t, Grab (food delivery) is still waiting for me,” Goh says.\xa0Goh’s involvement in the association began when he agreed to be part of the founding team. This was after a friend told him the other founding members felt he’d be a great addition.“At the end of the day, I enjoy helping people and felt that the delivery community needed a stronger voice,” he says.As a food delivery rider and president of the association, he’s familiar with the issues that fellow riders face. For example, delivery riders’ insurance is critical to their livelihood, given that they’re on the road most of the day.Some of the more important issues that the association addresses are the conduct of safety training for riders and reminders to practise defensive riding, which helps them avoid accidents. “Safety is more important than anything else because, at the end of the day, you want to go home safe,” says Goh.At his cafe, he offers free water to delivery riders who collect orders. Riders can also look for him at the cafe if they need help with work-related issues.I ask about his hopes — for both the cafe and the National Delivery Champions Association.“I want it (the cafe) to be profitable. I want it to be successful and I want it to be making me money because, at the end of the day, it’s a business. If this is successful, I can focus more on other things, other community projects. To be able to serve the community better, you’ve to be financially stable,” Goh replies.He adds that he hopes people will come to see food delivery as an essential industry. And with that, changes in societal infrastructure — such as parking for riders to make their jobs easier — will follow.While hurdles continue to stand in his way, he’s undeterred.It’s serendipitous that all the aspects of Goh’s life have come together at Heartbreak Melts Ice Cream Cafe. Ultimately, Goh says it’s important to “do whatever makes you happy”.\xa0Heartbreak Melts Ice Cream Cafe is on the GrabFood delivery service.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/boyutei-new-cafe/:['Boyutei is a highly anticipated collaboration between Hvala — a Japanese-style cafe famed for its specially curated matcha — and Whitegrass, a one Michelin-starred restaurant that presents classic French fare with a Japanese touch.As a contemporary French-Japanese cafe, Boyutei dishes up all-day brunch, desserts and tea.Hailing from Nara, Japan, Whitegrass head chef Takuya Yamashita is the brains behind the food menu at Boyutei. Meanwhile, the desserts and beverages are left in the capable hands of Hvala.Boyutei opened its doors officially on June 1. As reservations are not allowed, we recommend heading there early to snag a table for your midday break.The cafe resides in Ann Siang House, a restored heritage shophouse nestled on the outskirts of Chinatown.Despite its striking-blue facade, the interior design brings tranquillity to the dining space. The laidback yet understatedly stylish decor boasts comfortable chairs, wooden elements and pops of greenery throughout the cafe.The dining room of the cafe takes inspiration from the philosophical concept of yin and yang — about finding harmony and balance within oneself. The “white dining room” represents the light, warm side, while the darker side serves as a reminder to break away and loosen up.Boyutei offers the usual appetisers, such as soups and salads. The array of mains offered include Japanese sandos, rice and noodles. Its crepes, however, are the star of the show.The thin French-style crepes at Boyutei are laced with Japanese flavours in the form of savoury creations, such as unagi (S$26), prawn and chicken okonomiyaki (S$22), seafood mentaiko (S$22), and beef curry (S$24).A tie-up with Hvala means matcha is a must. The goma matcha crepe (S$14) is a soft crepe coated with an even spread of matcha pastry cream. A matcha lover’s dream come true, the crepe is further bolstered with freshly churned handmade matcha ice cream, crunchy goma (black sesame) crumble and a heavy-handed dusting of matcha powder.Various desserts are also up for grabs, including a sticky date pudding (S$17), a treacly indulgent toffee pudding complemented by miso butterscotch and Baileys ice cream.The name “boyutei” borrows influences from the Japanese kanji characters 忘忧亭, which means a pavilion where you can forget your sorrows.Like its name, Boyutei is a great hangout spot to break away from work or to catch up with friends, serving as a respite from the rush and heave of life.Keep your eyes peeled for a speakeasy bar — one we hope is coming sooner rather than later — that will be located in the basement of the cafe.\xa0Book a ride to Boyutei.28 Ann Siang Road, 01-02\nNearest MRT station: Telok Ayer\nOpen: Monday to Saturday (12pm to 10pm)28 Ann Siang Road, 01-02\nNearest MRT station: Telok Ayer\nOpen: Monday to Saturday (12pm to 10pm)Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/supernova-cafe/:['Supernova is one of those cafes where you already know you’re in for a good time from your first step inside.\xa0It might be the smell of pies and tarts wafting out from the refrigerated dessert display next to its entrance, or the orange back-lit shelf decked out in wines.\xa0Then there’s the charming decor that greets you — wooden counters topped with marblish stone, cosy banquette seating and old-fashioned chandeliers that somehow don’t look out of place.Combine that with solid food, genuine hospitality and “Kiss Me” from rock band Sixpence None The Richer streaming from the speakers, and you’ve a winning formula.This months-old spot is by the team behind Instagram-famous cafes such as Atlas Coffeehouse and Neptune, making this its sixth concept in Singapore. Incidentally, Neptune opened just last year a short distance away, along East Coast Road.While the group is known for recycling dishes across its outlets, we were pleased to find that this one is a bit of a steer away from its previous ventures — functioning as a cafe by day before morphing into a wine bar in the evening, complete with progressive sharing plates (crispy okonomiyaki, anyone?).A meal at Supernova will feel like a substantial event, not just because the food is filling, but because the prices are a tad higher than what we’re used to from the group’s other cafes.Yet it’s the kind of place that’s so easy to return to — figuratively, of course, since the queues can get rather long on weekends. Otherwise, it’s a fantastic addition to the Tanjong Katong stretch that we can totally get behind.\xa0Its brunch favourites include the fried chicken French toast (S$24.50), which we hear is the most-ordered dish to date. Think a thick, fluffy shokupan (Japanese milk bread) French toast with a crunchy layer of caramelised sugar, topped with a crispy piece of battered chicken leg and garlic butter.The whole shebang tasted more like Korean honey garlic chicken than we expected.\xa0Not that we’re complaining — it was delicious. As was the steak hash (S$26) — a pretty plate of sirloin with crispy potatoes ladled with herbaceous green sauce and two sunny side ups. The steak was well-cooked and the potatoes were crispy, but we wished the cubes were cut the same size for a more consistent bite.And boy, these folks have got their coffee down pat.\xa0Plump for filter, with six seasonal single origins that rotate from time to time.\xa0If you opt for an espresso-based drink, you can choose between two blends: Mr Cuddles (bold, comforting and nutty) and Mr Brightside (juicier and more acidic).\xa0We went with Mr Brightside for a magic (S$5.60) — milk poured over a double ristretto — and were floored by how expressive the beans were.\xa0If you like tea, there are some decent options, too.\xa0The photogenic iced tea with milkstache foam (S$8) showcases a pleasant jasmine oolong that’s faintly sweet and smoky. The slightly salty foam dissolves into the tea for a spectacular visual effect. Stir it in for a richer mouthfeel or drink it from the top down — it’s your choice.\xa0We hear their cold brew teas are also delicious.Booze-wise, there’s a selection of whites and reds by the glass. But we say go funkier with the team’s excellent curation of orange wines — whether it’s the Austrian skin-contact Meinklang Graupert Grauburgunder 2020 (S$88 a bottle) or cheekily named Obi Wine (S$84 a bottle) from wine producer Domaine Geschickt in the French region of Alsace.\xa0Supernova opens till 10pm most nights, making it an ideal spot for post-work dinner and drinks.Remember the desserts we mentioned before? These are not formally on the menu, so you’ll have to trudge your way to the front to see the day’s bakes.\xa0Dig your fork into the voluptuously stacked pistachio honey mascarpone cake (S$9.10), a slightly dense layered cake with honey mascarpone buttercream flecked with ground pistachios.\xa0Or the s’mores brownie pie (S$8), adorned with torched marshmallow meringue, bittersweet chocolate with a hint of salt, and a tight crumble base. We preferred this one, but then again, this reviewer has a bias for good chocolate.From the afternoon menu come the eggs in meurette (S$24), a classic Burgundian dish featuring poached eggs, red wine sauce and lardons (fatty bacon) that you’d be hard-pressed to find in many French restaurants here, let alone a trendy cafe.Supernova’s rendition isn’t half bad — if only the sauce was a little richer in dimension, rather than slightly sour.Is it conducive to conversation? For now, Supernova is bustling with activity at almost all hours of the day, so you might want to take your heart-to-heart talks elsewhere.Is a reservation necessary? Seats here fill up quickly and the restaurant does not take bookings for the time being. You know what you gotta do.How to get there? It’s situated towards the tail-end of Tanjong Katong Road, not far from East Coast Road. Take a bus down from Dakota or Paya Lebar MRT stations.Things to note:\xa0HungryGoWhere paid for its meal at this cafe for this review. Supernova is on the GrabFood delivery service.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/cafe-natsu-joo-chiat/:['It seems as though the face of Joo Chiat has changed almost overnight. It’s hard to keep up with the sheer number of new cafes and dining concepts that have sprouted up, with the likes of Tigerlily Patisserie, sando cafe Hello Arigato and Italian restaurant Forma. This latest wave of gentrification can feel all too overwhelming.Still, if you could mass-market hipster cafes, this would be it, a Joo Chiat resident tells me, somewhat cynically. Like it or not, Cafe Natsu is the latest sensation to sweep the Joo Chiat neighbourhood as well as social media.When we arrive at lunchtime on a Wednesday, Cafe Natsu is already packed to the brim with stylish and hungry patrons. Outside, a snaking queue has formed, but thankfully, we don’t have to wait too long to be seated.Our view at the high chairs by the windows overlooks the pastel-coloured Peranakan heritage shophouses along Koon Seng Road.Not that the scene indoors is any less appealing. With terracotta hues contrasted against soothing forest green with tiny bonsai on shelves, the interior is awash with natural light.Even a staff member can’t resist taking a video and does a walkthrough of the cafe with a smartphone.Opened on May 10, Cafe Natsu is a tie-up between the Ebb & Flow Group and chef Lewis Barker of the one-Michelin-starred restaurant Sommer. The team includes head chef Paul Chua, formerly from Fleurette restaurant, and his wife, head pastry chef Ang Wei Chan, who was with Micro Bakery.Its name Natsu, meaning “summer” in Japanese, alludes to the year-round sunny climate in Singapore. Serving Western brunch classics with Japanese flair, the cafe’s east-meets-west philosophy shines through in its menu as well as its decor.Inspired by the laidback vibes of Melbourne and the gentle elegance of Japanese establishments, the space seamlessly blends urban design and nature elements. Think textured walls that resemble the raked sand of Japanese Zen gardens and ceiling elements simulating the flow of water.Ah, the classic eggs benny. The staple brunch item takes the form of the mononym benedict (S$25) here. This power breakfast might induce a food coma, especially with a little too much hollandaise, but wins us over for its generous portioning.Of course, this is no average eggs benny. Delicately poached first-born eggs rest on toasted fluffy English muffins and are then covered in a thick yellow coat of miso hollandaise. You might have to put aside some of that sauce to taste the sansho-glazed ham and sauteed wasabi spinach underneath.Wash that down with a piccolo (S$5), brewed by Kohi Roastery and Coffee Bar next door, which comes in a pretty ridged cup. For this matcha lover, however, Natsu’s matcha latte (S$7) hit the spot with a smooth and creamy finish, and the barest hint of lingering sweetness.Since its sandos have been making the rounds of social media, we had to try them. Perhaps it was a different chef that day, but our egg mayo sando didn’t quite look like those we’d seen on the ’gram.For the uninitiated, the egg mayo sando (S$18) is a shokupan — Japanese milk bread — sandwich with egg mayo that’s seasoned with kanzuri (a paste made of chilli, koji and yuzu native to Niigata, Japan) peppered with crunchy spheres of tobiko. Its highlight: Two soft-boiled eggs with runny yolks.While it seemed simple enough, the sando lacked enough egg mayo that also, unfortunately, wasn’t flavourful enough and got overpowered by the tasty yuzu-kosho mayo that came with the side of fries.Our other main, a BBQ wagyu beef short rib bowl (S$26), seemed, on paper, to be a promising alternative to brunch food for those wanting something more filling.At such a price, we’d expected more out of the dish. The beef, no doubt of good quality, was well done, denying us the chance of enjoying the cut of meat at its full potential. On top of that, there was no accompanying sauce to pour over it, leaving us with a rather plain combination of rice and overcooked beef.For dessert, the much-raved-about kurozato mochi fried doughnuts (S$12) with housemade salted Hokkaido milk ice cream didn’t quite live up to the hype. The mochi doughnut balls were hard; even eating them with spoonfuls of ice cream didn’t help.Half-heartedly munching on the bland mochi balls, it made me wish I’d tried its other desserts instead. Still, I’m a sucker for pretty spaces and its beautifully plated dishes, so maybe I’d return to soak up the ambience over some tea and pastries once the hype dies down.\xa0Is it conducive to conversation? The cafe gets quite packed, so you have to chat above the din.Is a reservation necessary? Cafe Natsu accepts walk-ins only.Takeaway recommendations? If the mains are too much, the restaurant staff are happy to pack your meal in takeaway disposable packaging.How to get there? The thing about Joo Chiat is that it’s a little out of the way. From Kembangan MRT station, take bus service 33, which drops you off a five-minute-walk from the cafe.Things to note:HungryGoWhere paid for its meal at this cafe for this review.Book a ride to Cafe Natsu.283 Joo Chiat Road\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (8.30am to 5.30pm)283 Joo Chiat Road\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (8.30am to 5.30pm)AuthorEe Ming is a storyteller with a love of photography, insightful reads, films, and offbeat and obscure places.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/twg-tea-takeaway/:['TWG Tea’s new stable of takeaway teas — a first for the brand in 14 years — has been the talk of the town in recent weeks.\xa0The luxe gold cups and reusable glass straws have been making the rounds of social media, with tea lovers making a beeline for its Takashimaya store to get their hands on these pretty cups.\xa0TWG Tea was established in 2007 as a subsidiary of a Singaporean lifestyle company, The Wellness Group, from which — you guessed it — the abbreviation TWG was derived. Since then, it has served up its namesake brand of artisanal tea in luxury tea houses across the world.HungryGoWhere headed to its Takashimaya outlet, the only one that does takeaways in the gold cups, to see what all the rage is about.The teas come in posh, gold biodegradable cups in several varieties of carriers — single or double holders decorated with an illustration of a horse carriage or flowers.All the teas are made to order and brewed on the spot. It’s quite the sight to watch the smartly dressed staff brew and strain the tea behind the counter. While each cup of tea goes for S$8, TWG Tea is also running promotions for takeaways.\xa0They are: Tea and macarons for S$20, which includes a hot or iced tea and a box of six macarons, or tea and chocolates for S$22, which includes a hot or iced tea and a box of six chocolate bonbons.HungryGoWhere ordered two teas — eternal summer tea (cold) and 1837 black tea (hot) — and six macarons: 1837 black tea and blackcurrant; earl grey fortune and chocolate; napoleon tea and caramel; bain de rose tea; silver moon tea and strawberry; and number 12 tea and tiramisu.A popular choice, the eternal summer tea has refreshing floral, fruity and zesty notes that make it a great thirst quencher. Meanwhile, the 1837 black tea is TWG’s signature blend with a full aroma and smooth mouthfeel that’s easy on the palate.Hot teas come with sugar sticks, in the form of crystallised white-sugar popsicles, and those who get their beverages cold may ask for sugar syrup if they prefer their tea sweetened. Another TWG signature is its 1837 black tea and blackcurrant macaron, which has a subtle flavour, so that it doesn’t overpower the taste of the tea you’re meant to eat it with.\xa0The earl grey fortune and chocolate, and napoleon tea and caramel macarons weren’t overly sweet as caramel-flavoured pastries tend to lean that way.\xa0Other interesting flavours were the bain de rose tea macaron with an expected floral fragrance and surprising complexity. The silver moon tea and strawberry macaron’s ganache was too sweet, so much so that its strawberry flavour overpowered the more subtle tea-flavoured meringue shells.\xa0Our favourite was the number 12 tea and tiramisu macaron that had the right amount of sweetness complementing the slight bitterness of coffee. Fans of yuan yang and tiramisu will love this.There are a few things to note, though. Even though the gold cups are sturdier than your average fast-food chain takeaway and you might want to use them again at home, they are recommended for one-time use, according to the TWG staff.\xa0What you can reuse is the accompanying glass straw that comes with an order of cold teas.Overall, it’s great that TWG Tea’s offerings are available for takeaway.\xa0A TWG Tea staff member says the company plans to carry on its gold cup takeaways in the long run and offer it at its other stores if this trial is successful.\xa0Looking at how people are queuing for these cups, it’s likely that you won’t have to wait much longer until they’re offered at more outlets islandwide.Want to get your hands on this early TWG Tea release?

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/grab-foodie-awards-round-up/:['After a month of public voting, the first-ever Grab Foodie Awards has wrapped, with 34 eateries emerging as Singapore’s hot favourites.Tech company Grab launched the awards this year, with the hope of raising awareness and celebrating the hawkers, cafes and restaurants that helped to feed Singapore through the pandemic’s restrictions.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/ms-maria-mr-singh-singapore-gaggan-anand/:['At Ms Maria & Mr Singh, Mexican and Indian cuisine come together in an explosion of bold, innovative flavours and colour.The restaurant turns conventions on their head, and enjoys doing that, too.Just look to its menu — a curry dish served cold and raw, a carb-less fish taco, an avocado-rich guaca-chutney dip, and more.Singaporeans who are familiar with the highways and byways of Bangkok’s Sukhumvit will be no stranger to the restaurant’s progenitor — lauded chef Gaggan Anand.\xa0The opinionated chef is famed for his eponymous Bangkok restaurant that debuted on the Asia’s 50 Best list in 2021 at No 5, and also took home the Highest New Entry Award.This is his first permanent outpost in Singapore — he held a recent residency at the Mandala Club earlier this year — and Ms Maria & Mr Singh’s inaugural international foray.\xa0The casual restaurant now occupies the space formerly held by The Proper Concepts’ Mezcla bar.The irreverent, music-loving chef’s influences are clearly felt — the menu flows much like a greatest-hits album, with five chapters named after punny pop cultural references.Nonetheless, tweaks have been made to accommodate Singaporean palates, says Leong Sheen Jet, founder of The Proper Concepts, which collaborated with Gaggan to set Ms Maria & Mr Singh up here. Prices are kept accessible, while in keeping with the chef’s signature dishes and premium ingredients.Ms Maria & Mr Singh is a marriage of two cultures in more ways than one. The restaurant tells the tale of a fictitious couple — the titular characters — and their cross-cultural love story.The cosy, 40-seat space represents the duo’s residence, and is infused with touches from Ms Maria’s home Oaxaca, and Mr Singh’s native Jaipur. Diners are greeted at the door by taqueria-style neon signage, alongside richly tiled archways, rattan accents and traditional sarees draped over the bar.It embodies the spirit of “mi casa es su casa” — literally translated into “my home is also your home” — with its warmth, hospitality and family-style seating.Meals here are largely communal, so bring your friends and be ready to share.Each table is served a complimentary mixed chips with four dips — pickled mango, chilli cheese sauce, Guacachutney and pickled baby corn — to whet the appetite. These are highly addictive, but we’d advise reining it in for now.To start the meal, we recommend the cold curry ceviche (S$20) — cured Hokkaido scallops in a leche de tigre (Tiger’s milk) marinade, laced with the aforementioned Guacachutney.We also loved the Papdi Chaat (S$18 for four pieces), which sees Gaggan drawing on one of his extant signatures, the Yogurt Explosion — a chaat masala and yoghurt sphere. Here, the wobbly, thumb-sized sphere is nestled atop a disc of fried puri (unleavened flatbread) and paired with various chutneys and a liberal sprinkling of sev (a crunchy chickpea noodle snack).One of the headliners here is the Maria Singh Fish Tacos (S$18 for two pieces), comprising a barramundi fillet slice and a delicate layer of perilla leaf. Each taco — done in a different marinade — represents one half of the duo and their favourite ingredients.\xa0The Ms Maria & Mr Singh Shots (S$18), specially designed boozy companions for each taco, are an integral part of the dish. Mr Singh’s Shot is a riff on a Bloody Mary, with gin and Gaggan’s own blend of chaat masala thrown into the mix, while Ms Maria’s Shot features tequila, verdita, honey and lime.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50% off at picturesque date spots, including Wildseed Cafe at The Alkaff Mansion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGaggan fans will be pleased to know that his iconic Gaggan crab curry (S$32) is a mainstay on the menu, complete with sweet, glorious chunks of crabmeat.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/gusta-sourdough-pizza/:['It’s not often that you find an artisanal pizzeria in the heartlands. But neighbourhood joint or not, whether you’re guaranteed a sumptuous slice of pizza is dependent on many factors — from the crispiness of the crust to how fresh the ingredients are.\xa0\xa0For new entrant Gusta Sourdough Pizza Co, its chef-owner Sean Lai is hoping the location would be a moot point. Instead, he hopes his creations — the culmination of hours of research and development, meticulous experimentation and practice — will make the pizzeria stand out.It also doesn’t hurt that Gusta Sourdough Pizza Co, which opened on Sept 22, is conveniently nestled beneath an HDB flat on Serangoon Avenue 3, just a stone’s throw from Nex and Serangoon MRT station.Lai used to own an ice–cream cafe, Cottontail Creamery, at the same location. It served a variety of dishes, such as ice cream, waffles, pancakes and sourdough toast. It also offered —\xa0you guessed it — pizza.\xa0Lai said Cottontail Creamery served as a test kitchen for his food and beverage (F&B) projects, and was a space for the team to acquire new culinary skills.\xa0“At Gusta Sourdough Pizza Co, we have a firm belief in ‘practice makes perfect’,” he said. “By constantly improving on our craft, applying a high level of precision, and understanding the importance of good ingredients — even a casual pizzeria like ours can dish up delicious, well-executed and star-quality pizzas at affordable prices.”For now, the pizzeria opens only in the late afternoon. Lai, however, has plans to operate a different concept during the day — mainly a cosy daytime bakery that sells pastries and open-faced sandwiches.\xa0The pizza’s unique selling point lies in its proprietary pizza dough recipe — the result of countless tweaks to the flours, hydration levels and the type of salt.\xa0The dough, which is fermented naturally with a sourdough starter, is then left to slowly proof over 24 to 30 hours. The slow rise is what allows the base to develop a wonderful depth of flavour. When baked in a specially imported electric oven, it produces a fluffy and chewy base with just the right crisp.\xa0There are three categories of pizzas on its menu: Classic, premium and vegan.\xa0All of them are neo-Neapolitan–style pizzas, which means they resemble or take inspiration from Neapolitan pizzas that are subjected to precise parameters. They, however, incorporate flavours and ingredients that are outside of the strict Neapolitan tradition.At Gusta Sourdough Pizza Co, the pizzas are taken to new levels with the introduction of unique flavours, housed under its premium pizza category.The HungryGoWhere team tried the premium pizzas and were blown away by how innovative and delicious they were.\xa0We especially enjoyed the mala chicken (S$24.50) pizza, which comprised chicken, mozzarella, mala cream sauce, chilli oil and kale garnish. The minced chicken used was tender and juicy, while the housemade chilli oil — slow–cooked by its chefs and left to mature over five to six weeks — was fragrant and gave just the right amount of kick with every bite.The raclette cheese and potato pizza (S$26.50) was also a hit. It was especially rich, with every mouthful a decadent indulgence of creamy cheese and crisp roasted potatoes. We could not get enough of it! Though it sounds like it could be overwhelming, the light dust of paprika powder atop the pizza gave it a smoky addition and helped to cut through the richness of the cheese.\xa0\xa0The premium pizza category will include seasonal flavours as well. Lai said the team is already coming up with fresh ideas for a possible Chinese New Year menu, and is even toying with the idea of a lo hei (prosperity toss) pizza.Those who prefer classic offerings will not be disappointed. Familiar flavours include the margherita (S$20.50) and Hawaiian (S$23.5). We tried the Calabrese salami (S$22.50), which was slightly spicy owing to the addition of hot peppers in the salami. We recommend pairing this with the pizzeria’s housemade garlic-infused maple syrup — the refreshing sweetness elevated the otherwise–normal dish and helped to mellow out the strong flavours.There are also vegan options. The mushrooms and truffle oil (S$27.50) pizza was popular among the team for its nutty and earthy fragrance. If you’re feeling adventurous, opt for the kimchi (S$24.50) pizza that comes with vegan mozzarella, vegan kimchi, gochujang sauce, mushrooms, roasted seaweed, and a sprinkling of toasted white sesame seeds.\xa0Gusta Sourdough Pizza Co is planning on rolling out three-foot-long (about 0.9m) pizzas in a few months.\xa0Equivalent to the size of three-and-a-half pizzas, it’s a great option for sharing.\xa0You can choose from these flavours: Bufala ($13.50), pepperoni ($12.50), Italian sausage ($14.50), Hawaiian ($13.50), and ham and mushroom ($13.50). So look out for them!Gusta Sourdough Pizza Co is on the GrabFood delivery service.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/gyu-san-butchery-sando-shop/:['If you count yourself a wagyu fanatic, ready your taste buds for one of the most mouthwatering food concepts to open in southern Singapore. Gyu San is a Japanese dual F&B concept housing a butchery and sando shop. Opened on Aug 15, it joins the enclave of eateries in Tanjong Pagar.\xa0Chefs Tomoyuki Kiga and Linh Lam, who helm the sando shop and butchery respectively, boast an impressive resume with culinary experience from around the globe. They share the hope of introducing their customers to the beauty of different types and cuts of Japanese wagyu.Gyu San orders all its Japanese wagyu directly from various prefectures in Japan, and its butchery will offer seasonal cuts throughout the year.Gyu San’s sando shop in Tanjong Pagar offers a dining space that seats up to 25 people, with a cosy indoor section and an airy al fresco area.As the focus is on wagyu, the menu is unsurprisingly concise with only a handful of selections. The stars of the menu, the gyu katsu sandos, feature a wagyu katsu sandwiched between slices of lightly toasted shokupan (Japanese milk bread) with wasabi aioli.\xa0Unlike other wagyu sandos in town, the wagyu katsu at Gyu San is deep-fried in wagyu fat, procured from various breeds of wagyu — a perk of having an in-house butchery.The sandos are available in three cuts: House cut (S$32), striploin (S$48) and chateaubriand — filet mignon roast (S$62). Do note that the house cut will rotate, but the source of wagyu used — from Kamichiku Farm, a Japanese ranch where 78 per cent of its cattle are graded A4 and above — will remain unchanged.\xa0All of Gyu San’s sandos are made with Kamichiku’s Satsuma Gyu, the reigning champion of Japan’s Wagyu Olympics — making it the best Japanese wagyu in the world now. Its high marbling makes the wagyu extremely succulent and provides a satisfyingly fatty, luxurious mouthfeel.\xa0Apart from decadent wagyu sandos, you can enjoy some of chef Tomoyuki’s other creations, such as the tamagoyaki katsu sando — panko-fried steamed egg sandwich (S$18); ebi katsu sando — panko-fried shrimp sandwich (S$28); and fresh fruit sando (S$12).\xa0For sharing, the popular wagyu chips (S$8) is a must-have. It’s made from thinly sliced russet potatoes that are deep-fried in wagyu fat. For something lighter, get the A5 yakiniku salad (S$18).\xa0Gyu San makes every wagyu lover’s dream come true by offering the largest range of more than 55 premium Japanese wagyu cuts from different prefectures in Japan. These include less common cuts on the market, such as oyster blade and tri-tip. Every few months, the Gyu San team will bring in new varieties.Gyu San also offers saikoro steak, stew cuts, hamburger patties, and more for your cooking pleasure.For now, it has the following varieties on its menu: Kamichiku’s Satsuma Gyu 4% Miracle from Kagoshima (from S$21.90/100g), Kanzaki Gyu from Iwate (from S$26.90/100g), and Hida Gyu from Gifu (from S$36.90/100g).If you need help picking out appropriate cuts for your home recipes, speak to the friendly butchers to get their recommendation for your cooking needs.\xa0Book a ride to Gyu San.Guoco Tower, 01-03, 7 Wallich Street\nNearest MRT Station: Tanjong Pagar\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (11.30am to 9pm)Guoco Tower, 01-03, 7 Wallich Street\nNearest MRT Station: Tanjong Pagar\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (11.30am to 9pm)Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/review-lapin-telok-ayer/:['Perhaps it’s a happy coincidence that I’m reviewing Lapin the day after my much-needed break in Bangkok. After four days of frolicking in the city of angels, and with the authentic taste of Thailand still lingering at the tip of my tongue, I reckon I’m a good judge of what counts as authentic Thai food in Singapore.So believe me when I say at Lapin, authenticity and reverence for Thai cuisine are clearly a priority. That, along with impeccable service, quick food preparation and an electric atmosphere, makes dinner at the modern Thai eatery feel as though I were still in Bangkok.\xa0I didn’t chance on Lapin by sheer accident, nor was it through a cursory glance of my Instagram feed.Located in the Telok Ayer enclave, the restaurant is en route to my office on my once-a-week work-from-office day.At lunch, it roars to life as CBD office workers pour in to take refuge from the sweltering heat and partake in fishcakes and pad thai.It’s also not easy to find an online review for Lapin, which is perplexing. Still, if a new and modern Thai restaurant that opened in bustling Telok Ayer is enjoying all this patronage without so much as a peep from publications in Singapore, then it must be doing something right.And, as borders open and travel gathers pace, Lapin’s popularity is evidently not a case of scratching the travel bug, but a culinary dedication to great-tasting food that’s a joy to eat.\xa0As a lover of irony, I absolutely relish how scrappy the paper menu here is. Suitably stained with food and crumpled along the edges, it’s a veritable representation of the best that Bangkok has to offer in a setting that’s unfussy and highly convivial.We start with the sundried pork strips (S$19.90) that have been expertly seasoned, marinated and deep-fried. It’s bar snacks elevated, and at the price you’re paying, rather generous of a portion.Dip these into the jaew sauce, a bright and acidic accompaniment made with tamarind, fish sauce, lime juice, shallots, cilantro, chilli flakes, and toasted rice powder, that cuts through the delightfully fatty strips heroically.Elsewhere, the chicken knee (S$12.90) stands out, a menu option I’ve yet to see anywhere in Singapore. As its name suggests, this is the part of a chicken between the joints of the drumstick and thigh that’s made up of soft bones (or cartilage) and a smattering of chicken meat.And boy, did I thoroughly enjoy this. There’s texture in every bite, a comforting melange of soft meat, slightly crunchy cartilage, and light and flavourful batter that made me swoon. I’m not opposed to having this on the go in a bag as an easy snack to stave off those mid-afternoon munchies.For mains, you can’t go wrong with the Massaman beef curry (S$15.90). Swimming in a creamy and fragrant curry are generous chunks of impressive beef rump cubes so tender that everything gives way with such ease. It’s not spicy, at the very least, and the potatoes and carrots add a delicate sweetness to the whole presentation.There’s also a simply cooked round cabbage with dried shrimp (S$10.90) that’s value for money for the price and location. There’s expertise behind the stir-frying, as evidenced by the fat shreds of cabbage that still retain a satisfying crunch while absorbing the light seasoning they’re tossed in. And if you manage a bite of the dried shrimp, it will send you into a shock of umami goodness.Still, I would have liked a smidge more seasoning, but given Lapin’s dedication to authenticity, I’ve no difficulty believing that this dish is something that would look entirely at home by the sois of Silom.\xa0It’s rather unfortunate that my last, most memorable meal in Bangkok before flying home was the yellow crab curry, a dish I thought would be fun to try here at Lapin (S$18.90).At the risk of sounding ignorant, I acknowledge that different chefs interpret certain dishes differently. Still, I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t a tad disappointed that the yellow crab curry at Lapin was so remarkably different from the one I had at KubKao’ KubPla in Bangkok.Unlike its Thai counterpart, the yellow crab curry here is much too watery to be enjoyable and blatantly too spicy for the weak of heart. A heroic iteration needs to be creamier and silkier, and leaves a film of pleasure on the tongue. The curry itself is palatable and the crab chunks, while less generous, are flavourful with a great bite. It’s not bad, per se. Curry just deserves better.\xa0Is it conducive to conversation? Outside, yes. But inside, with jugs of beer being passed around, diners can get a tad rowdy.Is a reservation necessary? Definitely. It’s a small shop with limited seating, so make a reservation before heading there.How to get there? Lapin is a hop, skip and a jump from Telok Ayer MRT station. You can also alight at Tanjong Pagar MRT station, which would be a slightly longer walk.Take note:HungryGoWhere paid for its meal at this restaurant for this review.\xa0Book a ride to Lapin.\xa0173 Telok Ayer Street\nOpen: Monday to Saturday (11.30am to 10.30pm)173 Telok Ayer Street\nOpen: Monday to Saturday (11.30am to 10.30pm)Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/forma-singapore/:['A reservation at Forma seems to be the latest dining must-have. When I told a few friends I was swinging by for a weekday dinner, nearly all replied with an incredulous “you got a spot?”.Two months after it opened its doors in early May, the trattoria still manages to fill its seats months ahead. Last we checked, you’ll have to be put on a waitlist for a chance to get a slot from now till September.All the hype isn’t for naught. Handmade pasta by Lee Yum Hwa of Ben Fatto 95 fame is an immaculate work of edible art, and the restaurant’s glass-panelled pasta kitchen is its gallery.Even before our 6pm dining slot, there was a sizeable crowd outside. Some were waiting for their tables, while passers-by eagerly observed the masters at work.Forma is the meeting of the minds behind The Cicheti Group (which brought you Bar Cicheti and Wild Child Pizzette) and the hands from Ben Fatto 95, Lee’s private-dining one-man show. Lee previously trained with pasta makers in Italy.An all-local culinary team of chefs and pasta maestros runs the restaurant. Among them are Lee and his trainee sfoglina (female pasta maker) Denise Tsi of The Cicheti Group.Whipping up the dishes is executive chef Dylan Cheong, who has a strong background in Italian cuisine, including a stint at the three-Michelin-starred Osteria Francescana in Modena, Italy.Pasta is made fresh in the glass-encased workshop at the front of the restaurant. With the workshop facing the main road, diners and pedestrians can witness the traditional methods Lee and Tsi use, as they cut, roll and shape the Italian staple.Every season, expected to last a quarter of a year, Forma spotlights various pasta shapes and their culinary anthropology, delving into the historical elements and regional influences behind them.We hear the team is still working on the next season, which is expected to launch sometime in mid-August. So snag a seat quickly to try its new pasta dishes.\xa0We enjoyed the antipasti: Carciofi con stracciatella di formaggio (S$21) — tender braised baby artichokes with creamy stracciatella (a type of cheese) and tangy balsamic braised blackcurrants, pine nuts and mint salsa verde — and the polpette di baccala (S$21), moreish mouthfuls of fried salted cod balls with lemon aioli.Unsurprisingly, Forma delivers on its pasta programme. The opening season comprises seven types of handmade pasta that take you on a jaunt across Italy.The tortellini in brodo (S$34), one of Lee’s more distinctive creations, has a light taste profile, we were told. Minimalistic in presentation, it arrived in an underwhelming bowl of clear chicken soup.Resting at the bottom was a single layer of tiny tortellini, each a pocketful of mortadella di Bologna (Italian sausage), prosciutto crudo (dry-aged Italian ham) and parmigiano reggiano DOP (a type of cheese). Never mind their unremarkable appearance, these babies packed a flavourful punch.Post-dinner, we got to witness Lee methodically encase and seal each uniformly measured tortellini. Suffice to say, a great deal of work goes into putting 60g of pasta on a plate.The struncatura ammollicata (S$32) is a simple dish with a rich history. Known as the “poor man’s dish”, struncatura hails from the southern Italian city of Reggio Calabria and was made with the floor sweepings of wheat mills in the past.Wholemeal wheat and rye give it a darker tone and more bite than the average pasta. No, it wasn’t undercooked (yes, we asked). It’s tossed with anchovies, taggiasca olives, chilli, and sauteed breadcrumbs.Saving the best for last, we ended the meal with my favourite of the lot — the pappardelle e coda alla vaccinara (S$36), tossed in a braised oxtail ragu of tomato, pecorino romano DOP (another type of cheese) and red wine.Main courses aside, no Italian dinner is complete without dessert. We opted for the crostata al limone di Amalfi (S$16), an Amalfi lemon curd tart topped with a fruit tea jelly, with a side of whipped marshmallows.The little shoots of thyme didn’t contribute much taste-wise, but were great for the ’gram.Forma’s pasta portions are sized according to what you’d get in Italy, which is around 100g of pasta per person. On average, a pasta portion at Forma ranges from 60g to 100g.But even with Forma’s positioning as an upscale trattoria, as opposed to a ristorante, the price points for the various courses are a tad on the high end — especially given the fairly small portions it dishes out. So, if you’re looking for value for money, Forma isn’t it. (Free-flow still or sparkling water is a flat price of S$3 per person.)Expect to shell out nearly S$90 per person if you’re looking for a meal covering two antipasti, at least two pasta dishes (you’d be doing yourself a disservice to make it all the way there and order just one), one secondi, and a dessert, excluding wine or cocktails.Be warned: If you’re in the earlier seatings, you might be making supper plans when hunger strikes at 10pm.Is it conducive to conversation? Yes, but as the indoor area fills up, it may get noisy. So request outdoor seating if you prefer uninterrupted conversation. You’ll also get a nice view of the sunset at dinner if the weather’s clear.Is a reservation necessary? The restaurant releases slots a month or two in advance and they run out within hours. If you miss the reservation window, try your luck by walking in on Fridays and Saturdays for lunch, or get on Forma’s waitlist.Takeaway recommendations? The restaurant doesn’t offer takeaways at the moment.How to get there? It’s an 18-minute walk from Eunos MRT station. If you live in the east, you can also take bus service 33 from Bedok MRT station. Or, if you wish to skip the walking, book a ride from Eunos or Kembangan MRT stations.Things to note:\xa0HungryGoWhere paid for its meal at this restaurant for this review.\xa0Book a ride to Forma. 128 Tembeling Road\nOpen: Friday and Saturday (12pm to 2.30pm), Tuesday to Saturday (6pm to 10.30pm)128 Tembeling Road\nOpen: Friday and Saturday (12pm to 2.30pm), Tuesday to Saturday (6pm to 10.30pm)AuthorSarah is constantly seeking out new coffee spots and cocktail bars around the world, and should probably drink more water while at it.© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/aisyah-restaurant/:['Opened in April 2020 at the height of uncertainty, especially in the F&B world, Aisyah Restaurant stands out among the gaggle of successful Telok Ayer restaurants that cater to a higher-end audience.Not only does Aisyah Restaurant offer affordable Xinjiang cuisine, but it’s also Muslim-owned, which is welcome news for diners looking for halal food in the area.Perhaps it’s also a happy coincidence that Aisyah Restaurant is sandwiched between Thian Hock Keng Temple and Masjid Al-Abrar, suggesting a meeting of faiths and cultures at the intersection of food. And who doesn’t love a good intersection?\xa0For the uninitiated, Xinjiang is the largest autonomous region in China and is a melting pot of different ethnic groups, famously known for its central Asian leanings.It’s home to the Uighur ethnic minority, and the Hui and Dongxiang communities, which means that the food is predominantly halal. Xinjiang also sets itself apart from the rest of China by offering dishes that feature mutton front and centre — as opposed to other parts of China, where pork is more commonly consumed.Xinjiang’s diverse intersectionalities of cuisine are on display at Aisyah Restaurant, where the menu features some of the region’s favourites — braised mutton and big-plate chicken.The menu also offers dishes that make liberal use of seasonings such as cumin, chilli powder, cinnamon, garlic, and saffron, reflecting Xinjiang’s culinary influences from the Tibetans, Mongolians, Persians, and Turks.\xa0Unsurprisingly, the hand-pulled noodles took rightful place as one of the best iterations of this dish I’ve had thus far.On the evening of my visit, I had the braised mutton noodles (S$16.80) served in a bowl brimming to spilleth over, as the oft-quoted parlance goes. It was an immensely flavourful presentation of noodles — soft, springy and evidently hand-pulled — in a clear broth skimmed with an intoxicating slick of oil, red from the immersion and emulsion of mutton and chillies.There’s also a thick-cut daikon in this that lends suitable sweetness to an impressively savoury dish paired, though, with a miserly share of half a hard-boiled egg and a stalk of green — I could hardly protest generous portions of either.Still, the star of the show was undoubtedly the mutton ribs that were incredibly tender and, I’m glad to report, without any of the undue gaminess often associated with the meat and, for some, a dealbreaker. Put all those doubts aside, I assure you.The dry spicy beef noodles (S$15.80) come a close second, a bold blend of spice and sweetness that will make any spice-lover giddy with excitement. The treatment of sauce here also differs from the mutton noodles in that it’s made mainly with soya sauces and — I’m guessing — oyster sauce, so that it resembles something close to what you’ll get in wonton noodles. Still, if you’re spice-averse, the heat here will surprise you.I also liked the fried chicken dumpling (S$14.80 for eight pieces) mainly because it’s unapologetically fat and plump, but also because of the options it offers. You can choose from a filling of beef, mutton or chicken cooked in either spicy sauce (S$15.80) or soup (S$13.80), or fried, which I chose.\xa0Seduced by the promise of a mouthful of fragrant spices and an intoxicating wok hei (smoky aroma), I ordered the cumin prawn fried rice (S$12.80). Sadly, this plate was the perfect embodiment of why I have trust issues with fried rice.What it lacks in salt is further exacerbated by a cumin seasoning that does nothing to the fragrance and mouthfeel of the dish. I would go as far as to say it was bland, veering on tasteless.In an effort to include more vegetables in my diet in 2022, I also tried the kailan with money belly (S$15.80).It featured simply cooked and tender slices of tripe that were let down by a kailan stir-fry that tasted too healthy (read: bland) for what I imagined a solid stir-fry in its class should be. I suspect the eatery took away my beloved MSG for something solidly your-body-is-your-temple. Someone on a clean diet, I’m certain, would love this.Is it conducive to conversation? Aisyah Restaurant is a cosy joint, meaning everyone is near everybody else. Conviviality and conversation are most encouraged, I’m sure.Is a reservation necessary? Yes. Seats fill up pretty fast, so do make a reservation here.How to get there? The nearest MRT station is Telok Ayer, on the Downtown line.

We understand these dishes will eventually be available at their other stores islandwide.Order from the touchscreens near the entrance, or speak to any of the service staff — or Rangers, as they are referred to here — and take a seat overlooking Singapore’s northern waterfront.Natural lighting and scenic views are in abundance, with floor-to-ceiling glass windows lining the establishment.It’s family-friendly, too, with woodsy accents, artificial greenery and dinosaur models all around. Animal calls — or dinosaur calls, who knows? — and natural ambient sounds are also piped in at regular intervals, creating an atmosphere you won’t find amiss in any theme park or zoo.Contactless payments seem to be the norm here, but speak to any friendly Ranger, should you need to pay in cash.Do note that this is a casual-dining establishment. So while there is no surcharge for service, you are expected to collect your own food once it’s ready.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/tanglin-cookhouse/:['Singapore’s colonial days are well behind us, but there remain imprints of British colonial cuisine in the food scene — with dishes such as Hainanese pork chop being served in hawker centres and restaurants. If you’re wondering whether there’s more to colonial cuisine, Tanglin Cookhouse — a recent addition to Tanglin Mall — serves up an entire menu of elevated and contemporised dishes inspired by that era as well as popular present-day British food.The menu at Tanglin Cookhouse is a blend of colonial, Asian and British. You’ll find common British fare such as fish and chips, yorkshire pudding and scotch eggs, and Asian-inspired dishes such as its signature crispy Hainanese kurobuta pork chop, Indian butter chicken and lamb tikka masala.While the restaurant isn’t housed in a colonial bungalow, it tries to give you a feel of that, with vintage-inspired furnishing, walls in a retro emerald-green shade, rattan seats and leather-bound menus.It’s a place you can stroll into for brunch with the family, a high tea with the girlfriends, or even a tipple with your pals with its extensive alcohol and cocktail menu. We hear there’s also a one-for-one deal on gin and tonic on weekdays from 5.30pm to 7.30pm.For the late risers, good news — Tanglin Cookhouse’s brunch menu is served daily till 3pm.So you can laze in a little and still get to try brunch items such as its spicy fried chicken and waffle (S$21.90) and Welsh rarebit with espresso bacon jam (S$17.90) — a British dish of brioche toast with egg, bechamel sauce (a milky white sauce), triple cheese and espresso bacon jam.We were there for lunch on a weekday and had a go at some of its Asian-inspired signatures, such as the smoked haddock kedgeree (S$24.90), made with turmeric basmati rice, topped with smoked haddock and vegetables and doused with a sweet-and-sour tomato chutney, and the crispy Hainanese kurobuta pork chop (S$27.90) served with thick potato wedges and an oriental tomato sauce.Some pork chop dishes have a reputation for being too dry or tough, but here, the use of kurobuta pork meant the dish was juicy and tender, albeit high in fat.Another item that caught our eye was the mulligatawny soup (S$9.90), a British-Indian curry soup typically made with lentils, carrots and other assorted vegetables. The mildly spicy and sweet soup packed an exceedingly flavourful punch at first, though pairing it with the accompanying charcoal youtiao helped give it the balance it needed.If you have space for dessert, check out the gula melaka sago pudding (S$12). Unlike most other sago afters, where the sago is served in a soupy dessert, Tanglin Cookhouse’s version is a dense pudding served alongside gula melaka syrup and coconut cream.Tanglin Cookhouse’s menu has its share of inventive dishes and safe options (including pasta), so there’s likely something for everyone.If you or your dining companions have never given colonial cuisine a shot, we’d recommend getting a mix of Asian-inspired and Western mains as well as dessert (of course!) for an all-rounded meal.Tanglin Cookhouse is on the GrabFood delivery service.

Serving up authentic and homely northeastern Thai cuisine since 1994, it’s a small family of restaurants originally set up by Madam Achara (or Neng, as she is known to regulars).She started from humble beginnings at a hawker stall named Neng’s Kitchen at Farrer Road Market, selling simple Thai dishes such as beef noodles.Today, across the outlets, you will still find the same delicious home-style Thai food prepared by native Thai chefs, hand-picked and trained by Neng herself.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/hue-modern-thai-restaurant/:['Hipster Jalan Besar teems with third-wave coffee shops, cafes and restaurants. Against this busy backdrop stands Hue, a fairly new addition to the cafe stretch of Tyrwhitt Road.A passion project of seven friends — a mixture of Thai nationals, a chef, interior designers and a financial controller aged between 28 and 40, who all enjoy visiting Instagram-worthy eateries — the restaurant is easy on the eyes and incorporates some elements of Thai culture.Pattiya Ariyasakul, one of Hue’s owners, says: “There was a lack of nice and cool Thai food places with great ambience and food, and we took this opportunity to inject vibrancy and creativity to the Thai food scene in Singapore.”The first thing you’ll notice is its blue facade that stands in stark contrast to the neighbouring buildings. It’s meant to resemble a waterfall — a reference to water being the symbol of life in Thai culture.Upon entering the restaurant, you’ll see a neon sign that reads “The Hunger is Real” — a clever way of conveying its brand name. Hue means hungry in Thai.It also depicts the English meaning of “hue” — a colour or shade — by way of coloured light illuminating the sleek bar counter. Changing daily, it is inspired by the Thai custom of assigning a lucky colour to a different day of the week to receive blessings from god. The rest of the restaurant is designed with archways to mimic a cave.Leading the kitchen is chef Neo Jun Hao, who takes inspiration from the royal Thai recipe book. Using a variety of modern techniques, the 28-year-old translates comforting flavours into contemporary dishes that even those unfamiliar with Thai food can appreciate.All diners start with a complimentary dish called Melon First. Served in bite-sized pieces, cubes of watermelon brined with salted fish are topped with fried shallots and a sprinkle of sugar, reminiscent of the sweet and savoury way Thais enjoy their fruit.We sampled a variety of dishes such as Three Little Pigs (S$19), oven-roasted crispy pork belly stir-fried with three herbs and spices used in Thai cooking: Garlic, coriander and white pepper. Although covered in the green paste, the taste of coriander wasn’t overpowering.For soup, there’s Not a Tom Yum (S$19), a Hue original hot-and-spicy prawn broth that’s meant to be a tongue-in-cheek dig at the ubiquitous spicy soup offered at most Thai restaurants here. (No, Hue does not have tom yum on the menu.) It comes with grilled prawns and large chunks of deep-fried omelette.Hue’s take on the popular kor moo yang (grilled pork neck) is a delicious, lightly charred fatty pork collar with a sweet glaze, resting on a bed of sticky glutinous rice. The Moocano (S$23) comes with a spicy sour sauce that cuts through all the flavours perfectly and a dark-brown sweet sauce, which we advise against drizzling over the meat. Use it sparingly as a dip.Hue has also put a new spin on a classic dessert with the Tea-ramisu (S$14). Instead of an espresso shot, the sponge fingers are saturated with Thai milk tea.More tea powder is sprinkled over the large cloud of mascarpone, while the chocolate tuiles lend the dish a slight bitterness to offset the sweetness.If you are feeling a little more adventurous, give Hue’s Ong Lai (S$15) a go.The deconstructed pineapple tart is presented as a foolproof combination of a slightly charred pineapple ring atop a layer of crumbly pastry and a side of gula melaka (palm sugar) syrup.Pour the syrup into the centre of the ring, then take a scoop of everything, including the Thai chilli vanilla ice cream, to get all the flavours in one bite.Although the fare here is pricier than your average no-frills Thai eatery, Hue is a place you can check out for a special treat. There are plenty of corners to pose for photos and all its dishes are plated up for the camera, too.Most important, the restaurant has not compromised on flavour in favour of looking pretty, as some of its contemporaries do. This is one ‘gram-approved joint where you can be satisfied with the grub.Hue is on the GrabFood delivery service.

The tunes are played by local veterans with live bands playing from Wednesday to Friday, and DJs spinning on Friday and Saturday.Look forward to good drinks here, too, as J Bar is tended by a knowledgeable bartending duo Robert and Princess. The happy hour here runs from 4pm to 8pm for those looking for an affordable option.Additionally, look out for seasonal promotions with the current one being Oktoberfest till Oct 31. Aside from the obligatory pint of Erdinger (S$13++), food options include the Oktoberfest carnivore platter — crispy German pork knuckles, veal and chicken bratwurst, Thuringer snail sausage, premium Angus beef sirloin, sauerkraut and potatoes (S$58.80++).\xa040C Harding Road, Level 3\nNearest MRT station: Farrer Road\nOpen: Monday to Thursday (3pm to 12am), Friday and Saturday (3pm to 1am)Opened by long-time jazz pianist Peter Ng (aka Mr P), Maduro is an unconventional, classy bar that’s filled with curated works of art, music, food and drinks.Situated away from the main blocks at Dempsey Hill, it turns into a buzzy jazz music bar by night featuring a rotating line-up of Singapore’s top jazz acts across the generations.Inspired by the many cigar bar deals Mr P closed in the UK, Maduro also has a by-invitation-only private den in the back that’s open only to those in the know.Its cocktail bar offers tipples as eclectic and quirky as the music, such as the kopitiam gentleman — rye whiskey, charsiu reduction, gula melaka, orange bitters and bak kwa (S$25++), and pina-play — rum, spiced pineapple honey, ghost pepper and citrus medley (S$23++).The kitchen dishes out French-inspired home-style cuisine that’s easy to snack on, allowing most of the attention to go to the live performances in front of you.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/closure-of-fosters-steakhouse/:['After more than six decades of serving traditional English dishes with a twist, Fosters Steakhouse is closing its doors for good on Oct 26.Announcing this in a Facebook post on Aug 23, it thanked its customers for their support over the years and said it would hold a farewell party on Oct 25, from 5pm to 10pm.Having been around since 1960, Fosters Steakhouse has a long history that few F&B establishments can boast about. Media reports have said it’s the only steakhouse with Hainanese influences that’s still standing today.Originally located at the now-demolished Amber Mansion along Orchard Road, Fosters Steakhouse stands out among the hip cafes in the trendy Holland Village neighbourhood with its classical charm and cosy interior. The space is optimised to fit large groups, with tables big enough to seat groups of eight.\xa0\xa0It’s evident that the steakhouse has built a reputation for being a go-to spot for gatherings. Since its announcement, patrons have flocked to the comments section to share special memories of the place and bemoan its impending closure.\xa0For some, Fosters is a place offering great value and quality.Jewellery retailer Mary Ng, 65, says she’s been a patron of the steakhouse even before it relocated from Orchard Road. The reasonable prices, good-quality steak and aesthetic presentation are the main reasons she comes back yearly for birthday celebrations and catch-ups with friends.\xa0For others, it’s a place that holds precious memories and has sentimental value.\xa0IT consultant Jeannette James, 40, had her first taste of scones there.“As a young 10-year-old who had never stepped outside of Singapore, eating a scone with cream and jam felt like a luxury,” she says. “It was… a special treat when I was a child and I cherish the memories of my mum and I doing that.”\xa0For community manager Pamela Lam, 29, the restaurant was where her parents held their silver wedding anniversary party and where her date (now-husband) asked her to be his girlfriend. Upon hearing about the steakhouse’s forthcoming closure, the family made a reservation to attend its farewell party.\xa0Among the more popular menu items are its set lunch (from S$20.90+) and set dinner (from S$44+). Both feature soup (or a choice of an appetiser for the dinner set), a main course, a drink, and a dessert.\xa0While HungryGoWhere was there this week, we ordered the set lunch, picking the tenderloin steak as our main course.\xa0The steak was served medium-rare on a bed of mashed potatoes and vegetables. It was tender and juicy, with just the right amount of chewiness. Though good on its own, the steak can also be enjoyed with a rich chestnut sauce that’s incredibly savoury.\xa0Fosters Steakhouse is a space with a homey atmosphere that’s a rarity these days. While walk-ins are welcome until Oct 26, you’re encouraged to reserve a table or visit during non-peak hours to avoid disappointment.\xa0Fosters Steakhouse is on the GrabFood delivery service.

We reckon it’s the gratification of doing our bit for charity, however small the gesture. From now until Sept 20, Make-A-Wish Singapore is partnering 25 cafes and restaurants — among them notable names such as Tiong Bahru Bakery, Tipo Pizzeria e Trattoria and Wooloomooloo Steakhouse — for its “Wish Dish” initiative.A portion of the proceeds made from featured Wish Dishes at participating eateries will go towards raising S$50,000, in hopes of granting the wishes of children with critical illness. Participating eateries have pledged to donate up to 50 per cent of their proceeds from the dishes to the initiative.Since its inception in 2002, Make-A-Wish Singapore has granted close to 1,800 wishes.This is Make-A-Wish Singapore’s first partnership with Singapore eateries since 2013. Dr Jeremy Lin, Make-A-Wish Singapore’s chairman, said: “We are grateful for businesses with a heart that are committed to supporting us to grant more wishes for our children.”\xa0The Wish Dish campaign involves a list of popular eateries that serve a variety of cuisines, such as Korean, Chinese, Indian and Western. Diners can order the eatery’s selected menu items as usual and a percentage of the dish’s sales will go towards the cause.One of the more interesting Wish Dishes you can try is the Oatside kaya toast latte from Open Farm Community in Dempsey. It’s a coconut and pandan-flavoured drink that combines oat milk, coffee and sourdough crumble, and 10 per cent of the proceeds from the sale of the drink will go to the campaign. At Spring Court, one of Singapore’s oldest restaurants, order its signature crispy roast duck to contribute to the initiative (20 per cent of the proceeds will be donated).If you’re dining in a bigger group, you can look to The Great Mischief’s signature paella pans, which feature saffron-flavoured rice with chicken or seafood.Find the full list of participating eateries with their respective Wish Dishes below.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0All the places on this list, except Spring Court Restaurant and Wooloomooloo, are on the GrabFood delivery service.

Owing to space constraints, waffles and brownies are off the menu, but get a brioche bun (exclusive to the store) instead for your very own ice-cream sandwich.There’s a smaller selection compared with its flagship store, but you can still beat the heat with 18 rotating flavours, including its bestselling blue milk (milk, blue-pea flower and salt), apiary (honey ice-cream with cacao nibs), and Sicilian pistachio.What to order: Blue milk single scoop (S$4.20), Sicilian pistachio single scoop (S$5)\xa0148 Potong Pasir Avenue 1, 01-53\nNearest MRT station: Potong Pasir\nOpen: Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and Sunday (10am to 6pm); Friday and Saturday (10am to 9pm)Soak up the sunshine vibes at Rise, a bakehouse under a Potong Pasir HDB block that’s decked out in soothing blush tones and Scandic interiors.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/local-artisanal-chocolate/:['Chocolate is closely associated with various festive holidays and special occasions such as Valentine’s Day, Easter, Halloween, and Christmas.Rich and decadent, the confection is undoubtedly deserving of its own celebration on World Chocolate Day on July 7.Regardless, you don’t have to wait for a reason to treat yourself to the offerings from any of these four local artisanal chocolate brands.\xa023 Sin Ming Road, 01-15\nNearest MRT station: Upper Thomson\nOpen: Tuesday to Friday (11am to 7pm), Saturday and Sunday (10am to 7pm)Jerome Penafort, founder of Mr Bucket Chocolaterie, had his nose buried in the popular Roald Dahl book Charlie and the Chocolate Factory growing up.The 35-year-old later named his chocolaterie after Charlie Bucket, the main character in the story. There may not be any golden tickets or chocolate rivers to be found here, but the fresh handmade chocolate bonbons are certainly drawing a crowd.The popular chocolaterie was launched in November 2020 and has since won over chocolate snobs from across the island.Penafort believes that “chocolate produced from Asian cacao is just as, or even more, delicious than those from other parts of the world”.It’s no surprise then that the focus here is on sustainably sourced cacao farms in Asia. The founder said that there was a need to bring attention to these farmers who have gone unnoticed and unappreciated.The small team at Mr Bucket Chocolaterie is affectionately called “a bunch of Oompa-Loompas”, the fictional workers in Willy Wonka’s Chocolate Factory. Catch a glimpse of them in the open kitchen — a chocolate factory of sorts — working their magic in creating delectable chocolate treats.The drive to push the boundaries of chocolate has birthed unique flavour pairings, such as Mala Mild Spicy (S$22 for a box of six). Made using 72 per cent dark chocolate from Sungai Ruan, Malaysia, the savoury bonbon has hints of aromatic mala spice derived from a special spice mix from mala eatery Hao Zhang Ji.A visit to this boutique chocolaterie is fodder for both the eyes and the stomach.\xa0Tanglin Mall, 02-K4, 163 Tanglin Road\nNearest MRT station: Orchard\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (10am to 6pm)An accountant-turned-chocolatier, Anjalichocolat founder Anjali Gupta left the corporate world in an effort to pursue her passion for chocolate.Spurred by an Ecole Chocolat course while living in Istanbul, the 58-year-old fell into the world of chocolate-making. Before diving into the chocolate business, she continued honing her craft by undergoing further training in a culinary school in Istanbul and the Callebaut Chocolate Academy in the UK.With the help of her daughter who designed its logo, Anjalichocolat opened its doors in 2013.“I believe in offering something that is unique and memorable to my clientele,” Gupta tells HungryGoWhere. This comes through in the attention to detail, such as her choice of chocolate flavour pairings and handmade box embellishments.Anjalichocolat’s focus is to deliver indulgent European-style chocolates. Belgian couverture, fresh cream, butter, fruit puree, whole spices, coffee, teas, nuts, and dried fruit are used to create its treats.After perfecting the classics, Gupta launched a creative range called From Singapore Lah (S$15 for a box of four). Named after a ubiquitous colloquial term, this collection comprises chocolates infused with familiar Singaporean flavours.It has 15 flavours, such as teh tarik, kaya toast, Chinese 5 spice, and gula melaka. One of its bestsellers, teh tarik, features a milk chocolate shell encasing a creamy milk chocolate ganache infused with a local tea brand. Toasted tea leaves are sprinkled on top — intensifying the flavour while providing a crunch.\xa0232 South Bridge Road\nNearest MRT station: Chinatown\nOpen: Sunday to Thursday (10am to 7.30pm), Friday and Saturday (10am to 9.30pm)Chocolate has no doubt received some bad press because of its high sugar and fat content. A guilty indulgence, it’s usually categorised in the same family as candies and sweet treats.\xa0Enter Chocoelf, a homegrown brand seeking to change that perception with healthier chocolate options. A tie-up between a doctor and a chocolatier, the duo believe that “no sugar is better than sugar-ed”. Founders Joe Lee and Josephine Lee then set out to create delicious guilt-free nibbles using little or no sugar, for the health of their consumers. A combination of sugar substitutes (stevia, erythritol and maltitol) is used instead to achieve the best results in terms of taste and texture.Armed with their dream to share unique Singapore-style chocolates with the world, the founders created a range of artisanal chocolates and confections that are boldly infused with Asian ingredients.Crafted in Singapore, their bestselling signatures include kaya pandan.Popular among Singaporeans and tourists, Chocoelf can be found in shops such as department stores, health stores and various tourist landmarks. You may also pop into its chocolate cafe for a taste.\xa0Order from: www.fossachocolate.com/shopConceived by a group of three friends — Yilina Leong, Charis Chia and Jay Chua — award-winning chocolate brand Fossa Chocolate had a humble start.The trio, aged between 27 and 34, started by experimenting with chocolate at home. They peeled everything by hand and used their home oven to roast cacao beans.Their beginnings, however, go back a little further when the three founders were fascinated by a single-origin chocolate bar from abroad. Despite having only two ingredients — cocoa beans and sugar — the taste of raspberries and almonds was astounding.Unable to find chocolates made with high-quality cacao beans in Singapore, the trio set up shop in 2017.Among the pioneers of single-origin chocolate and bean-to-bar chocolate in Singapore, Fossa Chocolate produces fine chocolate from scratch.It uses sustainably sourced cacao beans with a focus on bringing forth the unique flavours that different cacao origins offer. Each bar is a product of a time-consuming process — roasting, grinding and tempering the beans in small batches, before finishing them in hand-packaged chocolate bars.Not shying away from adventure, Fossa Chocolate also partnered homegrown brand Pekoe & Imp to create Honey Orchid Dancong Oolong Tea Chocolate. The chocolate — with hints of floral fragrance, layered with notes of guava and cream — took home a silver award at the 2019 International Chocolate Awards.Fossa Chocolate has also put Singapore on the map with a presence in Malaysia, Hong Kong, United States, France, and Germany.\xa0Mr Bucket Chocolaterie and Chocoelf are on GrabMart.

It’s also peppered with some of the quaintest hole-in-the-wall cafes.These cafes in central Singapore are found in the unlikeliest of places and are great for weekend post-activity refuelling or a chill brunch.716 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 6, 01-4030\nNearest MRT station: Ang Mo Kio\nOpen: Daily (9am to 6pm)Occupying a small space at the foot of a public housing block, this Kinfolk-inspired cafe quietly states its presence at the void deck with practical wooden furniture, a few potted plants and a menu printed on its adjacent walls.Brew & Co started with an aim to make good coffee accessible to those living around the neighbourhood. It uses coffee beans from Singapore roasters.To add to its aesthetic appeal, the cafe also serves its iced coffee in sippy plastic cups that resemble a crossover between Starbucks’ takeaway cups and those you’d get from bubble tea chains.Bear in mind, though, that the cafe’s pretty small, so go early and hope for the best. Or you could get your order to go and occupy one of the public benches or seats nearby if you can’t wait to dig into your food and coffee!What to order: Orange espresso (S$6) and raisin swirl (S$5.50)\xa0183 Upper Thomson Road, 01-02\nNearest MRT station: Marymount\nOpen: Monday and Tuesday, and Thursday and Friday (8am to 4pm); Saturday and Sunday (6am to 4pm)Located along a stretch of popular cafes on Upper Thomson Road, State of Affairs is a new entrant at 183 Longhaus, a mixed-development apartment complex. Blending in with the building’s dark exterior, the industrial-themed cafe is even trickier to find without a signboard.We love that the cafe opens at 6am on weekends — perfect for early risers and those looking to get a caffeine hit before a run, cycle or hike.Despite being the new kid on the block, the cafe is helmed by a top-drawer barista. Resident barista Fahmi Zailani was a finalist in the Barista of the Year category at the World Gourmet Awards 2022.

That’s because it’s housed in the sprawling ITE College Central, by the swimming pool.Catering to students, the prices are low here, there’s a wide range of food, drink and dessert options, and everything is made in-house. Yes, you read it right — everything including its bestselling cream cheese garlic bread.You don’t need to be an alumnus to visit Boon Cafe. But note that members of the public will have to pay an extra 50 cents (only for food items), which is a small price to pay, given that none of the menu items are above S$10.What to order: Cream cheese garlic bread (S$3), iced dirty matcha latte (S$5.50)\xa0730 Upper Serangoon Road, 01-01\nNearest MRT station: Serangoon\nOpen: Tuesday to Friday (10am to 5pm); Saturday and Sunday (10am to 6pm)I found out about Amber Ember on the ‘gram.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/revival-bar/:['There’s not much you can find about Revival on the internet.\xa0Opened earlier this year, the cocktail bar has popped up where you’d least expect it — a residential building in the Robertson Quay district.\xa0Taking up a sort of curved space, most of the action happens on the ground floor (The Main Room), where soft pastel-coloured booths and teal counter seats face a high-ceilinged bar.\xa0The interior is fitted with glitzy art deco furnishings, including carpeted stairs leading to two smaller booths (The Sanctuary) and a “confession booth” for one on the second storey.\xa0The bar’s named after revival art (art styles inspired by classic art movements) and its cocktails take after famous paintings by the late French artist Claude Monet and Spanish painter Picasso.\xa0For big groups, four punch-bowl-style mixes are available in 1L and 2L formats.\xa0There is, however, nothing pretentious about the warm service offered. So don’t be shy to get the bartenders to explain the somewhat complex tipples on the menu.When the sun goes down, move out to the al fresco area (The Garden) for even more privacy, as we did during our visit on a weeknight. Far removed from the flurry of activity across the road, it proved to be a great spot for people-watching.\xa0Opened by Celia Schoonraad, Michael Callahan and Roman Foltan from The Compound Collective — the same people behind swanky cocktail bar Barbary Coast — Revival sure looks the part of a charismatic and suave sibling.\xa0The trio are veterans in the industry with decades of experience — including founding prize-winning speakeasy 28 HongKong Street — so you can be sure they’ve got the formula for a successful cocktail bar down pat.\xa0It also means that they have special access to a whisky fund, allowing Revival to double up as a retail space for rare spirits, displayed at the main bar and on the shelves along the stairs. In addition to the full Game of Thrones single-malt scotch whisky collection, there are hard-to-come-by Japanese whiskies, such as Hibiki.\xa0The bar also offers the service of buying whisky by the cask on request. The liquor can be stored and aged at a few distilleries before they’re finally bottled and sent to Revival to be opened.\xa0Cocktails, cocktails, cocktails. When we visited, its launch menu lists 16 concoctions that take after tipples we’re familiar with, including the pisco sour, old fashioned, and negroni. In the weeks to follow, we’re told the bar will be adding more to the selection.\xa0We took a fair amount of time to decide which to get, going through the flavour combinations in our minds based on the descriptions offered. Eventually, intrigued by the ingredients, we started with The Liver is the Cock’s Comb and The Lady of Shalott (S$22 each).\xa0Both arrived in impossibly elegant coupe glasses with an exaggerated thin stem, along with a snack bowl of lightly salted pretzels.\xa0The Lady of Shalott smelled of summer with red berries and lily, while the oat milk distillate rounded off the Plantation 3 Stars white rum in it. The Liver is the Cock’s Comb, by comparison, was a tangy version of a pisco sour made sweeter with Lustau Fino sherry and sweetcorn.\xa0Moving onto more robust flavours for our next round, we had Esfinge “The Sphinx” and The Scream (S$22 each). The Sphinx was a deliciously savoury and complex mix of carrot ferment, ginger, honey, acid and Ichiiko Saiten shochu that was gently fizzed with CO2.\xa0The spiciest of them all was The Scream, a fiery take on the margarita and bloody Mary combined, made with Ardbeg whisky, Codigo 1530 Blanco tequila, smoky Ancho Reyes chilli liqueur, chipotle distillate, red capsicum, lime, and agave. A sole kaffir lime leaf serves as garnish.\xa0To enjoy this drink, take a lick of the circle of paprika salt on the side of the glass for a kick of heat, then sip the concoction.\xa0With prices slightly lower than the average cocktail elsewhere, we also appreciated that there wasn’t an over-intellectualisation of the drinks, even though they’re named after art. There’s also no mention of the equipment used on the menu — the cocktails speak for themselves, and they do that pretty well.\xa0The food options, however, came across almost as an afterthought.\xa0Perhaps food isn’t a priority for an establishment focused on being a cocktail bar, but it feels like a missed opportunity.\xa0Among the few items on the menu, there’s a S$60 cheeseboard and charcuterie platter of Barbary Coast fame, vegetable dishes for snacking, and roast beef and pork spag bol jaffle (spaghetti bolognese in a closed toasted sandwich).\xa0We got the smoked salmon roll (S$18), which came as four measly slices of toasted bread with rolls of the smoked fish on top.\xa0In comparison to the restaurants across the road and an incredibly authentic Vietnamese eatery around the corner — where one can get a full dish at this price — this was lacklustre.Is it conducive to conversation? When it’s less crowded, the Main Room has plenty of corners to sink into for a good conversation. But given its limited indoor space, an al fresco sofa would be your best bet.\xa0Is a reservation necessary? Yes.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/crossings-cafe-bugis-social-enterprise/:['Every Friday night for the past eight years, an 85-year-old priest has been shaking up his signature whiskey-based Manhattan at an all-day dining cafe and social enterprise along Waterloo Street.Officially, Father Paul Staes is Crossings Cafe’s spiritual director, but his nametag is more telling of what he’s there to do on Friday evenings — volunteer as a bartender.Hailing from Belgium, Staes came to Singapore in 1994 as a missionary priest. As spiritual director, he sits on the cafe’s board and assists the eatery in its spiritual mission.Staes says he joined the cafe when it opened in 2013 at the request of board members. But he had one condition — that the cafe “must have a liquor licence”.The bartending priest, as he’s come to be known, enjoys mingling with people.He started his rounds at the cafe on Valentine’s Day in 2014 and continues to be present every Friday — making drinks, interacting with customers and recommending suitable alcoholic beverages to them.“Are you a beginner?” he first asks, followed by: “Are you driving?”Depending on your response and propensity for alcoholic beverages, Staes suggests either a cocktail or a bottle of Trappist beer (beer brewed within the confines of a Trappist monastery). Crossings Cafe stocks Trappist varieties Westmalle, Orvale, Rochefort, and Chimay.Raphael Saw, 58, a board member of the cafe who’s handled its marketing function for the past five years, says that the idea for the cafe came about because the Catholic Centre, where the cafe sits, was due for refurbishment.Authorities allowed the refurbishment on the condition that the first floor of the building — then a carpark — had to house a food-and-beverage establishment.While the centre’s management team had entertained the idea of getting external vendors, it eventually pooled donations and resources from investors, and started the cafe.The intention from the get-go was to run the cafe as a social enterprise and ensure that it can be self-sustaining.Nine years on, the cafe offers employment and personal development opportunities to persons with special needs, supports charities by providing their beneficiaries with meals, and channels its profits towards charities and social causes.The cafe marks its 10th anniversary next year and intends to have a year-long celebration.\xa0Saw says the board had always wanted to hire people with special needs, because of a desire to help the vulnerable.“We want to help them not just by giving money; we want to equip them with skills,” he adds.Working at the cafe provides these crew members with a sense of dignity by allowing them to work and support themselves.The cafe works with organisations such as Bettr Barista, a coffee academy with a social mission, and educational institution Assumption Pathway School\xa0to hire staff with special needs.\xa0One such staff member is Ahmad Irfan Azhari, 31, the cafe’s team leader and barista.Irfan started working at Bettr Barista as he wanted to pick up coffee brewing, but later joined Crossings Cafe because he wanted to acquire more skills and mingle with others.In the eight years that Irfan has been with the cafe, he says that there have been some challenges, but he forges on. “I try to keep going and I try not to give up.”He’s also learnt a lot during his time there, including handling customers, working with his colleagues with special needs and understanding what a social enterprise is about.As for what keeps him going, Irfan hopes to gather enough knowledge to start his own cafe or social enterprise someday.But the crew member with a larger-than-life personality quickly adds: “But we see how, lah — that one you also need money.”For now, he’s happy to arrive at work every day to meet his co-workers and chat with customers.Cafe manager Alfred Ho, 27, leads the crew of seven service staff, six of whom have special needs. He says Irfan is one of the cafe’s most outstanding crew members.Before joining Crossings Cafe, Ho was a management trainee at F&B company Creative Eateries. His current role is his first foray into people management and overseeing crew members with special needs.He’s come to develop a good relationship and rapport with his team. For example, during the cafe’s downtime, he mixes cookie batter, based on a recipe from Irfan’s mother, then gets his staff members to place the batter onto cookie trays.The cookies are sold at the cafe.\xa0Bartending priest and social mission aside, Crossings Cafe serves up hearty and affordable meals from a convenient, central location (next to Bras Basah MRT station).Ho says that the cafe has become a favourite among office workers in the area, such as those working at Manulife Centre — a short 50m away.Some of the cafe’s signatures include chilli crab spaghetti, which Saw excitedly tucks into when he joins us for this interview.Saw acknowledges that the F&B space is crowded and competitive. While people are generally supportive when they find out about the cafe’s social mission, “people also come to the cafe for the food, so we must deliver consistently good food”, he adds.The cafe constantly looks at ways to improve its dishes. For example, fried soft-shell crab was previously used for the chilli crab spaghetti. But now, it uses generous amounts of crabmeat — similar to what other cafes offer — albeit at a wallet-friendly price of S$16.80.Other crowd favourites include the Good Shepherd’s Pie, a hearty dish of ground beef layered with mashed potatoes. Our team loved this dish, particularly the addition of hard-boiled eggs under the top layer.But the clincher was ending our meal with Staes’ Flemish rice pudding (rijstpap), made from a recipe passed down from his mother.The priest makes and brings in a limited quantity of the pudding weekly, which he distributes to patrons who order his cocktails.He also personally spoons a generous amount of dark-brown sugar molasses on top of the dessert before guiding you on how to eat it.As the evening winds down and Staes prepares to make a move, he reminds us: “Enjoy and be a joy.”That sums up why an octogenarian still carves time out weekly to mingle with customers and whip up cocktails, despite the somewhat laborious nature of the role — because he wants to spread joy.\xa0\xa0Crossings Cafe is on the GrabFood delivery service.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/sarai-thai-fine-dining/:['We Singaporeans love our Thai food, as evidenced by the constant crowds at Golden Mile Complex and the influx of eager tourists to Bangkok as soon as borders opened. But street food and late-night supper haunts aside, there aren’t many places to get a more refined experience of the cuisine.Enter Sarai, a refreshed Thai fine-dining restaurant formerly known as Patara Fine Thai Cuisine. A name given to girls, Sarai has various meanings in Thai but is more commonly translated as “my princess”.Taking cues from the trend of casual fine-dining establishments marked by inviting pastel-coloured interiors, the restaurant is a far cry from the dark wood-heavy traditional design worn before.Blush-themed with teal accents on the walls and ceiling, Sarai has two dining rooms at the back that combine into one to seat 40 guests.\xa0The team, in the kitchen and at the front of house, has remained the same. Chef de cuisine Chimkit Khamphuang, better known as chef Lisa, imparts her Isan heritage through northeastern Thai dishes. You won’t find the typical selection of tom yum and pad thai here. Sumrub, a traditional way of enjoying Thai cuisine, where a mix of complementary dishes are eaten with white rice, is at the centre of the restaurant’s concept.\xa0The number of items on the menu has been whittled down, allowing the team at Sarai to focus on quality rather than quantity. The same a la carte menu is available for both lunch and dinner, with vegetarian options available.To best eat sumrub-style, go for the four-course set menu (S$68 to S$88++ for lunch, S$88 to S$108++ for dinner) comprising an amuse bouche, starters, mains and dessert.HungryGoWhere tried the S$68 lunch set, which came with a selection of three mains.\xa0Our meal started with plaa heng tang mo, a watermelon sphere on a bed of toasted coconut and smoked fish in a fried pastry tart shell. A bite-sized iteration of Thai watermelon salad, the fruit is soaked in rose water and brings a sweet and juicy contribution to the already-complex mouthful that’s salty, smoky and umami.\xa0It’s followed by two starters served together — mieng mak (S$16 for four) and puu sorn glin (S$24 for four).\xa0Mieng mak is a variation of mieng kham, a street snack made of an assortment of up to six aromatics such as toasted coconut and dried shrimps wrapped in wild betel leaves. It’s typically left to the guests to assemble on their own.\xa0Lisa’s mieng mak uses eight ingredients — ginger flower, young ginger, wild ginger, shallots, lime, dessicated coconut, chilli, and cashews. Although the ingredients are chopped up coarser than we’d prefer (read: harder to chew), it had the punchiness we’d expect.In contrast, the accompanying puu sorn glin, crab meat with pickled garlic on a puffed rice cracker, had the opposite flavour profile. Tangy and spicy, the bite was perfumed with lemongrass and was thoroughly enjoyable to eat.\xa0The mains that came next were all served at once alongside steaming white rice. Communal dining is encouraged here, so if you’re coming in a bigger group, portions will be combined into sharing plates.\xa0Together with an almost sweet-tasting roasted duck soup, gaeng jued pad yang (S$16), and stir-fried sweet peas and tokin jasmine flowers with garlic, pad tua gab dok ka john (S$26), you’ll get to choose one more dish. Fast becoming a favourite with diners at this one-month-old restaurant is the gaeng raweng nuea (S$36), a version of Thai green curry with tender pieces of wagyu beef short ribs from the UK that’s braised for 24 hours.\xa0The green curry is reduced to a sauce and garnished with slivers of kaffir lime leaf. It’s a dish that can get quite heavy and monotonous, so enjoy it with spoonfuls of rice and slices of white turmeric.Alternatively, you could go for the seafood option of yum hed goong yang —\xa0a giant Thai river prawn that’s grilled and served with a salad of locally farmed golden cap mushrooms and pink oyster mushrooms marinated in coconut cream, lemongrass and kaffir lime leaf. Dessert was kanom mor gaeng with peuak rang nok (S$16), a baked taro custard held in a pandan leaf envelope with strips of taro that are fried in sugar to resemble a bird’s nest.\xa0\xa0Drinks of the alcoholic and non-alcoholic variety are whipped up by Saminathan Kaliappan, head of operations at Sarai and also head bartender.\xa0I had a delicious sweet tamarind (S$12) drink that’s made with earl grey tea, fresh tamarind and palm sugar. Like the Thai version of a lemon tea, it’s a great refreshment on a hot day and I loved nibbling on the skewered candied tamarind.There is also the obligatory Thai red milk tea (S$12), but if you’re up for day drinking or drinks to go with dinner, look to the cocktail list for more fun takes on classic tipples. A galangal lychee martini (S$22) lends the classic drink a more fragrant note, while the floating market (S$22) is a curious concoction of vodka, caramel, calamansi and chocolate.\xa0Book a ride to Sarai.Tanglin Mall, 03-122, 163 Tanglin Road\nNearest MRT station: Orchard\nOpen: Daily (11am to 3pm, 6pm to 10.30pm)Tanglin Mall, 03-122, 163 Tanglin Road\nNearest MRT station: Orchard\nOpen: Daily (11am to 3pm, 6pm to 10.30pm)AuthorYawen has written a lot about food in her previous roles as the editor-in-chief of Wine & Dine and later as the associate digital editor of The Peak.

One of the first chefs in the US to introduce Japanese-Peruvian cuisine, his Nobu Hospitality empire includes hotels and restaurants around the world as well as in neighbouring cities such as Kuala Lumpur and Manila.\xa0Taking up residence in Four Seasons Hotel Singapore, the Singapore outpost showcases an identical menu to what you’d find at all Nobu restaurants but with a few extra perks. It’s the first to have a chef’s table (a private dining room with its own functional kitchen), a zen garden and two teppanyaki grills.\xa0Split into cold and hot dishes, the menu is mostly a throwback to the 90s when the combination of ponzu, sesame oil and raw fish was considered ingenious. Even the decor — wood-clad interior, panelled ceiling and indoor trees — looks like it never left that era.\xa0What to order: Black cod miso (S$68), whitefish tiradito — a Peruvian raw-fish dish (S$39)\xa028 Ann Siang Road, 01-02\nOpen: Monday to Saturday (12pm to 10pm)From fine dining to casual fare, Michelin-starred head chef Takuya Yamashita of Whitegrass lends his French-tinged Japanese touch to Boyutei cafe.\xa0Its name is derived from Japanese pavilions and the newest kid on the block sees Yamashita in charge of the savoury fare and matcha specialists Hvala responsible for the sweets (and tea). A range of comfort food makes up the menu with open-faced sandos, crepes, curry, cha soba, and chazuke (hot green tea over rice). For dessert, matcha fans can’t pass up the matcha goma garden comprising warabi mochi, homemade ice cream and a goma chocolate cookie.\xa0Tea, in particular those of the Chinese and Japanese variety, is the go-to drink here. You’ll find small-batch artisanal teas such as the Golden Key or Snowflake Dancong that are grown in specific regions or harvested only in the winter.\xa0What to order: Wagyu sukiyaki tamago sando (S$24), matcha goma garden (S$17)\n\xa0Palais Renaissance, B1-04/05, 390 Orchard Road\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (4.30pm to 11pm)Celebrating the fruits of the sea is exactly what Estuary’s mainly pescetarian menu does. Founded by serial entrepreneur and former DJ Daniel Ong, the restaurant-bar aims for sustainability; it gets some of its seafood from Ah Hua Kelong and vegetables from indoor farm Artisan Green.\xa0Led by head chef Polo Seah, former group executive chef from the Jigger and Pony group, the nosh here bears some similarities to the previous places he’s worked at, including Humpback and Caffe Fernet.\xa0There are freshly shucked oysters and a handful of options for cold dishes (hamachi ceviche and octopus carpaccio), but the highlight has to be its aged barramundi or turbot. Hung up in the dry ageing cabinet for up to 14 days — depending on the fish’s fat content — it’s then thrown onto the grill and served with a choice of chipotle agrodolce (a sweet-and-sour sauce), baba ghanoush, walnut tarator (a sauce) or seaweed beurre blanc sauce.What to order: Sea urchin with burrata, kumquat and grilled sourdough (S$26), Sarawak Bario claypot rice (S$30)\xa0InterContinental Singapore, Level 1, 80 Middle Road\nOpen: Wednesday to Sunday (12pm to 2.30pm, 6pm to 10.30pm)This new restaurant taking over Ash & Elm at InterContinental Singapore might be the answer to authentic Italian cuisine in the Bugis area.\xa0Davide Giacomelli, a young aspiring chef who’s spent 13 years in Michelin-starred kitchens, is the face and chef de cuisine of this venture after emerging as the best from a global talent scouting exercise by the hotel.\xa0The space serves as the hotel’s breakfast buffet during the day and then transforms into Luce for lunch and dinner. Expect comfort food such as the acquerello lobster, a risotto cooked simply in lobster stock with tender chunks of lobster meat, as well as a lively brunch on weekends.What to order: Acquerello lobster (S$46), tagliatelle coda mi manzo — freshly made tagliatelle pasta with deboned oxtail (S$36)\xa0128 Tembeling Road\nOpen: Tuesday to Thursday (6pm to 10.30pm), Friday and Saturday (12pm to 2.30pm, 6pm to 10.30pm)Expanding its Italian-focused collection of restaurants, The Cicheti Group marks its first foray into the east with a collaboration with a celebrated local sfoglino (male pasta maker).\xa0Better known as Ben Fatto and the private dinners he organises, Yum Hwa Lee takes charge of the pasta-making process from scratch.

Using what he knows best as a foundation for culinary exploration, the tasting menu promises to keep on evolving as Lee dives deeper into history.\xa0What to order: Lunch (S$198++), dinner (S$258++)\xa0Amara Hotel, 02-26, 165 Tanjong Pagar Road\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (12pm to 3pm, 6.30pm to 10.30pm)Chef Desmond Fong helms Sushi Yujo, yet another Japanese restaurant to open in the last year or so. The former head chef at Sushi Jin under the Les Amis Group, he’s got the techniques down pat as well as a sense of what Singaporeans like.\xa0You’ll get standard nigiri that’s made with fish flown in from Toyosu market four times a week, and his signature cooked dishes: Aburi ootoro (seared fatty tuna) that’s seared then topped with negitoro, truffle caviar and gold leaf.\xa0The lunch omakase, less indulgent than dinner, is offered in two different sets — Rikai and Shinrai.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/masterchef-singapore-ilya-nur-fadhly/:['“I’m a hustler,” says Ilya Nur Fadhly, summing up the multitude of pursuits he’s embraced since he left his job as an education consultant when the coronavirus pandemic hit. He’s now better known as a finalist on the third season of MasterChef Singapore, making it to the top five before having a crab challenge get the best of his culinary skills.Johnathan Chew, a 23-year-old dentistry undergraduate at the National University of Singapore, bagged the coveted title earlier this month. Chew eclipsed two other finalists — visual arts instructor Azwandi “Andi” Robani and car sales adviser S “Nares” Nareskanna.\xa0I’m sitting down with Ilya in his cosy Marsiling flat in early July, surrounded by his affectionate cats.The 36-year-old lives with his wife, a dental assistant, and their six-year-old daughter. They have a second child due in September.He also has a 17-year-old son from a previous marriage. I take my time teasing out parts of Ilya’s life that aren’t privy to many. When I ask about his earliest memory of food, he surprises me by revealing that his love affair with the kitchen didn’t start as a child. It manifested only when he was in secondary school, where his curiosity pushed him to learn more about the science behind cooking.He started with simple recipes, and experimented with various flavours and techniques along the way.\xa0Ilya’s love for MasterChef Singapore spurred him to sign up as a contestant once applications opened last year, even though he wasn’t necessarily confident about his cooking skills.“I didn’t think I could cook — or cook in a competition. That’s why I never joined any other competition. But I was a fan of MasterChef for a long time and I wanted to be a part of it — even if it was just the first episode,” he says.As it turned out, he breezed through the first few cooking challenges. I ask him which he found the easiest.“The coffee (challenge). Coffee’s quite versatile and I found all three (cooking methods — infusion, sauce and glaze) quite straightforward,” he replies.His creations on the show won plaudits from the judges. Some of the highlights were Sate Lilit Stuffed Squid (stuffed squid skewered on lemongrass with an orange brown butter sauce), Prawn Sambal No Goreng, and Bananalala (caramelised banana on coconut crumble and spicy soy caviar).Ilya adds that his stubbornness partly kept him consistent throughout the competition — he stuck to his guts about how he wanted to execute his dishes. During that time, it also became clear what he wanted his future to look like.“Before the competition, I’d done so many different jobs. There wasn’t one I could focus on and truly go after,” he says. “But this competition finally opened my eyes: ‘This is where you should go and this is what you should go after. Let’s do it’.”\xa0At the height of the pandemic, Ilya left his job as an education consultant because his company introduced pay cuts. But Covid-19 also proved to be a silver lining, as it led him to take up food delivery with GrabFood to earn an income — a job that not only provides a wage similar to his previous vocation but allows him a flexible schedule.Being on the job has also given him an understanding of both sides of the food business. “As riders, we may not understand why the food is taking so long. But, as someone who cooks, I understand,” says Ilya, who continues to deliver food orders full-time.“One thing (being a rider for) GrabFood has taught me is to be hardworking. If you’re hardworking, you can earn more.”Besides being a food delivery rider, Ilya took over his mother’s halal bak chang business and created Chunking.sg. He hoped to expand its customer base beyond just family, friends and word-of-mouth consumers, but has found marketing it challenging.Adapting a traditionally non-halal food item has had its obstacles, though moving away from traditional flavours has helped. “‘Bak’ traditionally means meat, like bak kwa and bak chor mee, and the point of doing the same recipe is that it has to be as good or better — otherwise, don’t do it. So that’s why I do rendang, so no one can compare because it’s not meant to be traditional,” Ilya says.He stuffs the bak chang with a homemade recipe of chicken or beef rendang, and offers seasonal mini lepat (glutinous rice, black-eyed peas and grated coconut) and mini asyura chunks (glutinous rice, minced beef, egg strips, fried shallots, ground nuts, carrots, and parsley). The seasonal items are available only when announced on Chunking.sg’s Instagram account.Last year, he also created sweet bak chang, in such flavours as matcha azuki, mocha, roselle lychee, and pandan durian. He hopes to revisit these sweet iterations in future.Since we’re on the subject of halal iterations of particular dishes, I’m compelled to ask him why Singapore’s Malay fine-dining scene isn’t as robust as it could be. I make comparisons to Malaysia, where diners have shown to be more willing to spend on experiential dining when it comes to Malay cuisine.He says that food in Singapore is pricey. For an establishment to adopt a fine-dining concept, it could incur extra costs from engaging consultants, especially for first-time business owners. There’s also a need to hire and train proficient front-of-house and back-end staff, whose costs will trickle down to diners. It’s something many wouldn’t be willing to fork out.Ilya also weighs in on some eateries that seem to pass off fusion recipes as upmarket dining. “I hate the word, because I feel like ‘fusion’ is mixing two cultures. But if you’re doing an upscale version of your own (food), it shouldn’t be ‘fusion’ — it should be ‘modern’,” Ilya says.Still, with adept Malay chefs working in numerous Michelin-starred kitchens, he’s hopeful that people will be more receptive to Malay fine-dining in time.\xa0So what’s in store for Ilya, now that the cameras are no longer around?\xa0A private-dining business could be on the cards.“With bak chang, it’s labour-intensive, time-consuming and the yield is so little,” he says. “For now, I’m thinking of making it a side business and focusing on my own food. I want to do semi-fine-dining but halal. This means you don’t have crazy prices, and have simple decor and maybe halal wine. But before that, I want to do private dining.”While he has not set himself a timeline, he’s looking to start his private-dining concept once he’s able to secure a venue. His home is not a viable option because of the limited space.“If there’s an investor who believes in my goal, that would be best, of course,” he adds.In the immediate future, however, he’s planning to tie up with MasterChef Singapore runner-up Nares and chef Muhammad Imran Kidd to hold a “six-hands dinner” in August, for three nights only. Our interview is nearing an end, and I’ve one final question: What’s one dish he has attempted many times but has yet to perfect?Ilya breaks into a giggle and is unsure if he should spill the beans. “I want to say this, but later Derek (Cheong, MasterChef Singapore Season 2 winner) will kill me! He said to make this is very easy — it’s date ice cream. I made it for my wife before and she said it was sticky.”He confesses that in general, desserts aren’t his forte, and points to how he and fellow MasterChef Singapore finalist Andi struggled with replicating chef Mohamed Al-Matin’s petite chocolate tall cake in the sixth episode.Ultimately, Ilya is grateful for the experience, and the many opportunities and lessons he gained from his stint on the show. One thing is for sure: His time on our screens is only the start of his foray into Singapore’s F&B scene.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/masterchef-singapore-season-3-johnathan-chew/:['With the dramatic victory of Johnathan Chew by a mere 1.5 points, the thrilling third instalment of MasterChef Singapore has come to a close. The newly minted 23-year-old winner is an undergraduate dentistry student at the National University of Singapore.An unprecedented event in the history of MasterChef Singapore, the riveting finale was a showdown between Chew and two other finalists — visual arts instructor Azwandi “Andi” Robani and car sales adviser S “Nares” Nareskanna. In previous seasons, only two contestants were selected for the finale, instead of three.Given the task of rustling up three courses, Chew impressed the three judges — chefs Audra Morrice, Bjorn Shen and Damian D’Silva — with his sophisticated reimagination of humble home-cooked fare that showcased flavours befitting a fine-dining establishment.On his win, Chew says: “I am so proud to be Singapore’s next MasterChef. My confidence in my abilities has grown so much, and I have picked up so many skills throughout my MasterChef journey.”MasterChef Singapore presented a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for Chew to network with fellow foodies, professional chefs and key players in the food industry. The experience has dramatically shifted his view of working in the sector.Bolstered by newly acquired in-depth knowledge, Chew now appreciates the effort put into a meal at a Michelin-starred restaurant. He says that it goes beyond what’s on your plate or the taste in your mouth. Instead, the price is justified by the chef’s effort, attention to detail, communication skills, and teamwork with fellow staff and food suppliers.Clinching the esteemed title has not just been a dream come true for Chew. It has also brought him closer to his other goals — such as opening a bakery with his mum (cue the collective awws).Adapted from MasterChef UK, the most recent season of MasterChef Singapore spanned nine weeks. The 10 episodes paid homage to Singapore’s distinctive multicultural cuisine and the country’s collective love for food, while shining a spotlight on sustainability issues. These included the importance of reducing food waste and leveraging local produce to minimise carbon footprint.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/homeground-coffee-roasters-outram/:['A delightful banter about uniforms was not what I expected from my late lunch at Homeground Coffee Roasters’ new home at Teo Hong Road, just outside Outram Park MRT station’s Exit H.\xa0All around me, servers fleet about wearing knee-length overcoats in various shades of earth, the fabric billowing as they make their way to customers asking to see the menu or for a glass of water.\xa0“They’re from Muji,” a server tells me almost inaudibly, when I stopped to ask.This seamlessness between pret-a-porter sensibilities and the physical units Homeground Coffee Roasters occupies is impressive. Inside, the space is expansive, breathable even. A light breeze can waft through quickly, passing by walls painted in a soothing hue of stone and wood panels in nutmeg.In the middle of the cafe, a bar table wraps around the wall that separates the two units. And while it acts as a unifier of the two spaces, it’s also fashioned into a coffee bar.\xa0Here, guests sit in pairs (or, by themselves, if the week calls for it), deep in conversation as a coffee artisan quietly serves glasses of Arabica blends in various permutations of preparation methods.\xa0It’s all so breathlessly poetic and impressively intentional.\xa0\xa0Co-founded by Elysia Tan, winner of the Singapore National Brewers Cup Championship for 2019 and 2022, Homeground Coffee Roasters opened at Joo Chiat Road in 2018.\xa0In its initial identity-finding mission, Homeground acted as both a coffee joint and a makeshift art gallery. It once hosted an art exhibition by Singaporean artist Ly Yeow, titled Salt and Light, which I visited. I recall thinking how austere the space looked with its overabundance of grey shades and stiff angles.Shortly after, the cafe underwent a style revamp going from severe and edgy to fun and kitschy, with menu items such as What a Chick and It’s a Wrap that aptly reflected the turn of mood.One pandemic and a few months later, Homeground Coffee Roasters is kitschy no more. There’s a maturity now that’s apparent even from the crowd it attracts — mature, quiet, reflective.\xa0They’re here for a good time — and a long time, if Homeground plays its cards well.\xa0The culinary brains behind Homeground is Aaron Kueh, who leads the spacious kitchen at the back and whose name is a delightful augury to the career path he has taken. Kueh used to stage at Ce La Vi, Maggie Joan’s and the Michelin-starred Jag, leveraging his fine-dining resume to craft a menu at Homeground that’s elegant, refined and delightfully unexpected — especially for a cafe.Take, for instance, the baked brie (S$19). It’s a straightforward slab of Danish brie elevated by the inclusion of umeboshi (salted Japanese plums), Korean honey, and a flambe of brandy served with slices of sourdough.\xa0The sweetness, creaminess and sourness come together to great savoury effect. Even when flambeed, there’s no untoward harshness or edge to the plate — everything works so delicately.Then there’s the quinoa tofu fritters (S$12), one of Homeground’s many inclusivity-forward vegan items. Quinoa and tofu are combined, breaded, then fried and served on a bed of hummus.\xa0Still, while the hummus could do with a touch more seasoning, the star of the show is, bar none, the pickled salad on top. Here, strips of cucumber and red onions are tossed in a sweet-sour raspberry vinaigrette for a slight acidic kick.\xa0I love that the cafe used red onions here, further cementing my theory that red onions are making quite the triumphant comeback on plates. Mains come by way of a chorizo kimchi stew (S$28). It’s a rare thing of beauty for something this flavourful (tomato-ey, sweet, tangy, spicy, savoury) to still be nuanced and layered in its execution.\xa0The typical chorizo stew has a reputation for being bold and brash (which many people enjoy). Yet here, the dish is light and delicately balanced, with hints of kimchi and smoked paprika peeking through.\xa0I also liked the charcoal grilled chicken (S$29) that has been brined (yay!) and grilled till a handsome char forms on parts of the spatchcocked bird. Underneath this cutlet is a bed of pomme de terre, roughly chopped so it retains bite, and then mixed with yuzu dressing for a sweet and citric aftertaste.\xa0When eaten with the bright (both in colour and taste) coriander chimichurri sauce, the dish becomes a magical and congruous melange of flavours that’s addictive and a delight to experience.Dessert gave me pause. A dramatic plate of burnt rice coconut (S$15) comes served with an architectural sculpture of fried Vietnamese rice paper roll, perched atop a pool of burnt black rice pudding. This has been carefully sweetened so as not to take away from the earthy taste of black glutinous rice, almost in reverence for original flavours.\xa0It’s then elevated with the addition of hazelnut crumble, uncooked black rice, and pandan-spinach oil, giving this a more Odette vibe than one from a humble eatery at Outram Park. Food-wise, Homeground Coffee Roasters left me satiated, deliriously surprised and impressed. The coffee was great, the food heroic, and the service incredibly warm and personable.\xa0I wished Homeground spoke more about the food served here on its social media pages and website. It’s a shame to hide this gastronomic treasure from curious eyes. I came here expecting none of these wonders and left wanting more. Bravo.\xa0Is it conducive to conversation? Yes.Is a reservation necessary? Homeground Coffee Roasters doesn’t accept reservations. There’s an automated queuing system at the entrance.How to get there? It’s across the road from Exit H of Outram Park MRT station.\xa0HungryGoWhere paid for its meal at this cafe for this review.\xa0Homeground Coffee Roasters is on the GrabFood delivery service.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/taste-test-mcdonalds-chicken-mccrispy-honey-soy/:['At first glance, McDonald’s new Chicken McCrispy Honey Soy looked like pretty standard fare. We received a drumstick and a thigh, and both pieces sported a rather plainly battered skin. Nothing special about this, or so we thought.\xa0It didn’t help that the pieces looked smaller than the original Chicken McCrispy, which furthermore, sports a crispy and crunchy skin that’s obvious from the get-go.To be fair, the new Chicken McCrispy Honey Soy (S$6.60 for a la carte, or from S$8.60 for an extra value meal) had an intriguing glossy shine to its golden-brown exterior that got us curious.\xa0When McDonald’s announced this new honey-soy-flavoured version on Monday, we couldn’t help but wonder if the caramelised exterior would make it too sweet for our taste buds.\xa0All our doubts were put to rest after we took our first bite.\xa0The honey soy glaze naturally gave the savoury chicken a sweet undertone, albeit a very mild one. Each mouthful was a burst of complex flavours and textures, thanks to the tender and juicy meat on the inside and sweet-savoury battered skin on the outside. This version is not spicy, and so, it’s perfect for those who cannot take the heat.While the Chicken McCrispy Honey Soy’s battered exterior may not be as thick as the original’s, it was surprisingly just as crispy — a truly delicious experience!

And yes, they are just as good as we remembered.The Spicy Chicken McNuggets are also available as part of a McDonald’s Happy Sharing Box, which consists of eight pieces of McWings to go along with 12 pieces of spicy nuggets.What better way to counter the peppery aftertaste of the Spicy Chicken McNuggets than a refreshing Hershey’s Chocolate Frappe (S$4.75 for small or S$5.15 for medium)!If you are a fan of Hershey’s chocolate like us, then you’ll love this beverage.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/samurai-vs-ninja-burger/:['As part of its “Honour your appetite” campaign, McDonald’s brought back two of its beloved burgers — the Samurai and Ninja — in less than a month.The Samurai beef burger (S$6.80 for single a la carte) made its comeback on Sept 22 to great fanfare, while the Ninja chicken burger (S$7 for a la carte) returned on Thursday (Oct 13).\xa0In this taste-off, we pit both “warriors” against each other to decide the ultimate winning burger!\xa0In terms of presentation, the Samurai burger looked rather underwhelming. It looked flat, and similar to our last taste test, the chopped lettuce within limp and sloppily placed.By contrast, the Ninja burger looked like it was put together with a little more care. Sandwiched between its buns was a thick chicken patty, topped with sliced cucumber and shredded white cabbage.\xa0For this round, the Ninja burger delivers a critical blow to the Samurai burger. It’s a promising start from Ninja burger, and the fight is on!The Samurai burger used the regular sesame buns. It’s the same bun used by the other burger items on McDonald’s menu; there’s nothing special about it.\xa0The Ninja burger, by comparison, uses charcoal buns. These buns are typically made from activated charcoal powder from coconut husks.\xa0Taste-wise, we hardly noticed any difference between the charcoal bun and the regular bun. Apart from its black aesthetics, the charcoal bun does not really have a distinct flavour profile. It does taste slightly less sweet, but that’s about it.The Ninja burger tries to attack with its sharp shuriken, but the Samurai burger dodges it skilfully. It’s a tie for this round!\xa0While the beef patty of the Samurai burger was juicy, the portion provided was rather small. The droopy pieces of lettuce neither inspired nor added anything to the taste of the patty.\xa0It’s evident that the Ninja burger outshines its rival with its thick and crispy chicken patty. Even the shredded cabbage it comes with has more life in them. The combination of textures makes munching on the patty way more satisfying.The elusive Ninja burger performs a surprise jumping front kick on the Samurai burger, leaving the latter bruised. This round goes to the Ninja burger!\xa0As the Samurai burger struggles to pick itself up, will it survive this round?As expected, the Samurai burger’s well-loved sweet and tangy teriyaki sauce was simply delicious. The slight black-peppery taste makes the sauce unique.The nanban sauce of the Ninja burger, however, is too sweet for my liking. If it were less sweet, its acidity could have been a nice counterbalance to the chicken patty.\xa0Towards the end, the Samurai burger manages to deliver a deadly punch from behind. The Ninja burger falters, but is it enough to bring it down?\xa0Time’s up and the fight is over! The Ninja burger scored a decisive victory over the Samurai burger. In the looks and taste departments, the Ninja burger is a clear winner.Fans of either burger may look out for a rematch next year as McDonald’s could be bringing them back again!McDonald’s is on the GrabFood delivery service.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/roasted-story/:['As someone who occasionally writes about food for a pay cheque, I’ve tried a fair number of tasty things — from the nutty intricacies of top-shelf Iberico ham to soft mouthfuls of decadent A5 Kagoshima wagyu almost white with marbling. As a Singaporean, though, sometimes all I want is meat that doesn’t make me baulk at the price.Oh, there’s excellent roast duck on Old Airport Road? Oh, there’s pork belly with an insane crackling in Chinatown? No surprises there.Roasted Story is, however, a tad fancier than most of them. On your way inside, you might spend a few seconds admiring the gilded gold door frames and tall ceilings — things you’d never find at the usual suspects.Then your eyes focus on the glass display at the back that puts many regular joints to shame — there are plump birds, richly marbled meats and char siew glistening in sweet glaze. If meat is your thing, you may feel like it’s Chinese New Year in here.\xa0Launched in June, Roasted Story specialises in Chinese roast meats cooked over lychee and citron firewood — two hardwoods known for their exceptional aroma. The restaurant’s chefs, I’m told, are highly trained in Chinese fare and have been cooking in Singapore for several years.The menu here reads more like the offerings at a zi char restaurant, but that’s a plus point as you can also get noodles and rice, soups, vegetables, seafood, and other sides.\xa0Roasted Story seems to hit the jackpot of fairly priced, quality food that also throws good service and ambience into the mix. It’s a great destination for a hearty family meal, but don’t fret if you’re dining alone — you can gobble up the generous set meals without judgement.\xa0The fire “bu jian tian” char siew (S$21.80) is a rock star. “Bu jian tian” — also called “fei kay yok” in Hong Kong, or “secreto” in Spain — refers to a cut that’s found on the underside of a pig, between the hock and bacon. It’s prized for its unique distribution of fat and soft lean meat.This is a fabulous dish that leans towards being more fatty, almost to the point of melting away on your tongue.Char siew is about the texture, the charred surface of the meat, and sweetness from caramelised marinade, and this ticks all the boxes.Here, a wait staff sets fire to a mixture of brandy and lemon essence before pouring it liberally over the pork. It’s as intimidating as an entree can get, but the smokiness is unbeatable.This is a roast meat place, so you must try the triple roast meat platter (S$21.80), which comes with roast pork belly, roast chicken and roast duck. You can opt for duck drumstick for an extra S$4 if you like a richer, slightly fattier cut.See that irresistible crisp on the pork belly? Sliced chunky for a wholesome bite, the meat is moist and not overly fatty, which I prefer for its porky savouriness. The duck is just as tender, with a slight oiliness that leaves the lips smeared.In comparison, the skin of the chicken leg doesn’t get as crispy, but I still like how the meat tastes — slightly juicy and full of flavour.Every roaster has a secret blend of sauces for their meats, and the ones here are pretty decent. There is a sweet one that’s often served with roast meat, and another earthy herbal sauce made with Chinese herbs (I tasted a bit of dang gui, the dried root of Angelica sinensis, and goji berry). We liked it best with the duck.As for carbs, I’d recommend forgoing the usual steamed rice and opting for the mee pok (S$3), which despite its simplicity, is quite tasty. The flat egg noodles are firm with a soft touch of lye water, and come topped with shallots and lard.Then there’s the herbal porridge (S$2), boiled down to a glorious, fragrant and umami-rich congee with earthy herbaceousness.Roasted Story also offers an array of zi char-style dishes. The salted egg yolk bean (S$12.80) sees French beans coated in aromatic salted egg crumbs — the slight crunch and saltiness are somewhat addictive.Or the wasabi prawn (S$18.80), fresh and plump things battered and wonderfully fried, before being dipped in a tangy wasabi mayo cream.We’d order both dishes again.\xa0While I appreciate the amount of ingredients stuffed into the signature beancurd (S$13.80), the dish was mostly lacking in taste. That said, it’s simple enough to fix with a few pinches of salt during the cooking process.Otherwise, the heaping stew of yam, onions, carrots, chilli, peas, shimeji mushroom, pork belly, and of course, tofu, is rather nice.\xa0Is it conducive to conversation? The proximity of the tables means you probably shouldn’t speak badly about your boss, but otherwise, it’s easy to talk here.Is a reservation necessary? Weekday evenings are somewhat quiet, with only half the tables filled, though I’d recommend making a reservation if you have a bigger group.How to get there? Take a five-minute stroll from Rochor or Bencoolen MRT stations.Take note:\xa0\xa0HungryGoWhere paid for its meal at this restaurant for this review.Roasted Story is on the GrabFood delivery service.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/durian-season-singapore-king-of-fruits/:['You smell it before you see it: A thick, cloying sweetness with a pungency akin to petroleum (some may say). The scent of the fruit stays on your fingers and permeates the air unapologetically. Yet Singaporeans can’t get enough of durians.\xa0Native to Southeast Asia — namely Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines — the king of fruits has an almost mythical reputation and is as divisive as it is highly sought after. Although not native to Thailand, the country is the world’s top exporter of durians and supplies Singapore retailers during Malaysia’s off-season.\xa0From avid durian lovers who have their own dealers and keep returning to particular stalls for quality to those who absolutely refuse to be in the same vicinity as an opened durian, the reactions alone give the fruit its notoriety among locals and foreigners alike. Singapore’s durian season, which happens twice a year (the main seasons) and lasts three months each time from May and from November, is dependent on Malaysia’s climate and rainfall. The unpredictable weather, due to climate change, has given rise to smaller seasons that may happen between these two big harvests.\xa0The majority of the fruit we get to enjoy is harvested and processed at night, then transported by truck across the Causeway from Johor Bahru, Pahang and Penang. Popular varieties include Musang King (or Mao Shan Wang), D24, D13, and Red Prawn — only a few out of the 200 varieties recognised in Malaysia alone.\xa0With a system where demand has a direct effect on how the fruits are priced, a kilogram of the plump yellow lobes can cost almost S$100 if it comes from the highest-prized variety Mao Shan Wang and, in particular, an older tree. The older the tree, the better the durian.\xa0\xa0“Some trees can bear fruit in five to six years… but good durians come from trees that are 25 years and above,” says Jonathan Lim, owner of Spike Empire.\xa0While some durian retailers get them from a trusted network of suppliers who are based in Malaysia, a few such as Lim have acquired their own plantations for quality control. Since buying his first plantation in Tangkak, northwestern Johor, four years ago, he now oversees five plots of land and spends a month each time on-site.\xa0Grown on elevated terrain such as hillsides, the trees need daily maintenance involving fertilisers, pesticides, pruning the surrounding grassland, and removing fallen branches or leaves. And, like all fruits when they ripen, the intoxicating sweet scent lures wild animals and insects that might get to them before they’re harvested.\xa0Even if all precautions are taken, unfavourable weather conditions can affect both the season’s yield and taste. When the trees are flowering, for example, strong rain can cause the flowers to fall off and trees can discard fruits before they ripen to conserve resources. For Singapore-based retailers, such as Kelvin Yong from Durians Direct, it pays to have a good relationship with suppliers. Only less than two years old, his store is better known for bringing in the less common varieties of the fruit such as those from Penang — the slightly bitter and creamy S17 and a more fibrous version of Mao Shan Wang called Tian Xiang.\xa0“We try to seek out the suppliers that are more into supplying the different types, and based on your relationship with them, they will go source for more varieties if you express your interest in selling different varieties,” he elaborates.\xa0Still, he never knows what to expect with each harvest. The average supplier, if they do not own a plantation, collects the fruit from many plots in the area, which makes it difficult to trace a durian’s provenance. “No durian seller has exclusivity to one farm,” Yong adds. Other factors can also affect quality, such as how it’s grown, the season’s rainfall and spoilage during transport. Only certain varieties of durians, in particular, can survive the 10-hour drive from Penang to Singapore.\xa0That’s why not many retailers bring in Penang varieties, which have been gaining traction in recent years, with Yong being one of the first few to do so. Most of the time, retailers end up absorbing the cost of damaged or bad-quality fruits.\xa0For Lim of Spike Empire, however, owning five plantations and a factory means there’s more freedom to find ways to monetise durians that don’t make the cut for being sold on their own. Those that do are husked and repackaged in boxes, while those that don’t are pureed and used in cakes, pastries and gelato.\xa0In a competitive market with never-ending demand and low barriers to entry, it’s a lucrative trade. Some sellers pass off cheaper varieties for those that are more expensive — for example Red Prawn (actually pale yellow in colour, unlike what its name suggests) for the red-hued D13 — and give others more marketable names, such as Black Gold for Mao Shan Wang durians.\xa0To the uninitiated, the world of durians can be overwhelming. All the more reason why true durian fans hang on to trusted retailers such as Lim and Yong, who are purveyors of good quality.\xa0So how can you tell what’s good? Try as much as you can to figure out your preferences. Yong says: “Your reference to bitterness, softness and sweetness might be different from mine, so there isn’t a fixed yardstick on what is a good durian or not. You pay your money’s worth and you enjoy it.”Durian varieties may go by a few names (they’re sometimes given catchier names compared with what they’re called in the kampung). Here are the most commonly found types in Singapore.\xa0\xa0D197 — Mao Shan Wang (other names are Musang King or Rajah Kunyit)Winning the popularity contest, its high demand has made it the most widely grown tree in all three Malaysian states.

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/singapore-home-based-businesses/:['From kimchi to takoyaki platters, the range of businesses you can now find on social media will surprise you. While brick-and-mortar shops struggled during the pandemic, these 10 home-based businesses saw a spike in orders, with many others sprouting up.As dining out becomes the norm again, here are our top home-based business picks, so that you can continue getting good grub from the comfort of your home.\xa0Third-generation Hainanese siblings Jocelyn, Josephine and Charmaine have taken on their late grandmother’s legacy of selling their native snacks, namely the chewy rice cake — yi bua — typically served at a wedding or a baby’s full moon celebration. Their grandmother, Madam Yeoh Min Lin, opened Hainan Cuisine & Snacks at the hawker centre at Toa Payoh Lorong 7 in 2000 and quickly garnered attention for her Hainanese rice kueh.\xa0A year after she passed away in 2020, the siblings set up All Things Hainanese in her honour, offering an assortment of snacks they grew up with, including their Signature Yi Bua and Traditional Handmade Kaya (as an ode to her beginnings as a hawker selling kaya toast).\xa0While the brick-and-mortar store at the hawker centre is still open, All Things Hainanese functions as an e-store and operates only on weekends. The three sisters, aged between 18 and late 20s, run it while juggling their full-time jobs and school with production and R&D for the store.\xa0For now, they’ve created the Yi Bua Cookie flavoured with the stuffing of the kueh (grated coconut sweetened with palm sugar, ginger, toasted peanuts, and toasted sesame seeds) and Yi Bua Cake, a larger and multi-layered variation of the kueh. With 3,000 followers and counting, they’re no doubt reaching out to the younger generation as intended.\xa0\xa0Started by Evelyn Lee in 2021, this one-woman home-based business specialises in two flavours of granola — Sweet Salty Nutty and Chocolate Blackout. Made by hand, these limited orders of granola have been getting the thumbs-up from food industry names such as chef-owner Willin Low. “I get feedback that is super heartwarming… People love the nutrient-dense, tasty snack a lot,” she tells HungryGoWhere.Working in the finance industry by day, she bakes batches of oats, nuts and seeds in her Tiong Bahru home. As a fitness enthusiast as well, she avoids using refined sugars and instead uses maple syrup and brown sugar to sweeten her granola.Her packets of granola even come with a full breakdown of their ingredients on a nutrition label. Feeling optimistic about the business so far, she has plans to increase production by renting an industrial kitchen in the near future.\xa0\xa0One of the quirkier cakes we’ve seen on Instagram comes from halal bakery Dapiku Sweets. It all makes sense when you discover who founded it: Jian Yun, a skilled baker with experience at establishments such as Room 4 Desserts bakery in Bali and Nahm restaurant in Bangkok, and designer and illustrator Aliff Tee.\xa0In 2019, the home-based business started as a way for both founders to express themselves through art and food. But during the pandemic in 2021, a retrenchment and a steady stream of orders allowed them to delve full-time into Dapiku, which they now manage in addition to freelance jobs on the side.\xa0Besides their elaborately decorated custom cakes, they are known for their burnt miso cheesecake and unique creations such as a peanut butter and kaya puff or gula melaka coconut fudge cake with coconut caramel. On the weekends, a monthly thematic dessert box offers up to seven sweet and savoury bakes — the best way to sample Jian Yun’s innovative spirit.Their dream for the future involves a commercial kitchen as well as a space for lessons and dessert degustation menus.\xa0Behind this American-style barbecue with Southeast Asian influences is a husband-and-wife team, Shane and Eve Gan, who’ve both worked in professional kitchens in Singapore, including Cheek by Jowl, Candlenut and Naked Finn. What started as a “small side project” during the pandemic in 2021, SouthEast is a marriage of Shane Gan’s passion for American barbecue and Eve Gan’s love for her native Indonesian cuisine.\xa0You might have seen their pictures of thick pink cuts of lightly charred meats on your feed — a good indicator of how well-received their food has been. It’s now become the pair’s full-time endeavour marinating, smoking and grilling meats.Their smoked five-spice beef short ribs, smoked nine to 12 hours, is a firm favourite, especially with the sakura ebi potato salad. They’ve recently started making their own sausages, such as the Asian herbed smoked pork sausage, and occasionally use wood found in the region for smoking their meats as well. And now that restrictions have relaxed and there’s less demand for takeaways, they’re planning to focus on private dinners.\xa0Unlike most of the home-based businesses that we’ve found, JP Kitchen started as a collection of restaurants.Taking time off to raise his children, Rosnani Konali decided to restart the business in 2016, but in a way that was still manageable. Since then, it’s amassed 19,000 followers on Instagram who are fans of its indulgent halal East Asian offerings such as takoyaki and sushi platters, donburi bowls and udon.A brick-and-mortar store might be an option in the future, but for now, its enormous 30-piece to 40-piece takoyaki party platters or seasonal steak donburi and Korean black bean udon can be delivered islandwide and are available for self pick-up at 4 Lorong G in Telok Kurau.\xa0\xa0Fresh university graduates, these three best friends took the leap into opening Momo Acai from their own homes in February 2021. As fans of acai bowls who were frustrated by the lack of late-night acai options in their neighbourhoods, they got the business off the ground.\xa0Operating from three locations — Holland Village, Toa Payoh and Tampines — gives them the unique advantage of reaching out to customers all over Singapore with more flexible opening hours.\xa0Now gaining popularity via word of mouth, they’ve expanded their halal and vegan-friendly offerings to include smaller portions of acai to eat on the go (Munchies Bup and an upsized Ultra Bup) and an acai cake in flavours such as Tickle My Berries or Nut-Flix & Chill.In the meantime, Momo Acai continues as a side project as the three friends hold full-time jobs in automotive, marketing and human resources. But they dream of having a store where they can chat with customers as they tuck into “bups” of acai.\xa0Jacqueline Choo, a financial services director, missed Japan so much during the pandemic that she set up Oh My Mochi in 2020. With support from her family, she makes strawberry red bean daifuku and matcha milk mochi for her 1,600 followers on Instagram.\xa0Her star product — adorable custom mochis — have captured the attention of the media. Her mahjong and animal-inspired mochi are fun renditions of the chewy rice cake. They’ve attracted such a good response that she’s working on a wedding and baby shower range, as well as on-site mochi catering services.\xa0Harun Rashid took his younger brother’s idea of selling chendol and started Chendolkita in 2020, with the help of their mother and younger sister. As the founder of Rocketvows, a wedding service company, Harun is no stranger to entrepreneurship and took on the task of promoting these bottles of sweet chendol with soft green jellies.\xa0They’ve come up with six variations of the well-loved drink or iced dessert comprising coconut milk, palm sugar syrup and droplets of green rice flour jellies — original, Kopita, Tehkita, Soyakita, Bandungkita, and Kurmakita (dates).\xa0Ultimately, Harun plans to make the business sustainable so as to have everyone working full-time.\xa0\xa0A six-member family runs\xa0Madam Yam, which specialises in abacus seeds or beads, a Hakka dish.\xa0Of Hokkien heritage, the matriarch — Madam Yam herself — learnt how to make the chewy beads of tapioca and yam at the request of her eldest daughter, but soon won over relatives when she prepared the dish for Chinese New Year gatherings. It was during the lockdown that her children decided to fulfil her wish of sharing her food with an even larger audience.While Mdm Yam does the cooking, her children manage\xa0the other aspects of the business and take care of its social media accounts. Her husband contributes with his secret chilli recipe that’s sold as Papa’s Chilli to complement the two available flavours of abacus seeds — cuttlefish and scallop.\xa0Founded by Zeng Wanting in 2019, this home-based business got a boost in sales when the lockdown (and Netflix hit Squid Game) happened. Selling kimchi made from an assortment of fruit and vegetables, the former retail and events professional did her own research — namely eating lots of kimchi in Korea and attending classes, to figure out her formula of marinade.\xa0An advocate of a healthy diet and a K-pop fan, she makes batches of apple, cabbage, cucumber and radish kimchi, on top of a few banchan (or side) dishes, such as mayak quail egg and seasoned cuttlefish. Wanting Kimchi’s signature whole leaf cabbage comes in three varieties: Fruity Floral, Aged Fruity Floral that’s extra tart, and Fiesty Fire with Habanero (a type of pepper) for a kick of heat.\xa0JP Kitchen and Momo Acai are on the GrabFood delivery service.\xa0AuthorYawen has written a lot about food in her previous roles as the editor-in-chief of Wine & Dine and later as the associate digital editor of The Peak.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/genki-sushi-calbee-collaboration/:['Japanese sushi chain Genki Sushi has teamed up with Japanese snack giant Calbee to launch a rather inventive and unconventional range of sushi dishes for a limited period. The seasonal roll-out was timed to coincide with the opening of Genki Sushi’s 19th outlet at I12 Katong mall on Oct 4.The crossover will feature some of Genki Sushi’s popular menu items, but with a twist — they come loaded with Calbee’s Jagabee potato sticks and Hot & Spicy Potato Chips. Available for one-and-a-half months, from Oct 6 to Nov 20, the creations will be offered in cardboard trays on top of Genki Sushi’s mascot plates, and you can get them at all Genki Sushi outlets islandwide.At a media tasting, Genki Sushi told HungryGoWhere that the creations were the result of hours spent experimenting with various combinations, so that the final products offer a gastronomical experience that’s a burst of flavour and crunch.We especially enjoyed the tweaks to the sushi chain’s ever-popular range of maki sushi (S$4.80 for three pieces), such as lobster salad maki, ebi fry maki and teriyaki chicken maki. They come topped with Calbee’s Hot & Spicy Potato Chips, which give an extra spicy kick.There’s also the “fully loaded” Jagabee range that features classic sides, such as tori nanban, ebi mentai and takoyaki with various flavours of Calbee’s Jagabee potato sticks, such as honey and butter, original and barbecue.While the creamy tartar in the Tori Nanban Jagabee Crunch (S$6.80) and the savoury mentai sauce in the Ebi Mentai Jagabee Crunch (S$6.80) were a delicious addition to the dish, overall the overload of fried food may feel a little overwhelming after a while.Our favourite is the soft cream Jagabee series (S$5.90 each), which offers a sweet and savoury end to your meal. You get to take your pick from Hokkaido milk, Japanese white peach and matcha soft serves, which sit on a bed of flavoured Jagabee potato sticks.If you’re feeling adventurous, you can order a dish of sashimi and eat it with the spicy potato chips, or wrap it around some potato sticks for a distinct crunch.The Genki Sushi-Calbee tie-up also comes with fun Instagram stickers and filters, so you can share your foodie experience on the social media platform.Search “genkisushi” in your Instagram Story edit page for stickers, and visit Genki Sushi’s Instagram profile for the filters. These will be available only until the end of the campaign on Nov 20.To celebrate Genki Sushi’s new I12 Katong outlet, it is handing out free limited-edition hoodies to customers with every S$50 nett spent — an offer exclusive to this outlet.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/september-coffee/:['I’m a little wary of restaurants and cafes that are too curated and too pretty to be true. You know the type — a well-designed logo, interiors decked out to maximum Instagram-worthy effect, and a blooming Monstera deliciosa because, well, plants.\xa0September Coffee at Chinatown is all that. But that’s not to say it’s not any good — that remains to be seen. But if first impressions are made to impress, then September Coffee has left little to the fertile imagination.\xa0The cafe’s interior is an influencer’s dream.\xa0Cream walls? Check.\xa0Tables with curves? Check.\xa0Globe lights? Check.\xa0Warm globe lights? Check.There’s also a dramatic curved entryway at the front that screams 2022 BTO-fancy. Like I said — curated.\xa0Still, I’m wary not because I don’t appreciate such aesthetics. But I wonder if it could have put a greater focus on other more pertinent aspects of the eatery.\xa0Something has to give, I reckon.\xa0Before September Coffee, the space was home to a run-of-the-mill, nondescript, functional 7-Eleven store.\xa0It makes the transformation of September Coffee all the more startling — from drab and dreary to dreamy and demure, all in one pandemic.\xa0And why September, you ask? Your guess is as good as mine, although other online reviews attribute it to the owner’s birthday month.I remember breathing a sigh of relief when I arrive on a Tuesday, at noon, for lunch. The crowd\xa0was thin, and I had free rein over where to sit.\xa0Still, the food took a tad too long to arrive — around 35 minutes for three dishes and a further 15 minutes for an appetiser.\xa0At one point, confused and famished, I stopped a server to ask if I had placed my order online correctly. “Yes, you did,” she assured me. “Your food is coming out very soon.”Surprisingly, the food I liked most was the delayed appetiser of soy glazed wings (S$12), which had the honour of being the last thing my dining partner and I ate.\xa0It was plump, juicy, and a delightful blend of savoury and sweet from the thick glaze that hugged the batter in a comforting embrace. If you’re serving crispy midjoints, this is how you do it.\xa0I’m also quite enamoured of the beef brisket (S$26), a thick square cut of beef that gives way easily when cut. Still, while tender to a fault, nearer the bottom, it did get a tad dry.\xa0But no matter. I loved that the asparagus it came with was sweet with a satisfying crunch. The potato strips also went a long way towards adding textural variance. There’s some thought put into this plate.\xa0Dessert comes by way of a September Coffee-recommended Pistachio Raspberry (S$14), which would easily draw respectable gasps from those less acquainted with the food industry.\xa0Taste-wise, it’s an easy dessert to like. There’s a pleasing tartness from the fruits (though the cranberry on the stem felt a little out of place) and a pleasant sweetness from the white chocolate ganache. The pistachio ladyfingers were a welcome surprise, since they weren’t mentioned on the menu.All in all, it’s a perfectly acceptable, average dessert.\xa0And for all intents and purposes, that’s exactly how I would describe September Coffee — perfectly acceptable. If you’re hungry and happen to be around the area, you’ll be adequately taken care of. Perhaps that would have to be good enough for now.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Feuds: Saizeriya vs Milan Shokudo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I ordered the fried chicken French toast (S$18), I wasn’t expecting it to be life-changing. I got it only because it was a September Coffee recommendation.\xa0It turned out to be noticeably lacking. The tour of disappointment starts with the thick French toast that’s fluffy but also dry on the bottom half.\xa0It needs to soak up more egg mixture, and I would recommend using two thinner, stacked slices instead.\xa0Also, the fried chicken at the top isn’t brined, so it’s not as juicy as it should be.\xa0But at least the spicy honey — a delightful mix of spice and sweetness — was good, though I thought it could have been a tad spicier for a touch more heat.\xa0Also, the menu indicated pickled Japanese cabbage in its description. Alas, that was nowhere to be seen. It’s perplexing. I wonder where it went.\xa0Elsewhere, the masago udon (S$23) would satisfy an undemanding Japanophile, which I’m not — a Japanophile, that is.\xa0This was one-note in texture and flavour, leaning too much on the cured ikura as a crutch for its savoury notes. It needs acidity and a crunch — pronto. The prices for the coffees on the menu didn’t impress me either. My first visit here before this review was just for drinks and I remember enjoying my iced French vanilla latte (S$6.50) but baulked later on at the final cost of the drink with service charge — S$8.15.\xa0For oat or soy milk, it’s an extra S$1. I don’t know about you, but S$9.15 feels like a steep price to pay for flavoured lattes.\xa0Still, the coffee here is reliable. September Coffee also has an extensive drinks menu, with an Iced Refreshers section that looks designed for the ’gram.\xa0Is it conducive to conversation? Yes, though it gets rather buzzy as the restaurant fills up.Is a reservation necessary? September Coffee accepts walk-ins only. The staff will put you on a waitlist if you arrive and there are no seats available.How to get there? It’s a short walk from Chinatown MRT station. When Maxwell MRT station along the Thomson-East Coast Line opens, it’s faster to get to the restaurant from there.\xa0HungryGoWhere paid for its meal at this cafe for this review.\xa0Book a ride to September Coffee. 258 South Bridge Road, 01-01\nOpen: Tuesday to Thursday (11.30am to 8.30pm), Friday and Saturday (11.30am to 9pm), and Sunday (11.30am to 5pm)258 South Bridge Road, 01-01\nOpen: Tuesday to Thursday (11.30am to 8.30pm), Friday and Saturday (11.30am to 9pm), and Sunday (11.30am to 5pm)Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/gyutan-tan-tanjong-pagar/:['A fan of ox tongue? Head to Gyutan-Tan, a new Japanese ox-tongue restaurant that opened along Tras Street in October.Singapore is full of eateries peddling beef of all kinds, but beef tongue is rather more uncommon.The restaurant’s name is a play on the dish — gyutan is the Japanese word for this particular cut of meat, while “tan” is also the word for charcoal.Here, the fatty delicacy is in the capable hands of chef Yoshiyuki Kuroshima, who is no stranger to the grill. He was formerly head chef at En Group, leading restaurants such as grilled donburi chain Aburi-En.The 82-seater is cosy, with woody accents and Japandi vibes. Diners with the fortune to be seated at the counter can watch their meats grilled atop the dancing embers of the binchotan (white Japanese charcoal).If you love Studio Ghibli’s body of work, you’ll also love the restaurant’s gorgeous anime-inspired illustrated walls — all equally whimsical.One mural tells the story of a young girl discovering a forest of cat-like farmers. Another depicts bubbling shabu-shabu stock simmering gloriously over a fire, with a freshly cracked egg and thick, moist slices of meat stewing within. It’s simply mouthwatering.Food-wise, lunch sets here are hearty and start from S$18. We tried the sumiyaki gyutan combo set (S$25), which comes with a plate of beef tongue slices — diners have the choice of thin and thick slices, or a mix of both — alongside shoyu pickles and lightly dressed salad. It’s also accompanied by mugimeshi (barley and rice), tororo (a sticky paste of grated Japanese yam), and flavourful oxtail soup, to round off the meal.Diners must choose one of five house sauces to go with their meals: Original (a soy-based housemade sauce); ponzu oroshi (ponzu with grated radish); Korean (a sweet-and-spicy rendition based on the popular Korean yangnyeom sauce); negi shio (a salt-based sauce with leek and black pepper); and lemon pepper.Each has its merits, but we particularly enjoyed the Korean and lemon pepper variants, which went well with the creaminess of the ox tongue.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50% off at picturesque date spots, including Wildseed Cafe at The Alkaff Mansion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the a la carte menu, the Gyutan demi-glace stew (from S$20), done in the classic Japanese-French fusion style with chunks of gyutan, is a must-try.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/2022-food-trends-grab/:['Scoot over bubble tea — coconut shakes are Singapore’s most well-loved drink these days.The creamy, refreshing beverage has been gaining traction as Singapore’s go-to thirst quencher. In 2022, coconut shakes outpaced milk tea to a greater extent than in the year before, shooting up to second place on GrabFood’s most-ordered list.\xa0That’s according to superapp Grab and its latest SG Food & Grocery Trends report.The 2022 report, released on Wednesday (Nov 9), is based on data from orders placed through its GrabFood and GrabMart delivery services, trend analysis, expert interviews and industry sources, and primary research in six countries.If you’re a food and grocery delivery addict, the findings are pretty interesting. But in case you’re not up to reading all 45 pages, we’ve done it so you don’t have to. Here’s a TL;DR:\xa0When it comes to Singapore’s most popular GrabFood orders, coconut shakes took one of the top spots. It rose two places — from No 4 in 2021 to its current rank at No 2.It was beaten only by burgers, which remained at No 1 since 2020.The report also revealed that coconut shakes were among the most popular beverages ordered during lunch (11am to 3pm), tea (3pm to 6pm) and dinner (6pm to 10pm).Milk tea orders held steady in sixth place.Burger fans: You probably contributed to this statistic.\nThis means more than seven million burgers were sold in Singapore on Grab’s food delivery service in 2021.In Singapore, burgers were the most popular orders on GrabFood in 2021 and 2022.\xa0Burgers trumped prata, which took the No 2 spot in 2021 but slipped to No 3 in 2022. The early bird catches the toast-and-eggs worm, it seems. Breakfast staples of coffee, toast, sandwiches, soft-boiled eggs, and mee siam make up the most-ordered items from 5am to 11am.\nMeanwhile, Singaporeans tend to indulge after the sun sets. Ice cream, nuggets and instant noodles are the foods of choice for supper, from 10pm to 5am.Here are the top eats throughout the day: If you came down with coronavirus in 2022 and were told to drink more liang teh (cooling tea) and coconut water, this one’s for you.Covid-19 test kits and home remedies were among the 10 most popular orders on GrabMart in 2022.\xa0Think cooling water, ART (antigen rapid test) kits, and chrysanthemum or herbal teas. These items pushed out hot favourites from 2021, including daily groceries such as bottled water, ice, and fruit.In Singapore, one Covid test kit was sold via GrabMart every two minutes in 2022.I’m guilty of this myself — heading to my favourite food delivery app and looking around aimlessly until I find something that hits the spot.\nIt’s usually because I’m searching for the cheapest eats, so it’s all about the offers or bundle meals to get the most value from my order.\xa0I do sometimes find a new food store that I probably wouldn’t have tried otherwise. And I’m not alone in this — according to the report, 90 per cent of users did the same, too.Wow, that’s a sizeable order. We wonder what eatery that was from and how many people they were feeding.We’ll probably continue to see larger orders — the average GrabFood basket size grew 15 per cent between 2019 and 2022, based on the report.GrabFood users are also more interested in healthy and meatless options these days, with vegetarian food becoming the most-searched cuisine on GrabFood in 2022.\xa0Korean food was dethroned from its No 1 spot in 2021, dropping to No 3 in 2022. Thai food took second place.\xa0In that vein, more people are on the lookout for healthy and plant-based alternatives.GrabFood orders for healthy meals have shot up in the last three years. Between 2019 and 2022, it’s grown four-fold. This is especially so during lunch, with lunchtime orders for healthy food outpacing those at any other time of the day.Three out of five Grab users surveyed in Singapore said that they have tried plant-based alternatives in the last six months.Make an order on the GrabFood delivery service.AuthorJia-En has worn several hats in her career — first writing TV scripts, then food and lifestyle stories at Wine & Dine.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/penny-university-reopens/:['Popular brunch cafe Penny University is reopening by the end of November, its founder Mouss Kamal told HungryGoWhere in a phone interview earlier this week. The cafe had moved out of its East Coast premises in early October after 10 years in operation.Mouss said that its new three-storey outlet at 17 Jalan Klapa in Bugis is three times the size of its previous East Coast store. The new outlet has stone and gravel elements as well as earthy furnishings, which lend the cafe its peaceful and minimalistic ambience.Spanning about 3,500 sqf, the store will have two levels dedicated to dining — including outdoor seating — while the third floor is being set aside for coffee-brewing classes for the public in the near future.\xa0It’s not only the cafe’s size that has grown. Penny University looks set to expand its specialty coffee selection and begin serving dinner daily in the new Jalan Klapa outlet.\xa0In the past, its coffee bar used to carry only one single-origin coffee in its menu. With the reopening, it now plans to serve at least three single-origin coffee options. These include anaerobic fermented beans from Colombia and exotic fruit beans from Rwanda.For the uninitiated, single-origin coffee comprises beans that are harvested from one producer in a certain region or country. As the beans are derived from a single source, single-origin coffee tends to be more exotic and of higher quality.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Feuds: Saizeriya vs Milan Shokudo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the first time, Penny University will also start to serve a daily dinner menu. It has dabbled with the idea of serving the dinner crowd before, having conducted a quarterly, and then monthly, private multi-course dinner session for customers at its former East Coast store.Mouss envisions a “sharing, communal-like dining experience” for its dinner service. Instead of the usual course of appetisers, mains and desserts, the cafe will serve what he calls “small and large plates”.Guests can order a selection of items from the menu in small and big portions, depending on their preference that night. It is a “playful and casual approach” to ordering, enjoying and sharing the food in the cafe, he added.\xa0Penny University is on the GrabFood delivery service.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/the-whisking-well-closing/:['Artisanal online bakery The Whisking Well — known for its handcrafted bakes such as burnt cheesecakes and brownies — will be ceasing operations some time mid-January 2023.Speaking to HungryGoWhere, the 28-year-old owner Francesco Lee said: “I’ve decided to discontinue my lease and take a break from doing F&B for a while. The rising cost of rental and ingredients are getting too high.”Lee also cited other reasons, such as his health and well-being, for closing the bakery. Commenting that the hours have been “insane”, he added that he has compromised his health for the sake of the business, especially in recent months.The work has been particularly challenging because his business partner, Jaz-ley Tan, pulled out of the business in April.Since then, he has been shouldering the load alone. “This level of discomfort helped me to groom my character as well as resilience. Also, I picked up skills I never thought I would enjoy doing, such as taking pictures and doing videos!”Lee said he has no plans for The Whisking Well after its lease ends at The Promenade @ Pelikat.Lee started The Whisking Well in 2018 as a home-based business, using “the remaining S$300” of his savings, under a different name. He rebranded to The Whisking Well in 2020, during the pandemic.At the beginning, he would supplement his income with odd jobs. As Tan was working as a freelance digital marketer, she would help with baking and marketing tasks in her free time. After business picked up, he asked her to come on board as a partner, he said.Lee’s aim from the get-go was to create healthier bakes without compromising on the quality and essence of his goods.He began sourcing natural and substitute ingredients. As such, his baked goods use 50 per cent less sugar than an average recipe, he said. His first two products — burnt cheesecakes and brownies — remain the brand’s bestsellers.In October 2020, they moved to a kitchen in Jalan Pelikat, which also serves as a location for pick-ups. Considering how humbly the business began, Lee said he felt the business “fared pretty well”. He added: “There were shaky months; however, The Whisking Well always manages to pull through.”For now, you can make your purchases on its online bakery and opt for delivery or pick-ups from Jalan Pelikat. On weekends, it serves special items that you can buy off the shelf. Previous limited-edition bakes include vanilla-rum caneles and cheddar scones.Lee said he is exploring opening up the outlet for walk-ins during the Christmas period. He also plans to open for walk-ins every day during the last week of operation, until he sells out.After the lease ends, Lee plans to take a few months off to travel. “I haven’t been able to have free time the past few years, as my leave and days off are usually used for things such as reservist and settling back-end things for the business.”He also has a new home-based project in the works — Kingchi, which sells high-quality kimchi using ingredients and recipes from South Korea.He said he started it to “counter the rising cost of ingredients and overheads”. “It’s more of a passion project,” he added. He plans to continue Kingchi and start a YouTube channel focusing on recipe videos when he has more time in February next year.As for The Whisking Well, he has not completely written off starting it again.“I’m still exploring opportunities and ideas for The Whisking Well,” he said.You can book a ride to The Whisking Well.The Promenade @ Pelikat, 01-73, 183 Jalan Pelikat\nNearest MRT station: Kovan\nOpen: Wednesday to Friday (12pm to 4pm, self-pickups), Saturday and Sunday (11.30am to 5pm, self-pickups), Monday to Sunday (24 hours, online orders)The Promenade @ Pelikat, 01-73, 183 Jalan Pelikat\nNearest MRT station: Kovan\nOpen: Wednesday to Friday (12pm to 4pm, self-pickups), Saturday and Sunday (11.30am to 5pm, self-pickups), Monday to Sunday (24 hours, online orders)AuthorDarren finds delight in the simple pleasures of life, which include his work, music and taking time to savour and document the diverse array of food around him.© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/singapore-food-festival-2022/:['It’s time to throw on your stretchiest pants as the yearly Singapore Food Festival returns from Aug 24 to Sept 11 with more than 70 gastronomic experiences. This is the first time in two years that the event is having a physical Festival Village — housing more than 25 eateries — since the coronavirus pandemic hit. The 2020 edition of the event was virtual, while the 2021 edition took a hybrid format.This year’s festival, themed “Real Foodies Only”, comprises several elements, including limited-time menus at partner restaurants, tours, workshops, and online offerings.Some of the more interesting flavours you can expect are a curry bagelwich from popular joint Two Men Bagel House that will feature flavours of Chinese, Indian and Malay curries as well as a sambal goreng pizza from Italian restaurant Dopo Teatro at the Esplanade.They are among restaurants islandwide offering festival-exclusive menu items. Don’t miss out, too, on a one-day pop-up collaboration between Steeple’s Deli and Park Bench Deli on Sept 4, featuring sandwiches that incorporate Steeple’s mouthwatering corned beef and Park Bench Deli’s pastrami.At the Festival Village — happening at the Bayfront Event Space, next to Marina Bay Sands, from Aug 31 to Sept 11 — you’ll be treated to familiar dishes with innovative twists.The Goodburger food truck is teaming up with Chinese eatery Blue Lotus Eating House to create a Festival Village-only plant-based golden chilli crab burger, while newly minted Michelin Bib Gourmand stall One Prawn & Co partners with heritage brand Hock Lian Huat to present a thick, silky prawn bisque with shrimps, mussels and clams as well as a ngoh hiang (five-spiced meat roll) platter.If you’re looking for something even more special, check out the Chef Arena within the Festival Village, which will host a nine-course dinner by top culinary masters featured in this year’s online masterclasses. The dinner will come with a Martell Noblige cocktail by Juan Yi Jun, head bartender of No Sleep Club, which holds the 15th spot on Asia’s 50 Best Bars 2022 list.There will also be tours and workshops happening around the island during this time, as fish farm Atlas Aquaculture and shrimp farm Blue Aqua take you on a trip to land-based farms. There, visitors can learn more about where their food originates and how they can harvest their own shrimp at home.If you prefer experiencing the festival from the comfort of your home or are tuning in from abroad, there will be nine free online masterclasses that will allow you to cook along with renowned culinary talents. These include a “four hands” collaboration between pastry chef Maira Yeo of Cloudstreet — who was this year crowned Asia’s Best Pastry Chef — and chef Justin Lee of JL Dessert Bar in Seoul, South Korea. There are accompanying food kits available for these masterclasses, but they are available for delivery only in Singapore.At a media preview of the Singapore Food Festival on Thursday (Aug 11), chef Damian D’Silva of Peranakan eatery Rempapa was asked how a chef should navigate culinary journeys, so that the essence of a dish isn’t lost.The MasterChef Singapore judge said: “When trying to modernise it, the first step is you have to know how to execute the traditional dish and techniques, in terms of flavours.“Once you get that right, then you can do whatever you want to do with it. But it’s important that you get that right.”Ms Teyi Guo, retail and dining director at the Singapore Tourism Board, was also asked how she sees the story of Singapore food and its flavours travelling the world.She pointed to chef exchanges, where Singapore chefs work with their foreign counterparts.“That’s when the vision happens; that’s when we challenge each other to say ‘what are the traditional flavours that need modernising, in a different context?’.\xa0“Then, it also brings the stories behind the food to different consumers out there. You’ll learn the culture of Singapore through food.”A single weekday ticket to the Festival Village starts from S$15 and a single weekend ticket starts from S$20.Book a ride to the Singapore Food Festival 2022.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/jelebu-dry-laksa/:['Among the most interesting things to rise out of the pandemic are the F&B businesses that mushroomed on Instagram. The menu is posted to Instagram, you order on Instagram, and once you’ve wired some money through, a hot package soon arrives on your doorstep — or something like that.Just recently, we wrote about Burger Daddy peddling dry-aged smash burgers from a condo balcony and Ground Floor Coffee, which sells fresh cups of joe from the window of an HDB flat.\xa0Some of them, like Jelebu Dry Laksa, have even transitioned to new digs and morphed into full-fledged businesses, and I’m all for it.“Jelebu” refers to Jelebu Road in Bukit Panjang, where chef Renee Tang launched the home-based venture from her kitchen in 2020 with one simple dish: Dry laksa cooked in a rempah instead of broth, then zhng-ed with lobster and tiger prawns.It became an instant hit and, since then, she’s done a pop-up at the now-defunct Takeshi Noodle Bar, and more recently, at the Singapore Food Festival.\xa0In late September, she started her first brick-and-mortar restaurant at the VivoCity mega-mall with backing from the Tipsy Collective, which owns a slew of bars across the island.With its tasteful retro outfit and prettily plated creations, Jelebu Dry Laksa is off to a promising start. Prices are what you’d expect from a casual restaurant — more value-for-money than comparable mod-Sin (modern Singaporean) names, but still considerably pricier than your garden-variety hawker centre laksa.\xa0The entry-level “kosong” with crispy ebi is S$12, while the more premium options run up to S$58 for one with Boston lobster. There are other mains such as a butter chicken mac & cheese, which is quite tasty.Chef Tang does a wonderful job of taking inspiration from a moment of her life and family, and turning them into flavourful creations with a touch of old-school elements.Dry laksa, also known as laksa goreng, isn’t exactly new.\xa0You’ll sometimes find it in Peranakan or Eurasian restaurants around Singapore.\xa0Forgoing the broth for rempah, it’s wok-fried instead of boiled, and has all the hallmark flavours of laksa without the occasional sogginess.\xa0Better still, it’s splatter-free, which I suppose makes it ideal for dates.Jelebu’s is one of the more unique versions of laksa goreng I’ve had the pleasure of tasting.\xa0Chef Tang’s rempah recipe boasts some 12 types of spices and herb, and the rice noodles are thinner than the thick bee hoon typically used in laksa, with a fantastic al dente texture and creamy umami that I’m told comes from a combination of young coconut milk — which tends to be sweeter than mature coconut — and a heady shrimp rempah.The laksa is available in several variations: Kosong (S$12), grilled tiger prawn (S$18), and the luxe butter-poached lobster (S$38 for half and S$58 for a whole crustacean).\xa0We found ourselves going for the cheaper two of the lot, starting with the kosong. Crispy sakura shrimp, fresh blood cockles, tau pok, fishcake, beansprouts, and a sweet sambal — the ingredients, while served “dry”, are soaked full of flavour, and the crispy ebi adds a seafood-y umami note that keeps us going back.\xa0The grilled tiger prawn version features fairly large prawns charred with a smoky wok hei finish.\xa0The laksa can be a tad spicy, especially if you mix in all the sambal, so you might want to wash it down with a shrimp, luffa and egg soup (S$10). It’s a simple, belly-warming dish — mildly sweet and very nourishing, like something mum might make on a rainy day.Eastern flavours meet the West with the butter chicken mac and cheese (S$26), a twist on the classic with a chunky helping of spicy butter chicken.\xa0The cheese combo is a complex blend of nutty red cheddar and meaty smoked scamorza, which works well with the heat from the cream. Yum, yum, and yum.As expected of the Tipsy brand, Jelebu Dry Laksa has plenty to offer on the beverage front, including cocktails such as a Hendrick’s gin bandung drink, beers and wines.\xa0But it’s the housemade iced drinks that got our attention. The Tang Brew (S$5) is a fragrant lemon tea spruced up with a dehydrated lemon slice and kaffir lime leaf. Or try the Ah Ma Barley (S$5) with young ginger, lemon and rock sugar. Granted, it’s expensive for a barley drink, but it’s probably the most delicious version I’ve drunk, ever!Dessert comes in the form of mini-cones filled with sweet kaya mousse accompanied by coconut ice cream, crushed peanuts and chocolate soil crumble.\xa0The kaya goreng (S$12) is conceptually interesting but feels a bit too gimmicky for a restaurant like this.\xa0Do I take a bite of the cone (which could be crispier) and then another bite of the ice cream? Or do I scoop a bit of everything on top of the cone? I tried both and am thrown off either way — mostly because of the slightly salty coconut flakes and overly sweet kaya.There’s another creation with rice-krispie-coated goreng pisang and dark chocolate sorbet that looks promising, and we might try it the next time we return.I’m not sure if dessert is the strong suit here, but if Chef Tang manages to maintain the standard of cooking, she’s all good.\xa0After all, Jelebu Dry Laksa is the kind of nostalgic and relatable spot that the crowd tends to relish.Is it conducive to conversation? Yes, the eatery is spacious and suitable for group hangouts.Is a reservation necessary? Only walk-ins are available!How to get there?

While the cafe aims to reach out to the younger generation, its social mission remains at the heart of its operations – to assist the disadvantaged elderly in the neighbourhood.\xa0By day, it’s a cafe that also serves as a space to run a dementia programme for its elderly residents. By night, it’s a private dining experience for chefs who’d like to host friends.\xa0Raymond Khoo, founder of The Saturday Movement, has been serving the Lengkok Bahru community for almost a decade. In his time here, he has seen many residents suffering from dementia.\xa0It spurred him to build a space to aid the underserved elderly in the neighbourhood. He did his own research and came up with a dementia programme that involved activities such as gardening and interaction with student volunteers.But instead of using the space purely for the programme, he decided to come up with an alternative concept to the community kitchen to entice a younger, cafe-loving crowd.\xa0S17 Community Cafe was thus born.\xa0The cafe was also designed with the comfort of residents in mind. For example, the interior of the cafe is lined with carpets to prevent sounds from bouncing, which could confuse those with dementia. For Khoo, the cafe is also a way to bring Singaporeans to the neighbourhood and highlight that there are people in this country who are living in poverty. Even if you don’t often see it.\xa0“In Singapore, everyone is always looking for different places to go. This could be one of the places,” said Khoo.\xa0\xa0Run by a small group of paid staff living in the residential area, S17 Community Cafe has a slim but intriguing menu.\xa0\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Feuds: Saizeriya vs Milan Shokudo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe two main food items are staple brunch options — a French crepe suzette (S$17.50) or an all-day breakfast with fresh greens, truffle scrambled eggs and chicken ham (S$18), served with your choice of waffles or pancakes.Aside from the usual coffee and tea, S17 Community Cafe serves an iced blue pea flower drink (S$7). The blue pea flowers are harvested from its mini-garden, then boiled in hot water and honey to make the drink. The light and slightly sweet flower is also incorporated into an agar, a jelly-like substance, which comes with the drink.Khoo said that the cafe plans to expand its vegetable garden, as gardening has been suggested to be beneficial in stimulating the brains of those suffering from dementia.\xa0As part of its opening promotion, the cafe will be offering a 50 per cent discount off the total bill until Nov 30.\xa0\xa0From 6.30pm, chefs from different backgrounds are able to cook and host their friends at S17 Community Cafe. Khoo said that it’d give the chefs an opportunity to cook for guests without worrying about the clean-up.\xa0So far, it has had a line-up ranging from home cooks to chefs from Michelin-starred restaurants hosting private events there.

These come in rectangular slices and have a thinner, airier crust than the Neapolitan pizzas that we may be used to seeing.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Feuds: Saizeriya vs Milan Shokudo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are 10 toppings, including classic ones such as margherita (S$6) and burrata cheese (S$9.50), to more elaborate ones such as the decadent Bacon Rado (S$8), a cheese-laden pizza with mozzarella, brie, parmesan and ricotta cheeses.If you loved the unique texture of the dough, then the new sandwiches have that in spades. At present, there are four making their debut.\xa0For a lighter meal, choose the Focaccia Mortadela (S$20) with burrata cheese, mortadella (thinly shaved slices of pork sausage or meat), fresh tomatoes and rocket.\xa0If you prefer something stronger, there’s the Focaccia Tartufata (S$22). This flavourful sandwich features a thick coat of truffle cream on its bread base, before being laden with Parma ham and two types of cheeses: Mozzarella and parmesan.We especially liked the Focaccia Buffulo (S$18) of beef pastrami, basil pesto, baked peppers, and caramelised onions. The textures and flavours married well — the pesto and onions, in particular, gave the sandwich a much-needed lift.Rounding out the menu is the meaty Focaccia Salami (S$19), with salame piccante (cured salami), porchetta and mozzarella cheese.The sandwiches, while tasty, proved to be quite a mouthful to eat, however.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/taste-test-mcdonalds-hawaiian-grilled-chicken-burger-and-more/:["The World Cup tournament kicked off last Sunday (Nov 20) and it has been nothing short of dazzling, with plenty of thrills and spills and stunning upsets. If you’ve been staying up to root for your favourite teams, chances are, you’d be famished from all that cheering and fist pumping.McDonald’s hopes to save the day with its slew of new products. Launched on Thursday (Nov 24), they comprise the Hawaiian Grilled Chicken Burger, Smoky BBQ Chicken Burger and Potato Pops.Will McDonald’s pull off a hat-trick with its trio of new items? Or will the dishes hit the post and go wide?\xa0Football metaphors aside, we put the items through a taste test to find out how they fare.First up was the Hawaiian Grilled Chicken Burger (from S$9.90 for a special set meal).\xa0Our verdict: GOALLL!The sweet and tangy pineapple slice was a stand-out, its flavours pairing incredibly well with the spicy mayonnaise. When combined with the juicy grilled chicken patty and soft sesame buns, each bite was complex yet delicious.If there’s one thing we felt the burger lacked, it was an ingredient with texture. Instead of the thin slice of chicken ham, which did not add much to the overall flavour profile, something crunchy or crispy would have made the dish more complete.\xa0\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMcDonald’s x New Jeans: Limited-time sweet & spicy McCrispy, Korean fried chicken style\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10 Suntec City dinner spots for every budget\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFree hashbrowns & coffee with KFC's breakfast Original Recipe Riser deal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we tried the Smoky BBQ Chicken Burger (from S$9.90 for a special set meal).Our verdict: MISS.This was our least favourite among the lot. With a name like “Smoky BBQ”, we expected flavours that were slightly charred and packed an earthy punch. However, the burger tasted like any regular crispy chicken burger. There was too little smoky barbecue sauce on top of our patty to bring forth any impact.We did enjoy the crunch of the crispy chicken ham patty and the savoury touch of the chicken bacon. The new dark malt buns had a sweet and nutty flavour, too.\xa0In our opinion, these buns taste better than the charcoal ones used for the Ninja burger, another McDonald’s offering.We saved the best for the last, the Potato Pops (S$4.20).Our verdict: STUNNING GOALLL!These fried, golden balls of potato goodness were amazing. Akin to tater tots, they were super crispy on the outside and pillowy soft on the inside.\xa0McDonald’s has infused a mix of herbs and spices in these Potato Pops, so there’s a tinge of spiciness. We’ve always paired McDonald’s fries or hash browns with its garlic chilli sauce, but this time round, we didn’t need to — the Potato Pops were simply delicious on their own!\xa0We’re not afraid to say this: McDonald’s has to make Potato Pops a permanent feature on its menu!\xa0The Hawaiian Grilled Chicken Burger, Smoky BBQ Chicken Burger and Potato Pops are available after breakfast hours at 11am on weekdays, and 12pm on weekends, for takeaways or dine-in at all McDonald’s restaurants.This is the first time the three items are featured on McDonald’s menu in Singapore.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/singapores-national-culinary-team/:['While the Olympics and Fifa World Cup are international sporting events that get the attention of viewers globally, not many know of the various world cups of the culinary world.\xa0Although lacking in fanfare, these competitions are no less gruelling.\xa0Some competitions last a few days, each day a 10-hour affair with no time to rest in between. Ranging from hot dishes to elaborate pastry showpieces, culinary world cups are a show of technique, teamwork, immaculate hygiene practices, and resourcefulness.\xa0\xa0Representing Singapore for the past 39 years is our very own National Culinary Team, a brigade of chefs handpicked by the Singapore Chefs’ Association from the culinary competition circuit.\xa0The team for 2022 is made up of Koh Han Jie (team captain), Kong Kok Kiang (team manager), Darren Chin Shiong Wei, Aloysius Tay Yu Wei, Marvas Ng, Gabriel Kwang (team assistant), Ben Goh Kai Chuen (pastry chef), and Wee Pai Hau (pastry assistant).This year’s eight-member team is led by team captain Koh, 29, head chef at floral-themed French concept Ce Soir Restaurant. A graduate of the Institute of Paul Bocuse culinary arts programme, he cut his teeth at Michelin-starred French restaurants such as Maison Pic and, closer to home, Les Amis.Not his first rodeo, he was in the National Culinary Team when Singapore took part in the Expogast Culinary World Cup 2018 and won second place. In the same year, he won the world champion title at the Young Talent Escoffier competition.Another veteran is 36-year-old Goh, who leads the pastry section. With 14 years of competing experience, the oldest in the group returned from Shangri-La Guangzhou to take part in this year’s world cup.\xa0When HungryGoWhere caught up with both of them at Temasek Polytechnic one evening, the team was busy practising for their involvement in this year’s Expogast Culinary World Cup, on Nov 27 and 30, in Luxembourg.\xa0The competition includes two components this year — Restaurant of Nations, where they’ll have to cook a three-course meal for 110 guests over five hours, and Chef’s Table, another three-course meal but with a chocolate showpiece at the end.\xa0Racking up a total of 3,260 hours of training by the time the competition rolls around, they practise fine-tuning their workflow and processes (the team will also be judged in the kitchen on their hygiene), with the members typically convening after finishing their day jobs. Sometimes, they meet on their days off as well.\xa0It’s a scheduling feat to get together eight busy chefs at the same time for many days on end and all that comes down to Koh as team captain.\xa0“We are all from different companies and we have to squeeze time out of our schedules to train together. That’s the toughest part. It also takes a long time for us to come up with a dish, between nine months and a year,” he said.He’s also responsible for looking for a kitchen to practise in. So far, they’ve borrowed kitchens at Koh’s own place of work, Sentosa Golf Club (where team manager Kong works), and Temasek Polytechnic.\xa0Sadly, the Singapore National Culinary Team isn’t given the same support offered in competing countries. In European nations such as Norway and Sweden, two top countries in the competition circuit, the national team is paid to practise full-time and have facilities built solely for it.\xa0Instead, team Singapore has had to rely on corporate sponsors for funding, and help from their mentors who are past winners. Koh added: “(You can imagine) the amount of passion you need to have when you have work commitments and family.”\xa0Like all athletes, sacrifices have to be made when training for competitions. The team forgoes time with their families and friends in the lead-up, spending their effort on research and planning the minutiae of logistics.\xa0They’re given one tonne of cargo to transport equipment and ingredients needed for Expogast. To recreate their dishes in the simple kitchen space they’re provided with, they’ll need to bring trays, chopping boards and their knives, of course. Specific ingredients are brought over to ensure the exact same flavour and texture can be recreated in a foreign country.“We also have to do one round of tastings there because even the tap water might taste different. It comes down to small details, such as the weather — it’s winter there,” Koh said.Aside from conducting R&D in the kitchen, he keeps an eye on culinary trends, making a note on how eating habits have shifted to become more environmentally- and health-conscious in the last few years. This year’s Expogast has also called for a plant-based course for the Restaurant of Nations segment.\xa0For Goh, practice makes perfect, given that his dessert has 15 elements of varying temperatures. The entire recipe for his elaborate dessert course is four pages long. He’ll keep on tweaking it until the team leaves for Luxembourg.And away from the kitchen at night, he uses a little trick of putting a piece of paper and a pen by his bedside, in case an idea comes to him. “I’m scared to forget anything so I need to record everything,” he quipped.But the one thing they both agree on is that rest and stamina are essential to thrive in culinary competitions. Faced with more than 20 hours on their feet and dealing with hot temperatures in close quarters, being physically unprepared could mean an extremely sore body after and, at the very worst, serious injuries.Goh recounted the 2018 Mondial Des Arts Sucres competition in Paris, where he got burnt by sugar heated to 180ºC. The accident occured in the last hour of a 10-hour-long day, but Goh persevered and even returned on the second day for another 10 hours of competing. He eventually won third place, his first time on a European podium.\xa0“I still keep the picture so I can look at it when I feel pain or down to remind myself how painful it was,” he said with a laugh.\xa0While Singapore’s National Culinary Team has fared quite well in past competitions, taking the top three spots consistently and winning three championships in the past decade, most of the public remain oblivious to their achievements.\xa0Even so, the experience offers a rare opportunity for the chefs to flex their creative muscles and those taking part see it as a way to better themselves. In a pressure-cooker environment twice as taxing as a regular kitchen, they learn to conduct themselves as professionals and keep their cool.\xa0Added Koh: “As chefs, we do want to get used to working in stressful environments, to help us get to another level. It forces us to be creative and come up with new dishes, too. It also gives us more confidence to cook in the style we want.”For now, they have their sights on first place on the podium as they continue to practise, while juggling full-time jobs and family. “It’s all or nothing,” Koh said with a glint in his eye.\xa0AuthorYawen has written a lot about food in her previous roles as the editor-in-chief of Wine & Dine and later as the associate digital editor of The Peak.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/mcdonalds-breakfast-bagel/:["We received the mind bagel-ling news on Wednesday (Nov 2) that McDonald’s is launching a new breakfast item, and we knew we had to try it when it came out. Launched on Thursday, the obviously named Breakfast Bagel comprises sliced cheese, egg, mushrooms and chicken ham nestled within two halves of a wholemeal bagel.\xa0It is available for a limited time, till Dec 7.HungryGoWhere grabbed a Breakfast Bagel on the way to the office on Friday. Will we rave over this new item, as much as we did McDonald’s new Chicken McCrispy Honey Soy?Here’s what we found.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMcDonald’s x New Jeans: Limited-time sweet & spicy McCrispy, Korean fried chicken style\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFree hashbrowns & coffee with KFC's breakfast Original Recipe Riser deal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTexas Chicken now 24/7 in Singapore & launches two new breakfast burgers, available from 4am\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt first glance, the Breakfast Bagel (S$4.80) looked pretty delicious, with a nice spring to the bagel and gooey cheese oozing from the sides. The addition of mushrooms was also a treat, as the ingredient is rarely included in a McDonald’s breakfast item.\xa0We took our first bite, however, and instantly winced at how salty it was. The two slices of cheddar cheese were a bit of an overkill, and when combined with the chicken ham, lent too much saltiness to the bagel. We tried dipping it into some garlic chilli sauce to balance out the flavours, but even that couldn’t save the day.\xa0The wholemeal bagel bun was a pleasant surprise, though. The bagel was more dense than the soft English muffins used in the McMuffin, and we enjoyed its chewy texture. We also liked that it was lightly toasted, as the crispy crusts around the edges made the experience that much more pleasant.Special mention goes to the thick and succulent mushrooms, which were a nice, earthy addition. We did wish that the bagel came with a sweet-savoury mushroom sauce, as that would have helped counteract the saltiness from the cheese slices and ham.While the experience was underwhelming, we felt that the new Breakfast Bagel was a good attempt by McDonald’s to introduce something different. We hope to see more filling options in the future. We’d probably scrap one of the cheese slices on our next try, though.McDonald’s is on the GrabFood delivery service.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/riang/:['It’s been three days since my visit to Riang, and I still don’t know how to properly define how the all-day bistro came about.\xa0Taking over the space once occupied by Babba, Riang — named after the road it’s situated at — can be considered, I suppose, a relaunch with a different name.\xa0Perhaps it’s more like a rebrand, albeit with interiors kept intact and only the signboard swapped for something new.\xa0The other significant change is, of course, the cuisine. Riang switches out Babba’s Peranakan fare for a menu more in line with the brand’s big brother, The Brewing Ground in Joo Chiat.Like its predecessor, Riang is a newish concept by the brilliant minds behind the always-packed, always-busy The Brewing Ground, situated within The Yards at Joo Chiat Place.And while I’m not one to reminisce, Riang has a backstory, existing formerly as Peranakan eating house Babba, which I reviewed three months ago.\xa0Here, I would like to sound a note of caution. At that time, I mentioned that this restaurant is within walking distance of Serangoon MRT station — it is not quite so, unless you enjoy walking, of course. Even the nearest bus stop is a distance away.\xa0This means the only customers with convenient access to Riang are residents who live in the landed homes within the estate. If Riang wants to attract and enjoy patronage from beyond the neighbourhood, it needs food that makes the trip from anywhere else outside this radius worthwhile.It’s a smart move for Riang to offer a menu that takes judicious inspiration from the tried-and-tested formula of all-day brunch fare at The Brewing Ground.\xa0For instance, the avocado tartine (S$18) is a close copy, minus the ricotta. It’s exactly as I remember it — reasonably seasoned with chunky bits of avocado that give this avocado-toast adjacent some much-needed texture.\xa0It comes served with a bright dash of acidity from the pickled shallots and sweetness from the cherry tomatoes. It’s an academically sound plate that, if I were to be exacting, could be elevated with a crack of black pepper.\xa0Similarly, the fish and chips (S$24) is a meal that a child would enjoy thoroughly and an adult could hardly complain about. The fish used is an Atlantic cod, coated with a flavourful batter and fried expertly, such that there’s barely any trace of oil seen.\xa0Here, the star is the Atlantic cod, which is thick, flaky and firm.\xa0It’s hard to eat this with cutlery because the fish comes apart in large, clean chunks. I gave up and went in with my fingers, dipping the cod into the tartar sauce. I suggest you do the same.I also thoroughly enjoyed the potato and leek croquette burger (S$16), a vegetarian delight for practitioners of the diet. Sandwiched between two buns is a potato and leek croquette that’s flavourful, thick and a great way to trick fussy kids into eating their vegetables. A parent would rejoice.The loaded crab fries (S$10) is the perfect example of overpromising and underdelivering.\xa0First, it’s not loaded. Second, I’m not quite sure what “crab” here refers to.\xa0Is it perhaps the chilli-crab sauce splotched over the fries that tastes like a ready-made convenience bought off a supermarket shelf? I don’t mind the shortcut, but at least throw in some chunks of crabmeat so the dish lives up to the expectations of its name.\xa0I’m not a big fan of the sticky date pudding (S$12) either. It’s neither a pudding nor is it sticky.\xa0Imagine my disappointment when this is served as is, sans caramel sauce, which is what makes such puddings “sticky”.\xa0\xa0Absent that glaring omission, I wouldn’t call this a pudding. It’s a cake and a good one at that, served with a scoop of yoghurt speculoos gelato that’s pleasantly tart. But a sticky date pudding it is not.\xa0In some ways, Riang’s sticky date pudding is a perfect metaphor for what the restaurant makes itself out to be. It’s excellent in some parts, but it has just a tiny bit more to go before it measures up to the excellence of the original.\xa0Is it conducive to conversation? Yes. Seats are well-spaced.\xa0Is a reservation necessary? Riang takes reservations only for weekdays as well as weekend dinners. For brunch on weekends and public holidays, do walk in.\xa0How to get there? Bus services 58 or 103 stops at Serangoon Avenue 3, which is 400m away.\n\xa0HungryGoWhere paid for its meal at this restaurant for this review.Riang is on the GrabFood delivery service.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/tres-sombreros-upper-east-coast/:['My fondest memory of a recent visit to Tres Sombreros, a new Mexican eatery on Upper East Coast Road, was a table of six middle-aged Caucasian ladies, each sipping from a tall goblet of white wine, engaged in convivial but hushed conversations.I remember this clearly because it’s a sight I’ve never seen during my restaurant visits.\xa0Something else I don’t often witness is a solo diner who left his plate of quesadilla almost untouched. He’s probably not that hungry, I hope.But I digress.\xa0Tres Sombreros (Spanish for “three hats”) is Upper East Coast Road’s answer to unfussy Mexican fare. It joins the likes of other Mexican eateries nearby — Platypus Cantina, Lower East Side Tacqueria, and Guzman Y Gomez at i12 Katong mall.\xa0A few units down from Tres Sombreros sit Tiong Bahru Bakery and Mikawa Yakitori Bar — both heavyweights in their cuisine class.\xa0Suffice it to say, Tres Sombreros has its work cut out.\xa0And I don’t say this lightly. This stretch of the east veering into Katong is home to many F&B greats — here, no one is hard up for options.\xa0I can’t wait to see what tricks Tres Sombreros has up its sleeves.I had to order the elotes (S$7) because I have an unhealthy obsession with corn.\xa0Here, it comes barbecued and served with crumbly feta. The half-cobs are coated with mildly spiced chipotle mayo and a simply named “Mexican spice blend” dusting that lends a nice heat to the entire presentation.\xa0Elsewhere, a basket of wings (S$18 for six) comes with sauce options such as BBQ and hot sauce. I went for the mango habanero, a riotous blend of sweetness and spice hot enough to leave your tongue tingling.\xa0Still, I would have loved the sauce tossed with the wings (like they do at Wingstop) instead of being drizzled. I’m glad to report that the chicken has been brined, although it could have been brined a few hours longer for a juicier finish.\xa0The one menu item I wasn’t expecting to enjoy was the quesadilla (S$14), which is great for vegetarians.\xa0It comes packed with mushroom, zucchini, grilled peppers, melted cheese, and salsa sauce — everything comes together beautifully. It’s almost, dare I say, umami.\xa0There are also specks of salt for an incredibly savoury finish.\xa0From the burger category, the Mexicana chicken (S$15) should be hailed as the epitome of value for money. An almost impossibly and comically massive cut of juicy chicken thigh comes sandwiched between burger buns, and served with guacamole, jalapeno and spicy salsa sauce.\xa0I would have had glowing praise for this, if not for its being too bright for my liking. I suspect it’s from the salsa sauce. A creamy sauce would have balanced this out perfectly.\xa0\xa0Tacos at a Mexican outfit are a given. Not only that; they should exude excellence, bar none.\xa0Work on your tacos, and the crowds will come.At Tres Sombreros, the pollo asado tacos trio (S$18 for three) was, for lack of a better word, a little too healthy-tasting for my liking. Inside a soft taco shell are chunks of grilled chicken, which could have been more fiercely seasoned.\xa0It comes with slaw, cheddar cheese and avocado cream, which make an academically sound plate. But when combined with chicken that needs more flavour, it comes across as burdensome.And then there’s the dessert. A disappointment through and through.\xa0Did I want the apple crumble (S$15)? No, I did not; my first choice of coconut rice pudding with mango was unavailable.\xa0Did I ask for a soupy dessert? I did not. And yet what came was a scoop of run-of-the-mill vanilla ice cream on its final vestiges of life, plonked on top of a microwaved, piping-hot apple crumble.\xa0Han’s apple crumble has more dignity than this puddle of mess.\xa0It’s evident what Tres Sombreros needs to work on. The savoury items were great, and I cannot help but heap well-deserved praise for their finesse.\xa0Still, for a restaurant at this location, generic, poorly thought out desserts are not it. Work on that, and I can assure you I’ll be back faster than you can shake a pair of maracas to lively mariachi tunes.\xa0Is it conducive to conversation? Yes. Seats are well-spaced.\xa0Is a reservation necessary? Tres Sombreros accepts walk-ins only.How to get there? Plenty of buses ply the road outside the restaurant. Services 10, 12, 13, 14, and 16 will get you there.\xa0HungryGoWhere paid for its meal at this restaurant for this review.Tres Sombreros is on the GrabFood delivery service.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/supercurry-telok-ayer/:['There’s Hainanese curry, and then there’s Singapore curry. At least, that’s the angle that the owner of Supercurry, chef Pang Kok Keong, is trying to sell — with a side of red-hot hype.\xa0When you step into the small coffee shop at the junction of Boon Tat Street and Telok Ayer Street, your eyes will be drawn to the bright-red sign in the middle of the unit.\xa0The logo bears uncanny similarities to that hypebeast brand Supreme, and some dishes on the LED-lit menu even sport a “Hype” label.\xa0Someone clearly loves his streetwear, it seems.Supercurry is in the same coffee shop that houses other popular stalls, such as Uptown Nasi Lemak, Mrs Hen and Ikan Story.\xa0Pang, who opened the stall in August, is no stranger to the F&B scene, having run the now-defunct French patisserie Antoinette, which closed in 2020, and Pang’s Hakka Noodles, also temporarily closed while he searches for a new location.While Pang himself doesn’t run the day-to-day operations (he cooks at the nearby Sichuan restaurant Basdban), he’s hired a veteran zi char chef with some 30 years of experience to helm the kitchen.If you’re looking for a classic Hainanese curry rice, you won’t find one here (Pang happens to be Hakka).\xa0What Supercurry offers are pre-selected sets with a variety of side dishes. Oh, and deliciously creamy curry, punchy chilli sauce and generous portions.\xa0At present, there are five base sets to choose from, but word on the street is that the team’s planning to release new options such as braised beef cheeks, which I can’t wait to try.\xa0\xa0While I don’t see myself travelling to Telok Ayer just for Supercurry, I wouldn’t mind dropping by whenever I’m in the area.Sets start from S$7.80, while sides range anywhere between 80 cents and S$3.50.\xa0It’s not exactly cheap for curry rice, but it somehow makes sense for a coffee shop where nasi lemak starts from S$6.80 and a zhng-ed-up bowl of Indomie from S$7.50. We’re in Telok Ayer after all.\xa0\xa0Let’s start with the curry.\xa0If you frequent places such as Beach Road Scissors Cut Curry Rice or Loo’s Hainanese Curry Rice, you’ll find the curry here thicker, but milder in appearance and taste. It’s not as salty, sweet or oily, but still full of coconut and chicken flavour. Lemak!The quintessential fried chicken set (S$7.80) is a must-try.\xa0This heaping plate of cutlet-fried chicken came with a tasty shredded onion omelette, cabbage and black fungus chap chye braised till soft, as well as addictive pieces of fried tau kee that are reminiscent of ling ling juan — that dried beancurd roll you find in hotpot places — only crispier and more savoury.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHawker Hustlers: Hipster hawker Ray Yeo of Bei-Ing Dimsum Club on reinventing dim sum and his love for all things Japan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen there’s the chicken, which is huge, by the way. Flawlessly fried without being too oily, the tender leg meat with extraordinarily airy and crispy skin resembles a good beer-battered fish and chips. This is a Muslim-friendly coffee shop, so I can only imagine some other culinary wizardry was employed.The braised soy sauce chicken set (S$7.80) comes just as tasty and even more tender, with a moreish, mildly sweet gravy and the same sides as above.\xa0I usually must have fried chicken every time I eat curry rice, but the sweet braised chicken mixed with the curry is quite tasty, and I imagine it’s a better option for the health-conscious peeps.But it’s the sides that make Supercurry truly special.\xa0You can get a hefty slice of assam fish for S$3.50, which is a steal compared with some cai png stalls. The meat is fairly soft and flaky, and the tamarind sauce tangy and spicy enough to stand up to your curry.There’s a crazy-addictive bowl of fried chicken skin (S$1.50) — large pieces fried to a crackling finish, and dusted with salt and curry powder — that we finished in a flash.\xa0Or thin pieces of chicken ngoh hiang (S$1.20 for two) that are small but full of meaty, umami goodness, and bear hints of fennel and cloves.Another popular side is the sotong & tempeh (S$2.50), which turned out to be a lot spicier than expected. I got six large squid rings in a bowl, with a bit of leek and small pieces of tempeh hidden inside the sauce.You might sweat a bit if your spice tolerance is anywhere beneath mala zhong la (medium spiciness), but underneath all that heat is a pretty tasty dish.\xa0The auntie manning the stall recommended the new crackling beef curry set (S$7.80).It comes with a heap of beef curry loaded with chopped chilli and okra (ladies’ fingers), braised cabbage, and a disc-shaped prawn cracker fritter — the kind you’d get at the wu xiang xia bing stalls.\xa0While crispy, the cracker lacked nearly any sort of flavour I had hoped for, as did the beef curry, which I felt could do with a lot more beefiness.\xa0The result is a somewhat-bland plate. As a saving grace, the beef itself was a good blend of fatty and lean meat, and nicely minced.For now, though, the chicken options are still my pick at Supercurry. That, and the large variety of promising sides to choose from.\xa0Is it conducive to conversation? As good as a coffee shop can get.Is a reservation necessary? Chope a seat with a tissue packet or your business card… probably.How to get there? Supercurry is inside a small coffee shop at the junction of Boon Tat Street and Telok Ayer Street — a few minutes from Telok Ayer MRT station.Things to note:\xa0\xa0HungryGoWhere paid for its meal at this stall for this review.Supercurry is on the GrabFood delivery service.

So, if you’re there for dinner, you can glimpse the thrice-daily light-and-music shows emanating from the giant indoor waterfall, at 7.30pm, 8.30pm and 9.30pm.If the restaurant’s name is familiar, you might have seen or heard of it on your travels to Hong Kong. Wa-En’s flagship restaurant has been serving diners there for more than 10 years, and was listed on Hong Kong’s\xa0Michelin Guide in 2016 and 2017. This is Wa-En’s first foray into Singapore. It opened its doors last month with its sister restaurant Kiwami.\xa0Kiwami, a premium ramen and gyoza bar, is located next door and shares a kitchen with Wa-En.Prepare your tummy for decadent cuts of premium meat, especially Wa-En’s range of Australian and Miyazaki A5 wagyu. Beef from Japan’s Miyazaki province is celebrated for its rich marbling and is among the world’s best. A5 is the highest possible wagyu grade, which means this is of top quality.If you’re looking to taste a bit of everything, go for the wagyu beef platter of seven types (S$158). It includes cuts such as karubi (boneless short rib), chuck roll and tongue. Each cut comes with four slices, so we’d recommend you share this with someone.You can take a breather from beef, with an extra plate — or two — of Iberico pork jowl (S$22) and chicken thigh (S$15). Fresh seafood, including Hiroshima oysters (S$18 for four pieces) and half-shell scallops (S$18 for two), are also on the menu.Unlike many yakiniku restaurants out there, you won’t find many sauces available.Instead, you may use a salt-and-pepper blend, minced garlic and yakiniku sauce as condiments, so as not to overpower the meat’s natural flavours.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50% off at picturesque date spots, including Wildseed Cafe at The Alkaff Mansion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHawker Hustlers: Hipster hawker Ray Yeo of Bei-Ing Dimsum Club on reinventing dim sum and his love for all things Japan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost of the fun comes from grilling your yakiniku (barbecued meat). But if you aren’t quite up to the task, you can ask one of the restaurant’s crew members to grill it at your table.Despite its name, the restaurant’s non-barbecued eats are worth a shot, too. We especially liked the cold Morioka noodles (S$18), a refreshing reprieve from the sweltering heat.\xa0Topped with an oozy onsen egg, the springy noodles come drenched in a vinegary, ponzu-based sauce.If you love cocktails, get Wa-En’s signature — a Miyazaki A5 wagyu fat-washed old fashioned (S$24), with fat-washed Suntory whisky, Okinawan brown-sugar syrup and Angostura bitters.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/br-by-bedrock/:['If you love a good burger, the offerings at BR by Bedrock are not to be missed.This is a limited-run collaboration by award-winning steakhouse Bedrock Bar & Grill and Oriole Coffee + Bar — both of which are under Commonwealth Concepts just outside 313@Somerset mall in town.When HungryGoWhere popped over for a taste test, we made the mistake of heading to the main Bedrock restaurant. The pop-up is at Oriole, which fortunately for us was located across the corridor.The pop-up features burger patties and Yukon Gold potato buns freshly made in-house at Bedrock each day.\xa0In particular, the beef patties are fully made of US Prime meat, with no fillers and binders, so it does tend to crumble more than you might be used to.As you would expect from a Bedrock meal, the beef is the star here, and presents itself in five carefully curated burgers.\xa0If that isn’t quite your thing, there are two non-beefy options — one of lobster and another of chicken.Each burger comes with a lovely basket of thick-cut fries, and a little side of pickles — a helpful touch of acidity to counter the generous portions of fatty meat.If you’re coming with a group of friends, be sure to splurge on an extra side of sweet soy wings (S$16++) or naked fries with blue cheese dip (S$16++), fresh from the Oriole side of the house.Steak fans will love the Bun Jovi (S$42++), which features freshly grilled 150g striploin steak slices, thinly shaved parma ham, creamy scrambled eggs and Gruyere cheese. Tomato jam is also slathered within.\xa0All in all, a satisfying burger to sink your teeth into.The Mighty n Cheesy (S$32++) certainly lived up to its name as a meaty tower of double prime beef patties, and two cheesy layers of Gruyere and Monterey Jack.\xa0Non-beef eaters aren’t missing out either. The Catch 96 (S$48++) was a hot favourite — a butter-poached lobster tail tossed in bearnaise sauce and a juicy cut of sous vide bacon.As was the Avalanche (S$42). Here, Australian short rib is braised and seared to lock in its moisture before being blanketed by an oozy chimichurri mayonnaise sauce.To round off the menu, there are also The Smokin’ Gun (S$34), with a US Prime beef patty and oak-smoked aged cheddar, the OMG (S$32) with onions and sauteed mushrooms, and a chicken option, the Chick-a-boo (S$29).The pop-up runs until the end of the year, and will be available from 5.30pm daily at Oriole Coffee + Bar for dine-in, takeaways or delivery.\xa0Oriole Coffee + Bar is available on the GrabFood delivery service.

An all-Korean marketplace, named Market Blue, opened at Tanglin Mall to great fanfare in early November.\xa0Located next to Korean bakery B for Bagel, the one-stop retail space features a fully air-conditioned food court, ramyeon (Korean instant noodles) library and grocery mart. There is also a photo-booth for guests to take snaps with friends while shopping.Market Blue is run by Blue Basket, an online marketplace in Singapore that specialises in specialty Korean products. Blue Basket sells everything from fresh produce and seafood to kitchenware and personal care products.The ramyeon library in Market Blue is truly a delight.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/sando-pureto/:['Sando Singapore is adopting a new persona — at night, that is.Opened in 2018 at Alexandra Technopark, the Japanese-inspired sandwich shop is known for serving delicious and ’gram-worthy gourmet sandwiches to the office and brunch crowd.\xa0The brainchild of three friends — Timothy Chan, Htet Pang and Ee Chong Goh — who were inspired by Japanese sando-wiches during their trip to Tokyo, Japan, Sando quickly became a hit among those working in the industrial area in search of a hearty lunch with a Japanese twist.\xa0Sandwiches there are loaded with goodies, such as tonkatsu (deep-fried pork cutlet), karaage (fried chicken) and braised pork belly that are accompanied by greens and a variety of sauces.\xa0Instead of brioche buns, Sando uses shokupan, a soft and mildly sweet Japanese milk bread that’s freshly baked in-house. Besides sando-wiches, the restaurant also sells donburi and sides such as takoyaki fries.You might think that’s it for its story, but recently, its owners surprised fans by announcing that Sando is undergoing a transformation — it’ll turn into a modern izakaya, come nightfall.Speaking to HungryGoWhere, Goh said the idea was mooted by one of its customers. At the time, Sando was operating only from morning till around 2.30pm daily, which meant it missed out on catering to the dinner crowd.\xa0The customer commented that it was a waste not to use the space and operate at night, given that the folks there were paying rent for the entire day.While agreeing, the trio wanted to put more thought into the idea. Instead of continuing with the breakfast-and-brunch concept, why not try something new, they thought.\xa0The idea of opening an izakaya at night was born, as that meant they could tap into the best of both worlds — the day and night crowd.\xa0\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHawker Hustlers: Hipster hawker Ray Yeo of Bei-Ing Dimsum Club on reinventing dim sum and his love for all things Japan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeef-tongue specialist Gyutan-Tan opens new Orchard outlet with exclusive afternoon tea\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKuroki at Paragon serves up value-for-money premium yakiniku sets from S$35\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNamed Pureto (pronounced as “Pl-aaa-to”), the bar is the founders’ take on chuka ryori (Japanese-styled Chinese dishes) in a modern izakaya setting. Unlike a traditional izakaya bar, Pureto does not serve kushiyaki (skewered food).Instead, food is served on small plates, tapas-style, which is perfect for a light dinner or sharing with colleagues after work. As the team had no prior experience in creating such dishes, they decided to rope in a former chef from Two Men Bagel House, Chef Ann, in June to curate Pureto’s menu.The drinks, however, are typical — it serves tipples such as sake, tapped Suntory beer and highball.The founders chose to combine the two names, and Sando/Pureto was officially launched in September. The izakaya, though, operates only on Thursdays and Fridays from 6pm to 11pm for now.A standout dish at the izakaya is the dumplings on Pureto (S$10). The dumpling skin is freshly made in-house from scratch. It’s filled with a mix of satay spiced prawn and pork, accompanied by sesame tare, chilli crunch and pickled pearl onions.\xa0If you are at Sando/Pureto for brunch, a must-try is the gooralie tonkatsu sando (S$15). It comprises free-range pork loin that has been breaded with fresh panko, lending the sandwich its crunchy texture. It’s accompanied by flavourful duck fat confit onions, kombu mayo, greens and kombu sauce — a satisfying meal indeed.Starting a hybrid concept was no easy feat, said Goh.The trio had to think outside the box when it came to providing the right operational set-up and manpower structure to support the new concept.For instance, Goh said the lack of storage and working space formed a “large part of (its) logistical problems”. There wasn’t enough fridge space available to store the different sets of ingredients. Moreover, the working area for chefs and their assistants was also inadequate.\xa0As a result, they spent almost S$20,000 on renovation work to create more fridge space and widen the working top area.As for why it’s open only two days a week, Goh said that the labour shortage was a challenge they have yet to overcome. They could not expect the same staff “to be working 12 to 14 hours every shift” to support the hybrid arrangement, he said.\xa0Look out for more updates on its social media, though, as Goh did not rule out opening the izakaya on more days, should there be enough demand and manpower.Book a ride to Sando/Pureto.Alexandra Technopark, 01-04/04A The Hub, 438C Alexandra Road\nNearest MRT station: Labrador Park\nOpen: Monday to Saturday (9am to 2.30pm).

It opened its first store in Singapore on Tras Street in 2019 that’s now temporarily closed for upgrading (as of this article’s publication on Sept 29) and has a second store on the Sentosa resort island.The pop-up concept will offer the coffee chain’s signature black or white coffee, made fresh using rich, full-cream Hokkaido Biei jersey milk.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/rough-guys-coffee-opens/:['With a name like Rough Guys Coffee, one would assume that the people behind this newly opened coffee joint would be, as its name suggests, tough and rowdy individuals.\xa0While that might be true, its founders — Hung Zhen Long and Shawn Ho — say they are friendly owners who are never short of a smile for their customers.Both Hung and Ho know the importance of providing quality food and service for the cafe’s patrons. After all, Hung was the co-founder of Beng Who Cooks, before he sold his shares in January. His business partner Ho was a barista from popular specialty coffeehouse Kurasu Singapore on Waterloo Street.A coffee fan himself, Hung had always wanted to start a coffee joint. But with no experience crafting artisanal coffee, let alone running a place that sells it, he decided to work part-time in cafes as a barista to learn the art of making great coffee.“I was hopping around cafes since February (this year). I learnt a lot from the baristas (I met) and also from the time I was pulling shifts at For The People cafe,” Hung said.Hung added that the baristas he had worked with included heavyweights such as first runner-up of the Singapore National Barista Championships 2022, Rashyd Haniff from Upside Down Coffee Roaster, Ong Shi Chun (better known as “Scong”) from Shake Coffee, and Angelo Tan from Kurasu.\xa0Hung met Ho in March while Hung was working part-time at For The People cafe on Hamilton Road. Bonded by their love of coffee, they decided to open a coffee bar together. After months of preparation, Rough Guys Coffee held its soft opening last Sunday (Oct 16).\xa0Located along South Bridge Road, the cafe joins other well-known coffeehouses in the area, such as Maxi Coffee Bar, The Community Coffee, and Grids Coffee and Bar. Its decor is minimalistic, with a predominantly white palette. A coffee bar counter takes centre stage, while white stools and circular tables are scattered around the space, along with several plants.On its menu is the Kurasu coffee (S$8.50 for hot, S$9 for cold), a pour-over that is the result of a tie-up with Kurasu Singapore. The brew uses washed beans from Kenya, and has notes of Kyoho grapes and dark berries.If you prefer a nuttier pour, go for the White (S$6 for hot, S$7 for cold). Made from washed beans found in El Jaguar, Mexico, it is reminiscent of dark chocolate and brown sugar. Rough Guys Coffee is also offering a small selection of bakes, provided by the folks from Yeast Side bakery.\xa0We recommend the moist banana bread (S$5) or the scallion scones (S$6). Baked to perfection, the scone is crunchy on the outside, yet soft and chewy on the inside.\xa0Asked if he has learnt any lessons from his previous F&B experience, Hung said he hopes to focus on the welfare of his staff, ensure quality control, and build a strong culture where his team shares a set of values.“Honestly, the mistake I made in Beng Who Cooks is that we burnt ourselves out by working too much day in, day out. We had a great team helping us out, but it was too much for them as well,” Hung said.\xa0He added that it was also crucial to set goals and values, and work with a business partner who’s aligned with these values.Besides serving great coffee, Hung and Ho said that they wish to create a space that can foster a community of coffee lovers in Singapore. They plan to do this by bringing together roasters and cafe partners, inviting them to showcase their brews on its menu every three months.\xa0Their plan is to have about four roasters or cafes on rotation yearly, which means coffee lovers will be in for a treat.Book a ride to Rough Guys Coffee.214A South Bridge Road\nNearest MRT station: Chinatown\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (10am to 6pm)214A South Bridge Road\nNearest MRT station: Chinatown\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (10am to 6pm)Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/beng-who-cooks-to-close/:['It has been a wild ride for Beng Who Cooks.\xa0Started by Jason Chua in 2018, the restaurant began as a hawker stall selling protein bowls at Hong Lim Market & Food Centre near Chinatown. He was later joined by his friend Hung Zhen Long after his partners pulled out.\xa0Business was good — then Covid-19 struck. It hit them hard as they barely survived the slump in sales.Instead of wallowing in self-pity, they decided to do a good deed — by offering food to anyone who needed and could not afford it during the circuit-breaker partial lockdown in 2020. As a result of the initiative, they experienced a meteoric rise in fame. It was the talk of the town, and their fan base grew.\xa0They even received a nomination, and then a special commendation, for the President’s Volunteerism and Philanthropy Awards 2020 Special Edition — Our Finest Hour in the City of Good.On Nov 13, 2020, a few months after they first hit the headlines, Beng Who Cooks opened its first full-fledged restaurant at Neil Road. It became known for its wide range of fusion dishes, including cheekily named ones such as Feelin’ Damn Rich and Boring Meatless Salad.Its menu has gone through several iterations. These days, it’s serving up dishes such as miso cream pasta, fried broccoli and an Old School Beng Bowl.Sadly, close to two years since opening, the restaurant is officially calling it quits. Its last day of operation will be on Oct 15.Chua told HungryGoWhere that increasing rent and a lack of manpower were the reasons behind the closure. The rental amount, he said, is expected to increase by about 60 per cent, should he decide to renew the lease at the end of October.\xa0As for manpower, Chua said that he is the only full-time staff member in the restaurant at present. Hung left the business at the start of the year. The rest of his crew — three chefs and seven wait staff — are all students who are working part-time.\xa0The lack of staff meant he had to hold the fort for long hours, and that has taken a toll on him.\xa0He had long considered closing down the five-year-old business, but soldiered on until recently.\xa0The turning point? He became a new dad to a six-month-old boy, and would prefer to spend more time with his family.He said: “Actually I’ve been (meaning) to close for a long time… I have a family, a newborn. And I am still working more than 100 hours a week. I missed a lot of time with my family and (I wasn‘t there for many of) my baby’s first moments.“It’s horribly depressing,” he added. “So I guess the (increase in) rent by the landlord may be a sign, a way of telling myself that maybe it’s time to take a break. It’s also a form of closure: ‘You’ve been fighting for five years alone, come back when you’re ready.’,” he said.Chua said he would be spending the rest of the month clearing up the space for handover. He would then focus on searching for other sources of income. He is also open to doing ad-hoc pop-ups, in which he partners another F&B brand to whip up meals in the latter’s venue.Beng Who Cooks is organising a “moving out party” on Oct 14 and 15. For these two nights, customers can enjoy music from an in-house deejay, while indulging in its signature food and drinks.\xa0Beng Who Cooks is on the GrabFood delivery service.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/asia-grand-reopens-at-new-hotel-location/:['When well-loved Cantonese restaurant Asia Grand announced its closure in January, fans were dismayed. The popular dim sum spot was practically an institution, having been at its Odeon Towers location for some 15 years.At the time, the restaurant stated that its lease had been terminated early due to the redevelopment of Odeon Towers. Its last day was on Feb 15 and relocation plans were not confirmed, it added.Fans of its authentic Cantonese cuisine can now heave a sigh of relief, as the restaurant has found a new home at Fairmont Singapore, a hotel in the City Hall area. This is just a short walk from its previous Odeon Towers location.The new Asia Grand site, which had a soft launch on Sept 24, offers a 230-seat space — a touch smaller than the 350-seat space at its previous home. The new space also has seven private rooms that can seat up to 12 each.\xa0The new location sports a more modern and sophisticated look, with black and white geometric floor tiles and fancy lighting displays at its entrance. Over at the dining area, the chairs and tables are largely the same, and the floor is covered with thick yet soft carpeting to make guests feel comfortable.As the restaurant is still undergoing minor renovations, its menu is limited. However, rest assured that you can still order some of Asia Grand’s popular items.This includes its famous Peking duck (S$98) — a delicious dish comprising thin and crispy duck skin that’s sliced tableside. The skin is dipped in sweet sauce and then wrapped in a thin pancake. We recommend popping the whole thing into your mouth for a satisfying crackle and a burst of flavour. This is the best time to try it, as Asia Grand is offering a promotional price for this dish, at just S$58 apiece.Another Cantonese delicacy you should try is the har gow (S$8.80) — a traditional dumpling. Each har gow comprises a juicy prawn wrapped within a translucent skin. It is then pleated into its final shape and steamed, before it’s served piping hot to guests in a basket.After a hearty meal, treat yourself to a refreshing aloe vera jelly (S$10), a cooling dessert that contains crunchy aloe vera bits. The light and sweet concoction is the perfect dish for Singapore’s hot and humid climate.This is the second time Asia Grand has had to relocate. It was first situated at the now-demolished Hotel Asia on Scotts Road in 1982, before moving to Odeon Towers along North Bridge Road in 2007.\xa0Previously known as Tsui Hang Village in the 1980s, it rebranded to its Asia Grand name in 2004 when the establishment broke away from the Hong Kong chain. The eatery was founded by native Hong Kong citizens — Andy Chau, Jacky Ma and Danny Sin — all of whom are now residing in Singapore.\xa0In a media release, Asia Grand said it was aiming for an official opening “sometime in October or November”. Meanwhile, the restaurant is accepting only phone reservations during its soft opening period.\xa0A spokesperson for Asia Grand said that the restaurant would be opening up another reservation hotline, owing to “overwhelming reservation calls”. More details will be released via the restaurant’s social media platforms soon.\xa0Book a ride to Asia Grand.Fairmont Singapore South Tower, 03-22B, 252 North Bridge Road\nNearest MRT station: City Hall\nOpen: Monday to Friday (11.30am to 3pm, 6pm to 10pm), Saturday and Sunday (11am to 3pm, 6pm to 10pm)Fairmont Singapore South Tower, 03-22B, 252 North Bridge Road\nNearest MRT station: City Hall\nOpen: Monday to Friday (11.30am to 3pm, 6pm to 10pm), Saturday and Sunday (11am to 3pm, 6pm to 10pm)Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/red-house-seafood-opens-new-outlet/:['Well-loved seafood restaurant Red House Seafood has opened a new outlet at the Esplanade.\xa0Established in 1976, Red House Seafood is one of Singapore’s oldest seafood restaurants and has been delighting diners for almost five decades with its Nanyang-style seafood dishes. It’s known for its signature dishes such as lobster noodles and chilli crab.Some might remember Red House Seafood’s iconic first outlet in a red colonial bungalow along Upper East Coast Road (hence its name). It started out offering mainly Chinese cuisine originating from the southern coastal regions of China such as Fujian and Hainan.Over the years, it began infusing influences from the Malay, Peranakan and other Asian traditions into its culinary techniques. The result is a melting pot of dishes reflective of Singapore’s multicultural landscape, such as seafood mee goreng (S$18 for small, or S$36 for large) and ayam halia goreng (S$18 for small, or S$36 for large).The family-run business also went through a fair bit of movement, going from its Upper East Coast Road home to East Coast Seafood Centre in 1985. The outlet closed in 2015 when the block was slated for redevelopment, but by then, Red House Seafood had already opened another outlet along Robertson Quay as well as one on Prinsep Street.\xa0Fast-forward to the present day, and its new outlet at the Esplanade — opened on Oct 5 — is its second. The other store is at Grand Copthorne Waterfront hotel.\xa0Like its sister location at Grand Copthorne Waterfront, the Esplanade outlet boasts a sophisticated and modern dining space with a nature theme. Rattan and timber furniture fill the space, and a wallpaper with plant motifs creates an inviting atmosphere.With an indoor dining hall that can seat 66, as well as an outdoor al fresco area for 50 people, diners will get to soak in gorgeous waterfront views as they eat. The outlet also has two private rooms that can host up to 10 or 14 diners each.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50% off at picturesque date spots, including Wildseed Cafe at The Alkaff Mansion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Esplanade store will feature a barbecue section exclusive to this venue, as a tribute to Singapore street food.

The lobster is thinly battered, deep-fried, then stir-fried in a rich and creamy custard sauce made with evaporated milk and unsalted butter. You can enjoy the succulent lobster meat with the refreshing pickled vegetables served on the side.For seafood lovers looking to spice things up, a must-try is the spicy seafood combination (S$38 for small, or S$76 for large). In this signature dish, Canadian scallops, grouper, deshelled prawns and squid are flash-fried, then tossed in a spicy and piquant sauce made up of local and regional spices as well as aromatics such as lemongrass and kaffir lime leaves.As part of its launch, Red House Seafood tied up with Singapore artist and illustrator Tan Zi Xi to design the store’s wallpaper, fabric and tiles.

Because of this, we’ve seen our fair share of food fads popping up periodically, from rainbow-anything to mala-flavoured foods to cheese hotpots.Enter the next trend — gelato-in-a-can. This follows the viral Japanese cake-in-a-can trend that arrived in Singapore a short time ago. As its name suggests, this dessert comprises gelato served in a brightly coloured metal can. Named Gelato Can, it is one of several other desserts offered by newly opened ice cream cafe Ree.Connect, which launched on Monday (Oct 10). It is available both for dine-in and as a takeaway option.You can pick from 12 gelato flavours to fill your can. Each can contain about 220ml of ice cream, or about two or three scoops.Must-try flavours include salted butter caramel (S$9) — made of homemade caramel sauce with gelato white base — and lemon tart (S$10), a nostalgic ode to Khong Guan’s lemon biscuit.Founders of Ree.Connect, Celine and Mark Ng, conceived the gelato-in-a-can idea while researching packaging ideas. The husband-and-wife duo came across a similar concept in Korea and decided to adopt it for the cafe’s grand opening.Selling gelato is something new to the Ngs, though. The pair started out as owners of a home-based business called Ree and Mummy, selling mainly bakes such as charred pineapple cheesecakes. Ree.Connect is their first foray into the Singapore cafe scene.Mark Ng said: “When the idea of the cafe came up, Celine thought that gelato and coffee would be a great addition to our offerings.“As a result, I took up gelato and barista courses to support her, and interestingly, I now really enjoy the creative process of coming up with new and interesting flavours that people enjoy.”Ree and Mummy opened during the Covid-19 circuit breaker period in 2020. The Ngs, both property agents, started the online shop to better support their family finances.\xa0The business built a loyal following online and its success spurred the Ngs to open their first physical store, Ree.Connect, at Katong V.\xa0Fans can still enjoy their signature cheesecake creations at Ree.Connect. These include the charred pineapple cheesecake (S$6.50 a slice) — a creamy yet light cheesecake that has the perfect balance of sweetness from the charred pineapple and savouriness from the mildly salty and tangy cheese.\xa0Besides cheesecakes, you can tuck into housemade waffles topped with a scoop of gelato or two.\nBook a ride to Ree.Connect.Katong V, 01-03, 30 East Coast Road\nNearest MRT station: Dakota\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (10am to 10pm)Katong V, 01-03, 30 East Coast Road\nNearest MRT station: Dakota\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (10am to 10pm)Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/newly-opened-mr-onigiri/:['If you’ve travelled to Japan before, chances are you would have come across an onigiri — a Japanese rice ball wrapped in nori, or a dried seaweed sheet. Typically filled with mentaiko (marinated cod roe), tuna mayonnaise, salmon flakes or pickled plum, it’s a pocket-sized snack loved by the Japanese.\xa0Newly opened onigiri specialty cafe, Mr Onigiri, has decided to put a local twist on this triangular Japanese treat by offering an upsized version that resembles a sandwich. Opening its doors in early October, the eatery’s version envelopes its fillings between two rectangular slabs of rice and seaweed, so the rice acts like two halves of a bun.Discernibly heftier in weight, these onigiri-wiches are a full meal and can satisfy you, even when you’re on the go.\xa0One locally inspired item on the menu is the otakotak onigiri (S$6.90).\xa0Wrapped in Japanese rice and seaweed, the otak from Muar, Malaysia, adds a spicy element to the onigiri. The freshly made tamagoyaki (Japanese rolled omelette), sweet mentaiko sauce and spam meat counter the zingy spiciness well, giving this onigiri a balanced and delicious flavour profile.The signature melty cheesy crispy chicken (S$5.90) is a fusion onigiri that resembles a typical local Western dish in Singapore.\xa0It comprises a thick crunchy chicken patty, fresh lettuce, cheese, tartar sauce and Japanese rice, bringing to mind an American hamburger with a Japanese twist, sort of like Mos Burger’s beloved rice burgers.Another must-try item on the menu would be the double yummy double ebi (S$5.90).\xa0The combination of deep-fried ebi, spam, tamagoyaki and creamy tartar sauce brings out the umami flavours of this onigiri.\xa0At present, Mr Onigiri is available for takeaways only.\n\nBook a ride to Mr Onigiri.215P Upper Thomson Road\nNearest MRT station: Marymount\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (10am to 8pm)215P Upper Thomson Road\nNearest MRT station: Marymount\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (10am to 8pm)Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/riang-opens/:['Modern Peranakan eatery Babba has shuttered quietly, less than nine months after its opening at Jalan Riang in Serangoon. In its place is Riang, a casual-dining concept that serves Western-Asian fusion cuisine.\xa0Both concepts are by the folks behind The Brewing Ground in Joo Chiat.When Babba first opened in February, it won the hearts and tummies of foodies, thanks to its dual concept of a picture-perfect brunch selection with a Peranakan flair in the day, and authentic Peranakan dishes in the evening. Standouts include its homemade banana cake, Nyonya otak and beef rendang.\xa0Fans were thus shocked when Babba announced on its social media accounts on Oct 24 that its last day of service was Oct 30.Riang opened a few days later, on Nov 2, with largely the same decor, taking over Babba’s rattan chairs, terrazzo stone tables and overhanging plants.Speaking to HungryGoWhere, a spokesperson for The Brewing Ground — which has been serving the brunch crowd in Joo Chiat since January 2021 — said the team was “very grateful” for the followers they have and the family they have built. When queried on the reason behind the closure, the spokesperson said: “Babba emerged as an idea out of the pandemic, hoping to cater to this lovely neighbourhood (by) bringing the love of Peranakan cuisine to you.”The spokesperson added that the team does “not have any future plans for the brand” at this point.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50% off at picturesque date spots, including Wildseed Cafe at The Alkaff Mansion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMartin’s Kitchen: New restaurant serves unique Hakka-inspired dishes with Mexican and European influences\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe that as it may, loyal fans of Babba will be relieved to know that Riang has retained Babba’s pastry chef and will continue serving the same desserts as its predecessor, such as its beloved homemade banana cake. There will also be new creations on the menu.\xa0Riang, like Babba, has a concept of serving different menus at different times of day. The brunch menu, available from morning till 4.30pm, serves brunch-related food and beverages, such as pancakes, breakfast sandwiches and tartines.\xa0This is supplemented by the mains and salads menu, available from 10am to 4.30pm, that has items such as hot-fried chicken burger (S$17).The sunset menu, available from 6pm, features starters and big plates appropriate for communal sharing, such as a fried chicken and banchan (S$25) and vanilla tiger prawns (S$28).A highlight at Riang is the Riang Breakkie (S$16), a hearty set where you can opt for your choice of meat (thick-cut bacon or a chicken sausage), choice of bread (sourdough or brioche) and choice of eggs (scrambled, sunny side up, soft-boiled, or over-easy).

Located within the Luzerne Building in Bendemeer, the new 2,400 sqf store is almost double the size of its first outlet in Farrer Park. It can accommodate up to 70 seated guests.Syip was founded by Sandee Yip and her older sister Sara Yip in June 2021. Pronounced “sip”, the cafe is known for its signature espressos and delicious toasts, such as the burrata open-faced toast and sweet French toast.Speaking to HungryGoWhere, Sandee Yip said that the new outlet would continue to feature a clean, minimalist aesthetic, albeit with a more industrial feel. Visitors can expect the usual white chairs and tables iconic to the brand — these will be juxtaposed against the backdrop of grunge grey walls.She added that the siblings loved the new store’s high ceiling and that it was “not easy to come by”.

A generous amount of ikura caviar is sprinkled around the sauce, infusing a fresh salty flavour to the dish.Atop the breakfast tart rest fluffy scrambled eggs. Overall, the portion is just right for a morning meal to kickstart the day.If you prefer something more adventurous, get the octopus mentaiko rosti (S$23). As the name suggests, the base of the dish is a potato rosti, a popular breakfast dish in Switzerland of fried grated potatoes.Similar to the tart above, you will find Japanese-inspired elements in this dish, too. The chewy charred octopus blends well with the sweet-savoury mentaiko mayo and salty ikura caviar, creating an explosion of umami flavours in your mouth.The lightly sprinkled bonito flakes are a nice touch, providing a subtle crispy texture to the dish.You can’t leave Syip without taking a “syip” of its signature white coffee (S$7). Each cup comprises a double espresso shot, fresh milk, cocoa powder, and a thick layer of whipped cream.

While short, they viewed the cafe as a “good trial” for them to prepare for their next dining concept.\xa0The result? Two Bake Boys Studio, a cafe-cum-baking studio that would offer baking classes for fans of all ages and groups, from kids to adults. There’s also scope for team-bonding activities and other events. Prices for each class range from S$58 to S$288, depending on the difficulty level.\xa0Kitty said that the idea came from her customers, who had been asking her to conduct baking classes. Scheduled to open in December, Two Bake Boys Studio would thus be a way for the founders to share what they have learnt in the process of running Two Bake Boys.Known for its handcrafted picturesque crepe cakes, Two Bake Boys first gained popularity when Kitty, a Thai-born Singaporean PR, started selling Thai tea crepe cakes with Thai milk tea sauce (S$59 for a six-inch cake) from home at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic to supplement the household income.\xa0Kitty and her husband Philip Yap were Singapore Airlines cabin crew members, and both of them embarked on this business after finding themselves hit with a pay cut due to the pandemic.\xa0\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Feuds: Saizeriya vs Milan Shokudo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaunched in July 2020, the freshly baked cakes, which come with a creamy Thai tea sauce, became an instant hit.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/good-morning-scones-takeaway-store/:['Home-based bakery Good Morning Scones is aiming to open its first takeaway outlet by the end of November, it told the HungryGoWhere team on Tuesday (Nov 8).In a series of Instagram stories posted a week ago, Good Morning Scones teased its followers on the takeaway store’s location, before finally revealing that it will be at Telok Blangah House. The venue is just a few minutes from HarbourFront MRT station and is located across VivoCity shopping mall.\xa0Good Morning Scones was founded by Ellane Ong in July 2020. The idea was born when Ong’s events-related business came to a halt due to the pandemic. Realising there weren’t many businesses offering quality scones at the time, Ong decided to jump on the opportunity of selling homemade scones.While acknowledging that her decision to start the business was born out of impulse, Ong said she didn’t regret her leap of faith.\xa0She began experimenting with recipes, and in just one day, started an Instagram account and completed a photoshoot using the nostalgic “good morning” face towels as packaging for her baked goods — a look that is now iconic to the brand.\xa0Ong started opening up slots on Instagram every month for customers to make their orders. Her scones were so popular that they would sell out the moment slots were open. About a year later, she launched a website to take on orders in a more fuss-free manner.At present, customers would have to pay a delivery fee or self-collect from her location at Fernvale. The takeaway store is, hence, a natural progression for the business.Ong said that the takeaway store would serve the same items as its online menu, such as the popular plain scones that are moist and buttery. Customers can also buy seasonal items such as the savoury corn bacon scones.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind sourdough too… sour?

It sits in a central location and the rent fits the budget. Moreover, the store can hold a huge commercial oven needed to bake the scones at scale.\xa0Building up to the launch, Ong said she was focusing on hiring the right people and training them before she explores adding new items to the menu.\xa0Book a ride to Good Morning Scones when it’s open.Telok Blangah House, 02-05, 52 Telok Blangah Road\nNearest MRT station: HarbourFront\nOpen: To be confirmedTelok Blangah House, 02-05, 52 Telok Blangah Road\nNearest MRT station: HarbourFront\nOpen: To be confirmedAuthor© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/homeground-grill-and-bar-closure/:['After three years of operating Homeground Grill & Bar, childhood friends Nellie Tan and Chrystal Yeong have decided to call it quits. The last day of service for the grill house is Dec 25.Speaking to HungryGoWhere, Yeong said that the main reason for the closure was the founders’ “personal choice” to move on to the next phase in their lives. Since opening Homeground Grill & Bar on Serangoon Road in January 2019, the pair felt that they have accomplished their mission to create a go-to place for foodies to enjoy quality grilled food in the heartlands.Other contributing reasons for the closure were the rising costs in food and utilities. Adding that it has been “a very tough climate for F&B businesses” lately, Yeong said the cost of electricity tripled, while the cost of food rose by 10 to 15 per cent this year.\xa0While there are no concrete plans to reopen Homeground Grill & Bar for now, Yeong said that they were exploring a takeaway concept based in a shopping mall for their next venture. The idea is still undergoing a financial analysis and a decision to invest in it has not been finalised. That said, Yeong targets to launch it by the first quarter of 2023 if a go-ahead consensus is reached.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50% off at picturesque date spots, including Wildseed Cafe at The Alkaff Mansion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMartin’s Kitchen: New restaurant serves unique Hakka-inspired dishes with Mexican and European influences\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHomeground Grill & Bar became famous for its charcoal-grilled paleo comprising meat, seafood and vegetables.

The two-storey restaurant sports a white minimalistic exterior with black borders and arcs, giving it a chic, modern look.\xa0Ornaments and Chinese calligraphic characters scattered around the building lend it an old-school, homely touch.Tan Xiang Yuan specialises in Chinese-style seafood. The eatery’s range of more than 80 menu items spans dishes such as steamed fish and seasonal live catches, including Alaskan king crab and Australian lobster. One of the highlights is the TXY signature seafood hotpot (from S$98). Served over charcoal fire, the dish is a generous, bubbling pot of juicy prawns, sweet clams and more — all cooked within an aromatic broth that’s simmered for at least 12 hours.\xa0If you prefer something more exquisite, a must-have is the angelica black pepper crab (seasonal pricing). The earthy, celery-like taste of angelica roots balances well with the spicy kick from the black pepper.

Its last day of service will be Dec 11.Housed in a majestic colonial-style building at Phoenix Park near Tanglin Road, Flourish Bakehouse was a breath of fresh air in the Singapore cafe scene when it opened some 15 months ago, in October 2021.\xa0Its charming surrounds and sprawling lawn, which doubles as a pet-friendly al fresco area, became an instant hit among foodies, parents and pet lovers.\xa0Guests can loan a picnic mat and set it up on the lawn — making it a perfect space to kick back lazily, while indulging in their favourite food, as pets and kids roam free.\xa0In her Instagram post, Ong said the closure was a tough call.“It was an incredibly difficult decision and we’re gutted to be leaving such a beautiful space, but many factors, including a short-term lease renewal, led us to this decision,” said Ong.Ong then touched on Flourish Bakehouse’s growth since it opened, and the fond memories it has created with customers.\xa0She said: “I started Flourish with the hope that it would become an extension of home for everyone who comes through our doors, and 15 months on, I’m so glad how it has evolved to become just that.”\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Feuds: Saizeriya vs Milan Shokudo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatisserie Cle brings its well-crafted pastries to new River Valley flagship for fifth anniversary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15 stalls you must try at Redhill Food Centre\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“We’ve loved seeing the young families that have grown since we opened, the friends who have reconnected, the fur kids who guard our window and the customers who have found respite at our space,” she added.Flourish Bakehouse started after Ong, who began selling her baked goods from home during the pandemic, quit her job as an auditor to venture into the cafe business full-time.Known for its Aussie-style rustic bakes, some all-time favourite items in the cafe include grilled cheese toasties, the ham leek parmesan scone and cheddar corn muffin.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/cafe-kitsune/:['I’m not sure how my dining partner and I managed to wait patiently in line for nearly an hour for seats at Cafe Kitsune.\xa0No complaints. No grumbling. No tsk-ing. No chairs.\xa0I suppose standing in line for a table in the middle of a weekday afternoon is simply par for the course for entry to Singapore’s latest cafe import.\xa0Thankfully, we had the wisdom to grab lunch at So Good Char Chan Tang a few units away — desserts do not a lunch make.\xa0Cafe Kitsune is the latest addition to Capitol Singapore’s F&B directory. It offers French-Japanese desserts and pastries in a 40-seat mise en scene brimming with tropical vibes. There are indoor and outdoor seats, but given December’s weather, I’d give the al fresco option a hard pass.\xa0Cafe Kitsune is the F&B arm of the Maison Kitsune brand that hails from Paris, France. The French-Japanese lifestyle brand was founded in 2002 and operated as a fashion brand, a record label, an art gallery, and an F&B retailer.Right now, Cafe Kitsune can be found in Paris, Japan, Korea, New York, China, Thailand, Indonesia and the United Kingdom. In-store, diners can browse tableware, ready-to-wear apparel and coffee accessories.Cafe Kitsune also prides itself on a stellar cup of coffee, using single-origin beans from Brazil and Guatemala. The brand is serious about coffee, evidenced by its two roasteries — one in Vertbois, France and the other in Okayama, Japan.\xa0According to Cafe Kitsune, the beans from the latter will be used throughout Asia in the near future.If you’re here for proper food, the only savoury items available are the sando. If you’re hungry, do as I did and have a decent meal first (there’s Punggol Nasi Lemak downstairs, too), and come to Cafe Kitsune for drinks and dessert.From their range of pastries and sweets, I had the strawberry shortcake (S$13) covered with a cream laced with a delicate strawberry flavouring.\xa0Inside, the sponge is beautifully moist, and the jam between the layers tart with a hint of sweetness. Surprisingly, even when all the elements are put together, this cake is not saccharine for solo consumption.I also had the white chocolate matcha cookie (S$7), which would thoroughly please green tea fans. I can smell the matcha before it goes into my mouth — that’s how much green tea is in this.\xa0The cookie comes chock-full of things — chunks of white chocolate chips, nuts, and a surprising dash of salt that elevates and brings everything so elegantly together.\xa0The chilli chocolate tart (S$12) is a Singapore exclusive that no true chocolate lover should miss.\xa0From the dry chilli flakes that adorn the surface of the dark chocolate ganache, you can probably guess that this is not kid-friendly. Unless your brood is the type that enjoys the heat from this, which hits you so potently at the back of the throat.\xa0Proceed with caution.Kids would enjoy the buttery and crumbly fox-shaped shortbread cookies (S$4 each) that everyone photographs perched on the brim of their coffee. Which I also did, of course, only to have it break mere moments later. It’s cute, kitschy, easy to eat, and comes in four flavours — butter, matcha, chocolate and sesame.\xa0Elsewhere, the iced soy sesame latte (S$9.50) has bold, roasty undertones that made my dining partner squeal with delight.\xa0I had the cortado (S$7.50) because it’s rare to find it in Singapore cafes that usually offer only lattes or whites (and not even the actual, proper type defined by baristas). It’s my first time having this half-espresso shot, half-milk beverage here, and I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed it.\xa0My only gripe is the chicken katsu sando (S$15).\xa0I should have recognised the warning bells when the cashier asked if I would like to have mine warmed up.\xa0“Like in a microwave? The way we do it at 7-Eleven?” my mind wondered.To nobody’s surprise, that’s exactly what this sandwich is. A huge chunk of chicken breast that’s dry, tough and a nightmare to consume. I’ve had 7-Eleven sandwiches with more personality than this.\xa0I know people would cry foul and chastise me for ordering savoury food at a famous dessert outfit. But if it’s available to order, as a food reviewer, I will get it. And if it can’t stand up to scrutiny, take it off the menu, please.\xa0Still, the sando does not and should not take away from all the desserts and drinks Cafe Kitsune offers because those are great.\xa0And when the queue eventually dies down, and Singaporeans hanker for the next shiny trinket, I wouldn’t mind spending a leisurely afternoon here again, reading a book, listening to a podcast and just, you know, watching the world pass me by.\xa0I reckon I would enjoy myself very, very much.Is it conducive to conversation? Yes. The seats are well-spaced.Is a reservation necessary? Cafe Kitsune accepts only walk-ins for the moment.How to get there? Capitol Singapore connects directly to the City Hall MRT station.\xa0HungryGoWhere paid for its meal at this cafe for this review.\xa0Book a ride to Cafe Kitsune.Capitol Singapore, 01-11, 13 Stamford Road\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (10am to 10pm)Capitol Singapore, 01-11, 13 Stamford Road\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (10am to 10pm)Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/bukit-canberra-hawker-centre-opens/:['Sembawang residents have a brand-new stomping ground for meet-ups and affordable eats — Bukit Canberra Hawker Centre (BCHC) — which opened officially on Dec 17.\xa0This is Sembawang town’s first hawker centre in almost 30 years, and a highly anticipated one among residents in the area.The sprawling facility has over 800 seats and 44 hawker stalls across a wide range of cuisines.Besides that, here are three things to look out for.There’s Mexican-Indian fusion stall Snack That Food Up — cheekily shortened to STFU — and another selling Hainan and Harbin cuisine. Home-based business Liu Kou Shui has also set up its first physical store selling fusion donburi (from S$5) and its signature mala char siew (S$4).Fans of lok lok, mookata and barbecued Melaka seafood will also find plenty of choices. If you’re looking for a light snack, there’re bakes from Muffin Homme and putu piring (steamed rice cakes) from Bege.rack.Hawker stalwarts such as Yu Kee Braised Duck, Lixin Teochew Fishball Noodles and Habib’s Rojak are available, too.Health-conscious diners will be pleased to know that there are healthier options at every food stall. These are called Canopy Nutrients Meals (CAN meal), and are prepared using healthier cooking methods and ingredients.\xa0One such meal is the minced meat ban mian (S$5.50), which is served with a wholegrain staple, and contains three essential food groups at recommended portion sizes.The stalls have also listed the calorie count of your meal, to help diners be more aware of how often these dishes should be consumed.\xa0Dishes marked green contain 500 kilocalories or less, and are ideal for everyday consumption. By contrast, dishes marked red have more than 700 kilocalories — patrons are encouraged to reduce their consumption of these calorific meals.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Junction Westgate opening with promos; will house 23 tenants, including new halal teppanyaki\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHawker Hustlers: Hipster hawker Ray Yeo of Bei-Ing Dimsum Club on reinventing dim sum and his love for all things Japan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Vikram Nair, a Member of Parliament for Sembawang group representation constituency, each stall has at least two dishes that are priced below S$3.50.Further discounts are available to blue Community Health Assist Scheme (Chas) cardholders, and members of the Pioneer and Merdeka generations.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/all-things-hainanese-bras-basah/:['When it comes to the world of kueh, most of us will think of ang ku kueh. Or perhaps png kueh — pink-hued, peach-shaped glutinous rice cakes — or putu piring (and its tutu kueh variant), a round steamed rice cake filled with palm sugar and moulded to resemble a delicate flower.Over at All Things Hainanese, a pair of third-generation hawkers have made it their lives’ work to celebrate, well, all things Hainanese.\xa0And with it, a rare kueh that’s made exclusively by the dialect group — the yi bua.If we were to dissect it into its raw constituents, the yi bua is a chewy, doughy kueh stuffed with gula melaka (palm sugar), peanut, sesame, dried tangerine, coconut and brown sugar. Glutinous rice dough is kneaded by hand, filled with stuffing, and then wrapped with a strip of banana leaf before being steamed.The result is a squarish cake with rounded corners and a single, red dot in its centre.As with most heritage eats, there is a secret ingredient. You won’t catch co-founder Jocelyn Loi, 30, sharing that anytime soon, though.To Loi, the yi bua (S$8.40 for six pieces) is more than just another snack.Historically, this kueh is used by the Hainanese for all occasions, from moments of celebration to death. For funerals, the yi bua is made sans the spot of red, since it’s typically an auspicious colour for the Chinese. Meanwhile, during birthdays for the elderly, the kueh takes on a triangular shape and is known as tar kat lau.These days, you’re more likely to see it at a Hainanese child’s first-month celebration or at a wedding.\xa0Otherwise, the yi bua is seldom seen in modern Singapore, and often flies under the radar in comparison to its more popular relatives within the kueh family.Growing up, Loi herself didn’t quite appreciate the enormity of her family’s cultural legacy.\xa0She, along with the other children in the family, had always helped out with the kueh-making process.“Back then, when we were all kids at home, (making kuehs) was part of our everyday life. We would help out with moulding the kueh or the various food preparation steps. But it didn’t occur to us that this wasn’t something that everybody did. We were like the little minions at home helping out.We didn’t know that it was special, until more (media) articles came out and we realised that we actually have something quite unique.”The recipe is carefully guarded and passed down from Loi’s maternal grandmother Yeoh Min Lin, who started Hainan Xiao Chi, a hawker stall selling kueh like these and more, in Toa Payoh during the 1970s.\xa0With the help of the late Ong Teng Cheong, then-Member of Parliament for Toa Payoh, and later the fifth president of Singapore, she secured a stall selling traditional kaya, soft buns and various kueh.“Since then, we’ve gained more popularity and people started to travel all the way down (to Toa Payoh) to buy these kueh.”Today, the stall is still in operation. Helmed by Loi’s mother, Goh See Mui, 57, it continues to draw quite the crowd.\xa0The hawker space is small, and stocks are limited, so it’s not uncommon for the kueh to be fully sold out by the early afternoon. Prospective patrons are often turned away without an yi bua in hand.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Feuds: Saizeriya vs Milan Shokudo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt wasn’t until Yeoh passed away in 2019 that Loi took up the mantle of championing her family’s legacy.“No one expected it, so it came as a shock for everybody,” she recalled. “One day, I snapped out of that grief and thought: ‘If I don’t continue this, there’s no more connection left with her.’”All Things Hainanese was thus born in September 2020.\xa0Even though it operates under the same umbrella as the more established Hainan Xiao Chi stall, Loi and her cousin, Charmaine Goh, hope\xa0that the younger, newer branding will be more appealing to younger folks.“We decided to come together and create this, because we wanted to pass down this culture to the next generation,” she says. It’s quite a niche group in Singapore, compared with other dialect groups, so most Singaporeans today — even Hainanese descendants — may not be familiar with the culture.Loi traces her Hainanese ancestry to both sides of the family — her paternal grandparents used to run their own coffee shop, with her grandfather making his own kaya.“It’s just about putting everything together,” she says. “It’s no longer just a business, per se. It’s also about passing on that heritage.”Loi, who had been working in the hotel industry for the past 10 years running events and weddings, wouldn’t say that she’s much of a cook. But that hasn’t deterred her from picking up her family’s trade.It’s a careful, gradual process, with her mother lending her support on more complex recipes while Loi masters the necessary skills.The brand started out online, sharing tidbits about Hainanese culture on its Instagram page, while taking in weekend and corporate orders for the various kueh.The kueh is fully handmade with natural ingredients — a tradition that’s been passed down.“We insist on not using machines in any step. We feel that there is a difference in terms of the skin texture. All our fillings are made from scratch — nothing is purchased off the shelf,” says Loi.It takes about 20 to 25 minutes to make each batch of 16 yi bua by hand, but Loi says this is non-negotiable. There is a discernible difference in quality and texture otherwise.When the orders pile up — especially during Chinese New Year — it’s all hands on deck. The whole family pitches in to help out.“If we need help, we have reinforcements.”All Things Hainanese opened its first physical store in Bras Basah Complex, with a soft launch on Dec 3.It benefits from being very centrally located, so its customers can pop in more easily to pick up their orders.The Purvis Street area — a mere stone’s throw away — is also a former Hainanese enclave, so the store’s new location is particularly apt. It is led by Loi and Charmaine Goh, 19, who is in charge of R&D for the business.Charmaine Goh, a recent culinary school graduate from At-Sunrice GlobalChef Academy, has been the brains behind the brand’s modern creations, including yi bua-flavoured butter cookies (S$12), mochi (S$8) and more.“This is our first step to getting in with the younger market. But of course, our older customers still like the OG products,” says Loi.\xa0Its signature yi bua — featured prominently as part of its branding — is of course available here.The duo is working on other new offerings, including new yi bua skin options, but notes that the base flavour is naturally gingery and can be quite strong. It is a challenge to balance the flavours so that it doesn’t overpower whatever skin it is wrapped in.Other snacks, such as love letters (S$15.80) and pineapple tarts (S$21.80),\xa0are also available, including bua art (S$6), another traditional kueh that Loi describes as an “inverted yi bua”.The store is takeaway-only, but customers are encouraged to order its highly addictive butter-and-kaya croissant (S$2) to be eaten while hot. Slathered thickly with housemade kaya and a generous slab of butter, the croissants here are perfectly toasted fresh upon order — albeit more crunchy than flaky.Charmaine Goh makes the croissants herself, and even the kaya is housemade with no preservatives. If you love kaya, be sure to pick up a jar of the spread for snacking on at home.There’s also a luscious bowl of laksa (S$4.50) to be had, with generous portions of tau pok (beancurd), fish cakes and prawns, and a dollop of housemade chilli. The broth is creamy and flavourful without being too heavy. And of course — it contains yet another secret ingredient that even Loi isn’t privy to. For now, anyway.All Things Hainanese is on the GrabFood delivery service.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/meokja-by-jungga/:['Die-hard fans of the popular Korean show Running Man would remember that episode where cast members dashed around Seoul’s Gwangjang Market for a game, picking up everything from chewy tteokbokki to wriggling octopus sashimi and other delicious things.It’s been more than five years since that episode aired, and every year, I strived to visit the Korean street food mecca, but life happens and it’s been difficult seizing an opportunity to fly over.\xa0So when I heard about Meokja by Jungga, a casual Muslim-owned Korean restaurant gaining popularity over social media, I had to bite.Launched in October at the fancy new GR.iD mall, Meokja by Jungga is helmed by chef Jung Sangwoo, a Korean-born Muslim revert who’s been living here for a while now.\xa0He initially started it as a home-based business to raise awareness of what authentic Korean food should taste like, and while the restaurant isn’t halal-certified, he uses only halal ingredients in his cooking.There are plenty of Muslim-friendly Korean restaurants in Singapore, and having eaten at a few of them myself, it’s hard to say many are actually authentic, or uhm, good.\xa0As it turns out, you can eat very well with just chicken, beef and fish for protein, as chef Jung displays clearly in his casual eatery.\xa0Casual, because aside from the cool recessed lighting and stone tiling, Meokja by Jungga is rather no-frills. The small online menu is concise and affordable — noodle and rice dishes start from S$6.90, while staple street food such as kimbap and yangnyeom chicken go from S$4.90. If that’s not value for money, I don’t know what is.Meokja also has several combo sets that allow you to try its different mains and sides along with two drinks at a bundled price. Get the JjamJja Set (S$34) for jjajangmyeon, jjamppong and tangsuyuk, or the BunShik Set (S$32) for tteokbokki, eomuk tang and tuna rice balls.What kind of person must you be to not order side dishes in a Korean place?Get the tteokbokki (S$6.90) to whet your appetite. Slathered in an addictively spicy sweet sauce, the texture and flavour of the chewy rice cakes and thin fishcakes are spot-on.\xa0Or try the lesser-known tangsuyuk (S$11.90) – crispy fried chicken served with a sweet-and-sour fruit sauce.\xa0The chicken is lighter in taste than typical fried chicken, with a batter similar to that of tempura, allowing the tangy chunks of pineapple and peach to stand out.By this time, you should be ready for the mains.\xa0Bibim-guksu (S$6.90) is a dish I love to make at home. It’s spicy, tasty, and best of all, easy to assemble.\xa0Chef Jung does his with a very thin sort of wheat flour noodles called somyeon, which absorbs the gochujang sauce perfectly. His version comes with julienned carrots and seaweed — simple but refreshing enough to flush the hot weather away.The jjajangmyeon (S$9.90) here comes as thick and chewy egg noodles coated in a rich black bean sauce, accentuated by bits of minced beef and caramelised onions.\xa0It’s a little sweeter than what I remember of jjajangmyeon, but there’s still enough savouriness and earthiness to make this a hit.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50% off at picturesque date spots, including Wildseed Cafe at The Alkaff Mansion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor something warmer, the jjamppong (S$11.90 for a la carte) is a pretty decent option.\xa0The aromatic bowl came topped with prawns, clams, squid and kimchi, with mildly spicy soup to soothe your soul.

I’m told it’s known as the Sprite of Korea, but I find the drink way more carbonated with stronger lemon notes. Both are very satisfying.Not all the banchan (side dishes) were in unison during our visit.\xa0The eomuk tang (S$8.90) is a classic fishcake dish that falls a bit short. The fishcake itself is okay, but the broth lacks that satisfying and deep umami I once had on a rainy night in Myeongdong. To be blunt, it was bland.There are other sides: A kimchi jeon (S$6) that tastes absolutely delicious with generous amounts of the fermented cabbage, but also only slightly chewy and lacking any crispiness on the sides whatsoever.\xa0Or a plate of tuna mayo rice balls (chamchi mayo jumeok bap, S$6) — a good snack if it had more flavour and, I reckon, a lot more mayo and a dash of sesame oil.None of these are major dealbreakers, though, and should be easily rectifiable. Chef Jung still manages to deliver a fantastic Korean cuisine experience for both adherents and non-Muslims alike, with dishes that do make the cut.\xa0To that, I can only say meokja, or “let’s eat”, in Korean!Is it conducive to conversation?

Orders can be made from 11am onwards.The fast food chain teased its return on social media with a caption: “Gather with the special people in your life and have a reunion over juicy patties dipped in a rich black pepper sauce, along with golden Twister Fries and more! Huat are you waiting for?”McDonald’s Prosperity Burger has been an unofficial Chinese New Year tradition for many here. Originally introduced in 1994, this iconic burger makes a long-awaited appearance once every year.\xa0Judging from the photo that accompanied the post, it looks like the crowd favourite may be returning with the rest of its crew – curly fries and strawberry pie.\xa0The Prosperity Burger (S$6.70 for a single patty, S$8.70 for a double patty) remains an unwavering constant through the years. Its oblong-shaped sesame buns house sliced onions and a chicken or beef patty drenched in spicy black pepper sauce – a simple recipe that still manages to stir the excitement of fast food lovers across the island.\xa0Another item that makes its much-desired return is the Prosperity Twister Fries (S$5 a la carte, additional S$0.90 with a meal). Aside from McDonald’s seaweed shaker fries, there may not be another side as famous as this. After all, what’s not to love? The crispy curly fries are, at fast food prices, a steal.First introduced in mid-January this year, the strawberry pie (S$2.30) impressed diners with its adorable pink exterior and mild sweetness.\xa0If you’re hungry, you can get the Prosperity Feast (S$13) instead, which\xa0typically\xa0consists of the aforementioned items and is accompanied by a beverage to wash it all down.All items are available after breakfast hours at 11am on weekdays, and 12pm on weekends, for takeaways or dine-in at all McDonald’s stores.\xa0\xa0McDonald’s is on the GrabFood delivery service.

Its space combines old and new elements, placing a modern spin on a 70s coffee house.Seng House opened its doors to the public on Dec 15. Its owner, Hong Liya, is also the brains behind Seng Coffee Bar, a cafe and bar concept by herself and her father along Changi Road. The duo also owns the popular Gu Zao Ren Taiwan Porridge that’s located beside Seng Coffee Bar.\xa0Seng House’s menu is divided into six sections: Breakfast (available until 5pm), lunch (available from 11am to closing) and dinner (available from 6pm to closing), bakery, desserts and sides.\xa0You may find it strange that the lunch and dinner menu is staggered in such a way, since dishes in both sections are available until closing.\xa0The answer lies in the fact that many of the ingredients used in its dishes are handmade from scratch, resulting in long preparation hours. The staggered availability of dishes allows the team ample time to get ready.For example, the spaghetti and linguine used in its pasta dishes are made fresh in-house.\xa0Its desserts also get the same attention. The mille crepe cake (from S$9) requires the baker to layer each crepe above one another, piece by piece.Hong said that the goal for her and the team was to bring comforting, nostalgic foods to cafes in Singapore. She drew heavy inspiration from her childhood experience in creating the menu.\xa0The claypot chicken rice (S$18.80) is a dish similar to one she often had as a child. The dish is made even more homely with the addition of Seng House’s homemade chili.\xa0One of its most popular dishes, the Hainanese pork chop (S$22.50) was inspired by Hong’s father who used to run a Hainanese western F&B place. According to Hong, the dish uses Iberico pork which grants the pork chop a juicer texture. Instead of normal breadcrumbs, Seng House uses old-school biscuit crumbs.Coffee lovers can also look forward to a range of coffee-based drinks, including cold brews and filter coffee using beans from Ethiopia, Kenya and Costa Rica.\xa0At night, choose from its selection of craft beers (from S$9), cocktails (from S$16.50) or wines.With its thoughtful curated menus and wide selection of drinks available, Seng House is a wonderful spot for meals or deep conversations among friends.\xa0\xa0Seng House is on the GrabFood delivery service.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/cafe-gui/:['Cafe Gui is a Korean-Japanese fusion cafe in Royal Square at Novena sandwiched between a gaggle of beauty parlours, TCM clinics and hair salons. It’s definitely not somewhere you’d expect an aesthetic, whitewashed, minimalistic cafe, but perhaps that’s the charm.Still, when it comes to food options in this neighbourhood, a diner would be spoilt for choice.\xa0Downstairs, there’s crowd-favourite Two Men Bagel House; at the corner, an Indian-Muslim food court; and on the sixth floor, the ubiquitous Haidilao Hot Pot.\xa0Maybe Cafe Gui’s decision to set up shop here is to fill a gap. Dependable, safe, it-just-works Korean fare that can feel a little too run-of-the-mill at some parts.A quick search online reveals that the space is apparently named after GuiGui, the owner’s pet cat who recently passed away.\xa0Beyond that interesting origin, little can be gleaned about Cafe Gui apart from its being a 16-seat joint with great lighting from its floor-to-ceiling windows.\xa0If you’re here to take photos, the seats furthest in are your best bet.The ika geso (S$9.90) surprised me with its deft handling of seasoning. Squid tentacles are breaded delicately, then fried and tossed artfully in a delightful blend of salt and pepper. To say that this is addictive would be severely understating the fact.It rained the whole day I visited, so getting the simply named Korean ramen (S$9.90) was a no-brainer. It’s a comforting and familiar bowl served with luncheon meat and kimchi, and makes for great eating on a cold December.\xa0I also liked the hint of spice at the finish, which gave it a good kick of heat.\xa0Sure, one may say “I can cook this myself at home”, but for S$9.90, I’d gladly pay someone else to make it for me.\xa0Another main dish that’s equally comforting — and great for kids — is the Arabiki sausage bowl (S$14.90). I particularly enjoyed the great acidic flavours from the pickled beetroot and cabbage that went incredibly well with the pork sausages.\xa0It also comes with scrambled eggs, which I thought were beautifully silky but desperately needed more seasoning.\xa0Still, if you’re looking for a bento-box idea for your young brood, this would make great inspiration.\xa0So far, so dependable.\xa0That’s until the Korean black soy pudding (S$7.90) was served. This was tasty. I’m certain Cafe Gui intentionally downplayed the other dishes to make space for this standout star. It’s everything a food reviewer can ask for in a sweet treat.\xa0I particularly appreciated the play on texture — silky-smooth pudding in delightful contrast with the crunchy peanut bits. All this sits on a round of pandan bread, finished with a sprinkling of black sesame powder. It’s not overwhelmingly sweet, and everything was in perfect balance.\xa0If only everything else were this innovative.\xa0I ordered the grilled chicken skewer (S$16.90) because it’s the one dish I see at every table.\xa0Small wonder — grilled chicken skewer with yakitori sauce is the epitome of approachable.\xa0The Cafe Gui iteration has a lot to live up to, and in some ways, it did. The meat is thickly cut, juicy and adequately seasoned. But that’s where the praise ends.\xa0The presentation, for instance, is vibrant, but too separate to sit on the same plate. The onigiri could have been approached more creatively — even the 7-Eleven one has filling.\xa0And then there’s the Dalgona Honeycomb (S$9.90). An “in-house special!” the menu screams.\xa0In reality, it’s a latte served with chunks of dalgona honeycomb. Also, dalgona? In 2022? Come on.\xa0Still, what would have been more 2022 is to have options for alternative milk — oat or soy, take your pick. When asked about its absence, the counter staff told me they haven’t had many requests for it since the cafe opened in September.\xa0I don’t buy it. Alternative dairy is akin to inclusivity in the office. You don’t have to wait till someone demands inclusivity before you start being inclusive.\xa0After all, it’s not just lactose-intolerant diners who prefer alternative milk. Many others prefer it on account of principles and beliefs. Not having the option in this day and age is a strange decision.\xa0\xa0Is it conducive to conversation? Yes. The seats are well-spaced.\xa0\xa0Is a reservation necessary? Cafe Gui accepts walk-ins only.How to get there? Alight at Novena MRT station and walk through Novena Square to the second floor.\xa0HungryGoWhere paid for its meal at this cafe for this review.\xa0Cafe Gui is on GrabFood.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/circular-croissants-singapore/:['Of late, croissants have claimed their spot as one of the hottest foods in Singapore. They first appeared in various shapes resembling muffins, cubes and even donuts. Now, they’re coming to us as cream-filled, circular croissants drizzled to aesthetic perfection.\xa0These circular croissants premiered at Lafayette Cafe and Bakery in New York City in April. They quickly made waves across Instagram and TikTok for their extravagant appearance, and garnered so much hype that each customer was limited to buying just one.\xa0Thankfully, we won’t have to fly to the Big Apple to get a taste of these beauties.\xa0Over the past fortnight, bakeries across Singapore have been launching their own renditions of the viral TikTok food trend. Singaporeans, for their part, have been making a beeline for these shops to check out the hype. The few bakeries that have them are selling out within hours of opening their doors.\xa0Getting your hands on these may not be as hard as you think, however, with more bakeries boarding the bandwagon. The latest one to do so is the popular Keong Saik Bakery, which released a teaser on the launch of its round croissants, Crolls, happening on Wednesday (Sept 21).In terms of texture, little separates the circular croissants from its traditional counterparts.\xa0It’s got a flaky and crispy exterior, and a honeycomb-like interior. The main difference lies in the taste.\xa0Circular croissants are flavour-bombs bursting with cream filling, so don’t expect the typical buttery taste found in regular croissants.23 Hamilton Road\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (8am to 6pm)Dubbed La Lebombz, the circular croissants from La Levain were sold out within an hour of their launch on Sept 19. There are six flavours on its menu, with an equal number of sweet and savoury options.If you have a sweet tooth, there are the Nutella, Passionfruit and Mango, and Raspberry Lebombz (from S$6.20 onwards)On the savoury side, it sells Truffle Cream Cheese, Parma Ham and Cheese, and Mushroom Camembert Cheese Lebombz (from S$7.20).If you didn’t manage to get your hands on these, fret not. La Levain plans to increase the quantity to meet customer demand. The team says new flavours are also in the works in the coming weeks, so keep your eyes on its Instagram page for the latest updates.\xa0Place a pre-order on the La Levain website to secure your pastry.lyf Farrer Park Singapore, 01-06, 2 Perumal Road\xa0\nOpen: Wednesday to Sunday (9am to 11pm)Yeast Side is a cafe-bar that recently opened its second store at Farrer Park. Its circular croissants, known as Swirls, are available only at this store.Of the four bakeries that sell circular croissants, Yeast Side has the smallest variety, with just three flavours: Almond Swirl, Black Forest Swirl and Vanilla Pistachio Swirl (S$10 each).\xa0The bakery turns out 20 Swirls in each flavour per day.Yeast Side is also working on a pre-order link to prevent wasted trips down to its Farrer Park store. Keep a lookout on its Instagram bio for updates.33 Keong Saik Road and 44 Jalan Merah Saga, 01-42\xa0\nOpen: Operating hours vary across stores\xa0After two months of R&D to get the perfect ASMR crunch, Keong Saik Bakery will be launching its Crolls on Sept 21. It’ll have four flavours ready for the launch: Pistachio Praline, Cacio e Pepe, Genmaicha, and Milo.\xa0Unlike the other bakeries, its Crolls are sold in smaller, bite-sized pieces. It was inspired by a Saudi Arabian bakery, Over Jar, which had a similar pastry on sale.\xa0You’ll have to buy them in sets of four (S$14), but you can pick different flavours — an upside, since you can easily try all four. Keong Saik Bakery is planning to make pre-orders available.\xa0If your heart is truly set on having just one flavour, you can opt to dine at its stores and order a single Croll (S$3.90 each). These won’t be available for pre-order, so make sure you go early, as the bakery’s making just 10 to 12 Crolls per flavour in a day.\xa0The bakery says it will “see the response in the coming weeks and months” before deciding if the Crolls will be a permanent fixture on its menu.Cluny Court, 01-02B, 501 Bukit Timah Road\xa0\nOpen: Daily (9.30am to 6pm)Swish Rolls was the first bakery to announce the launch of the circular croissants named Croons on Sept 9. There are five flavours on the menu: Crackly Sea Salt Butter, Loaded Pistachio, Super Summer Berries, Deep Dark Varlhona Chocolate, and Ham n’ Cheez (from S$3 onwards).\xa0HungryGoWhere tried the Loaded Pistachio, Deep Dark Varlhona Chocolate and Crackly Sea Salt Butter while we were there. We enjoyed the richness of the Deep Dark Varlhona Chocolate Croon and found the nutty sweetness of the Loaded Pistachio delightful. The Crackly Sea Salt Butter Croon was forgettable, though, and we’d have enjoyed a regular croissant more.\xa0\xa0Swish Rolls bakes its Croons in two batches: 9.30am and 1pm. Each customer is limited to buying six, so be sure to head there early to snag yours. When we arrived at 2pm on Monday to collect our pre-ordered Croons, they were already sold out and unavailable for walk-in purchases.\xa0Alternatively, you can pre-order the Croons on the Swish Rolls website to avoid disappointment (and queues). But note that pre-orders have to be made six business days in advance.\xa0\xa0The bakery says it has sold more than 3,000 Croons so far and produces about 400 a day.Azhar Aziz contributed reporting.\xa0La Levain, Yeast Side and Keong Saik Bakery are on the GrabFood delivery service.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/ben-yeo/:['It would be a pretty massive understatement to call Ben Yeo — actor, host and fashion enthusiast — a mere fellow foodie.It’s been a whirlwind three years for the 44-year-old, who has launched several F&B concepts within this short period.The list of ventures is impressive, stretching across the breadth of Singapore’s food scene — and during Covid-19, too.“I remember when we opened SG Umami (Yeo’s fusion izakaya and pizza joint) with a soft launch on May 15, 2021. Right after that, at midnight, we started to pack away all our chairs and tables, because the Heightened Alert started on May 16,” he says.Heightened Alert refers to Covid-19 controls that were rolled out in 2021, which saw the cessation of dine-in activities at all F&B establishments in Singapore in May.“It was a roller-coaster for all businesses.”Even then, the down-to-earth serial entrepreneur seems to have taken all these and more in his stride. After all, he’s no stranger to the ups and downs of F&B, having been in the business for decades.At present, there’s SG Chee Cheong Fun — an online purveyor of gourmet chee cheong fun (rice noodle roll) kits with premium condiments — launched during the height of the pandemic.\xa0There’s also the aforementioned SG Umami, specialty steamboat eatery Tan Xiang Charcoal Fish Head Steamboat Restaurant, lok lok stall Geon-Bae Korean Lok Lok, beer garden Playground, and even a durian business named SG Mao Shan Wang.His latest venture, mod-Chinese resto Tan Xiang Yuan, opened in November on the fringes of Rochor and Little India.Yeo had his fingers in the fast-casual pie, too — a 2021 tie-up with McDonald’s saw the creation of an all-new Hainanese chicken burger.And if that isn’t enough to keep anyone busy, he’s cooked up many a storm on YouTube and television, in addition to a steady stream of acting work.HungryGoWhere sat down with him to get an insight into chef Ben.Yeo’s fans are probably well-acquainted with his background before he embarked on his acting career. As a teenager, he trained in the culinary arts at Shatec, and interned at Cantonese restaurant Hai Tien Lo under legendary masterchef Chan Chen Hei.“I always wanted to be a Japanese chef and work in Japan,” he says. But he eventually took up work as a store manager for Delifrance for a year and a half, where he learnt the ins and outs of the F&B industry.Spurred on by his love for fashion, he opened his own streetwear shop at Far East Plaza, at age 21.“All my passions just so happened to start with the letter ‘F’. Food, fashion, and now I’m a father,” he muses.\xa0This was before he was scouted by then-broadcast giant SPH MediaWorks, and the rest is history, as they say.Even as an established actor-presenter today, Yeo has made it no secret that food continues to be a big part of his life.“I can’t act forever, so I still need something else to do,” he says wryly.His forays into the food scene stretch as far back as late 2012 with Play Kitchen, a Western stall at Jurong Point. In the years that followed, Yeo’s also helmed fried chicken chain Tenderfresh, as well as Hawkerman, a casual eatery.As Yeo knocks out concept after concept — each with its own brand story and recipes — the burning question remains: Where does his inspiration come from?\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Junction Westgate opening with promos; will house 23 tenants, including new halal teppanyaki\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50% off at picturesque date spots, including Wildseed Cafe at The Alkaff Mansion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“From everywhere,” he says matter-of-factly. “(It comes) from my own experience, business partners, family — from my grandma and my mum.”His first pandemic venture, SG Chee Cheong Fun, was born out of some experiments with condiments from heritage soya sauce brand Kwong Woh Hin Factory. Yeo and his business partner Dickson Woo, the third-generation owner of Kwong Woh Hin, then pulled the business together into its present iteration.Yeo isn’t one to stew too long on a good idea either. SG Mao Shan Wang, for example, took off in three days.He recounts: “My partners and I discussed it on the first day. The next day I went out to source for durian suppliers, and on the third day, we started to sell them.“All of us love eating durian, but when it comes to selling, none of us had any experience. Only I knew a little bit about how to open the fruit.“With the help of a friend who has experience selling durians, we just whacked (got on with it).”One thing he’s learnt is that having to deal with uncontrollable variables, such as traffic, the weather and the fruit’s short shelf life, makes selling durian a highly stressful trade. (Did you know, according to Yeo, that at room temperature, durians last only for 30 hours from the moment it falls off the tree?)The business ran for two seasons, from June to September 2021, and again during the same months in 2022. Yet, due to the difficulty in ensuring the fruit’s quality, Yeo doesn’t foresee the business continuing into the new year.For him, though, the food always takes centrestage.\xa0“Usually, I will think of the food first — what to sell, what to create. After that, we will think of the environment and the concept.”The process sometimes evolves far beyond what he initially envisages — just as in Tan Xiang Yuan, which was intended to be a second outpost for his casual fishhead steamboat concept.\xa0“But when we came here, we saw the structure (of the conserved building) and thought: ‘Maybe we can do a bit more.’ Eventually, we changed the concept and it became a modern-Chinese restaurant.”Today, Tan Xiang Yuan seats 100 diners, with room for more when the eatery completes renovations on the second floor, hopefully before Chinese New Year in January.It still has a signature hotpot dish, but it’s not quite the same. The dish, and the restaurant as a whole, revolves around live seafood and atas (elevated) ingredients, such as scallops and fish maw. There’s even a durian chilli crab and a fried Mao Shan Wang dessert.Yeo is still active in the media industry, and calls it his main business, while these are more like side ventures.He hopes to bring Tan Xiang Charcoal Fish Head Steamboat Restaurant to more locations around the island.\xa0He can’t quite promise that it’ll look exactly the same, though. As with Tan Xiang Yuan, he and his partners dislike overhauling a new location just to fit the concept they had in mind.“We will go to the location first, then try to incorporate the environment into our restaurants or stalls.”As for passing the businesses down to his two sons, aged 10 and 13, Yeo doesn’t quite think they’re keen.“They’re more interested in eating than cooking,” he jokes.Playground is on the GrabFood delivery service.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/3-bubble-tea-gems/:['Food trends may come and go, but bubble tea is here to stay. You might be surprised to know that its history in Singapore dates as far back as 1992 and regained popularity in 2001 before the trend dropped off. In 2011, it made another comeback and has been cemented in the hearts of many Singaporeans ever since.\xa0Now, we’re spilling the tea on some hidden bubble tea gems for your next boba craving — specifically three brands that are collaborating with HungryGoWhere to offer exclusive discounts in September!\xa0Readers can enjoy 10 per cent off selected drinks from Sept 1 to 30 by simply flashing this article and showing the staff that you’ve liked and followed HungryGoWhere’s Facebook page.\xa0\xa0Chagee set foot in Singapore only recently, in 2021. Despite being a newer player in our bubble tea scene, it has quickly expanded across the island — with a total of 10 outlets and a new Wisma Atria store opening in September.With an aim to preserve Chinese tea culture, its drinks combine flavours of its homegrown tea leaves with fresh fruit or fresh milk to put a modern twist on these traditional teas.The more popular drink options from the milk tea series include the Da Hong Pao Latte and Jasmine Green Tea Latte (S$7.20). Those with a preference for intense tea flavours should opt for the former, while those who like a more subtle, floral taste can try the latter.\xa0If you’re looking to satisfy a craving for something sweet, its White Peach Oolong Latte might do the trick. The sweetness of the peach is a prominent component of the drink and gives it its unique fruity flavour.Do note that the 10 per cent discount applies only to Chagee’s milk tea series.What to order: Da Hong Pao Latte (S$7.80), White Peach Oolong Latte (S$7.20)The Whale Tea opened its first store in Singapore in 2019, with the aim of offering its customers unique, healthy and tasty beverages. What sets it apart is its tea-brewing process, which uses a one-of-a-kind machine called a “teapressor”.While the 10 per cent discount is applicable only to one drink per customer and excludes toppings, you can still order its signature drinks that already come with toppings, such as the Flaming Brown Sugar.It’s a three-layered drink made of brown sugar pearls and cold milk, and topped with cheese foam. As a finishing touch, the foam is torched to give the drink its caramelised flavour.A lighter alternative would be its Grapefruit Lava (S$5.80) that features fresh grapefruit pulp and peach gum — a zero-calorie topping with a jelly-like texture. If you’re a tea enthusiast, you can’t go wrong with the Honey Dong Ding Oolong either.What to order: Flaming Brown Sugar (S$7.10), Honey Dong Ding Oolong (from S$4)Our final gem is homegrown brand Woobbee, which has been around since 2010.\xa0You can expect more local flavours on its menu, such as its signature Herbal Mint Milk Tea with Grass Jelly. Also known as the “Pei Pa Koa” drink, it’s reminiscent of childhood days when our parents spoon-fed us the familiar syrup as a remedy for coughs and sore throats.\xa0Another locally inspired drink is the grape Yakult earl grey tea. Unlike typical bubble tea drinks, this drink uses cold-brew French earl grey tea as its base.If you want a healthy and refreshing option, consider having its Fresh Milk Black Tea with Less Sugar (from S$4). This drink also qualifies for the Health Promotion Board’s challenge if you’re looking to earn extra rewards.Bear in mind that the 10 per cent discount for Woobbee cannot be stacked on top of existing discounts and won’t come with shop rebates, and applies only to its large drinks or a minimum of S$5 spent. Though this excludes ice blended or fresh juice options, there’s still a variety of beverage options available.\xa0What to order: Herbal Mint Milk Tea (from S$4.80), grape Yakult earl grey tea (from S$3.80)Book a ride to these bubble tea shops.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

But the brand promises a chocolate wonderland that will be a contemporary reimagination of Wonka’s whimsical factory, complete with chocolate delicacies and a multisensory journey to appreciate the cacao fruit.Located in Dempsey, the factory will open this Saturday (Dec 3). It spans close to 5,000 sqf and houses experiential zones, including a creation station that allows you to build your own slab of chocolate, a first in Singapore. Pick from a wide variety of ingredients such as dried fruits and nuts to create your personalised chocolate bars.A post shared by HungryGoWhere (@hungrygowhere)Then, move on to get an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at Mr Bucket Chocolaterie’s chocolate-making approach.\xa0Take a peek as its chocolate makers sort, roast and grind cacao beans before tempering it into a rich substance at the Hot Kitchen (named The Bean Room).\xa0The Cold Kitchen (named The Chocolate Room) is where the magic happens — you’ll get to see the velvety chocolate being crafted into the brand’s signature bon bons, bars and more.Desperately needing chocolate after the delightful view? You can instantly indulge in your craving in its cafe. The dining area comprises an indoor space, named The Tasting Room, and an al fresco set-up at the factory’s outdoor patio, called The Cacao Garden.\xa0The natural wooden chairs, high ceiling and minimalist aesthetic lend a calming vibe to The Tasting Room. This, coupled with the aromatic smells of the freshly made chocolate desserts, makes dining in here an exquisite experience.Dig into an array of food and beverages from a menu that has been specially curated by the brand. A highlight is the bean-to-bar journey tasting set, a chocolate flight that showcases the bean-to-bar journey.Served on a wooden tray, it showcases the evolution of cacao beans harvested from a farm in Panchor, Malaysia.Eat your way through the tray, starting from the cacao bean dark chocolate dragee, before moving onto a refreshing cacao husk lemon tea, 66 per cent chocolate bar and double soy caramel bon bon. Finish with a 64 per cent chocolate passionfruit sable.Other bakes are also available, such as the chocolate passionfruit tart, which features 64 per cent panchor ganache and passionfruit mousse, and the festive maple apple cake — made with maple mascarpone, apple insert, panchor cremeux and maple sable breton.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Feuds: Saizeriya vs Milan Shokudo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatisserie Cle brings its well-crafted pastries to new River Valley flagship for fifth anniversary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15 best Holland Village cafes for the ’gram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Bucket Chocolaterie adopts a sustainable, zero-waste approach to the cacao fruit. It does this by using all parts of the fruit to create a variety of beverages to complement its bakes.If you haven’t gotten enough of the cacao husk lemon tea from the tasting flight, you can order a full-sized version. It’s made from cacao husks infused with lemon, sweetened with homemade cacao syrup and topped with a cacao foam sweetener.\xa0Alternatively, you can opt for the classic iced chocolate, which is made by steeping 64 per cent panchor granules in milk.Once you’re satiated, move on to the chocolate dispensary, where you get to load up on treats for snacking at home.Launched in November 2020, Mr Bucket Chocolaterie is a Singapore-based chocolate lifestyle brand that specialises in artisanal chocolate bon bons and treats from cacao sourced only within Asia. At present, it has one chocolate store in Sin Ming.Its founder, James Penafort, said in a press release that he hopes the new Dempsey factory will help to “cultivate a deeper appreciation for cacao grown in Asia”.\n\n“We’ll continue to champion Asian cacao and pay homage to producers from the region, through showcasing the bean-to-bar process and sharing the stories of the farms and farmers behind these delicious chocolates,” said Penafort.Mr Bucket Chocolaterie is on the GrabMart delivery service.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/the-great-bay-fiesta/:['Nothing screams Christmas quite like a carnival. The Great Bay Fiesta, a Christmas carnival held at the Bayfront event space near Marina Bay Sands (MBS), will put you in the best festive mood imaginable. It will open daily for feasting and play from 1pm to 10pm, and run until Jan 1, 2023.\xa0Once there, you can be assured of a good time as The Great Bay Fiesta has got all things that make a carnival great – circus, games, light shows, and of course, food.A post shared by HungryGoWhere (@hungrygowhere)The food stalls at the carnival feature both local and international brands, with a decent selection of dishes available.It is the only sheltered area on the grounds, excluding the tents used for performances, so you may want to check the weather forecast before heading down. Expect lots of Thai night market food items as more than 10 brands were specially flown in to join the line-up of stalls, including the popular Indy Pancake Cartoon.\xa0With over a hundred cartoon pancake (one for S$12, two for S$20) characters to choose from, you’d be spoilt for choice. While it was a little pricey, we were impressed by the skill of the vendor and surprised to find that the pancake was airy, moist and flavourful – even without maple syrup drenched on top.\xa0Other vendors were offering items such as fresh seafood (from S$10), meat skewers (from S$2), mango smoothie (S$5) and more.\xa0We highly recommend you make your way down a little later in the day, as most of the Thai stalls had not finished setting up during our visit, even at 4pm. Local brands present include social enterprise My Nonna’s, which serves mostly Western items such as foot long hotdogs (from S$8) and fish and chips (S$15), and Hitokuchi Onigiri, a newly established brand selling a sandwich onigiri hybrid.\xa0If you’re feeling thirsty, Coco San is serving up coconut shakes (from S$4.40) in its various permutations to freshen you up, including taro coconut shake and oreo crumble coconut shake. Alternatively, get a pint of beer (S$10) from the beer garden.\xa0\xa0There’s nothing quite like winning a plushie to commemorate your trip to a carnival. Most of the carnival games range from S$6 to S$10 (the number of tries differs from game to game), though you’d probably need to spend more to win yourself a prize.\xa0If you’re feeling lucky, opt for the bag-fishing game to the side of the bumper car area. You simply have to fish for a shopping bag — you’d get whatever prize is within.\xa0If you’re just there to have fun, there are carnival rides such as bumper cars and a pirate ship, and there’s also a bouncy castle. Most of the rides are catered to children, but it’s a good trip down memory lane for the rest of us.If you’re in need of some entertainment, splash out a little on The Great Cirque des Cascades by Gandey’s Circus. Performances run from Tuesday to Sunday and cost upwards of S$76. If you’re not sure what to expect, think clowns, lots of acrobatics and motorcycle stunts.\xa0The thrilling, jaw-dropping routines conducted by performers from the UK will leave you breathless — and in need of a thirst quencher.Do note that while entry to the food area is free, you will have to buy a S$10 admission ticket to enter the carnival games area.\xa0Book a ride to the Great Bay Fiesta.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/puzzle-coffee/:['Christmas is all about giving. And what better gift than Melbourne-favourite Puzzle Coffee making its way to Singapore?\xa0Launched in 2021, Puzzle Coffee has grown exponentially in popularity. The Singapore outpost is its fifth outlet, as well as its first international location.\xa0The specialty coffee joint landed here on Nov 22 and has been enjoying a steady stream of patrons since. It helps that Puzzle Coffee is conveniently located right outside the entrance of Orchard MRT station.\xa0\xa0Though it takes up a pretty large area, the space at Puzzle Coffee is small and cosy. It functions mostly as a takeaway unit, with only 20 seats available. Odds are, you’ll be sharing your table with others.\xa0\xa0Still, its white and wood themed interior gives it a sense of serenity that is a contrast to the bustle of the mall. Puzzle Coffee promised to bring the same vibe from its Melbourne outlet, and we’re inclined to say that it delivered.\xa0\xa0Puzzle Coffee has collaborated with Bakery Artisan Original to provide freshly baked pastries such as the kaya croissant (S$5) to accompany its drinks. It’s a great snack after a round of Christmas shopping.\xa0The drink menu at Puzzle Coffee is neatly divided into three sections: coffee, specialty drinks with no coffee, and pour-over coffees.\xa0Its coffee beans are sourced from around the world and flown into Melbourne for roasting. Thereafter, the beans are distributed to its various locations, including the Puzzle Coffee outlet in Singapore.\xa0\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Feuds: Saizeriya vs Milan Shokudo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatisserie Cle brings its well-crafted pastries to new River Valley flagship for fifth anniversary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15 best Holland Village cafes for the ’gram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic (S$6) — dubbed Melbourne’s secret — is very similar to a cup of white (from S$6). The only difference is that Magic has more coffee than milk. We found the drink to have a thinner consistency and lacking a strong aroma. Otherwise, it was a decent cup of joe.\xa0Of course, Puzzle Coffee is best known for its edible cups (extra S$3). While we love the novelty of this concept, we’re not sure we’d pay for it. The edible cup had the texture of stale biscuits and the taste of wheat crackers.\xa0Another coffee drink we tried was the dirty matcha (from S$7), which combines matcha with coffee. It tasted like a muted version of pure matcha, with a hint of a nutty aftertaste from the espresso.\xa0Surprisingly, the sweet potato latte (from S$6.50) was the standout performer among both coffee and non-coffee drinks. It was sweet and had a strong taste of sweet potatoes – perfect if you aren’t a fan of coffee or dislike the taste of milk.\xa0Fans of black sesame should also try its black sesame latte (from S$6), which can best be described as something similar to black sesame milk. The drink would’ve been elevated if it had a deeper, nuttier flavour.A post shared by HungryGoWhere (@hungrygowhere)For pour-over coffees, Puzzle Coffee has a variety of four to five beans to choose from. Its single origin beans (S$7 for hot, S$8 for iced) will rotate on a weekly or biweekly basis, depending on the supply.\xa0Meanwhile, its Ninety Plus Gesha lineup is fixed with the following beans: Kambera (S$19 for hot, S$20 for iced), Juliette (S$25 for hot, S$26 for iced) and Perci (S$30 for hot, S$31 for iced).\xa0But what’s with the hefty price tag? Gesha, or Geisha, coffee is famed for its high quality and unique flavour profile of floral and sweet notes. However, the plant isn’t easy to cultivate, hence the high price point.\xa0Not many coffee houses bring in Gesha coffees, so that’s great news for die hard coffee fans. If you can look past paying S$30 for your coffee, that is.\xa0\xa0Book a ride to Puzzle Coffee.\xa0Ion Orchard, B1-38/39, 2 Orchard Turn\xa0\nNearest MRT station: Orchard\xa0\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (10am to 10pm)Ion Orchard, B1-38/39, 2 Orchard Turn\xa0\nNearest MRT station: Orchard\xa0\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (10am to 10pm)Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

There’s also a gift shop selling various dinosaur merchandise such as shirts, dino eggs, and plushies.Dishes here start from S$8.80, and you can order from a self-ordering kiosk.HungryGoWhere was there for a media tasting, and it was a hearty meal indeed.\xa0The tonkotsu soba (S$13.80) from Tsuta had a milky and umami broth, but what won us over was its tori karaage with mayo (S$10.80) that had a surprisingly well-seasoned crispy skin and juicy chicken meat.We tried the signature soya sauce chicken rice (S$8.80) from Hawker Chan, and enjoyed the tender meat and flavourful sauce that was on a par with its other outlets.From Nasi Lemak Ayam Taliwang, we had its namesake dish: The Michelin-featured nasi lemak ayam taliwang (S$9.90), which had well-seasoned chicken, flavourful chilli and garnishes to go along with fluffy coconut rice.The pad krapow (S$8.80), a minced pork stir-fry dish with chilli and basil leaves from Took Lae Dee, was comforting with its juicy, fragrant minced pork paired with white rice. The winner for us, however, was the pad thai (S$9.80), a classic Thai rice noodle dish, which had the smoky wok hei char, sweet sauce, and zesty lime blended with perfectly fried noodles.We reckon the Jurassic Nest food hall would be the newest hangout for families, especially with the multitude of events happening at Gardens by the Bay, such as the Pokemon Go Safari Zone event from Nov 18 to 20, Avatar: The Experience at the Cloud Forest, and the highly anticipated Christmas Wonderland happening from Dec 2.\n\xa0Hawker Chan, Tsuta, Bismillah Biryani, Nasi Lemak Ayam Taliwang, Took Lae Dee, and Putien are on GrabFood.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/meow-barbecue-bugis/:['From wallet-friendly yakiniku outlets to Korean barbecues, Singaporeans can’t get enough of tableside grilling. Bringing its unique flavour of Korean, Japanese and Chinese cuisine, Meow Barbecue from China joins the fray on Saturday (Sept 24).\xa0Aside from being one of the most established chains in China with more than 30 stores across major cities, the cat-themed barbecue restaurant was founded in 2012 by 53-year-old owner Fang Daqiang, aptly known as Uncle Meow.\xa0It’s no surprise that he has been a fan of felines since he had one as a child. Meow Barbecue was inspired by his love for his pet cat and pays tribute to its picky taste buds.A post shared by HungryGoWhere (@hungrygowhere)The Singapore store at Bugis+ will be its first outpost abroad. Fang says Singapore’s multiculturalism makes it an ideal city to assess how Meow Barbecue’s special blend of barbecue would be received by different palates.\xa0The space can seat up to 90 diners, with most tables holding a party of four. Expect to find adorable cat motifs and decor all around the restaurant, from the entrance to the desserts served — truly a cat lover’s Instagram haven.\xa0That being said, you don’t have to be a cat lover to appreciate Meow Barbecue.\xa0There’s something for everyone on its extensive menu with different quality cuts of beef, pork, chicken, and seafood.\xa0One of the items that stood out most was the Meow signature spicy beef (S$23.80). It had a spicy kick and was equal parts sour and savoury, a flavour profile mala fans would enjoy. Yet this is not typically found at barbecue restaurants here.\xa0Another interesting dish is the Iberico pork collar marinated in pineapple sauce (S$22.80). The marbled cubes of meat are grilled along with the pineapple slices, allowing the mild sweetness and acidity of the fruit to offset the fattiness of the pork collar.\xa0As the servers come by the table to cook the meats for us, they disclose that there’s a method to enjoying the grilled food.\xa0They’re taught to alternate between cooking dishes with original, sweet and savoury flavours, so as not to overwhelm diners with the same tastes.\xa0Those gunning for variety may wish to opt for the value-for-money set, the Meow signature mixed meat platter (S$66.80).\xa0It includes its bestseller, the Meow signature beef cubes with onion, together with premium Iberico pork belly, Iberico pork collar in smoky sauce, teriyaki chicken thigh, and marbled beef chuck.\xa0Our top pick from the platter: The marbled beef chuck, which was bursting with flavour and incredibly tender.\xa0\xa0Pair your meats with four housemade dipping sauces: Omnipotent seasoning, grapefruit juice, Japanese-style sauce, and Thai-style sour-and-spicy sauce. We particularly enjoyed the grapefruit juice sauce, which was sweet and tart, pairing well with most meats.\xa0What surprised us the most was how well done the desserts and drinks were. The Meow lemon tea (S$3.80) used both lemons and limes to give it a nice balance of sweet and sour, serving as a great palate-cleanser between bites.The most impressively plated desserts we’ve seen at barbecue restaurants were the Snow Ice items (S$10.80 each) available in two flavours: Soy and oreo. A mound of shaved ice (either milk- or soy-flavoured) over a grass jelly bed, they’re topped with whipped cream that holds in place a cat paw pudding.\xa0If you don’t particularly enjoy the taste of fresh milk, opt for the soy-flavoured snow ice that comes drizzled with strawberry sauce. Meow Barbecue is offering an opening promotion from now till Sept 30, so head there early.\xa0You get 50 per cent off its signature dishes: The spicy beef (UP: S$23.80) and chicken with cheese dip (UP: S$15.80). We recommend making a reservation to secure your seats.If you share a passion for cats, sign up for its membership and get cat-themed memorabilia such as badges and trinkets.\xa0It’ll also give you discounts on certain dishes such as its Meow signature chicken with Sichuan pepper (S$14.80 for non-members, S$13.80 for members).\xa0Book a ride to Meow Barbecue.Bugis+, 01-17, 201 Victoria Street\nNearest MRT station: Bugis\xa0\nOpen: Sunday to Thursday (11am to 9.30pm); Friday, Saturday and public holidays (11am to 1am)Bugis+, 01-17, 201 Victoria Street\nNearest MRT station: Bugis\xa0\nOpen: Sunday to Thursday (11am to 9.30pm); Friday, Saturday and public holidays (11am to 1am)Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/what-you-should-order-from-miracle-coffee/:['A pop-up of local Mandopop star JJ Lin’s coffee concept Miracle Coffee finally opened on Friday (Sept 30) to much fanfare. Some fans arrived there before dawn, ahead of its opening at noon.The kiosk, located at the ArtScience Museum’s outdoor Rain Oculus, is a sneak preview to the opening of its flagship store, slated to launch in 2023 at the museum’s lobby.\xa0We, too, got in line from 8am, and managed to take our turn by 12.20pm. Once at the counter, we were momentarily stumped by the options available. There were 10 caffeinated options, ranging from cold brews and pour-overs to specialty lattes and the usual Americano and cappuccino.\xa0We opted for a pour-over with beans from Costa Rica (S$9), described as having notes of pineapple, nuts and chocolate.A post shared by HungryGoWhere (@hungrygowhere)It was a well-brewed cup of coffee that we thoroughly enjoyed, thanks to the sweet notes that came with a slightly acidic aftertaste. But it did not have a velvety mouthfeel, which we felt would have elevated the coffee to the next level.\xa0We also tried the Singapore-exclusive Kaya Cloud (S$9), an Americano-style coffee topped with fresh cream flavoured with kaya as well as shaved gula melaka.\xa0While we did not discern any kaya from the cream, we enjoyed the distinct smoky and caramel flavour of the gula melaka, which helped balance out the bitterness of the coffee.If you are not a coffee connoisseur and simply want a simple and classic brew, we recommend the oat milk latte (S$7.50). The light and smooth beverage is a good middle ground between the intensity of the pour-over and the syrupy Kaya Cloud. Our cup did feel like it had more oat milk than coffee, so in future we’d probably ask the barista to temper that down.Over at the lobby of the ArtScience Museum, where SweetSpot cafe is currently situated, you’d also get to try a sampling of Miracle Coffee’s non-caffeinated favourites on top of Americano and latte, such as the brown sugar hojicha latte (S$6.80), Miracle Milo (S$6.50) and JJ’s Wonderblend (S$6.80).We loved the Wonderblend, which is a refreshing smoothie comprising a blend of blueberries, bananas and yoghurt. It helped quench our thirst after the wait, and it didn’t hurt that the bright colours were perfectly Instagram-worthy.\xa0The 90-day pop-up kiosk will end on Dec 29, so make your way there soon!Victoria Bok and Azhar Aziz contributed reporting.Book a ride to the Miracle Coffee pop-up kiosk.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/gamo/:['Tucked within the old-school bookshops and music stores in Bras Basah Complex is the newly opened bakery Gamo. It’s the first Muslim-owned bakery selling Japanese-inspired pastries.\xa0If you’ve been on TikTok over the past week, you may have come across Gamo’s post showing where it’s located.Some fans expressed excitement about its opening on Sept 10 in the comments, given its proximity to their workplace, while others were excited about a new addition to the Muslim-owned bakery scene in town. The bakery is a small space with limited seating. The interior is reminiscent of a modern Japanese home with white walls, wooden accents and green plants.\xa0Gamo is run by a small team of three led by pastry chef Shah Sarifi, who leads the team with almost a decade of experience. She boasts an impressive resume with stints at a number of five-star hotels in Singapore, including Pan Pacific Singapore, Sofitel and JW Marriott.\xa0When asked why she chose to open a Japanese-inspired bakery, Shah said there weren’t any halal Japanese bakeries in Singapore, so she wanted to create something for the community.\xa0At present, the bakery is in the midst of attaining its halal certification.Pastries are baked fresh daily by Shah and her team who start their day at 5am. The menu is often refreshed and new bakes are introduced on a rotational basis, so follow the cafe’s Instagram page to get the latest updates on its special items.Regardless, the mainstays are enough to impress with both sweet and savoury options.\xa0One of the more unique classic pastries on its menu is the pain au suisse (S$6), a croissant with vanilla custard and chocolate chips folded within. Shah was inspired by famous French pastry chef Cedric Grolet’s pain suisse.\xa0Despite the simplicity of its ingredients, the pastry undergoes a complex baking process to achieve its iconic layered top.It is also quite a rare find in Singapore owing to the meticulous preparation needed — Gamo is the first halal bakery to serve the pain au suisse in Singapore.\xa0Other more traditional offerings include the French butter croissant (S$4) and the double chocolatine (S$5).\xa0Gamo also has two savoury pastries on its fixed menu: Chicken sausage croissant (S$7.50) and kani crab mentai croissant (S$8).\xa0The chicken sausage croissant is reminiscent of a takoyaki — sweet with a hint of salty umami from the bonito flakes. And fans of mentaiko should definitely try the kani crab mentai croissant.\xa0For sweets, Gamo serves an assortment of small, delicate-looking cakes and tarts in flavours such as matcha yuzu lychee and dark choc keki (S$11 each).\xa0However, the dessert that stood out the most was its strawberry guava mochi tart (S$12.50), comprising fresh strawberries, housemade milk mochi on strawberry guava curd.\xa0Within the tart is a strawberry caramel centre, which could be a tad sweet for some, but we found it well-balanced with the slight tanginess from the berries.\xa0Overall, it was a nice dessert that has subtle flavour and an interesting combination of textures — crunchiness from the base, chewiness from the mochi and softness from the curd.\xa0Those still looking to get their hands on the viral circular croissants can also make their way to Gamo.A post shared by HungryGoWhere (@hungrygowhere)Three flavours are available — goma, matcha white chocolate and kaya. They’re sold on weekends with only 30 pieces of every flavour each day, so be sure to head there early to get them.\xa0\xa0The team behind Gamo told HungryGoWhere that it plans to rotate the line-up with new flavours every two weeks.\xa0For now, the team is experimenting with strawberry shortcake and chocolate as potential options.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/acai-brothers/:['Come supper time, we Singaporeans often find ourselves faced with a dilemma – to eat or, for the sake of our diet, not to eat. It’s great news, then, that Acai Brothers is providing healthier late-night options to help us with this conundrum.\xa0Its smoothie bowls are made from the acai berry, which is known for being a superfood. It’s high in antioxidants and other nutrients, making it the perfect guilt-free snack to enjoy at any time of the day. If you’re wondering why the name Acai Brothers sounds so familiar, it is a popular chain in Australia known for its innovative menus and high-quality products. Founded by two friends, Ben Day and Sam Carson, the brand has expanded to more than 15 outlets across Australia since its inception in 2014. On Aug 20, it opened its first store in Singapore — in Kovan. This is Acai Brothers’ first international store, though it certainly wouldn’t be the last, as the team has said that they are looking to open more outlets around Singapore.Located along Upper Serangoon Road, the storefront dons a bold, minimalistic appearance different from the bright, cheerful tones typical of specialty acai stores. Aside from a concrete bench flushed against the wall, there aren’t any seating areas inside.However, its cool outward appearance is a stark contrast to the warmth of the service staff who amiably welcome you as you enter the store.\xa0The menu offers six specialty acai bowls to choose from. If none of the flavours appeals to you, you can even opt to build your own bowl (from S$7.50).\xa0Both options come in three sizes: Regular, large or share. The share bowl is something intriguing that acai lovers may want to check out, as it boasts close to a litre’s worth of acai.\xa0What we appreciated about its acai base was that it is blended with bananas, giving the base a very subtle sweetness that didn’t overwhelm. It maintained the texture of pure blended acai berries, which is similar to a sorbet – slightly gritty owing to the skin of the acai berries.\xa0What is more impressive is the base’s versatility. It can be blended with different ingredients to incorporate the flavour of the bowl within the acai base itself — something not many acai stores do.\xa0For Ain’t Nothin’ Butter (from S$11), the base was blended with cacao and peanut butter, which made it significantly creamier and added a tinge of nutty flavour to every bite.\xa0On the other hand, the base for Salted Caramel (from S$11) was blended only with vegan salted caramel protein, allowing it to retain a grainy texture while incorporating a burnt caramel flavour to the acai base.\xa0Despite its fairly hefty price tag, Acai Brothers is worth a try. Many of its toppings, such as its granola and protein powders, are made in-house with quality ingredients such as cacao powder and macadamia nuts. It also has interesting options such as coconut yoghurt, which you can’t typically find. Aside from acai bowls, Acai Brothers serves drinks on the menu. There are eight flavours for its smoothies (from S$7.50) and all of them are naturally sweetened with coconut nectar.\xa0For something more special, try the Berry Delicious (from S$8.50), which, true to its name, was quite tasty. It has a smooth velvety texture with a slightly sour note from the goji berries.A post shared by HungryGoWhere (@hungrygowhere)You should also try its coffees, made from its specialty Bro Blend. The beans are roasted in Australia and regularly shipped to Singapore to ensure freshness.\xa0Since coconut milk isn’t typically offered as a milk option, we recommend having the iced latte with coconut milk (S$6.50). It was smooth and refreshing, with a pleasant hint of sweetness from the coconut – great for Singapore’s warm weather.\xa0Acai Brothers is on the GrabFood delivery service.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/sol-ora-sentosa-mediterranean/:['If you’re looking to scratch that travel itch without breaking the bank this season, there’s a new restaurant that’s all about that chill Mediterranean vibe — Sol & Ora, which means “sun and shore”.\xa0It’s pretty literal in that sense — the restaurant is perched along the coast, with plenty of stunning sea views and natural light during the day.A post shared by HungryGoWhere (@hungrygowhere)If its name rings a bell, that’s because it rides on the popularity of its sister restaurant Sol & Luna, a Latin-European bistro that’s more centrally located in the heart of the CBD.\xa0In comparison, Sol & Ora is less about business lunches and more about leisurely brunches and ice-cold cocktails.You can even make a day of it: The restaurant is part of 1-Altitude Coast, a multi-concept beachfront establishment by 1-Group, which also has a rooftop bar and day club on its premises.\xa0The kitchen is headed up by Singaporean chef Felix Chong, who is no stranger to European cuisine. He’s been helming Italian fine-dining restaurant Monti at 1-Pavilion for the past two years.Food-wise, the restaurant prides itself on produce-driven cuisine from the Latin-Mediterranean regions of France, Greece, Italy, and Spain. Portions here are designed for sharing, so we advise bringing friends and your appetite!Start with a deliciously soft brioche roll (S$8) with French Provencal butter and black olive tapenade (spread), as well as an eclectic selection of mezze (S$22) from the region — Spanish padron peppers, Sicilian olives, Greek falafel, French feuille de brick (thin pastry) with whipped taramasalata and tzatziki dips.The flavours here are light and delicate, especially so in the saganaki cheese (S$23), a Greek pan-fried appetiser. Sol & Ora’s rendition is coated liberally in honey, and employs cheese made from goat’s milk instead of the usual sheep, making the dish milder but no less flavourful.\xa0Wash it down with a specialty Sol & Ora cocktail before moving on to the meat of the meal. There are four options, including a refreshing Summer Solstice (S$22), a gin-and-tonic concoction featuring rose syrup, lychee liqueur and ouzo (a Greek aperitif).We liked the cavatelli pasta (S$28), comprising chewy, longish pasta shells that are specially made in-house, alongside bits of squid and crabmeat.\xa0The porcetto (S$45, serves two) — a roasted suckling pig hailing from the Sardinian region of Italy — was another highlight. The pork is first brined, steamed and air-dried to retain its juicy meat, before being roasted at high heat to give it a crispy exterior. Pair each bite with its accompanying cinnamon-spiced apple and pear compote for added flavour.The meatless imam bayildi (S$18) — a scorched, braised and stuffed eggplant — was a personal favourite. Laced with tomatoes, coriander and cinnamon, the eggplant is finished in an oven and topped with crumbled feta cheese and rocket leaves.Weekend high tea menus (from S$28 per person, with a minimum of two diners) will be available from November, featuring sweets and savouries. Think cantaloupes wrapped in Parma ham, mushroom spinach quiches with truffle caviar, tartlets, cakes, and macarons.There’s a glimpse of some fireworks from Sentosa’s Wings of Time attraction around 8pm, so keep an eagle eye (and your cameras!) out.Book a ride to Sol & Ora.The Outpost Hotel, Level 7, 10 Artillery Avenue, Sentosa\nNearest Monorail Station: Imbiah\nOpen: Monday (7am to 10.30am), Tuesday to Friday (7am to 10.30am, 6pm to 10.30pm), Saturday and Sunday (7am to 10.30am, 11.30am to 2.30pm, 3pm to 4.30pm, 6pm to 10.30pm)The Outpost Hotel, Level 7, 10 Artillery Avenue, Sentosa\nNearest Monorail Station: Imbiah\nOpen: Monday (7am to 10.30am), Tuesday to Friday (7am to 10.30am, 6pm to 10.30pm), Saturday and Sunday (7am to 10.30am, 11.30am to 2.30pm, 3pm to 4.30pm, 6pm to 10.30pm)AuthorJia-En has worn several hats in her career — first writing TV scripts, then food and lifestyle stories at Wine & Dine.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/kissajin/:['The Les Amis Group launches a delightful new Japanese concept, Kissajin. The establishment will be offering a unique omakase experience at relatively affordable price points, starting from S$68 for lunch.\xa0Officially launched on Oct 10, Kissajin is one of the group’s 25 concepts.\xa0It draws on the spirit of “kissaten”, a typical Japanese tea and coffee house that provides its patrons with a quiet getaway space. Curiously, it doesn’t serve coffee, nor does it have extensive tea offerings.\xa0Instead, the restaurant offers traditional Japanese dishes presented in novel ways. The highlight would be trying the restaurant’s version of yoyo tsuri, a common festival game in Japan that mimics fishing.\xa0A large glass bowl filled with balloons floating in iced water is presented to the table and diners attempt to fish one out. Afterwards, you pop the balloon with a toothpick to reveal the glistening orb of goma or sesame tofu within.Kissajin is characterised by darker colour palettes and a medley of songs comprising 80s J-Pop hits, playing into its laidback atmosphere.\xa0While an omakase dining experience can often feel slightly intimidating due to its elegance, Kissajin creates a sense of comfort with its ample space and its use of natural materials in its interior.Still, it maintains a sense of class and elegance with the subtle, shimmery gold details on its walls.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50% off at picturesque date spots, including Wildseed Cafe at The Alkaff Mansion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHawker Hustlers: Hipster hawker Ray Yeo of Bei-Ing Dimsum Club on reinventing dim sum and his love for all things Japan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe menu is curated by head chef Ryo Yamaguchi and executive chef Makoto Saito.\xa0A seven-course lunch will set you back S$68, while an eight-course dinner would cost S$98 – a reasonable amount considering that the menu is refreshed quarterly so consumers get the freshest, in-season ingredients.\xa0However, if you are looking to be blown away by distinctive and sophisticated dishes that use unorthodox ingredients, you may want to pay its sister restaurant, Jinhonten, a visit instead.\xa0The most unconventional dish served was the goma tofu from playing the yoyo tsuri. The tofu is homemade and infused with a strong black sesame flavour.\xa0It’s similar to a burrata with a smooth exterior and firm, curd-like interior. When combined with the assorted seaweed and yuzu dressing it’s served with, you get a light but flavourful dish with soft and chewy textures.\xa0A post shared by HungryGoWhere (@hungrygowhere)The most unconventional dish served was the goma tofu from playing the yoyo tsuri.

This rendition is served with a small dollop of light and airy cream, with only a hint of sweetness.\xa0When eaten with the sweet azuki bean paste, seasonal fruits and brown sugar syrup, we got a refreshing dessert that was sweet with a tinge of acidity from the oranges.\xa0\xa0Book a ride to Kissajin.\xa0Shaw Centre, 01-11, 1 Scotts Road\nNearest MRT station: Orchard\xa0\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (12pm to 3pm, 6pm to 10.30pm)\xa0Shaw Centre, 01-11, 1 Scotts Road\nNearest MRT station: Orchard\xa0\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (12pm to 3pm, 6pm to 10.30pm)\xa0Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/shake-shack-candlenut-buah-keluak-burgers-curry-fries/:['Fast-food joint Shake Shack has launched its first-ever chef collaboration in Singapore, and with no less than Michelin-starred chef Malcolm Lee of Candlenut and Pangium.On Nov 5, diners can head to Shake Shack’s flagship Neil Road outlet for buah keluak burgers (S$12.90) and curry fries (S$5.90). These will be available from 11am until they’re fully sold out.HungryGoWhere got a sneak peek and taste test. Here’s what we found.It arrived in a little paper tray with Peranakan motifs — a nod to chef Lee — but was arranged a little “senget” (slanted) by Shake Shack standards.At first glance, the sunny-side-up layer steals the show. When you pick it up, the yolk oozes and mixes satisfyingly with the melted American cheese before being soaked up by the potato bun base.A post shared by HungryGoWhere (@hungrygowhere)Once you take a bite, however, the nuttiness of the buah keluak — pangium tree seed — paste and ikan bilis sambal melds with the Angus beef patty in an explosion of flavour and umami.\xa0It works well as a fusion burger, with elements of east and west — besides the starring ingredients, you’d also find diced pickles, cucumbers and sauce from Lee’s signature Chef’s Mum’s Chicken Curry.We did find that the buah keluak and sambal weren’t distributed evenly throughout the burger, so some bites were more tasty than others.The curry fries, tossed in Lee’s secret blend of curry powder and salt, draw inspiration from the same Chef’s Mum’s Chicken Curry dish. In comparison to the show-stealing burger, we found the fries rather lacklustre.According to Shake Shack, this collaboration was six months in the making, and the burger had its start as a staff-only meal made by the Candlenut kitchen.More chef tie-ups are in the works for the near future, the brand added.Shake Shack is available on the GrabFood delivery service.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/haidilao-high-tech-northshore-plaza-anniversary-dining-promos/:['Presenting Haidilao’s “smartest” restaurant so far, with spinning robot arms, RFID chips and servers on wheels.Opened in April, this is its 19th and latest outlet, and is situated in Punggol’s Northshore Plaza I.(Westies can keep a lookout for its next outlet, which is slated to open later in November at Jurong Point.)Frequent Haidilao-goers would know that the popular hotpot chain had previously incorporated some of these high-tech elements in other outlets. Take, for example, an automatic soup machine and roving robot waiters at its Marina Square store, which opened in 2019.\xa0The Northshore Plaza outlet brings together the best of these into what is billed as Haidilao’s first-ever smart restaurant.According to Haidilao, it wanted to minimise the possible transmission of germs and bacteria from food handling and human interaction.Enter the Intelligent Food Room, a specially designed cold room that keeps the food fresh and monitored at all times.Each plate is equipped with an RFID chip that helps staff monitor how long the food has been kept there for.Once the system has received your orders, robot arms whir into action, pulling plates of pork balls, tofu and other Haidilao staples from its shelves and arranging them neatly on a tray.A staff member double-checks the work done and adds the finishing touches, before handing it off to a roving robot waiter. Cutely adorned with a cat-like face, it carefully wheels your food around obstacles and people, all the way to your table.The best part? Diners can watch the robot arms in action from behind a glass pane, and see the roving servers on the dining floor as they munch on their meal.There’s also a multimedia light and projection show on one of the restaurant’s walls, if you’re looking for other types of mealtime entertainment.For those of us who love less oil, salt or sediments in their soup base, the automated soup machine, similar to the one in Marina Square, is able to calibrate your soups according to your exact preferences.A post shared by HungryGoWhere (@hungrygowhere)In addition to all the bells and whistles, Haidilao has rolled out special anniversary promotions to celebrate the milestone anniversary. Oct 31 marked its 10th year in Singapore, after its initial Clarke Quay launch in 2012.Here’s what you can expect at all outlets islandwide, for dine-in only while stocks last.Each week sees two exclusive Haidilao dishes priced attractively at S$10 per full portion, down from the usual price of S$28.Here’s the schedule:Nov 7 to 13: Iberico pork, Haidilao-flavoured beef\nNov 14 to 20: US beef, squid balls in ink sauce\nNov 21 to 27: Sliced fish, pork jowlHaidilao is on the GrabFood delivery service.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/yun-nans-stonepot-fish-yishun/:['Yun Nans Stonepot Fish opened in China to much fanfare (think four-hour-long queues) and now it’s here in Singapore!Opened by parent company Yun Nans, a casual restaurant chain known for its steamed pot chicken soup, the popular concept opened at Northpoint City in Yishun on Nov 5.The new concept involves pressure-steaming live fish in a handcrafted granite stone pot, which produces a pot of sweet, collagen-rich fish broth that’s bursting with flavour. Each granite stone pot comes from Yunnan, China, and is handmade exclusively for the restaurant.Step into Yun Nans Stonepot Fish and you’d be greeted by a feature wall housing aquariums from which you can view the live fish available for your meal. The fish are retrieved for preparation after each order.Yun Nans Stonepot Fish boasts a well-lit interior decked out in earthy hues, with furnishing that’s elegant, with touches of materials Yunnan is known for, such as terracotta and emerald marble headboards. There’s also an intriguing cloud light installation that changes hues with the time of the day.Each table features its own stone pot that’s powered using a centralised steaming system. The pots are brushed with a cleaning kit after every meal, and they’re also cleaned thoroughly with high steam before each meal.Choose from seabass (S$42.80++/pc), patin (S$5++/100g), or soon hock (S$8.80++/100g) for live fish options, or you can opt for chilled fresh seabass (S$28++/pc). The fish are sustainably sourced from local farms.If you went with live fish, the fish would be whisked from the aquarium, freshly culled, cleaned and brought over in a wok, together with fish liver and tofu. The ingredients are then placed into the stone pot.Soup is added next, which is a highlight in itself. You can go for the signature collagen fish soup (S$18++) that’s been simmered for six hours with dried scallops, salmon fishhead and bones, and old hen, before being pressure-steamed with ginseng, Solomon’s Seal (yu zhu), bursting tofu imported from Yunnan, red dates, and goji berries.Or opt for the wild mushroom soup (S$18++) comprising ingredients such as Yunnan’s Shangri-La Matsutake mushrooms, wild porcini, pork bones, old hen and Yunnan ham.A post shared by HungryGoWhere (@hungrygowhere)The pot is then covered with a handcrafted straw hat, which keeps the steam at a controlled 160°C. The steam valve gets turned up, and the fish and broth undergo smokeless, high-pressure steaming for four to six minutes.HungryGoWhere had the live soon hock with collagen fish soup, which was a perfectly cooked broth that’s smooth yet rich in flavour. The fresh fish was sweet, juicy and tender — every mouthful took us right back to the ocean.You are recommended to eat the fish before adding ingredients. This is so that you get to enjoy the fish at its best; further cooking would cause the already-tender pieces to disintegrate into the soup.After enjoying the fish, you can choose add-ons for your soup, such as the specialty seafood platter of scallops, prawns, crabsticks and sliced fish (S$32.80++ for small, S$58.80++ for large) or the assorted meat platter comprising various cuts of beef and pork (S$28.80++ for small, S$48.80++ for large).We recommend the mushroom platter (S$14.80++ for small, S$22.80++ for large), which had a standout ingredient, the golden fungus. Yun Nans partnered local farmers to harvest this rare ingredient that costs US$150/kg (or S$210/kg). And it was well worth the price. Crunchy with a jelly-like texture, it was an ingredient we’d definitely return for.If you’d like some dishes to complement your hotpot, try some of these new items exclusive to the Stonepot concept.The crispy barramundi collar (S$9.80++) was crispy and fragrant on the outside, with juicy, tender flesh on the inside. The grilled clams with spicy garlic sauce (S$12.90++), cooked in an aluminium foil box and grilled over charcoal fire, resulted in smoky, sweet and juicy clams. You can have it with the accompanying vermicelli or with fragrant scallion rice (S$3++).End the meal with sweet treats, such as the crispy rice cake with brown sugar (S$7.90++) that had just the right amount of caramelised sweetness.Besides these dishes, the outlet’s full offerings include favourites from Yun Nans, such as the lychee prawn balls (S$18.80++) and traditional baked rose pastry (S$6.90++ for four).We thoroughly enjoyed the rose pastry, which had a buttery texture with a fragrant rose-paste filling.Yun Nans Stonepot Fish is having a grand opening promotion. It’s offering 50 per cent off its stonepot fish selection from Nov 8 to 10.\xa0Yun Nans is on GrabFood.

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/one-punggol-hawker-centre/:['North-easties are evidently excited about the opening of One Punggol Hawker Centre on Oct 31. With 34 stalls and more than 700 seats, it’s the new go-to food haven for hungry residents.Hours past lunch at noon, the place was still packed with people. It isn’t hard to see why, given that popular stalls such as Kwang Kee Teochew Fish Porridge and Eng Kee Chicken Wings have found a home there.Braving the crowds, HungryGoWhere rounds up five stalls that are a hit in our books at the new hawker centre.\xa0One Punggol Hawker Centre, 02-14, 1 Punggol Drive\nOpen: Thursday to Tuesday (7.30am to 9pm, or until sold out)Botak Cantonese Porridge is a family-owned business that started selling Cantonese-style porridge at Our Tampines Hub. The stall at One Punggol Hawker Centre is its second outlet.Most known for its handmade meatballs that are freshly kneaded and shaped every morning, you’ll have to head down early in order to snag a bowl of the popular handmade meatball porridge (S$3.50).What sets it apart from other porridge stalls is its effective use of ginger — the subtle tang in the porridge wasn’t overpowering, incorporating a refreshing sweetness to the dish.What to order: Handmade meatball porridge (S$3.50), sliced fish porridge (S$5.30), minced pork century egg porridge (S$4)\xa0One Punggol Hawker Centre, 02-01, 1 Punggol Drive\nOpen: Daily (9am to 9pm)With multiple outlets across the island, most Singaporeans wouldn’t be strangers to Uncle Penyet. It was a pleasant surprise that despite the numerous outlets opened, Uncle Penyet maintained its high calibre at its newest stall.While the signature smashed fried chicken (S$6.50) is on the pricier side, it’s well worth the money. The chicken thigh is huge with a crunchy exterior.Fans of spice shouldn’t skip on the chilli — it was sharp with a slight tang, building a complex flavour when paired with the rest of the ingredients in the dish.What to order: Smashed fried chicken (S$6.50), ayam panggang set (S$6.50), ayam kukus with brown rice set (S$5.90)A post shared by HungryGoWhere (@hungrygowhere)One Punggol Hawker Centre, 02-13, 1 Punggol Drive\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (11am to 8pm)It isn’t easy to find tangyuan, a chewy glutinous rice ball stuffed with filling, in Singapore. Perhaps that is why there was a snaking queue at the hawker centre just to get a piping-hot bowl from 75 Ah Balling Peanut Soup. It’s the fourth outlet opened by the popular brand, which started its first stall at Golden Mile Food Centre.Soup bases available at the stall include peanut, almond milk, ginger and longan red date. You can opt for four to six glutinous rice balls (S$2.40 for four pieces, S$2.80 for five, and S$3.20 for six) in the soup.While yam and matcha glutinous rice balls are the more novel flavours, we highly recommend the original three: Peanut, sesame and red bean.What to order: Peanut soup with sesame, peanut and red bean glutinous rice balls (from S$2.40)\xa0\xa0One Punggol Hawker Centre, 02-18, 1 Punggol Drive\nOpen: Daily (11.30am to 8pm, or until sold out)Fei Zhuang Herbal Bak Kut Teh is one of the more underrated gems at One Punggol Hawker Centre.The robust herbal taste was prominent in the pork ribs herbal bak kut teh (S$6), giving it a deep and earthy flavour that’s especially soothing on an overcast day. While the pork ribs weren’t melt-in-your-mouth soft, it had decent chew and slid off the bone easily.We’d give the youtiao (S$1.50) — a long strip of deep-fried dough — a miss, though. It’s relatively expensive and tough.What to order: Pork ribs herbal bak kut teh (S$6), premium loin ribs herbal bak kut teh (S$9)\xa0\xa0One Punggol Hawker Centre, 02-20, 1 Punggol Drive\nOpen: Daily (7am until sold out)This stall means business. Its signboard simply features Chinese characters “\u200b\u200b水粿”, which is the name of the only dish the stall is selling — chwee kueh (S$2 for four pieces, S$3 for six and S$4 for eight).The kueh served here was delightfully warm, soft and fluffy. While the preserved radish wasn’t overly salty, it could have been served warmer as the temperature difference between the two components was slightly jarring.What to order: Chwee kueh (S$2 for four pieces, S$3 for six and S$4 for eight)\xa075 Ah Balling Peanut Soup, Uncle Penyet and Botak Cantonese Porridge are available on the GrabFood delivery service.

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/cny-steamboat-ingredients/:['With reunion dinner just around the corner, it is no doubt that the topic of choosing the right steamboat ingredients will arise. Everyone has their personal favourites; some prefer more meat than vegetables, while others would rather boil their own broth.\xa0What is undisputed is the sumptuous spread of ingredients across the table every year — guaranteed to send you into a delightful food coma.Here are the top five must-have ingredients HungryGoWhere recommends to add a little flavour to your not-so-usual steamboat reunion dinner this year, while also snagging some attractive Chinese New Year (CNY) promotions.\xa0Nothing can go wrong, in our opinion, when it comes to the humble cheese tofu. The succulent fish paste mixed with buttery cheese bits makes it a highly popular steamboat ingredient. It has a very soft and chewy texture that melts in your mouth (just be careful not to bite it whole immediately after taking it out from the soup, as it is really hot).Preparation: To ensure it’s cooked, let it simmer for at least three minutes until the cheese tofu floats to the surface. Add a little chilli to it to make the perfect combination.Cheese tofu is available at almost every supermarket, and FairPrice is having a limited offer of two packets of Peng Wang cheese tofu for S$3.85. You can even get an offset of 1% off GST, until 1st July 2023.\xa0Introducing the crowd-favourite steamboat ingredient that is available at many notable hotpot restaurants such as Paradise Hotpot, Hai Di Lao and Beauty in a Pot. A staple for those who love their fishballs stuffed, this ingredient is a must-have to bring some sweetness into the meal.\xa0Although it looks very plain on the outside, a bite into this savoury snack sends the delicious fish roe flowing out. Its sweetness is paired with the chewy texture of the fishball, leaving you asking for more.Preparation: Add the fishball with fish roe into the steamboat broth when it’s boiling and leave it in for at least three minutes. If it’s frozen, you might consider leaving it in the broth for an extra five minutes.You can find fishballs with fish roe at FairPrice under its own household brand at S$8.58 (a pack has approximately 20 servings). It is also trans fat free and free of artificial preservatives and colourings.\xa0The beancurd skin roll, or more colloquially referred to as the ring roll, is a crowd favourite, especially among the younger generation. With a crispy texture that softens slightly when dipped in the steamboat broth, it is great for pairing with other ingredients or enjoyed as a crunchy snack on its own.As it absorbs whatever soup broth it is dipped in, we suggest dipping it in more flavourful broths, such as tom yum or mala for a satisfying kick. What’s more, pair it with mushrooms or noodles for that added flavour burst. The ring roll is also vegetarian-friendly, so it’s a staple that can be enjoyed by all.\xa0Preparation: No rinsing is required. Simply dip it into hot soup for three seconds and it is ready to eat. Leaving it longer in the soup will cause it to become soggy, although some may prefer that — so the choice is yours!Everbest serves high quality ring rolls at affordable prices of less than S$5 per packet, available at FairPrice, Cold Storage and even GrabMart.\xa0No steamboat is complete without the addition of mushrooms, especially enoki mushrooms. These long and thin mushrooms add a chewy and crunchy texture to dishes, elevating the steamboat experience.Fun fact: Enoki mushrooms are commonly known in China as “see-you-tomorrow-mushrooms”, as they are not easily digested in the stomach and tend to come out of the digestive process whole.Regardless, enoki mushrooms are highly nutritious and pack a good amount of fibre and antioxidants into each serving, so don’t give them a miss! They are best paired with noodles or rice and other flavourful sauces.\xa0Preparation: It would be good to trim the ends of the enoki mushroom and tear them apart to smaller chunks before placing them into the soup. Give them a gentle rinse after trimming to remove any soil or dirt. To maintain optimum quality, any excess should be chilled and stored in the fridge.You can get enoki mushrooms from all major supermarkets, but Meadows has really affordable Taiwan enoki mushrooms that are S$1.10 for 200g. These are available at Cold Storage.\xa0\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15 best fish head curry in Singapore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15 places to get the best fishball noodles in Singapore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xa0If you’re looking for a flavourful and rich soup broth for your steamboat, the 1chi-yo collagen broth is the soup for you.Made from premium ingredients, and carefully simmered for eight hours to allow the flavour and nutrients of the broth to surface, this collagen broth has no MSG, preservatives and artificial flavourings or colourings. Guaranteed to add a rich flavour to any steamboat meal.\xa0Preparation: Remove from the freezer and thaw. Once done, pour it into the pot, add water to the broth, and bring it to a boil. Stir to ensure that the broth develops a milky colour and a thick viscous soup base. Once that’s done, you can begin adding all the steamboat ingredients for cooking.The 1chi-yo superior pork or chicken collagen broth can be found at FairPrice (S$13.20 for a twin pack of 250g) and other supermarkets, and can be kept in the freezer for longer shelf life.\xa0Now that you have all the must-have ingredients to have the perfect steamboat experience, try it out yourself. You might be amazed at how fun prepping for it can be.\xa0All ingredients mentioned above are also available on the GrabMart delivery service. You can also book a ride to get your groceries.For other recommendations this Chinese New Year, check out our reunion-dinner guide, CNY snacks guide, and Ikea Singapore’s rabbit buns.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

Thank you for your continuous support. Come down to get your nudedles before Pasta La Vista!”When HungryGoWhere contacted owner Clarence Chooi, 28, on Monday, he declined further comment, saying that he was busy preparing for the closure.\xa0Chooi interned and worked at Michelin-starred and fine-dining restaurants before starting Nudedles.4 in December 2021.\xa0Nudedles.4 went viral last year for its month-long tie-up with Mirko Febbrile, an Italian chef who worked for the Michelin-starred eatery Braci.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/dignity-kitchen-food-court-boon-keng/:['It’s lunchtime, and the food court at 69 Boon Keng Road is a hive of activity.\xa0The queue stretches to the main door and beyond, with office folks and workers from the nearby industrial district waiting patiently in line.At first blush, it looks like any kopitiam. There are the usual suspects: Chicken rice, nasi lemak and laksa.\xa0\xa0Oh, claypot rice… and is that the smell of freshly baked muffins?If you’d missed the prominent mural at the entrance, this is Project Dignity, the world’s first training centre for hawkers.“You’ll see schools for formal culinary education and fine dining, but none for hawkers,” says Koh Seng Choon, executive director of the social enterprise.\xa0It seems only fitting, then, that the home of hawker culture — now inscribed on Unesco’s Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity — has codified this into a curriculum.\xa0Those who train here learn the ins and outs of running a hawker business. This entails not just cooking from recipes, but runs the gamut from the intricacies of taste, flavour and mouthfeel to dealing with customers.What makes this place stand out all the more: It also caters to those who are differently abled. Dignity Kitchen — Project Dignity’s food court arm and Asia’s first community food court managed by people with disabilities — offers work opportunities to more than 100 workers, of whom 85 to 90 per cent are differently abled.If there’s one thing that’s clear during our visit, it’s that not all disabilities are visible.Uncle Peter, who works at the drinks stall, signs cheekily at us with a big grin — visible even through his face mask.\xa0The hearing-impaired 65-year-old brews a mean cuppa. As he stirs, spoons and pours, he walks us through some basic signs with a smile.He’s paired with an able-bodied worker who helps him when the situation calls for it — typically signing him drink orders from customers who aren’t familiar with sign language.The social enterprise welcomes all who are differently abled and disadvantaged, including the disenfranchised.Koh says: “It can be physical, like the loss of a limb in an accident. It can be mental (such as) depression and bipolar disorders. There’s a social element, too — single mothers, abuse cases — and, lastly, the intellectual aspect — those with IQ 70 and below.”The idea is to skill people who need help, so they can get jobs elsewhere.Besides breaking down the nuts and bolts of running a hawker business, Project Dignity takes it a step further by simplifying the process with technology, where possible.At the claypot stall, for instance, the ingredients are prepared beforehand. The assigned worker puts the necessary components into a pot, places it on the stove, and waits for the timer to go off before serving a piping-hot claypot meal.\xa0Instead of a traditional claypot stove, the system relies on electricity with no open fires, thus improving workplace safety and reducing ambiguity.\xa0The latter is especially important, says Project Dignity. Some workers on the autism spectrum are most comfortable with a strict set of steps and do not deal well with deviations.This system also allows an amputee worker to man the stall solo.Creating a hospitable work environment is also key, Project Dignity adds. The intention is to reduce stress for the workers, where possible, as well.Stoves and other similar equipment tailored to the differently abled are a challenge to obtain, and Project Dignity relies heavily on donations and sponsorships from external parties to make this possible.Besides claypot rice (S$6), Project Dignity’s signatures include kolo mee (S$5), laksa (S$4.50), nasi lemak (from S$4.50) and chicken rice (S$4).Dignity Kitchen’s low prices and hearty food seem to have its customers returning for more.Many of the diners are regulars — workers and office folks from nearby industrial districts or those who live in public housing blocks in the vicinity.You’ll also find the mouthwatering smell of vanilla and butter wafting through the air. Muffins, cakes and even seasonal specials such as stollen and log cake are churned out of its oven throughout the day.The food court is also halal-certified, and sees healthy demand from corporations for its bakes and takeaway items, especially during Christmas and Chinese New Year.Like any F&B business out there, even a social enterprise like Project Dignity has its grouses and unhappy diners to deal with.\xa0Cheryl Loh, events and social media assistant for Project Dignity, says: “Most customers are patient, but sometimes, we get angry customers who aren’t aware that the workers are differently abled.” Project Dignity’s main objective is its train-and-place programme, so that its trainees can support themselves in the long run.Says Koh: “After skilling them, we must get them jobs. Some of them work here; some in cafes, hotels. If we cannot get them jobs elsewhere, we create jobs for them here.”\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Junction Westgate opening with promos; will house 23 tenants, including new halal teppanyaki\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHawker Hustlers: Hipster hawker Ray Yeo of Bei-Ing Dimsum Club on reinventing dim sum and his love for all things Japan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is also where the other projects under the Dignity umbrella come in. Apart from Dignity Kitchen, there are others including Dignity Wheel — where wheelchair users do short-distance food delivery — and Dignity Craft, a group of enterprising ladies who knit caps for cancer patients.\xa0There is even Dignity Avatar, which trains workers with physical disabilities to operate robots remotely. These robots are deployed to hospitals here and in Hong Kong to ease the workload on healthcare workers.Just a stone’s throw from the main dining area is Dignity Farm, a hydroponic urban farm that grows a multitude of leafy greens.Adriel Yeo, 24, is one of the folks manning it.He has had some experience in growing plants of his own, but still finds certain ones, such as fennel, a challenge to grow.\xa0As is keeping the irrigation system mosquito-free — a task that sees him meticulously monitoring the flowing water with a fine fish net, in search of potential larvae.Some of the crops, such as spring onion and rosemary, are used in the kitchen, and occasionally, in the training courses that Project Dignity runs.Yeo, one of the longest-serving folks on the farm, has been with the social enterprise for slightly over a year. He also works on human resources and accounting tasks in the small office above the farm.Round the back of the compound is a hot kitchen, much like what you’d see in any bustling restaurant.This is where the social enterprise cooks up food in big quantities, mostly for its catering arm, which turns out an average of 300 bentos daily.To mitigate the usual dangers of a working kitchen, those assigned to work here are higher-functioning and guided by experienced culinary professionals.Housemade rempah and rendang are also made in large quantities here — from scratch — and used in Dignity Kitchen’s hawker dishes.For Koh, the brains and heart behind the operation, charity work has been a big part of his life for the past two decades. Earlier this year, he was named a Champion of Change by the World’s 50 Best Restaurants.It’s been quite the journey — the operation was bleeding money in its initial years before breaking even in 2016.\xa0Since then, the profits have been put back into its people. Trainees are paid a wage of S$6 an hour, and the organisation gives a free hot dinner to almost 100 of the working poor every night.A lot of the funds also go towards Project Dignity’s Hong Kong outpost, which employs more than 50 workers.What’s next for Koh? An outpost in London for war veterans and refugees. And, beyond that, for Project Dignity to become a publicly listed company.\xa0Book a ride to Project Dignity.69 Boon Keng Road\nNearest MRT station: Boon Keng\nOpens: Mondays to Fridays (8.30am to 4pm), Saturdays and Sundays (8.30am to 2pm)69 Boon Keng Road\nNearest MRT station: Boon Keng\nOpens: Mondays to Fridays (8.30am to 4pm), Saturdays and Sundays (8.30am to 2pm)AuthorJia-En has worn several hats in her career — first writing TV scripts, then food and lifestyle stories at Wine & Dine.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/shaker-lakers-to-close/:['Popular fusion-style hawker stall Shaker Lakers will close early next year, it announced in a Facebook post last Saturday (Dec 3). Its last day of operations is Feb 25, 2023.“We are sorry about the closure for the last (two) weeks as we are taking this time to re-evaluate the business operation,” the brand said in the post.“With a heavy heart, we have decided to cease operations.”Located at Yishun Park Hawker Centre, Shaker Lakers opened on Aug 9, 2019. Launched by Irish chef Michael Quinn and Singaporean Gillian Pua, it is known for its unique creations that fuse Eastern and Western flavours. Think Western fare with local influences, such as sambal prawn linguine.Shaker Lakers also gained popularity for making its ingredients from scratch, such as its fresh handmade beef patties and hand-cut potato wedges that are cooked to order.Quinn is the head chef for the brand. The duo met while working at Swiss farm-to-table restaurant, Marche Singapore, and decided to open a hawker stall together.When asked about Shaker Lakers’ two-week closure since end-November, Pua told HungryGoWhere that the team took the time to explore other options for the business moving forward, such as direct bidding from the National Environment Agency (NEA) or renting a virtual kitchen.However, Pua said that they ultimately decided to close because of the huge rise in food costs. She added that prices for ingredients at the stall have increased, with some rising 50 per cent while others rose by a whopping 200 per cent.“Almost on a weekly basis, we received notifications from various vendors on price hikes. This has become very unmanageable,” Pua added.\xa0The stall will reopen on Dec 7 and run until its closure date.To cope with the price hikes, Pua said the stall has increased the prices for some of its menu items. For example, its well-loved Lakers Texan Beef Burger is now priced at S$10.90, up from S$9.90 previously.Shaker Lakers also recently imposed an extra 50-cent charge when guests swap their fries for salad.\xa0\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Junction Westgate opening with promos; will house 23 tenants, including new halal teppanyaki\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHawker Hustlers: Hipster hawker Ray Yeo of Bei-Ing Dimsum Club on reinventing dim sum and his love for all things Japan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo remain competitive, not everything on the menu saw a price increase, though. Selected items, such as its pasta menu, were spared. For instance, prices for its carbonara pasta and beef bolognese pasta have remained unchanged, at S$7.50 each.Pua said: “The current pricing is what the customer can accept. We can’t increase any further. If we increase the prices further, we will end up losing our customers.”There are no plans for Shaker Lakers to relocate or reopen in the near future. Co-founders Pua and Quinn have decided to spend more time with their respective families after the closure.That said, Pua acknowledged that the team would miss their supportive customers over the years once the shutters fall for the last time next year.“We would like to thank all our customers for their never-ending support. We are leaving with a heavy heart, but nonetheless, their support has kept us going during the trying times over the last three years,” said Pua.Shaker Lakers is on the GrabFood delivery service.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/pasar-216-bedok-central-opens/:['After a three-month closure for repair and redecoration (R&R) works, Blk 216 Bedok Food Centre and Market has finally reopened on Friday (Nov 25).The hawker centre, also known as Pasar 216 Bedok Central, was closed from Sept 1 to Nov 24 for R&R works conducted by the East Coast Town Council.\xa0Housing 82 food stalls and 264 tables, the hawker centre has long been seen as an underrated foodie spot filled with hidden gems. There are plenty of delicious options for hungry foodies — if you’re willing to make the trek to this largely residential area.HungryGoWhere understands that several of its original stalls, many of them well-known, are still operating there.Make a beeline for Prawn & Mee, one of the more popular stalls there. Originally known as Plum & Rice, it rebranded in 2019 to sell prawn noodles. The menu is simple — you can have prawn noodles, dry or with soup, with just prawns or with the addition of pork ribs.Known for having a dense, well-seasoned broth and fresh plump prawns, this dish is an explosion of umami flavours. Do note that it will open only on Dec 3. When HungryGoWhere visited the stall on Friday, there was a notice informing patrons that it will be closed till Dec 3 due to “duties to the nation”.Craving Ipoh hor fun? You can get the dish at Ah Li Ipoh Hor Fun Fish Dumpling. Unlike the usual thick gravy you find in most hor fun (flat rice noodles) servings, the stall’s version is lighter, with a clearer-than-usual broth. The hor fun (S$4) is laden with vegetables, shredded meat and mushrooms, which went well with the smooth hor fun noodles.We recommend ordering a side of the stall’s popular fried dumplings, which come with either fish or prawn meat. The fillings are generous and the crisp texture of the dumplings completes your meal.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Junction Westgate opening with promos; will house 23 tenants, including new halal teppanyaki\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHawker Hustlers: Hipster hawker Ray Yeo of Bei-Ing Dimsum Club on reinventing dim sum and his love for all things Japan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are looking for light bites or takeaway food, well-loved stall Yummy is the perfect place to visit. It’s known for its handmade and slippery-smooth chee cheong fun (rice noodle roll, from S$2.70 for a set) that is topped with a thick sweet-and-spicy sauce, sesame seeds and a crispy fried beancurd skin for added texture. You can also add other items, such as salted egg bak chang (rice dumpling) and yam cake for a more substantial meal.And it’s good news for fans of Sin Ho! The beloved stall, which sells fish soup in the day and Cantonese-style zi char (wok-fried dishes) in the evening, is also back. Its menu features favourites such as crayfish seafood soup, sambal lala and the super popular har cheong gai (prawn paste chicken), which we’ve heard can sell out quite quickly!\xa0As part of the R&R works, the Blk 216 Bedok Food Centre and Market underwent general repainting, replacement of anti-slip floor tiles and upgrading of the toilets.

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/fernvale-hawker-centre-and-market/:['What makes the two-month-old Fernvale Hawker Centre and Market special, so much so that popular hawker stalls have flocked to set up shop there?\xa0The hawker centre, which opened on Sept 25, is located within the Fernvale Community Centre, on its third floor. It’s spacious, clean and modern, with large ceiling fans providing ventilation to the space.\xa0Big names have made the hawker centre their home. These include stalls such as Hock Hai (Hong Lim) Curry Chicken Noodle, Seng Hiang Bak Chor Mee, Whitley Road Big Prawn Noodle.\xa0But the best part about dining at hawker centres is finding hidden gems. After some trial and error, we’ve rounded up some of our favourites.\xa0Fernvale Community Club, 03-26, 21 Sengkang West Avenue\nOpen: Daily (10.30am to 8.30pm) Ah Er Soup didn’t receive its Michelin Bib Gourmand status for nothing. It is known for serving comforting traditional soups with premium ingredients that are affordably priced, with nothing above S$9.\xa0There are 10 types of soup available on the menu. Each is cooked over long hours under carefully controlled temperatures so the robust flavours from the ingredients can be extracted.\xa0It’s difficult to say which of the 10 soups is the most popular.\xa0The mini Buddha Jumps Over the Wall (S$9), a soup dish regarded as a luxurious Chinese delicacy, is packed with premium ingredients such as scallops and abalone in a shark bone broth.\xa0On the other hand, there are also simpler options, such as the lotus root peanut pork ribs soup (S$5.80), which are not short on flavour and quality. When paired with a bowl of pumpkin rice (S$1.20), these soups make a nourishing and comforting meal.\xa0What to order: Lotus root peanut pork ribs soup (S$5.80), ten tonic ginseng chicken soup (S$6.80), and watercress pork ribs soup (S$5.50)\xa0\xa0\xa0Fernvale Community Club, 03-19, 21 Sengkang West Avenue\nOpen: Daily (7.30am to 9pm)Previously located on Elias Road, Mohamed Danish Prata Paradise was a well-kept secret by those living in Pasir Ris.\xa0HungryGoWhere opted for the classic, foolproof order – one egg (S$1.80) and one plain prata (S$1.10). Both had great texture and leaned more towards the old-school style of prata – fluffy with a light and crisp exterior.\xa0Of course, that’s only half the battle won, since prata and curry go hand in hand. The stall served dalcha curry, a lentil-based stew, with our prata. It was thick, not too spicy and had bits of vegetables inside, pairing nicely with the prata.\xa0The stall also serves rojak, a salad dish. It is prepared Indian-style and served with a sweet chilli sauce. The ingredients are mostly deep-fried, including options such as fishcake, fritters and potatoes (from 90 cents each).\xa0What to order: Plain prata (S$1.10), egg prata (S$1.80), rojak with flour items such as potato and fishcake (from 90 cents each)\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Junction Westgate opening with promos; will house 23 tenants, including new halal teppanyaki\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHawker Hustlers: Hipster hawker Ray Yeo of Bei-Ing Dimsum Club on reinventing dim sum and his love for all things Japan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFernvale Community Club, 03-03, 21 Sengkang West Avenue\nOpen: Daily (7am to 5pm)Located right beside the popular Munchi Pancakes, some may not even give D’Junction Bakery a second glance. However, the bakery sells quite a wide variety of breads that are perfect for breakfast or a snack.\xa0Opt for its signature egg tart (S$2.20) if you want to try something new. It’s similar to a Portuguese-style egg tart, but bigger and with a flakier base. The egg pudding was thick and creamy, making it a substantial snack.\xa0The bakery also sells classics such as hot dog bun and ham and cheese bun (S$1.30 each).\xa0What to order: Signature egg tart (S$2.20)\xa0Fernvale Community Club, 03-22, 21 Sengkang West Avenue\nOpen: Daily (11am to 2.30pm, 5pm to 8.30pm)Jin Kimchi Express sells authentic Korean food at hawker-centre prices.

Its dishes either use or are served with its housemade Jin “original flavour” kimchi.\xa0If you’d like a discount K-BBQ experience or simply have a craving for pork belly, you could get its KBBQ platter (from S$32) from its butchery located nearby and top up a small fee (from S$4) to have the meat cooked for you.\xa0Fernvale Hawker Centre houses the establishment’s first flagship stall. Aside from the express stall and its butchery, you’ll also find a minimart where you can shop for items such as its homemade kimchi and halal ramyeon, a Korean-style instant noodle dish.\xa0What to order: Galbi pork belly grilled meat set (from S$7.60), mul naengmyeon (from S$8.80), kimchi pancake (S$6)Fernvale Community Club, 03-02, 21 Sengkang West Avenue\nOpen: Daily (6.30am to 5pm)\xa0Run by a young sibling duo, Yi Qi Fa Economic Bee Hoon and Nasi Lemak opened in 2019 at a hawker centre in Pasir Ris. Its name, Yi Qi Fa, can be translated to “prosper together” in English.\xa0The stall has fried noodles (S$1.20), fried kway teow (flat rice noodles, S$1.20), fried bee hoon (rice vermicelli, S$1.20) and white bee hoon (S$1.70) available as the noodle base.The white bee hoon is Yi Qi Fa’s signature dish.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/40-million-coffee-shop-chang-cheng-mee-wah-yishun/:['The coffee shop at Block 848 Yishun Street 81 — which grabbed headlines after it was sold for an eye-watering S$40 million — has opened for business.The coffee shop run by Chang Cheng Mee Wah houses 22 stalls that will leave patrons spoilt for choice.It features a renovated shopfront that’s clean, well-lit, and fuses the contemporary with the old-school — with the original outdoor seating refurbished, in a nod to the original KPT Kopitiam that occupied the space.A nice modern touch is the addition of Wi-Fi, which is available for patrons of the coffee shop.The line-up of food stalls has also been refreshed.On top of Chang Cheng’s cai png and drinks stalls, branches of famous eateries have set up shop here.These include Tai Wah Pork Noodle, which serves Michelin Bib Gourmand-worthy bak chor mee; popular popiah business Ann Chin Popiah, which also serves kueh pie tee and old-school waffles; and Waker Chicken, which dishes up Korean fried chicken.Returning stalls from the old kopitiam include Hup Kee Braised Duck, which specialises in braised duck and kway chap; Chong Pang Huat, which serves satay and BBQ chicken wings; and LA BBQ Seafood.Also returning are Han N Han Peanut Pancake as well as Black & White Rojak, which serves Chinese-style rojak.There are options for diners with various dietary needs, too.Muslim diners can patronise stalls such as Al Hajar Indian Muslim Food, while vegetarian patrons can give Fu Kang Vegetarian’s Chinese vegetarian dishes a go.HungryGoWhere stopped by to explore the food options and shed light on what’s likely on the minds of customers: Is the food worth a trip there?We tried the signature Tai Wah pork noodles (S$9) from Tai Wah and duck porridge (S$4.80) from Hup Kee.Tai Wah’s signature pork noodles had a generous amount of ingredients, with mounds of minced and lean meat, pig liver, fried sole fish, and lard heaped on the noodles. In the soup were dumplings, seaweed and meatballs, a different treatment from the regular pork noodles (S$5 or S$7), where the meatballs and dumplings are served with the noodles.The noodles had a pleasant springiness and bite, and the vinegar-based noodle sauce made every mouthful of noodles and tender, juicy meat umami-laden and toothsome. Remember to stir thoroughly for a consistent mix.Hup Kee’s duck porridge had a good serving of tender, flavourful duck slices, and a sweet-and-savoury sauce that complemented the humble yet smooth porridge. We relished the umami and flavour that burst forth from the fried shallots, diced celery and braised peanuts, making for varying tastes with each mouthful.The new coffee shop is having a grand opening promotion for a limited time, and diners heading there to capitalise on the discounts might just discover their new favourite late-night haunt in the north (our writer is converted).Here’s a list of stalls at the coffee shop:\xa0Multiple stalls at the coffee shop are on the GrabFood delivery service.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/sonder-joe-leong/:['Chef Joe Leong, 29, has food in his blood. Metaphorically speaking, of course.Son to celebrity chefs Sam and Forest Leong, he’s been in and out of kitchens since childhood.And he’s worked under the tutelage of celebrated chefs at establishments such as 2amDessertbar, Tippling Club and V-Zug.Now, he has set up his first independent venture — a semi-fine-dining restaurant named Sonder just off Jalan Bukit Merah. Tucked away amid warehouses and industrial offices, the restaurant is a short distance from the main road and 2280Burger.Billed as a two-in-one bakery-bistro by day and Euro-Asian restaurant by night, Sonder prides itself on familiar flavours done differently.The name means “special” in German, and rightly so — the menu is full of classic hawker fare that we all know and love, but with special, decadent European-inspired twists.From 12pm to 5pm, sweets, cakes and bakes (from S$2.50) fresh out of Sonder’s oven are on display, ready for takeaways and dine-in. Think kouign-amann, fresh fruit tarts\xa0and even whole cakes — with a four-day pre-order, that is.Two- and three-course set lunches are also available (from S$30), featuring specialty dishes such as beef pastrami sourdough (S$20), winged bean pomelo salad (S$15), and whole pork knuckle by Grandpa Prin (S$45).Freshly baked breads and slabs of house-made butter in three varieties — sea salt, kombu and black garlic — are included in each set, as well as the option of coffee or tea.After 6pm, prix-fixe menus — which are likely to change every few months — lead the charge.At Sonder, prawn mee manifests as a carb-free dish comprising king tiger prawns, lobster bisque espuma and linguine made from scallops, and chicken rice as a risotto with spring onion pesto and chicken roulade.In particular, the risotto comes with all the necessary components for a good chicken rice dish — gingery rice, sweet black sauce and chilli. According to Leong, he employs the same chilli recipe used by his grandmother, who ran a chicken rice stall in the old Margaret Drive Hawker Centre.In a nod to his Thai heritage, Leong also serves up moo ping (grilled pork skewers), in the form of a Kurobuta pork collar, marinated for 24 hours and finished in a subtle coconut glaze.\xa0I personally enjoyed his rendition of the traditional Thai red curry, presented here as Aubergine, a deceptively simple Japanese eggplant starter halved lengthwise across the plate.Dig your spoon into the flutter of blue pea flowers, pickled pearl onions and housemade potato chips to get to the quenelle of creamy curry sorbet artfully concealed underneath.Steamed fish, a mainstay in Thai-Chinese cuisine, is reimagined as Barramundi, steamed and fried, in a moat of garlic lime jus.Finish the meal with a Red Ruby, or the Apple Crumble, a tempting, glossy apple that alludes to the Original Sin. (As does a mural of Adam and Eve on the walls of the restaurant.)Price-wise, the three-course Petit menu starts at S$88, while the six-course Classic and eight-course Gourmand menus run up to S$138 and S$188 respectively.Book a ride to Sonder.217 Henderson Road, 01-03\nNearest MRT station: Redhill\nOpen: Tuesday to Saturday (12pm to 5pm, 6pm to 10pm)217 Henderson Road, 01-03\nNearest MRT station: Redhill\nOpen: Tuesday to Saturday (12pm to 5pm, 6pm to 10pm)AuthorJia-En has worn several hats in her career — first writing TV scripts, then food and lifestyle stories at Wine & Dine.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/58-minced-meat-mee-closure/:['Best known for its steaming broth and piquant minced meat dumplings, 58 Minced Meat Mee in Bedok is widely recognised as one of the best in the business.On Sept 6, however, it was announced on social media that the stall would be closing for good on Sept 30.It came as a surprise to many, as it continues to be well-loved and frequented by hawker-goers and foodies alike.Since then, the queue has only grown even longer. According to reports on social media, the wait ranged from 40 minutes to more than two hours in the days after the initial announcement.When HungryGoWhere made a trek to the stall, the line had snaked across the corridor, around a corner and well out of sight of the stall itself.Speaking to customers waiting in line, I was told by many that the bak chor mee here was a must-try and would be sorely missed.\xa0In particular, a bowl of 58 Minced Meat Mee has been a weekly ritual for Karl Wong, who has been frequenting the eatery since he was eight or nine.The 37-year-old, who works in the marine electronics industry, had returned to have it for the last time.According to him, 58 Minced Meat Mee’s dumplings and broth are unmatched, even in comparison with crowd favourites at Bedok 85 Fengshan Food Centre and Bedok North 511 Market and Food Centre.Usually, he has to queue for 30 to 40 minutes but estimates that the line has doubled in size since the announcement. He arrived just before noon and got his bowl of noodles only around 2pm.\xa0According to the owner Sim Kok Quan, 70, the famed recipe has been passed down through the generations. Speaking in Mandarin, he said that his father had taught it to him and his brother.One of Sim’s assistants, who declined to be named, said that the work has certainly ramped up since word about the closure spread. “The more publicity there is about it, the more people come (to see us). It’s been non-stop work (since 6am),” the assistant said in Mandarin. “Last weekend, the queue was around four hours long.”Sim’s grandnephew Ler Jie Wei, 38, a fifth-generation hawker who runs the Famous Eunos Bak Chor Mee stall near Ubi, says that his granduncle had hoped to find a successor to continue the business, but was unable to do so.Sim, a third-generation hawker himself, declined to comment further, except that he’s keen on retiring after 30 years in the business.After several attempts on two separate days and a wait of almost two hours, I got my hands on a steaming bowl of the acclaimed bak chor mee (from S$3).The wantons, freshly made mere minutes before they arrived in my bowl, were certainly worth the wait and packed quite a punch. Umami-laden and savoury, each bite-sized piece was chock-full of dried fish and well-marinated minced meat.For more dumpling goodness, I’d suggest going for the large bowl (S$4), which also comes with a larger portion of springy yellow noodles.The soup, filled with a smattering of finely minced pork, lard and spring onions, is intensely flavourful and addictive.If you’re willing to brave the line, be sure to arrive by the late morning — those looking to join the queue after noon may be turned away.\xa0Book a ride to 58 Minced Meat Mee.The Marketplace @ Block 58, 01-151, 58 New Upper Changi Road\nNearest MRT station: Bedok\nOpens: Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays (6am to 2pm)The Marketplace @ Block 58, 01-151, 58 New Upper Changi Road\nNearest MRT station: Bedok\nOpens: Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays (6am to 2pm)AuthorJia-En has worn several hats in her career — first writing TV scripts, then food and lifestyle stories at Wine & Dine.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/singapore-hawkers-new-york/:['A food hall modelled after Singapore’s hawker centre — the first of its kind in the United States — is set to open in New York City on Sept 21. Named Urban Hawker, the food market will house 17 F&B vendors, 11 of which hail from Singapore.\xa0The hawkers were specially chosen and curated by Singapore food guru and restaurateur, KF Seetoh. A wide variety of Malay, Peranakan, Chinese and Indian cuisines will be made available, in an attempt to replicate Singapore’s culinary repertoire more than 15,000km from home.Among the hawkers featured is Daisy’s Dream Kitchen, which sells home-cooked Peranakan favourites such as laksa and nasi lemak. Part-owned by Singapore actress Selena Tan, Daisy’s Dream Kitchen started out as a hawker stall at Tiong Bahru Market and Food Centre in 2011. It has since moved to Temasek Club as a full-fledged restaurant.Well-known Malay restaurant Padi @ Bussorah is also part of the impressive line-up of hawkers. Branded as Padi D’NYC in the Big Apple, it’ll showcase authentic Malay fare such as mee rebus, satay and beef rendang. Padi @ Bussorah opened its restaurant at Bussorah Street (outside the Sultan Mosque) selling Malay hawker food such as nasi ambeng in 2015.More contemporary hawkers from the younger generation will also have a spot at the food hall. Burger joint Ashes Burnnit serves locally inspired burgers and sandwiches such as the grilled satay chicken burger with marinated chicken thighs and roti john. Known for its charcoal bun burgers, Ashes Burnnit redefined the gourmet burger wave when it opened its first outlet at Golden Mile Food Centre in 2019.Urban Hawker is a project by Makansutra, in partnership with Urbanspace, a market-maker in New York City. It will be open daily from 8am to 11pm, and the stalls are on a three-year lease.Below is the full list of F&B vendors available at Urban Hawker:\nDaisy’s Dream Kitchen, Padi @ Bussorah and Ashes Burnnit are on the GrabFood delivery service in Singapore.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/one-prawn-co/:['Since its opening in January, One Prawn & Co’s bubbling earthenware claypots — teeming with delicious prawn broth — have been a constant feature on my social media feed.It’s said to draw inspiration from Japanese ramen and Penang-style prawn noodles, dishing up umami-laden hae mee with a modern twist to a never-ending stream of Singapore foodies.I was dying to see if it lived up to the hype, and so, headed there one Saturday afternoon last month with a companion for a taste test.\xa0This eatery had its start as a hawker stall named One Prawn Noodle at Golden Mile Food Centre, before closing in late 2021.\xa0Since then, it has reopened in MacPherson with its own space, a wider range of dishes, and most recently, a nod on this year’s Michelin Bib Gourmand list released in July.At the helm is chef Gwyneth Ang, who cut her teeth at gourmet restaurants such as the one-Michelin-starred Burnt Ends, Forlino and Tong Le Private Dining.\xa0One Prawn & Co’s corner unit is spacious, with plenty of natural light. Powerful ceiling fans whirl overhead, so despite the coffee-shop setting, it’s well-ventilated and comfortably cool.The front-of-house staff minimised waits by taking our food orders while we were in the queue.\xa0So it was a short 10-minute wait before the claypots, chock-full of premium ingredients and bubbling prawn broth, arrived at our table after we were seated.We ordered the signature Five Fortune Big Prawns Claypot (S$30) with the works — big prawns, pork ribs, lala (clams), sliced shabu-shabu pork, and tobiko prawn balls — as well as the One Prawn & Co Prawn Noodles (S$14) with small prawns.Whether you order your noodles dry or soupy, it arrives in its own bowl, separate from the broth and ingredients.\xa0The eatery eschews the traditional plastic dishes of yesteryear for a modern, Japanese-inspired porcelain bowl. Each noodle dish comes with generous toppings of beansprouts, fried shallots, lard, and some greens.The broth was a delight. It was sweet, full-bodied and flavourful — so much so that we drained the bowl dry. Even then, it didn’t feel cloying, as you might expect after such a rich meal.You can also dunk a beancurd roll (S$1) into the pot to soak up all that umami goodness.When it comes to the pork ribs, the best prawn noodle places usually have them so soft they fall off the bone. One Prawn & Co’s rendition, by contrast, had a nice bite to it, while remaining fork-tender.The prawns were served in the usual style — halved lengthwise with the shell, which peeled away easily. The small prawns, in particular, stood out for their incredible freshness and sweetness.We also loved the ngoh hiang tasting platter (from S$8.50), which arrived fresh from the wok.\xa0It’s an absolute must-have and included the usual suspects of pork ngoh hiang, prawn cracker, fishcake, fried beancurd, in addition to One Prawn & Co’s crowd-pleasing sotong youtiao. Be sure to add an extra liver roll (S$2.80).I had hoped to beat the inevitable queue by arriving for a late lunch but was nonetheless greeted by a sizeable line of about 10 parties deep.\xa0There’s a small, sheltered waiting area with some seats, but you’d likely have to wait on the pavement under the unforgiving midday sun.Communication about wait times could certainly be improved. We had no idea how long it would be, and indeed, it was almost an hour before we were ushered to a table.Food-wise, I felt that the all-in-one Five Fortune Big Prawns Claypot, while heaped with premium ingredients, didn’t live up to its promise and hefty price tag of S$30.The inclusion of lala, for example, didn’t add much to the dish. While well-cooked, the clams’ naturally delicate flavour was overpowered by the richness of the broth.\xa0The big prawns — supposedly the star of the dish — were also lacklustre and lacked flavour, especially when compared with the standout smaller prawns in terms of quality and texture.Don’t get me wrong. The dish was passable, and indeed, better than most out there. Yet, all in all, the variety of ingredients could have been more carefully curated.\xa0It ended up being quite a pricey meal for a coffee-shop lunch.\xa0Is it conducive to conversation? Not exactly. While there’s more than enough room between tables, you may have to compete with roadside traffic, or the hustle and bustle of the kitchen, depending on where you’re seated.How to get there? Work up an appetite by taking a 10-minute walk from Mattar or Tai Seng MRT stations. Alternatively, bus services 8, 62, 90, and 151 will take you a few steps away from the eatery.Things to note:HungryGoWhere paid for its meal at this eatery for this review.One Prawn & Co is on the GrabFood delivery service.

The result? Juicy and tender meat that melts in your mouth. Paired with a mildly salty yet fragrant sauce, this chicken rice stall has people returning for more.While a plate of steamed chicken rice is usually priced at S$4, it’s now priced at S$5 because of the limited supply of fresh chicken.

The dishes are self-explanatory and you don’t have to wonder what you’re getting.\xa0The main menu items are rice bowls, such as Japanese curry meatball don (S$8.90), beef steak don with truffle ponzu (S$10.90), and salmon don with mentaiko sauce (S$8.90). \n\nYou’ve the option of adding S$2.90 to make it a set. There are three set options, all of which come with miso soup and your pick of a side dish: Yaki cheese balls, chicken karaage (Japanese-style fried chicken) or tempura ebi (battered prawns).\xa0Other extra sides not found in the sets include tempura soft shell crab (S$5.90), salmon miso soup (S$3.90) and edamame (S$1.50). \n\nMoving forward, Lai intends to beef up the menu.\xa0Lai, the man behind everything at Oh My Don, worked as a hotel chef for about a decade before setting up this stall.\xa0Three years ago, he conceived the idea of starting a business but hesitated because of the coronavirus pandemic. He decided to wait till the situation improved and, at the end of 2021, began making preparations to start the stall.\n\nOh My Don opened on Jan 23. It has just eight main dishes comprising seven rice bowl varieties and a salad bowl (S$3.50).\xa0He chose to serve rice-based dishes, since rice is a staple in Singapore, and many Singaporeans prefer to have rice for lunch and dinner.\xa0Lai’s journey through the food industry began in his youth. Upon completing secondary school in Malaysia, he came to Singapore and started working in F&B. His first job here was at Kenny Rogers Roasters, before he moved on to work at hotel restaurants. At Peppermint, he was made the sous chef and oversaw the Western food section. \n\nBut given that he handles pretty much everything at Oh My Don alone — his wife helps him on weekends and her days off — he had to create a menu that wasn’t too laborious. He, therefore, decided against featuring complex Western cuisines. The beef steak don with truffle ponzu (S$10.90) was the first item on the menu that caught my attention. I had never seen truffle ponzu (a Japanese citrus-based sauce) being served at a coffee-shop stall.\xa0I decided to upgrade it to a set with chicken karaage and miso soup. To my surprise, the chicken karaage came with a side of wasabi mayonnaise, instead of the standard mayonnaise typically used at coffee-shop and hawker stalls. Even the miso soup had a generous serving of ingredients (soft tofu cubes, konbu and radish) in it. \n\nApart from the beef steak don, my colleague and I ordered the tendon or tempura rice bowl (S$7.90) and chicken katsu don with truffle aioli set with yaki cheese balls and miso soup (S$6.90). The tendon consisted of battered crabstick, enoki and shiitake mushrooms, pumpkin, sweet potato, baby corn, three prawns, and an onsen egg atop a bed of rice.\xa0At S$7.90, it’s a good deal, given the variety of fried goodness you get. The battered prawns were yummy — the exterior was crispy and the prawns were firm to the bite.The chicken katsu don with truffle aioli — which I am told is popular — comes with cucumbers, cherry tomato and an onsen egg, and is topped with shredded seaweed. The truffle aioli has a subtle truffle aroma to it and went well with the fried chicken.\xa0One of the things that stood out for me was the rice itself. Lai uses Japanese short-grain rice that has a sweet and salty taste, making it quite flavourful by itself. It might have to do with the dark-brown sauce drizzled over the rice. The sprinkle of black and white sesame seeds also added some nice bits of crunch to it.\xa0Lastly, I really liked that the food was served in small Japanese-style trays. The bowls and plates also had a Japanese aesthetic.\xa0The use of elongated wooden spoons and chopsticks made the experience more complete. It’s almost as though we were dining at a Japanese restaurant — but at wallet-friendly prices. Clearly, presentation is a priority for Oh My Don and I appreciated it.\xa0Among the rice bowls we ordered, the beef steak don with truffle ponzu was the best. The beef, cut into bite-sized pieces, had a slight char on its surface. Thankfully, the beef was a little over medium-rare and had a slight pinkish hue on the inside. But the chef didn’t ask us how we would have liked our beef done. That added option would have been nice. \n\nFor the tendon, the batter was a little thick around the edges for some of the fried pieces. My preference is a thinner batter, so that it’s a little less floury. \n\nIf I were to get the set next time, I would recommend either Set B (chicken karaage with miso soup) or Set C (tempura ebi with miso soup). The yaki cheese balls were nothing to shout about in terms of taste, but I appreciated how they were topped with bonito flakes to make them look more appealing. For the chicken karaage, it didn’t taste anything like the high-quality fried chicken you’d get at a Japanese eatery. But the wasabi mayonnaise definitely made it tastier.\xa0In terms of the wait, my colleague and I were the only customers when we placed our orders. It took about 10 minutes before the food arrived, which was reasonable though a tad long for the quick service typical of most coffee shops. It did make us wonder if Lai could cope with more customers, since he’s alone at the stall most of the time. \n\nOverall, it’s a place I’ll visit again because it serves pretty good rice bowls that are easy on your pocket. Next time, I’ll have a go at other menu items such as the salmon don with mentaiko sauce and Korean glazed pork belly don (S$6.90).\xa0Is it conducive to conversation? It’s located in a coffee shop, so there’s bound to be chatter and the usual cling-clang of cutlery around you. But the coffee-shop setting is more casual than a restaurant’s, and there’s no time limit on dining in. So chat away.\xa0How to get there? The nearest MRT stations are Khatib and Yishun. If you’re coming from either MRT station, take bus service 117 from the bus stop opposite the station and alight at Block 430B Yishun Avenue 1. It’s a five-minute walk to the stall.\xa0Things to note:\xa0HungryGoWhere paid for its meal at this stall for this review.Oh My Don is on the GrabFood delivery service.

And, in our small nation of foodies, where the people are, good food goes, too.\xa0As a lifelong eastie, it’s hard to make a list of just 10 recommendations — it’s a little like being asked to pick a favourite child. But here are my picks for a long, tough day when you need something to soothe both stomach and soul.\xa018 Bedok South Road, 01-45\nNearest MRT station: Bedok\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (7.30am to 8.30pm)Jiak Song Mee Hoon Kway opened in Bedok last year and has since received rave reviews for its smoky broth, freshly made hand-cut noodles and well-marinated minced meat. Owned by Aaron Wong, a MasterChef Singapore Season 1 contestant, the business opened its first stall in Telok Blangah in 2020.My top pick here is the signature all-in combination of mee hoon kway with minced pork, pork slices, and pork and shrimp balls, with dry or soup options.The mee hoon kway is made to order, so be prepared to wait. But the process does it no disservice at all — the noodles are thick, doughy and pack quite the bite. Paired with peaty, umami-rich soup, crispy ikan bilis and a gooey egg yolk, this ban mian is a flavour bomb that leaves you craving more.What to order: Signature all-in combo mee hoon kway (from S$5.50), limited-edition Kurobuta mee hoon kway (from S$5.80)Tong Bee Coffee Shop, 92 Jalan Senang\nNearest MRT station: Kembangan\nOpen: Monday to Saturday (6.45am to 3.15pm)\xa0With red plastic chairs for seats and matching bowls of the same tint, Boon Kee Fishball Noodles & Laksa has been serving up delicious noodle meals to regulars, Kembangan residents and workers of the nearby Chai Chee industrial district for more than 40 years.For years, I’ve been a huge fan of its laksa with generous portions of fishcake slices, cockles and tau pok (tofu puffs). The soup base can certainly hold its own, with rich notes of coconut milk and homemade rempah in every spoonful.\xa0Diners who aren’t quite game for a spicy meal can take their pick from tasty mee pok, fishball noodles and even a signature Malaysian-style mee tai mak in black sauce.If you’re looking to make a trip there for lunch, be sure to arrive as early as you can. It tends to sell out by early afternoon and will shutter for the day shortly afterwards.What to order: Laksa (S$3.50), mee pok (S$3.50)Springleaf Eating House, 01-468, 69 Bedok South Avenue 3\nNearest MRT station: Bedok\nOpen: Monday to Thursday (11.30am to 3.30pm, 4pm to 8pm), Friday to Sunday (11.30am to 3.30pm, 4pm to 8.30pm)Serving charcoal bun burgers, truffle fries and salads at hawker prices, halal-certified Ashes Burnnit sees long mealtime queues almost daily.Its bestseller is a truffle mushroom burger, comprising sauteed mushrooms, American cheese and a juicy beef patty atop its signature buns. The truffle fries are a must-try as well.If burgers aren’t quite your thing, the lamb chop, which comes with fries, coleslaw and garlic bread, is a good alternative, too.\xa0After opening four stores here, the Ashes Burnnit team recently announced an upcoming outpost in New York City, bringing “Singapore-style omelette sandwiches” to a truly international audience.What to order: Truffle mushroom burger (from S$8), truffle fries (S$5), lamb chop (S$12.90)Block 216 Bedok Food Centre and Market, 01-54, 216 Bedok North Street 1\nNearest MRT station: Bedok\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (9am to 2pm)Formerly a Japanese fusion eatery named Plum & Rice, this stall rebranded itself to Prawn & Mee a few years back to serve next-level prawn noodles with accessible ingredients.When I visited, there was a small crowd of customers milling around even before the store’s shutters were fully raised at 9am. And be warned: It sells out fast — sometimes way before its official closing time.The menu is simple, minimalist and modern. Besides the usual options of dry or soup, diners can decide between just prawn noodles, or a mix of pork ribs and prawn noodles. I would recommend the latter, which consists of a healthy portion of peeled fresh prawns and tender ribs layered with soft cartilage for some bite.What to order: Prawn noodles (from S$4), pork ribs and prawn noodles (from S$4)FoodHub@Bedok, 01-0633, 209 New Upper Changi Road\nNearest MRT station: Bedok\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (11am to 9.30pm)This self-proclaimed carby monarch is well-known for its Din Tai Fung-style fried rice at truly affordable prices. Since King of Fried Rice’s original store opened at Golden Mile Tower, the franchise has expanded briskly in the last few years — with a whopping 23 branches islandwide to date.It’s not hard to see why. With a range of customisations available, or in its own words “a sick variety of fried rice”, there’s something for everyone. Diners can choose how they’d prefer their rice cooked — namely egg, mala, tom yum, or XO — and top off the meal with a protein.If you’re not feeling adventurous, the dependable pork cutlet egg fried rice will satisfy you.What to order: Pork cutlet egg fried rice (S$8.50), crabmeat and tobiko mala fried rice (S$13.50)Bedok Interchange Hawker Centre, 01-58, 208B New Upper Changi Road\nNearest MRT station: Bedok\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (9am to 11pm)Take a jaunt just round the corner from King of Fried Rice to yet another foodie hotspot — Bedok Interchange Hawker Centre.Hock Hai Curry Chicken Noodles, a Michelin Bib Gourmand recipient in 2019 and 2021, has called this place home since it moved from its original Hong Lim location. As the name suggests, curry chicken bee hoon (rice vermicelli) is the stall’s mainstay, but it also serves satay bee hoon.The star here is its thick, luscious gravy, which blankets spongy tau pok and fishcakes. Upon placing your order, the curry and other ingredients are dished out and topped off with potato chunks, chicken strips and your choice of noodles.What to order: Curry chicken bee hoon (from S$4), satay bee hoon (from S$4)FoodHub 59, 59 New Upper Changi Road\nNearest MRT station: Bedok\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (7.30am to 8pm)Snaking morning queues are a common sight at Chef Kin HK Wanton Noodle, but any true-blue Singaporean knows that this means the food is worth the wait.Instead of the usual Singaporean-style wanton noodles that often comes with char siew, dark sauce and small wantons, chef Kin’s dishes are done Hong Kong-style — more commonly seen in restaurants instead of hawker centres.Here, the wanton noodles come with a small side of leafy vegetables, nestled atop a bed of thin, eggy noodles, plump wantons, and chock-full of shrimp and meat. As with most wanton noodle stalls, the usual choice of dry or soup applies.The braised beef brisket noodles, composed of tender slices of meat and noodles, are also popular.What to order: Wanton noodles (S$5), braised beef brisket noodles (S$5.50)Bedok Interchange Hawker Centre, 01-64, 208B New Upper Changi Road\nNearest MRT station: Bedok\nOpen: Monday to Saturday (11.30am to 8.30pm)The queue at Inspirasi is constant and impressive, often stretching across the hawker centre’s corridor in a steady stream of hungry folks in search of tasty comfort food.This family-run stall has been around since 1970. It’s best known for its soto ayam, a savoury chicken noodle soup with shredded meat, and mee rebus — yellow egg noodles in a thick gravy, topped with generous portions of green chilli, fried shallots and a hard-boiled egg. Some customers ask for lontong — compacted rice cake — to go with their orders, instead of the usual noodles.The begedil — deep-fried potato fritter — is a must-try, so be sure to add that to your meal.What to order: Soto ayam (S$3), mee rebus (S$3), begedil (50 cents)Bedok 85 Market, 01-08, 85 Bedok North Street 4\nNearest MRT station: Bedok\nOpen: Thursday to Tuesday (3.30pm to 12am)Bedok’s Fengshan Market and Food Centre — or Bedok 85, as it’s more casually known — has a reputation for being quite the foodie paradise. Think mouthwatering sambal stingrays, smoky satay sticks and piping-hot zi char with oh-so-good wok hei.One of the food centre’s main draws is Seng Hiang Bak Chor Mee. This stall opens late into the night, dishing out steaming bowls to an appreciative supper crowd.\xa0Here, diners have the choice of dry or soup — the former comes with a piquant housemade chilli sauce, and the latter a rich, garlicky broth with a smattering of minced pork. The minced meat noodle soup is generally the more popular of the two, drawing fans from across the island.What to order: Minced meat noodle soup (from S$2.50)Bedok 85 Market, 01-25, 85 Bedok North Street 4\nNearest MRT station: Bedok\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (11.30am to 10.30pm)Head to 75 Ah Balling Peanut Soup, also located at Bedok 85 Market, for a chewy, comforting dessert to round up your meal.Each bowl comes with a choice of three to six tang yuan (or ah balling, in Teochew) with your choice of filling and soup. Patrons can choose from traditional fillings or contemporary riffs — take your pick from black sesame, red bean, peanut, yam, or matcha.Soup-wise, the stall offers ginger, peanut, almond, and longan tea. Mix and match as you please, but my usual order is a mixed bowl of black sesame and peanut glutinous rice balls in ginger soup.Take a careful bite into the soft yet QQ (bounciness associated with fishballs, glutinous rice balls and certain types of noodles) glutinous rice coating to reveal the warm, oozy core, then wash it down with a sip of ginger broth. Tangy and mildly spicy, it whets your appetite for more.What to order: Peanut and black sesame tang yuan with ginger soup (from S$2.50), yam and red bean tang yuan with peanut soup (from S$2.50)All the places on this list — except Prawn & Mee, Hock Hai Curry Chicken Noodles, and Inspirasi — are on the GrabFood delivery service.

A husband-and-wife team runs the stall full-time and concocts a mean chilli sauce that’s fragrant and punchy.You might break out into a sweat, but this savoury comfort dish is worth it. The tender, juicy chicken here is equally irresistible, making this a worthy consideration if you’re on the hunt for an affordable meal at East Coast Park.What to order: Chicken rice set meal (S$5.50), fried wanton (S$4)\xa0East Coast Lagoon Food Village, 01-42, 1220 East Coast Parkway\nNearest MRT station: Bedok\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (11am to 8.30pm)Founded in 1963, Han Jia Bak Kut Teh Pork Leg is no ordinary stall. Yes, there are many places in Singapore selling bak kut teh (a Chinese-style pork rib dish), but this stall stands out with its generous serving of pork leg at S$6.50. Customers can even choose between a lean or fatty portion of pork leg.You can tell that the pork has been cooked for a long time because its tender and juicy meat falls off the bone effortlessly. Be sure to dip the pork ribs in black soya sauce for added depth and flavour.The soup here is refillable, so you can sip endlessly on herbal peppery soup if you wish.What to order: Bak kut teh (S$6), pork leg — lean or fatty (S$6.50)\xa0East Coast Lagoon Food Village, 01-19, 1220 East Coast Parkway\nNearest MRT station: Bedok\nOpen: Monday and Tuesday, and Thursday and Friday (10am to 8pm), Saturday and Sunday (9am to 8pm)If you’re craving roasted meat, look no further than Siang Yuen Traditional Roasts. It is one of the few roasted meat stalls at East Coast Lagoon Food Village and uses charcoal to roast its meats.The specialty here is the roasted duck, which bears all the traits of delicious charcoal-roasted meat — from its crispy skin right down to its unmistakable smoky char. You can choose to pair the meat with either rice or noodles.What to order: Roasted-duck noodles (S$5), roasted-pork rice (S$5)\xa0East Coast Lagoon Food Village, 01-48, 1220 East Coast Parkway\nNearest MRT station: Bedok\nOpen: Monday, Tuesday and Thursday (12pm to 8pm), Friday to Sunday (12pm to 9pm)Among the well-known stalls at East Coast Lagoon Food Village lies this hidden gem. Makanz is a humble stall that serves hearty portions of briyani.According to reviews online, what’s special about its briyani is that it’s less oily, and the chicken is boneless and fried. This makes enjoying it so much easier! If you’re looking to indulge, the stall also sells tulang — a spicy mutton or lamb-bone dish.What to order: Boneless chicken briyani (S$6)\xa0All the places on this list, except Siang Yuen Traditional Roasts and Makanz, are on GrabFood.\xa0If you’re planning to travel to these eateries with your bicycle, book a ride via the GrabCar for Cyclists service.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

Since then, the stall has been known for its delicious braised pork rice, in addition to Taiwanese-style fried chicken and mee sua (thin vermicelli noodles in a thick broth).The braised pork is cooked to perfection, with a good balance of lean meat and fat. What’s more, it also serves ramen-style eggs with creamy, runny yolks, making this a heavenly combination.Customers should also try the well-seasoned fried popcorn chicken that’s known to be juicy, tender and highly addictive.What to order: Braised pork rice set (S$6.80)\xa0Golden Mile Food Centre, 01-104, 505 Beach Road\nNearest MRT station: Nicoll Highway\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (11am to 3pm)Braise is another stall that happened to also open in 2021 and has since received many positive reviews from food bloggers and enthusiasts.Specialising in braised pork, it offers different cuts, such as pork cheeks and ribs that have been braised for hours with a medley of herbs, spices and wine.

It was also the only Muslim-owned hawker stall included in the guide that year.With only a small selection of dishes on its menu, its signature dish, tahu goreng, comes highly recommended.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/kin-men-seng-heng-hokkien-braised-duck-halal/:['It can be quite a challenge to source halal Hokkien braised duck in Singapore, which keeps our Muslim friends from savouring the delicious dish served with rice or noodles. Thankfully, there’s now a halal-certified Hokkien braised duck stall at the bustling gastronomic haven of Amoy Street Food Centre.The stall is Kin Men Seng Heng Hokkien Braised Duck, which announced on its Instagram account on July 11 that it is now halal-certified.Its third-generation owner said on Instagram of the stall’s origins: “The name Seng Heng came from ‘seng gong’, which means success and ‘heng heng’ that means lucky. When I took the mantle, I added ‘Kin Men’ in honour of my grandfather’s birthplace, Kin Men Island, Taiwan.”Helmed by the grandson of the founder and a few other co-owners, the stall has received rave reviews from diners for its authenticity in taste and tender braised duck. These reviews have come from customers who soon became loyal fans of this humble stall.In addition to the duck, customers have also said that its herbal broth is not overpowering and has good balance, making it an excellent complement.For simplicity, Kin Men Seng Heng Hokkien Braised Duck has a straightforward menu.Patrons can choose to pair their braised duck with rice, kway teow (flat rice noodles) or yellow noodles. The noodles can be served separately or in a bowl of broth (S$4 for the dry or soup version). Customers can also opt for an upgrade to a set (S$6), which gives them more ingredients — egg, braised beancurd and tofu puffs.If you can’t get enough of its braised duck, you can also order a quarter (S$13), half (S$25) or the whole duck (S$48) from its a la carte menu.It’s always encouraging to see young hawkers who are willing to delve into the hawker trade and preserve Singapore’s food culture.After all, they certainly are keeping our bellies full and making sure that everyone gets a taste of the fruits of their labour.\xa0Book a ride to Kin Men Seng Heng Hokkien Braised Duck.Amoy Street Food Centre, 02-133, 7 Maxwell Road\nNearest MRT stations: Tanjong Pagar and Telok Ayer\nOpen: Monday to Friday, and Sunday (9am to 2pm)Amoy Street Food Centre, 02-133, 7 Maxwell Road\nNearest MRT stations: Tanjong Pagar and Telok Ayer\nOpen: Monday to Friday, and Sunday (9am to 2pm)Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

Headlining the event were four young Singaporean chefs who have made waves on the global culinary stage. Chefs Mathew Leong (Re-naa, Norway), Jimmy Lim (JL Studio, Taiwan), Barry Quek (Whey, Hong Kong), and Angela Lai (Tairroir, Taiwan) cooked up a storm for guests. Joining them were international culinary veterans who have made Singapore their home — chefs Tetsuya Wakuda (Waku Ghin, Singapore) and Tristin Farmer (Zen, Singapore).In all, there were 42 one-starred, seven two-starred and three three-starred eateries. Of these, seven restaurants made the list for the first time, and two are newly crowned two-starred restaurants.Here’s the full list of Michelin star awardees:One-starred restaurants are notable for their high-quality cooking and are “worth a stop”.Out of the 35 restaurants retaining their one-star status this year, 11 have done so for six consecutive editions — since the first Michelin Singapore guide in 2016.Seven establishments joined the Michelin ranks with one star to their name. Notably, Burnt Ends joins the list as a new addition after its recent move from Keong Saik to its new Dempsey location.Two-starred restaurants provide excellent cooking and are “worth a detour”.Two restaurants have been bumped up to two-star status.Three-starred restaurants are “worth a special journey” for their exceptional cuisine.

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/tampines-hawker-stalls/:['Home to Singapore’s largest integrated community and lifestyle hub and three MRT stations, Tampines houses many hidden hawker gems, so much so that its residents hardly have to venture out of the town for good food.It was a tough pick for our must-tries, but here are 10 stalls we recommend that you visit if you’re swinging by this eastern hub.\xa0Tampines Round Market and Food Centre, 01-07, 137 Tampines Street 11\nNearest MRT station: Tampines West\nOpen: Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday to Sunday (6am to 12pm)A hot favourite at the famous Tampines Round Market and Food Centre, Song Han Carrot Cake has been attracting consistently long queues for more than two decades. Selling only one item — carrot cake — the store keeps its prices low, despite egg prices going up recently. With S$2 getting you a hearty portion of white or black carrot cake, you can also go for a larger S$4 option, if you’re looking for a heartier helping.Fans of Song Han swear by its soft, moist and flavourful version of this local dish, and its differentiating factor — a good dose of curry powder. I, for one, love my crispy carrot cake, but I’d trade this for a plate of Song Han’s black-and-white carrot cake any day.What to order: Fried black-and-white carrot cake (S$4 or S$5)\xa0Tampines Round Market and Food Centre, 01-14, 137 Tampines Street 11\nNearest MRT station: Tampines West\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (7.15am to 2pm)A few stalls away, you’ll find yet another queue at Nasi Lemak Specialist, but don’t let it deter you — we promise you it’s worth the wait. Unlike most other nasi lemak stalls that use Thai jasmine rice, Nasi Lemak Specialist uses basmati rice prepared with freshly squeezed coconut milk. The result is a fragrant, light and fluffy base for you to pile your favourite nasi lemak ingredients on.The stall has a whole variety for you to choose from, but if you’re unsure, opt for its economical set from S$2.50, which has a fried egg, anchovies, peanuts, and chilli. Or go luxe with its quarter-chicken set (S$6), which has all of the above, including a juicy chicken thigh. Its fried chicken is made with a homemade batter that delivers on both flavour and crunch.What to order: Mega-value set — with chicken wing, otah, fried egg, and begedil (S$5.50), quarter-chicken set (S$6)\xa0The Hawker Centre @ Our Tampines Hub, 01-65, 1 Tampines Walk\nNearest MRT station: Tampines\nOpen: Monday and Tuesday, and Thursday to Sunday (7am to 10pm)Botak Cantonese Porridge serves up silky, smooth Cantonese porridge that’s flavourful, hearty and chock full of ingredients for its price. The stall keeps things simple, with only a small selection of Cantonese porridge topped with different permutations of ingredients.For the undecided, the signature mixed porridge — which comes with a bit of every ingredient served at the stall — would be a great choice. It also includes the stall’s handmade meatballs, made fresh every morning.Also, I love that Botak Cantonese Porridge deep-fries its thinly sliced youtiao to crispy perfection. If you want more, you can also add an extra portion of youtiao for 80 cents.What to order: Signature mixed porridge (S$4), homemade meatball porridge (S$2.80)\xa09008 Tampines Street 93\nNearest MRT station: Tampines\nOpen: Monday to Friday (8am to 3pm); Saturday (8am to 2pm)Hom Grill, which stands for Home of the Marvellous, dishes out restaurant-quality Western cuisine. With menu items priced at average hawker prices, the stall is in the industrial estate at Tampines Street 93. Because of the crowd it serves, the place opens only for breakfast and lunch, so head there earlier in the day to avoid missing out.If there’s one thing you should have from its menu, it’s the maple chicken chop, which is chargrilled to tender perfection with a slightly crisp skin. The maple seasoning also lends a mild sweetness that complements the savouriness of the protein and spiced butter rice perfectly.What to order: Maple chicken chop (S$6.20), Hom BBQ beef sandwich toast (S$4.50)\xa09008 Tampines Street 93\nNearest MRT station: Tampines West\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (9am to 2pm)When Lawa Bintang opened in 2017, it drew long queues for the first-of-its-kind lobster nasi lemak, made fresh-to-order and topped with cheese and a touch of chilli powder. It didn’t matter that its nasi lemak cost more than five to six times an average plate; the queues didn’t care.Five years on, Lawa Bintang is still standing strong and commands a slightly more manageable queue. Fret not, the lobster nasi lemak is still there if you’re travelling all the way to Tampines for this prized treat (and priced the same after five years).But the fried sotong nasi lemak, at S$9 and with the protein filling up nearly half my plate, is my go-to every single time.What to order: Fried sotong nasi lemak (S$9), lobster nasi lemak (S$22)\xa0824 Tampines Street 81, 01-83\nNearest MRT station: Tampines West\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (8am to 2.30pm, 5.30pm to 8pm)Open for about a year, the young hawkers behind Jofa Meepok — Joel Tan and Fabian Lim — have been making waves with their innovative take on bak chor mee (minced meat noodles). Its signature version is topped with clams, mock abalone, fried fish sticks, and prawn paste balls — on top of the usual minced meat.The duo may be young (in their mid-20s), but their commitment to their noodle craft shines through the extensive research and development. They conducted recipe testing and held several taste tests before opening Jofa in Tampines, and most recently, their second outlet in Chinatown.Their sought-after chilli paste is one of the fruits of R&D, and if you’d like to try it but can’t take spice, we recommend that you ask for it to be mixed with ketchup in your noodles.What to order: Signature minced meat noodles (S$6 or S$8), prawn paste soup (S$5.50)\xa0Chang Cheng Food Court, 02-03 (Stall 7 and 8), 866A Tampines Street 83\nNearest MRT station: Tampines\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (9am to 7pm)Hidden within Tampines Central Community Complex is this year-old Peranakan hawker stall manned by a fully Peranakan crew who wanted to share their love for this cuisine. The stall opens for breakfast and runs until dinnertime, and serves different dishes, depending on the time of day.Everything at Heritage Corner is made with heart and generosity — evident in the rich flavours present in every dish, from the nyonya laksa gravy to the simple chap chye (braised vegetables). You’d want to come with a bunch of people because you simply wouldn’t be able to enjoy the magnitude of what this place offers if you order just a dish or two.What to order: Ayam buah keluak — chicken with black nut paste and tamarind (S$4.50), nyonya laksa (S$5.80)\xa0802 Tampines Avenue 4\nNearest MRT: Tampines West\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (7am to 8pm)Opened by a former Peach Garden chef with more than a decade of F&B experience, Chef Too Chang Wei serves up silky soft rolls of high-quality handmade chee cheong fun. Choose from a range of flavours — plain, prawn, mushroom, or char siew — and watch as the chefs get to work, skilfully making each roll from scratch.Regulars swear by how smooth and thin the freshly made rolls are and rave about its power-packed handmade chilli sauce. The stall’s popularity has led to Chef Wei opening stores all over the island. Take heart as Tampines now has one to call its own, at 802 Tampines Avenue 4 — a stone’s throw from Tampines West MRT station.What to order: Plain cheong fun (S$3), prawn cheong fun (S$5)\xa0Foodcity Coffeeshop, 01-08, 139 Tampines Street 11\nNearest MRT station: Tampines West\nOpen: Wednesday to Monday (11.30am to 10.30pm)Mookata (Thai-style barbecue) places are a dime a dozen in Singapore, given Singaporeans’ love of Thai food. But Cocokata delivers a spin on your regular mookata offering, infusing coconut into its broth, marinated meats and accompanying chilli sauce. The result is a mildly sweet, fragrant broth that complements the greasiness of the barbecued meats perfectly.If barbecue isn’t quite your thing, Cocokata also has a la carte cooked dishes on its menu (yes, also made with coconut). These include its signature coconut sauce sea bass and coconut sauce prawns. If you prefer something sans coconut, don’t worry. It also has regular Thai dishes on its menu, such as tom yum fried rice and basil pork.What to order: Seabass with signature coconut sauce (S$25), prawn omelette (S$8)\xa0Kim San Leng Coffeeshop, 01-148, 138 Tampines Street 11\nNearest MRT station: Tampines West\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (12pm to 7pm)Warisan Kampung is a hawker stall manned by a husband-and-wife team, selling the husband’s late grandmother’s take on asam pedas (sour and spicy stew), served in a claypot. There’s the classic fish (snapper) version, but if you want to switch things up, the stall also offers stingray, beef and chicken options, and you can buy them as part of a set meal for one to three persons.As everything is made fresh-to-order and the fairly new stall is quite popular, expect a bit of a wait for your food when you head there. You can also text the stall via WhatsApp at least a day ahead to book a slot for dine-in or takeouts, or to pre-order your claypot.What to order: Asam pedas with snapper (S$10.50 for one person), omelette (S$3.50)\xa0Botak Delicacy, Hom Grill, Jofa Meepok, Lawa Bintang, Chef Wei HK Cheong Fun, Cocokata, and Warisan Kampung are on the GrabFood delivery service.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/michelin-bib-gourmand-2022/:['Michelin, an authority on fine-dining and the gourmet world, has just released its latest edition of the Bib Gourmand list — with nine new additions. Of these, five are restaurants, three are hawker stalls and one is a street-food establishment.The Bib Gourmand category has been around since 1997, and recognises eateries that are affordable and well worth your money. In Singapore, this means a meal at any such eatery will cost no more than S$45.Essentially, its existence proves that a good meal doesn’t have to cost a pretty penny.This is the list’s sixth edition since Michelin landed on Singapore’s shores in 2016. (There was no announcement in 2020 because of the pandemic.)As we know, there’s no lack of cheap yet delicious food in Singapore, so the yearly Bib Gourmand list is always highly anticipated.Who’s among the best of the best this year?\xa0Sixty-seven eateries were awarded the Bib Gourmand distinction this year, including the nine new entrants.Among the newly garlanded restaurants are Indonesian eatery Cumi Bali in Tanjong Pagar and prawn noodle eatery One Prawn & Co in MacPherson.Fool, a new modern wine bar led by chef Rishi Naleendra, also joins this year’s list. It shines with a “fascinating selection of snacks and small plates, showcasing precise execution and plating,” Michelin said in a statement on Tuesday (July 5).Naleendra also heads Kotuwa — which has a Bib Gourmand of its own — as well as the one-Michelin-starred Cloudstreet.Regular Michelin observers may be surprised to find Man Man Japanese Unagi Restaurant — a chargrilled eel restaurant in the heart of Tanjong Pagar that’s been on the list since 2019 — missing from this year’s announcement. But fret not: It underwent a name change last year and rejoins the list as a new entrant Unagi Tei.Un-Yang-Kor-Dai, which serves up Isan cuisine from northeast Thailand, is no stranger to the Michelin award system. It was awarded a Michelin Plate last year and has now been promoted to Bib Gourmand status.The Michelin Plate is bestowed on eateries that haven’t been awarded a star or a Bib Gourmand, but are recognised for serving very good food.Meanwhile, there are three new hawker stalls on this year’s Bib Gourmand list.Kim Keat Palm Market and Food Centre in Toa Payoh is proving quite the hotspot, with Hai Nan Xing Zhou Beef Noodle\xa0and Lixin Teochew Fishball Noodles earning nods. Elsewhere, Kelantan Kway Chap Pig Organ Soup from Jalan Besar’s Berseh Food Centre also makes the list for the first time.Sing Lung HK Cheong Fun, a street-food stall on Beach Road that serves Hong Kong-style rice noodle rolls, rounds off the list of new Bib Gourmand eateries.Traditionally, the Bib Gourmand announcement serves as a prelude to the Michelin Guide’s star announcement, which is slated for July 12. Stay tuned.Cumi Bali, One Prawn & Co, Un-Yang-Kor-Dai and Man Man Japanese Unagi Restaurant (now Unagi Tei) are on the GrabFood delivery service.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/nyonya-pok-pok-kay-hawker-peranakan-food/:['In Asian families, it’s quite often the case that the father tells his children what to do. But at Nyonya Pok Pok Kay, it’s the reverse.At this family-run Peranakan hawker stall, daughter Sarah Sng calls the shots, which range from everything to do with ownership, business operations, liaising with suppliers and handling customers to marketing and social media.Her father Leon Sng — a chef with more than 20 years of experience — is happy to take a back seat. His sole domain is the kitchen, where the 57-year-old whips up bowls of chicken curry kapitan and ayam sioh (chicken with tamarind and coriander).Since it opened in November 2021, the quirkily named hawker stall at Pasir Ris Central Hawker Centre has attracted a loyal following in the east for its affordable and delicious Peranakan fare.“My dad is very supportive and gives me the space to make the final decision,” says the 27-year-old Sarah Sng, who’s already had a hand in three F&B ventures.\xa0Thanks to her father’s influence, Sarah Sng started learning culinary skills from him as early as in primary school.Back then, he left his position in a hotel kitchen to become a canteen stallholder at Temasek Polytechnic selling mixed vegetable rice with her mother. Sarah Sng would also help with simple preparatory work and cashiering during her school holidays.She later obtained her diploma in business administration (marketing and public relations) from Singapore Polytechnic. But still wet behind the ears, she chose to take on a job instead of furthering her studies.In September 2017, Sarah Sng had her first brush with running a food business.To raise funds for her younger sister’s university fees, her parents started a food-based business called Daddy’s Kitchen, selling Peranakan home-cooked meals and hosting tok panjang (a lavish nyonya feast) on the weekends for guests to enjoy a private dining experience at their home.No stranger to playing hosts — back in secondary school, Sarah Sng’s friends loved to gather at their place to make pizza from scratch with her mother and sample Leon Sng’s food — the private dining business seemed like a natural progression.It quickly gained popularity through word of mouth. Extended family and groups of friends came by for meals and birthday celebrations. Daddy’s Kitchen also branched out into doing Christmas and Chinese New Year takeaways.As with most Peranakan dishes, they required a lot of planning and prep work, and it was all hands on deck starting as early as midweek. The family didn’t have a dishwasher, so they would have to hand-wash some 16 sets of cutlery. “It was very fun but tiring,” she recalls.Heartened by the response, the entrepreneurial family decided to open a stall at the basement of Hong Leong Building in Raffles Place in July 2018.Called Baba Bento, it catered to the lunch crowd selling four staple dishes: Chicken curry, beef rendang, asam pedas (sour and spicy fish), and ayam pongteh (nyonya chicken and potato stew). Things were tough, and in the second week, Sarah Sng had a breakdown and, finally in March 2019, the stall shuttered because of high rental costs.Still, it gave Sarah Sng a little confidence and know-how. She had seen the way her father managed Baba Bento and had some ideas of her own on innovation and growth.Things were “backdated”; they used traditional equipment such as stoves, which slowed the heating process. Her father barely knew how to use Microsoft Word, let alone social media.Eventually, Sarah Sng returned to the corporate world as an events and communications executive at Peter Knipp Holdings, an F&B and hospitality consultancy, to gain more exposure to the industry.“I felt I was very young. A lot of things were very new to me and I was trying to do everything at once… I wanted to see what else I could learn,” she says.She was involved in events such as the World Gourmet Awards, which gave her the opportunity to network with various distributors and suppliers. She also gained a better sense of what professional chefs looked for on a plate when it comes down to the ideation, presentation and taste.\xa0Feeling empowered by her newfound knowledge, she left her corporate job to open Nyonya Pok Pok Kay last year. She’s the eatery’s sole proprietor.Every day, Sarah Sng and her father arrive at 9am to start cooking, with her mother and sister doing the prep work the day before. When noon comes around, they’re ready to serve customers in their distinctive short-sleeved kebayas.It isn’t easy surviving in the hawker world, having to contend with the long hours in a hot and fast-paced environment, she says. And as a young woman, she often had to hold her own and assert herself when liaising with suppliers.Some might prefer not to mix family with business, fearing that it might stir up conflict, but the Sngs seem not to mind. “When we work together, we realise our strengths and weaknesses, emotions, and begin to help one another. It’s more than a business,” says Leon Sng.Ever the supportive father, Leon Sng’s steadfast support is what keeps her going. Plus, he’s content doing what he does best — cooking up a storm in the kitchen.Reflecting on their father-daughter relationship, Leon Sng describes his daughter as “open and teachable”, while she calls him a “mentor figure who is patient and hardworking”.The two joke that they also share a “trademark” boisterous laugh. Sarah Sng says: “My dad laughs very loudly, which I’ve inherited. People get a shock when they hear us.”How are they planning to mark Father’s Day, which falls on Sunday (June 19)? “We’re planning to do a belated celebration, since we’re open that day. We plan to take him out for a nice American breakfast,” she adds.For now, the young woman is focused on getting the business off the ground.She hopes to expand the brand in future, though finding manpower is a constant challenge. Her goal is simple: To share her family’s love language of food with more people.Nyonya Pok Pok Kay is on the GrabFood\xa0delivery service.

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/affordable-brunch-pasar-216-bedok-central/:['When it comes to Block 216 Bedok Food Centre and Market, it’s true that the early bird gets the worm.\xa0This hawker centre, also known as Pasar 216 Bedok Central, is a jackpot for those who love nostalgic, old-school eats such as soya bean, kaya toast sets, and kway chap. Yet you’ll find that many of these stalls close by 2pm.\xa0If you’re seeking affordable brunch options, here are five stalls you’ll enjoy at Block 216 Bedok Food Centre and Market.\xa0Blk 216 Bedok Food Centre and Market, 01-43, 216 Bedok North Street 1\nOpen: Tuesday (3.30am to 12pm), Thursday and Saturday (3.30am to 11am)\xa0This elusive yu char kway (deep-fried dough fritter) stall at Pasar 216 Bedok Central is open for business only three days a week: Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. Still, even on a random weekday at 8am, there was a snaking queue in front of the stall.Bite into its dough fritters (S$1), and it’s pretty clear why.The yu char kway was fried to a perfect crisp. It had a thin, crispy layer that yielded the perfect ASMR crunch. Yet it retained its light, chewy texture and wasn’t overly greasy.\xa0While there are other items on the menu, such as its plain salted bun (S$1) and butterfly bun (S$1), we recommend sticking to the dough fritters.\xa0That said, if you’re lucky enough to find its sesame ball (S$1) available, be sure to pick one up. We heard it sells out around 6am.\xa0What to order: Dough fritters (S$1), sesame ball (S$1)A post shared by HungryGoWhere (@hungrygowhere)Blk 216 Bedok Food Centre and Market, 01-10, 216 Bedok North Street 1\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (7.30am to 2.30pm) When it comes to iconic Singaporean breakfasts, a youtiao and soya bean drink combination is high on the list.\xa0And while we’ve soya bean specialty stalls all across Singapore, there’s something special about seeing it scooped from a giant container at a hawker centre.\xa0At this stall, you’ll find one of the cheapest soya bean drinks in Bedok, with a cup starting from 80 cents. The syrup wasn’t too sweet, making it a light, affordable breakfast.\xa0If you’re there for lunch, get the grass jelly drink (from 80 cents) for a refreshing respite from the heat.\xa0We also enjoyed the soya beancurd (from 70 cents). It had a firm, tofu-like pudding texture, instead of the usual silky-smooth ones you’ll find at soya bean chains.\xa0What to order: Soya bean drink (from 80 cents), grass jelly drink (from 80 cents), soya beancurd (from 70 cents)\xa0Blk 216 Bedok Food Centre and Market, 01-77, 216 Bedok North Street 1\nOpen: Monday to Thursday, Saturday and Sunday (4.30am to 2.30pm)\xa0Yummy Daoxiang is an underrated breakfast spot that serves unique chee cheong fun (rice noodle rolls), yong tau foo (a Hakka Chinese dish), and rice dumplings topped with a sweet sauce.\xa0Since we’ve never seen a crossover quite like this, we were rather impressed by its novelty. We went for Set F (S$3.60), a mix of silky chee cheong fun, crispy deep-fried beancurd skin, flat-fish ngoh hiang (five-spice meat wrapped in beancurd skin), and a steamed cake of your choice (carrot, pumpkin or yam).\xa0The dish was a wonderful amalgamation of textures, and was particularly filling on account of its large portion of carbohydrates. If you’re looking for a lighter breakfast, we recommend sharing it with someone.\xa0What to order: Set A comprising chee cheong fun, fried beancurd skin and fishcake (S$2.70), Set F comprising chee cheong fun, fried beancurd skin, flat-fish ngoh hiang and steamed cake (S$3.60)\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Junction Westgate opening with promos; will house 23 tenants, including new halal teppanyaki\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHawker Hustlers: Hipster hawker Ray Yeo of Bei-Ing Dimsum Club on reinventing dim sum and his love for all things Japan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlk 216 Bedok Food Centre and Market, 01-46, 216 Bedok North Street 1\nOpen: Tuesday to Thursday, Saturday and Sunday (8.30am to 3pm) This Han Kee Fish Soup stall is unrelated to the popular stall of the same name at Amoy Street Food Centre.\xa0But it does sell similar fare — Teochew-style fish soup featuring sliced fish in clear broth.\xa0You may be disappointed if you favour more savoury fish-soup bases. The soup here is more suited to those with a lighter palate. Still, it had a subtle sweetness and wasn’t insipid.\xa0The sliced fish soup (from S$5) contained a decent portion of sliced fish, smooth tofu, tomatoes, seaweed and vegetables.\xa0The sliced fish was the star ingredient, of course. It was firm with a bouncy texture, and its freshness was evident.\xa0Add on a bowl of white rice (50 cents) to pair with your soup. You could also ask the uncle to add some braised sauce for extra kick.\xa0What to order: Sliced fish soup (from S$5) with white rice (50 cents)Blk 216 Bedok Food Centre and Market, 01-37, 216 Bedok North Street 1\nOpen: Wednesday to Monday (4am to 2pm)Ah Li Ipoh Hor Fun Fish Dumpling primarily sells two things: Dumplings and noodles. But the stall allows you to tailor the dish to your liking.\xa0There are three dumpling variations to choose from: Fish, prawn, and wonton (with pork filling). You can have the dumplings plain — as a side — or pair them with regular, thin egg noodles or hor fun, a type of flat rice noodles.\xa0We opted for the stall’s signature fish dumpling hor fun (from S$4), which came tossed in a thin, clear gravy. The dish was served with vegetables and mushrooms, and four pieces of deep-fried fish dumplings.\xa0Fried upon ordering, the dumplings had a satisfying crunch, and the filling was fresh and juicy, with a generous amount of ingredients stuffed within.\xa0Exercise caution, however, when mixing the chilli that’s served with the hor fun. We found this to be extremely spicy — though spice lovers would welcome it.\xa0What to order: Fried fish dumplings (from S$3), fish dumpling hor fun (from S$4)\xa0Yummy Daoxiang and Ah Li Ipoh Hor Fun Fish Dumpling are on the GrabFood delivery service.

For optimal rice to eel ratio, opt for the double portion.\xa0Other bowl variations involve unagi that has been cut into smaller pieces and served with a variety of ingredients, such as tamago (egg), tororo (grated yam) and okura (lady finger).\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50% off at picturesque date spots, including Wildseed Cafe at The Alkaff Mansion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHawker Hustlers: Hipster hawker Ray Yeo of Bei-Ing Dimsum Club on reinventing dim sum and his love for all things Japan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile comprising the same ingredients — unagi and fluffy Japanese rice — the unajyu (S$12 for regular, S$20 for large, S$22) is technically a different dish. The unajyu, aside from being more expensive, is served in a jubako (traditional lacquered food box), and contains more unagi.\xa0The priciest item on the food menu, the bikkurijyu, or surprise unajyu, (S$35) is for serious unagi fans. The dish comprises a whole slab of unagi resting on a bed of Japanese rice.\xa0Perhaps what we’re most excited to try is its hitsumabushi (S$13.50), a popular dish in Nagoya cuisine. It involves dividing the unagi bowl into sections and eating it in three different ways: As a normal unadon, with condiments (seaweed, spring onions and wasabi), and with tea or dashi broth.\xa0Expect some non-unagi items as well, such as the colourful salmon ikura don (S$18) and an affordable chicken and egg don (S$8.50).Unatoto will also be serving sake, such as Kubota senjyu (S$95 for a bottle) and highball (Japanese whisky with soda, S$7.80), making it a potential post-work hangout. You’ll also be able to order sides such as skewers (from S$2.80) and sushi rolls (from S$9.80) for sharing.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/bag-me-up/:['Just when we thought the bagelwich (a sandwich with bagel bread, for the uninitiated) era was over, Bag Me Up swoops in to prove us wrong.\xa0Launched on Dec 9, Bag Me Up is located in the trendy Everton Park area where crowd favourites such as 46 Mittsu and Nylon Coffee are situated nearby.\xa0Founded by a team of four, comprising a married couple and two others, Bag Me Up takes over the small space previously occupied by Handcraft Coffee. With just a small bench for seating, it functions more — as its name suggests — as a takeaway space due to the limited seats available.\xa0Here, you’ll find simple fare that focuses on quality ingredients and how they come together to create a flavourful bagelwich.\xa0There are six bagelwiches available on its menu, ranging from S$10.50 to S$16.50. Bag Me Up does not sell plain bagels with schmears, so do visit the space with an empty stomach.\xa0\xa0The Trustful bagel (S$10.50) is the flavour that started it all. It consists of mushrooms, scrambled eggs and a truffle schmear. The aromatic combination was born after the team experimented with the flavour in one of the founders’ kitchen.\xa0Impressed by its simplicity and taste, the four of them set to work to bring the idea to life. With experience in various F&B establishments such as floral-themed cafe Artea SG, they were no strangers to the scene.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/sui-yi-gastrobar/:['As Singapore’s nightlife rouses from its slumber, new kid on the block Sui Yi Gastrobar is, too, gearing up to provide revellers a jolly good time.\xa0Located near Clarke Quay, this new music-themed multi-concept establishment by Jumbo Group is a haven for foodies looking for a fun night of music, karaoke and gourmet seafood.\xa0The space is split into three sections: Indoor seats, outdoor seats and private karaoke rooms. There are plenty of large tables and comfy seats, making it ideal for cosy group gatherings. To add to the vibe, there will be live canto-pop or mando-pop music every Wednesday, Friday and Saturday from 7pm to 10pm.\xa0True to its theme, Sui Yi Gastrobar’s food menu is divided into four sections that are aptly named after musical concepts: Appetising preludes, seafood symphony, golden brown hits and main theme songs.\xa0Appetising preludes consist of innovative snacks such as the chilli crab flower dome (S$16), which comprises flower-shaped kueh pie tee (a crispy shell) topped with crabmeat, caviar and Jumbo’s signature chilli crab sauce, and the pork lard crunch! (S$7).\xa0We appreciate that each dish was well curated and crafted with quality ingredients. The pork lard was tossed with ikan bilis, curry leaves, dried chilli and fried garlic to give it a nice savoury touch. It’s addictive and didn’t feel too heavy with grease.\xa0Jumbo Group is known for its famous seafood restaurant chain, so it’s no surprise Sui Yi has a section that’s seafood-centric. The seafood symphony section comprises items such as Master Hawker’s sambal sotong (S$28), Wasabi Prawn Bombs (S$24) and Master Hawker’s sambal stingray (S$28), all of which felt quite ordinary compared to the other sections.\xa0\xa0The sambal stingray’s star ingredient, the sambal, was on the sweeter side and lacked the fragrance of typical sambal chillies. In terms of spice, it was on the milder side. A pity, considering that the stingray was fleshy and had a nice firm texture. We found ourselves most impressed by the golden brown hits section, which features a range of crispy, fried foods.\xa0The Fill Good chicken rice balls (S$14) was the eatery’s twist on a traditional chicken rice dish. The rice is moulded into a ball with bites of chicken within, deep-fried and served with chicken rice chilli. While it sounds gimmicky, the result was a flavourful chicken rice ball with a delicious crisped exterior.\xa0Other honorary mentions include its otafu (S$16), a tofu cube mixed with otah, and the firecracker mala karaage (S$16).\xa0That’s not to say that Sui Yi Gastrobar isn’t true to its traditional dishes. For its mains, the Sui Yi’s sah poh fan (claypot rice, S$22) is served in a charcoal-fired claypot with Chinese sausages and duck liver sausage.\xa0This is how it’s typically served in Cantonese cuisine. Yet not many places do it as it’s quite expensive. That being said, we felt there could have been a better ingredient-to rice-ratio. \n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Feuds: Saizeriya vs Milan Shokudo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may want to opt for Sui Yi’s supreme crab fried rice (S$28) instead, as it contains generous chunks of crabmeat, lard and tobiko on top of fragrant fried rice.\xa0What’s a night out without drinks? The drinks menu features handcrafted cocktails that are playfully named after popular Chinese songs. The My Lucky Charm (S$19) drink, for instance, is named after Taiwanese singer Hebe Tian’s song, Little Happiness (小幸运).\xa0Sui Yi Gastrobar has happy hour deals that run daily from 5pm to 8pm. It includes options such as beers, house pour spirits, wine, umeshu and sake from as low as S$6. There are also daily specials, such as Fried Chicken Tuesdays where you get to enjoy its har cheong gai (shrimp paste chicken) or firecracker mala karaage for S$2.\nIf you want to have intimate conversations among your friends, you might want to choose outdoor seating or a private room as it can get a little noisy indoors. Besides, there’s no better way to ring in the new year than with singing and food, which you can do so wholeheartedly at Sui Yi Gastrobar’s private karaoke room. There’s no time limit to the room and you can sing until the gastrobar closes.\xa0Simply buy one of its dining packages.

The well-known hawker centre is a reliable go-to spot for a range of delicious local food that runs the gamut from Hainanese chicken rice to rojak, sliced fish soup and more.Recently, a few new entrants have renewed buzz for the food centre, such as Nian Nian You Yu, which sells steamed fish sets, and The Pig Organ Soup.Enter another newbie — Danlao, which literally stands for “guy who does eggs” in Mandarin. Opened on Monday (Dec 5), Danlao is a stall that serves scrambled eggs with warm jasmine rice, which you can elevate with a variety of toppings.\xa0It is founded by four young hawkers — Ong Zhen Ning, Jermaine Choo, Howard Ng and Lim Siow Fen — who decided to start Danlao as they wanted to serve quality food at affordable prices. The four of them were acquainted through work, childhood or mutual friends.\xa0Unlike the usual scrambled eggs that tend to have a degree of definition and firmness, Danlao’s version is silkier and creamier. Speaking to HungryGoWhere, one of the co-founders said the stall achieves the desired fluffy texture by expertly managing control of the fire and the doneness of the eggs.They also source quality eggs, based on their experience in the F&B industry. Two of them had worked in specialty egg restaurants, such as American eatery Eggslut.You can choose from five variations of the stall’s signature scrambled eggs with rice. For those who crave a more hearty meal, opt for the char siew scrambled egg rice (S$6), luncheon meat scrambled egg rice (S$5) or chicken cutlet scrambled egg rice (S$6).\xa0The toppings are placed on top of the freshly cooked eggs, which blanket the rice beneath.If you’d like seafood, go for the prawn scrambled egg rice (S$7). A non-meat option, the tomato scrambled egg rice (S$4.50), is also available.For extra zing, dip your scrambled eggs into Danlao’s housemade chilli for that spicy kick.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Junction Westgate opening with promos; will house 23 tenants, including new halal teppanyaki\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHawker Hustlers: Hipster hawker Ray Yeo of Bei-Ing Dimsum Club on reinventing dim sum and his love for all things Japan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also customise your meal by requesting extra toppings at an additional cost.

Located along North Bridge Road in Bugis, Samrang instead offers Indonesian cuisine that’s not commonly found here.\xa0Opened last Saturday (Dec 3), Samrang’s dishes mostly involve beef and chicken.Samrang initially started as a home-based business in February 2021, selling homemade bottled sambal pastes inspired by the Indonesian province of Semarang. The business thrived and the Muslim-owned brand had to shift its operations to a central kitchen from June the same year.From there, it began to introduce other items to its menu, such as the Indonesian-style barbecued short ribs called iga bakar. The dish, packed in a cupboard box, was originally available only for online deliveries.With its new physical store in Bugis, the iga bakar is now available for dine-in, for those who want to taste the juicy meat on the spot.The signature dish uses high-grade Australian beef short ribs that’re marinated with the brand’s special mix. It’s then slow-cooked for 14 hours. Prices start from S$109.90 onwards for a 2kg set.If you prefer a more complete meal, you can try the a la carte iga bakar rice box (S$34.90). Each box comprises a cut of the slow-cooked Australian beef short ribs, a serving of rice, karedok (Indonesian salad) and two pieces of tofu.\xa0You can up its flavour by glazing the tender meat with a housemade Samrang glaze or using it as a dip. There’s also peanut sauce and sambal paste in the box.\xa0\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50% off at picturesque date spots, including Wildseed Cafe at The Alkaff Mansion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther dishes on the menu include Bakso Mercun, a fiery beef-ball bakso that’s good as a side.For dessert, indulge in the restaurant’s popular deep-fried lumpia pisang (S$10.90).

(The Tanjong Pagar store was smaller and served mostly baked goods and coffees.)The cafe held its soft launch in December last year, and since then, images of its now-iconic overturned trees — which take centre stage within the cafe — have been making waves.The eatery hopes to meld art with artisanal sips and bites with this cafe-slash-art-installation. Besides the aforementioned trees, concrete accents, glossy gold surfaces and carefully landscaped shrubbery play off one another — Instagrammable to a T, is what comes to mind.After the feast for the eyes and the camera, turn to Equate’s eclectic menu for some nourishment.There’s an array of sandos, thickly sliced and made with housemade shokupan (Japanese milk bread) and sourdough.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/little-cart-noodle-house/:['Each time I visit Hong Kong, a trip to eat cart noodles is a must. Yes, there’s milk tea, dim sum, and incredible roast meat to be found in the city, but a comforting bowl of cart noodles? That’s an increasingly rare find even in Hong Kong, since the government crackdown on street food in recent years.\xa0The remaining cart-noodle hawkers have since moved to small eateries: Foodies flock from afar to Wing Kee in Causeway Bay — known for its greasy meat broth and famous pig’s-blood curds — or to Yat Sing in Prince Edward for its milder, clearer radish soup.Having returned from Hong Kong just this month made this visit to Little Cart Noodle House especially exciting. I’d been craving Cantonese flavours the entire week.\xa0Sure, I could be sorely disappointed, but do you know how difficult it is to find cart noodles here?Little Cart Noodle House is a famous cart-noodle brand that’s been operating in the neon city since 1960 — the original being a tiny unit in Wan Chai where hungry diners had to stand as they slurp up lunch.\xa0Thankfully, its sparkling new venture at Far East Square in Singapore is a lot more comfortable.While I’ve never dined at its big brother, the food at Little Cart Noodle House is comparable to some of the better ones I’ve tried in Hong Kong. The 28 toppings available are not out of the ordinary, and I presume the restaurant serves a lot more — it’s not uncommon to see over 40 items at some shops — at its original store.You can go for classics such as marinated chicken wings and beef balls. But there are also innards and more exotic toppings such as beef tripe and pork skin, in keeping with the spirit of Hong Kong cart noodles.Plus, prices are fairly reasonable for a restaurant in the CBD — an average bowl with four toppings will set you back around S$13 — and the portions are quite decent.\xa0Choose from dry or soup versions with a wide selection of noodles (from S$2.50): Yellow noodles, thin egg noodles, thick or thin rice noodles, hor fun, or Nissin instant noodles. I suppose one could order rice, but have some decency — we’re at a noodle house!For our first bowl, we went for thick yellow noodles in soup. The broth is somewhat mellower and less greasy than expected, but it’s what lets the flavourful stock shine through, with a hint of sweetness from boiled radishes.What’s interesting is that you can also select your preferred level of spice. Its slightly tangy chilli packs a mean punch, so you’ll want to mix it in a little at a time.The beef brisket (S$3.80) at Little Cart Noodle House is absolutely delicious, soft from being boiled for what must be hours until almost gelatinous. There are some chicken midwings (S$2.80), lightly marinated and very tender, though I wish they came with the wing tips — it turns out they’re sold separately as another topping.Have you tried Hong Kong curry? Rather than the coconutty slop Singaporeans are used to, the version here tastes a lot closer to the umami-rich Japanese curry, albeit less sweet. This makes the curry Fuzhou balls (S$2.80) one of my favourite toppings at Little Cart Noodle House, along with some fish roe balls (S$2.60).\xa0I also got a braised egg (S$1.50), because can noodle soup truly be complete without one? The one here is rather savoury with hints of cinnamon and star anise.You can complete your cart-noodle order with a la carte dishes such as curry squid and fried shishamo, but we opted for the beancurd skin roll (S$5.80), featuring fishcake that’s first cooked in a superior broth before being fried till crispy. I couldn’t get enough of this.We also tried the dry version, with thin egg noodles akin to the ones used in wanton mee. There’s something about Hong Kong noodles that’s just a bit springier and lighter.\xa0For toppings, Little Cart Noodle House has a tasty fried pork chop (S$2.80) that’s a bit on the leaner side but still quite juicy. If you like beef tripe (S$2.80), the store does a good one that’s slightly chewy and free of any organ flavour. Oh, and that large and meaty chicken feet (S$2.20) — dig in for all that collagen goodness.Vegetables are usually an afterthought when it comes to cart noodles, but if you’re looking for some healthy eating, you won’t go wrong with the boiled radishes (S$1.80) and kang kong (S$1.80), cooked in the same hearty broth served with the noodles.Speaking of the soup, it’s not so salty or stodgy that you’ll have to drink lots of water, though I still got an iced milk tea (S$3.80). It’s frothy and mildly sweet — the way I like it.This might be the first review I’ve done where I’ve nothing to complain about. If I had to nitpick, it’d be the chicken feet looking scarily fresh like it’s just been chopped off. But that’s just a “me problem”, isn’t it?With a steady queue seen outside during lunch hours, it seems the store’s doing well — for good reason. It’s had more than 60 years to perfect its recipe after all.Is it conducive to conversation? The restaurant can get very loud during lunchtime.Is a reservation necessary?

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/underrated-stalls-senja-hawker-centre/:['It’s been slightly more than a month since the long-awaited Senja Hawker Centre opened in Bukit Panjang.\xa0The Kopitiam-operated hawker centre is home to 28 stalls, many of which are Michelin-recommended or heritage brands.\xa0While much has been said about its bevy of famous stalls, such as Michelin Plate Heng Gi Goose and Duck Rice and Michelin Bib Gourmand recipient Shi Hui Yuan, what of its other, lesser-known neighbours?We visited some of the other stalls there, including a few vegetarian and halal options, to see if Senja Hawker Centre is worth the hype. These are our top five picks.Senja Hawker Centre, 02-26, 2 Senja Close\nOpen: Wednesday to Monday (10.30am to 7.30pm)\xa0Ah Lock Kitchen is helmed by hawker-preneur Lee Lock Teng, who opened his first stall at Yishun Park Hawker Centre, Ah Lock Tofu, at the age of 24.Like his first stall, Ah Lock Kitchen offers a modern take on Hakka yong tau foo (a dish consisting primarily of tofu filled with ground meat mixture or fish paste) by presenting it as a rice bowl.Its signature Hakka tofu bowl (S$6) comes with handmade deep-fried tofu, meatballs, stir-fried long beans and mani cai (sweet leaf vegetable) on a bed of short-grain rice. The combination was topped with seaweed, diced tofu and a special mayonnaise blend.\xa0Apart from the mayonnaise, which we felt was a tad unnecessary, the ingredients blended well together and were flavourful. It made for a light meal, and we would recommend this, but only if you like salad bowls for lunch. Also available is a Hakka tofu bowl\xa0(S$7.50) and Hakka black noodle dish (S$6).While its other outlets are halal-certified, the Senja Hawker Centre outlet is still in the midst of applying for its halal certification. As there are only four Indian-Muslim food stalls at the hawker centre now, the addition of Ah Lock Kitchen would be much-welcomed.What to order: Hakka tofu bowl (S$6)Senja Hawker Centre, 02-19, 2 Senja Close\nOpen: Monday to Sunday, closed on alternate Wednesdays (6am to 9pm)\xa0After witnessing the owners of the neighbouring stall, Haji Subuhani Family Stall, order a plate of chicken nasi briyani (S$6) for themselves, I was influenced to follow suit.\xa0I didn’t regret my decision. The owners of the stall were friendly and patient as I debated on what to order.\xa0For the price of S$6, we were gifted a heaping portion of rice, two pieces of keropok (deep-fried crackers), a bowl of curry and a large piece of chicken. If you prefer your briyani to be easier on the spices, this would be a suitable meal option.\xa0While there, we saw a handful of people ordering the rojak (ingredients start from 90 cents). Given its popularity, it’s worth a try in our books. If you find yourself at Senja Hawker Centre in the morning (before 11am) or in the evening (after 5pm), be sure to try its prata (S$1.10), too.What to order: Nasi briyani (S$6), rojak (ingredients start from 90 cents)Senja Hawker Centre, 02-03, 2 Senja Close\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (6am to 2pm)\xa0Made popular by the owner’s resemblance to Taiwanese-born actress Vivian Lai, 97 Nasi Lemak was first established at Old Airport Food Centre where it steadily grew in fame.\xa0Our favourite thing about the set was its price. At S$3.50, the chicken wing set was comparatively affordable. Our second favourite thing was the runny egg.\xa0Sadly, the ingredients didn’t stand out. The chicken wing lacked crunch but was reminiscent of home-cooked chicken wings one ate as a child.That being said, we enjoyed the subtle fragrance of the coconut rice and the sweetness of the sambal chilli. Combining the ingredients together yielded a satisfying meal, and for that price? We won’t complain.\xa097 Nasi Lemak is also in the midst of getting its halal certification.\xa0What to eat: Chicken wing set (S$3.50), chicken katsudon set (S$4.10)\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Junction Westgate opening with promos; will house 23 tenants, including new halal teppanyaki\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHawker Hustlers: Hipster hawker Ray Yeo of Bei-Ing Dimsum Club on reinventing dim sum and his love for all things Japan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSenja Hawker Centre, 02-02, 2 Senja Close\nOpen: Thursday to Tuesday (10.30am to 7pm)\xa0When an eatery — Yong Feng Ji Chicken Rice, in this case — claims on its menu that it has the perfect chicken set (S$4.50), you pretty much have to try it.\xa0We agree that it’s a hearty set meal comprising chicken, fragrant chicken rice, oyster sauce vegetables, achar and soup. The portion of chicken given was also generous, though we can’t say the same for the rice.\xa0\xa0Was it perfect? Not quite. But if you’ve got a serious chicken rice craving, it’ll do nicely. The chicken was tender and flavourful, and the rice wasn’t too oily.\xa0One of the more affordable stalls at Senja Hawker Centre, Yong Feng Ji Chicken Rice is definitely value for money. If you’re on an even tighter budget, try its minced chicken porridge (S$2.80).What to order: Perfect chicken set menu (S$4.50)Senja Hawker Centre, 02-15, 2 Senja Close\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (6.30am to 8pm)\xa0Ba Fang Vegetarian caught our eye when we saw an abundance of dishes lined up behind its display case. From eggplant drenched in gravy to curry vegetables, the stall had it all.\xa0We opted for the bee hoon set (S$3), which consisted of white bee hoon, tau pok (tofu puff), zai er (fried beancurd skin) and white cabbage. The bee hoon, though lacking slightly in flavour, was moist and served as a good companion to the other ingredients.\xa0Special mention goes to everyone’s favourite part of the vegetarian bee hoon – the zai er. While the individual pieces given were a little small, the zai er was fried to a satisfying crisp and had a salty finish. We were resisting the urge to buy a full box of it.\xa0What to order: Bee hoon set (S$3), extra serving of zai er (S$1)\xa0For more content on hawker centres, read about the launch of Bukit Canberra Hawker Centre and opening of Blk 216 Bedok Food Centre and Market.You can book a ride to Senja Hawker Centre.\xa0Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/ngee-fou-hakka-ampang-yong-tou-fou/:['Every morning, at a time when most people are sound asleep, a group of family members are already up bright and early, briskly preparing for the day ahead.They are the Pangs, who have been running the 928 Ngee Fou Hakka (Ampang) Yong Tou Fou stall along Upper Thomson for more than 50 years. Traditional Ampang-style yong tau foo presents diners with a plate of fried and boiled items doused with a black bean sauce.Come 5am, the whole family is up, with each member easing into their roles like clockwork: Some work on prepping ingredients, while others plug away on the store’s signature sweet sauce and chilli sauce.\xa0Ngee Fou used to handmake its tofu until recently when its tofu machine stopped working and could not be repaired. These days, it orders them from a supplier.\xa0The tofu is stuffed with meat or fish, which is derived by painstakingly scraping meat from each fish and turning it into a paste. Once stuffed, they are then fried to crispy perfection.By 9am, a slew of dishes are ready to go. The coffee shop Ngee Fou’s in — which also has a noodle stall and a drinks stall — is nondescript but functional.Instead of having diners pick their own ingredients, Ngee Fou mixes and matches them on their behalf, according to the party size. A server heaps ingredients, such as fried tofu, fishballs, fried beancurd skin, stuffed bittergourd, quail eggs and kang kong, onto a plate before drenching these in a thick gravy.The order is served with bowls of warm rice and saucers of chilli and sweet sauce.Elaine Pang, 31, who also manages the drinks stall and helps with other areas when the stall gets busy, manages Ngee Fou’s administrative matters. Her brother, who doesn’t wish to be named, works there as well.Both of them learnt the ropes from their father and other relatives. Their father, who wanted to be known only as Mr Pang, 60, is one of four siblings who took over the stall from their parents.\xa0928 Ngee Fou Hakka (Ampang) Yong Tou Fou was established in July 1971, when Pang’s grandparents took over the business from a family friend who decided to stop because his wife had passed away.\xa0The original shop used to be a standalone store before the area was developed into the present line of shophouses and housing. Pang’s grandparents ran it together, but their 11 children took turns to help with various tasks.After Pang’s grandfather died in 1994, her grandmother ran it on her own until sometime in the 2000s, when four of her children — including Pang’s father — took over.Pang’s generation, too, grew up helping out at the store, which has seen several iterations. It moved a few times but always remained in the same area. Its current site is its fourth, and family members who work there live on the second storey.Even as decades passed, the Pangs remained steadfast in their conviction of serving the same plate of food — year after year.\xa0Asked why, Pang said yong tau foo is an essential part of the Hakka tradition. Not only does it help the family stay connected to their roots, they are also determined to serve comforting dishes that evoke nostalgia and encourage people to keep returning for more. Helming a food business has its challenges, including the usual high manpower costs, labour shortages and rising food costs.As Ngee Fou’s handmade ingredients entail a labour-intensive food preparation process, the Pangs feel these challenges most keenly. Their staff are made up of mostly family members as well as some part-timers and close friends.In the earlier days, Pang’s Chinese-educated father, uncles and aunties struggled to serve English-speaking customers. “They were all forced to go for English classes by my grandparents,” Pang said.Other challenges include limited parking space, as Ngee Fou is nestled in an area where there’s only a narrow street of parallel spots. The construction of the Thomson-East Coast MRT line also saw road closures and hoarding, which affected business, said Pang.Thankfully, the opening of Springleaf MRT station in August 2021 and the relaxation of Covid-19 controls in April 2022 have led to a modest increase in footfall, she added.Regular patrons of that area may notice another stall nearby — Beng Cheng Hakka Yong Tau Fu — selling similar fare.When asked what the relationship between the two shops was, Pang said one of their aunts started the other stall.Despite the Pangs’ devotion to tradition, it’s undeniable that they’ve had to move with the times as the society progresses. The older folks are looking to hand over the business to the next generation, although Pang says there’s no clear plan on who will take over.For now, they’ve revamped their order and queue management system, and even started accepting PayNow as a payment mode.\xa0These new processes took a while for the older generation to accept, she acknowledged.\xa0“Because (the old ways have) worked for them for so many years, (they’re) sure it’ll continue to work.”The Pangs also tweaked their recipe recently to suit changing consumer tastes and introduced individual sets to cater to those who prefer not to eat from a communal plate. “It used to be saltier,” Pang said.Some things don’t change, however. Ngee Fou prefers working with suppliers it’s developed a relationship with for years, as the family feel this is the best way to keep the quality of their food consistent.Pang added that her relatives are content to let things remain as they are for now and she does not foresee the brand opening more outlets anytime soon.Describing her relatives, Pang said: “They’ll always say: ‘You can never finish earning money, so if you’ve enough to get by, why not just get by peacefully.’ That’s their motto.”\xa0Joy Fang contributed to this article.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/the-flying-pan/:['It’s a two-man team at The Flying Pan, a small Western stall in Hougang that caught the attention of Singapore’s foodies in late November last year.Today, it serves around 300 plates a day — including 100 or so of its signature chicken chops — for the low, low price of S$5.50 for a main course and a choice of three sides.It’s probably one of the cheapest offerings by a Western-food stall on the island.Vicky Ho, 23, is younger than most hawkers out there but is the backbone of this coffee-shop stall.When the orders come in, Ho runs point on plating and packing takeaway orders, while her husband Sean Leong, 38, fires up the grill.It’s a delicate dance in its kitchen; the space is narrow and shared with a wanton mee stall.\xa0The couple count themselves lucky that their neighbour wraps up operations at 5.45pm — just before The Flying Pan’s evening peak hour hits — and graciously allows them free rein over the space.Born in April 2021, in the thick of Covid-19, the Flying Pan marks a return of sorts for Ho and Leong.Leong had cut his teeth at fine-dining resto Ristorante da Valentino and ran another Western stall at Ci Yuan Community Club before the pandemic struck.The stall’s name comes from a chef with whom Leong apprenticed.“He liked to throw the frying pan whenever he was upset with the food or the staff. I thought that’d make a good name,” he jokes. The couple always loved Western food but found that it could cost quite a bit — even in coffee shops.“When you go to a coffee shop, the Western food can be the most expensive (cuisine),” says Ho. “We thought: ‘Why not sell the food more cheaply?’”“We may earn less, but that way, more people will be able to enjoy our food.”Looking around the coffee shop it calls home, The Flying Pan’s prices are on a par with those of its neighbours, which range from S$3 to S$7 a plate.This means profits are thin, though.When asked about rising ingredient prices, Ho says they were hit hardest in late 2021, when costs shot up drastically.During the worst of it, the duo were on the verge of raising prices to manage costs.“We were considering it for two, three months, but in the end, we didn’t. We just didn’t want to.”This was possible only because costs dropped gradually after the initial spike, says Ho.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Junction Westgate opening with promos; will house 23 tenants, including new halal teppanyaki\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHawker Hustlers: Hipster hawker Ray Yeo of Bei-Ing Dimsum Club on reinventing dim sum and his love for all things Japan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlates start from S$5.50 for a choice of protein and three sides.Here, you can choose from a range of meats for mains — chicken, pork and fish — with optional top-ups for more premium options such as ribeye. Next, take your pick from several carbs and greens, including aglio pasta, mashed potatoes, garden veggies and fried mini-buns.The chicken chop is a crowd favourite, but Ho is partial to the pork chop and ribeye.If there’s one thing the couple are proud of, it’s that the proteins are cooked on the spot instead of being par-cooked, as is common at many eateries. Grilling the meats fresh ensures they stay juicy and moist, and prevents certain meats from becoming stringy.This, however, means customers may have to wait up to 45 minutes for their meal.This doesn’t seem to deter many diners, though. The stall sees a steady stream of patrons and takeaway orders, which continues until they sell out at about 8pm.Before the stall went viral, business was slow, says Ho, attributing it to the resumption of international travel in early 2022.During this time, she managed the stall by herself, while Leong drove a private-hire vehicle to supplement their income and support their three children, aged five, seven and 15.It was only in late November 2022, when a regular customer, Andrew Tang, wrote about their plight on the Can Eat! Hawker Food group on Facebook, that business started picking up — and quite suddenly, too.The sudden influx of customers caught Ho unawares, and the couple took a few days to adjust their processes and iron out the kinks.When HungryGoWhere took a peek into their kitchen, they now have the process down pat, working with clockwork efficiency to turn out plate after plate. When things get hectic, Ho’s 15-year-old stepson, aunt and cousin will help out on occasion.Ho says The Flying Pan may be moving soon, though, since the current space is a tad too confined for its needs and its lease will be up in April.\xa0The couple are still mulling over their next steps, but Leong hopes to expand the menu to include more pasta dishes, pizzas and the like.For more content on young hawkers, read about pasta eatery Nudedles.4 and Peranakan stall Nyonya Pok Pok Kay.\xa0\xa0The Flying Pan is on the GrabFood delivery service.

She tells us about some of her go-to spots — from kid-friendly places to date-night-worthy eateries.Popiah! During family gatherings, my grandma used to prepare all the ingredients and we’d have a huge DIY party with my cousins.\xa0Fortune Food has a great home-delivery party pack that’s similar to my childhood experience, so I love having that spread with my cousins — with the addition of our offspring now!These days, we eat at conveyor-belt sushi restaurants a lot, because the kids love them! Genki Sushi and Sushiro are our go-to places.For special occasions with my husband, we always try different Japanese omakase restaurants.\xa0For family occasions, we always love Summer Pavilion at The Ritz-Carlton because of chef Cheung Siu Kong.

I’m intrigued by the science behind this form of cuisine.\xa0I remember having my first mango sphere at a buffet once and I absolutely loved it. I even Googled how to make it. I’m interested to see how our taste buds can be excited!I recently tried A5 wagyu at this restaurant called Wagatomo and it was absolutely delicious!

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/my-must-eats-chee-soon-juan/:['My Must-Eats is a HungryGoWhere series featuring Singapore’s public figures and their favourite food haunts. This week, we speak to Chee Soon Juan, opposition politician and owner of cafe Orange & Teal.Singaporean politician Chee Soon Juan is known for his vocal views in the political arena. But he surprised many in 2021 when he announced that he would venture into a new territory — food.The secretary-general of the Singapore Democratic Party said in a Facebook post then that he would be opening a cafe, Orange & Teal, with his wife Huang Chih Mei.\xa0The homely venue at Rochester Mall boasts comfy couches and bookshelves brimming with books. It serves mostly Western fare, such as a creamy Tuscan butter salmon pasta and wine-infused, slow-grilled beef cheeks.\xa0A year later, in August 2022, he opened a second outlet at Marina Square.Dr Chee, who has a doctorate in neuropsychology, hopes both outlets would serve as cosy venues that foster conversation and an appreciation for the arts.Speaking to him, you’d find that Dr Chee is down-to-earth and simple, with a love for comforting food and dishes that evoke a sense of nostalgia.\xa0He talks to us about some of his favourites.Babi pongteh. I remember helping mum slice the pork, after which she would slow-braise it in fermented soy. And being Baba Nyonya, she’d cook the dish especially for Chinese New Year, which makes it all the more poignant for me.\xa0The other is a stir-fried honey soy minced pork with lots of white pepper. I try to recreate this for my kids — with limited success, of course.It’s a bit like that food critic Anton Ego in Ratatouille when he takes a forkful of the dish — namesake for the movie — and has this dramatic flashback to his childhood when his mother cooked the simple peasant dish for him. Smell and taste have that strange effect of conjuring up images in our subconscious.\xa0There are few places that manage to evoke this feeling in me. For the honey soy minced pork stir-fry, it was a small eatery at Jalan Leban, Upper Thomson, where the Singapore Democratic Party office used to be. It served this dish, but is no longer in operation.\xa0For the babi pongteh, it was at Ivins Peranakan Restaurant that specialises in Peranakan cuisine. \xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Like most Singaporeans, it’s the ubiquitous hawker centre — no particular one.\xa0I frequent the one closest to where I live, at Lorong 5 Toa Payoh. There’s one stall operated by an elderly couple that serves rice with the usual sides such as potato, tau pok and curry chicken. It’s one of the less-patronised stalls — better to give them some business — but the food is simple yet good.\xa0 Of late, however, it’s been Orange & Teal — which I started — where I go for more than just the food. I’m also the official waiter, busboy and dishwasher there.\xa0 Hands down — white rice. Almost anything goes with white rice, doesn’t it? Take the honey soy minced pork dish. Add a runny fried egg or two, and you’ve got yourself a self-made Michelin-starred meal. The withdrawal symptoms get quite strong after a few days of pizzas and burgers.I haven’t come across any place overseas that gives a taste of home. The closest ones that come to mind are a couple of street food places in Taipei, especially the breakfast items such as youtiao (fried dough), or shao bing (crispy flatbread) with dou jiang (soy milk).\xa0\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Junction Westgate opening with promos; will house 23 tenants, including new halal teppanyaki\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHawker Hustlers: Hipster hawker Ray Yeo of Bei-Ing Dimsum Club on reinventing dim sum and his love for all things Japan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xa0The simple, unpretentious street foods that are representative of local cuisines, such as Mediterranean and Middle Eastern ones. They sound exotic. I have yet to venture there and would love to try the food there.The beef cheeks and baby-back ribs at Orange & Teal. Just ask chef Anabel — talk about shameless plugs.\xa0I also enjoy butter crab with fried mantou (buns).\xa0I’ve had this at several eateries at various hawker centres, but the one that sticks in my mind is the first time I ate it, which was many years ago. I can’t remember exactly which one, but it was somewhere in Hougang.\xa0This dish has to have a thick, creamy sauce.

Then, last year, he discovered he had stage one nose cancer after a regular eye check for glaucoma.The Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Transport and Sustainability and the Environment had to undergo radiation therapy, and as a result, lost some weight. Thankfully, Baey has been cancer-free since April and soaking up life’s little moments after his health scare.A peek at his Instagram page shows Baey cheerfully continuing his constituency activities as well as keeping up with his fitness routines and enjoying good food. For instance, he celebrated the news of being cancer-free by having a “nice couple dinner” with his wife.\xa0And, yes, the 52-year-old still takes selfies.We talked to him about some of his favourite meals and food haunts.It has to be the humble da pau (big steamed bun). I remember eating one at my late grandfather’s house in Hougang. As a young kid, the bun just seemed humongous and there was so much to enjoy!\xa0It brought back memories earlier this year when my taste buds were affected due to my radiation treatment. I have since regained my taste buds, but the first time I discovered that I lost my sense of taste was when I was eating a da pau for breakfast.\xa0I enjoy hawker food and the area I frequent most is Tampines N4 Neighbourhood Centre.\xa0I am there for breakfast almost every Wednesday.

The soup is just so rich and delicious.\xa0The next generation has taken over the running of the stall from the original owner, Mr Lee.

The last time I had steamed egg was in a Japanese restaurant, but I cannot recall which one it was.Anywhere that serves Thai.I like Yhingthai Palace Restaurant on Purvis Street. I recently ordered its \u200b\u200bcoconut pandan cake — with layers of fresh pandan cake, fresh young coconut flesh in coconut cream, and a layer of fresh cream — and that was heavenly.You can’t really go too wrong with Thai food. Even the “baddest” Thai food is kind of okay. My go-to Thai dish is green curry.Satay. I love chicken, pork and beef satay. I had the most amazing beef satay at Changi Village recently, at Tang Tea House (Changi). And pork — I will do anything for good pork satay.

His victory over India’s Srikanth Kidambi won him fans across the sporting world.This year, he ascended the world ranking to third place, making him the highest-ranked men’s player in the country’s history. He was also recently crowned Sportsman of the Year at the Singapore Sports Awards.And, this week, Loh became the first Singaporean man to make the BWF world tour finals, which will take place in Bangkok, Thailand in December.Even though he has his sights on the world stage, the fresh-faced athlete’s favourite fare is closer to home.We catch up with the busy 25-year-old to find out what dishes he’s craving.Kaya toast with two half-boiled eggs! This has been my favourite breakfast since I was young. Two slices of bread toasted to an even brown and generously layered with kaya and butter, drenching the crunchy corner of the kaya butter toast into my half-boiled eggs — that first bite brings me back to my childhood every time.There’s a coffee shop by where we have our training, near the OCBC Arena. It’s just a regular coffee shop, but the uncle makes my toasts just right.I like trying new places. The food scene is so lively in Singapore, and there are always new ones to check out!The one I go to most frequently is the same coffee shop for my kaya toast and half-boiled eggs. When I’m back in Singapore, I’m probably there at least once a week.\xa0As I am answering these, I’ve just been craving mee pok — the hit of tanginess from the vinegar and chilli from that first bite, and when they have good fishballs. It’s not easy to find mee pok overseas.If I had to choose one, mee pok is one of the most Singaporean dishes I like.\xa0This I don’t actually travel far for — my usual mee pok shop is a five-minute walk from my place. Their hours are consistent and they’re always open when I’m craving one.\xa0There are many cuisines I have yet to try. But I do like steaks, and a nicely marbled Kobe beef in Japan is very high up on my wishlist.\xa0Before this, I was never a fan of beetroot, but the carpaccio di rapa rosse I had at Il Borro Tuscan Bistro in Dubai was amazing.It had goat cheese and pistachios on it, and the combination of textures and flavours was actually really good. I wouldn’t call myself a convert yet, but I might just start trying more beetroot dishes next time!AuthorYawen has written a lot about food in her previous roles as the editor-in-chief of Wine & Dine and later as the associate digital editor of The Peak.

The fact that it has limited opening hours also makes it that much more enticing.\xa0\xa0If you’ve never been there, you can’t go wrong with the classic prawn mee (from S$6.50). While the presentation of each bowl is basic, the prawns served were sweet and thick with a bouncy texture – undeniable evidence of their freshness.\xa0\xa0The soup served with the noodles was a perfect accompaniment — it’s sweet, with a hint of saltiness.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/nagai-hokkaido-cuisine/:['If you’re on the lookout for quality Japanese kaiseki cuisine at affordable prices, the new Nagai Hokkaido Cuisine is dishing out some wallet-friendly options.Having been around for almost 30 years, the restaurant’s original Sapporo store is a storied one. It is best known for being a favoured food haunt of politicians and celebrities, including Japan’s Imperial family. Its launch in Singapore in December 2022 marks its first-ever foray beyond Hokkaido’s borders. At its helm is chef Makoto Nagai, 42, who had been heading up the original restaurant; his father, Shinichiro Nagai, founded the eatery back in 1993.Nagai is very centrally situated at Suntec City’s Eat At Seven Japanese food enclave, which also plays host to popular joints such as Tendon Kohaku and Una Una.The setting is quiet and cosy, perfect as a spot for dates or business lunches, too.\xa0Chef Nagai prides himself on serving up incredibly fresh ingredients, some of which are specially flown in from Hokkaido.Those looking to indulge should go for Nagai’s omakase menus, which are its specialty. Diners can choose from four menus at varying price points — S$98, S$138, S$198 and S$380.HungryGoWhere tried the six-course S$198 menu, comprising an appetiser, its signature hand-carved ice plate sashimi, a grilled dish, a chef’s special, a main course and a dessert.\xa0As is common in kaiseki cuisine, the exact dishes will vary depending on the season, so you can be sure that you are served ingredients that were harvested in their prime.For example, the sashimi course we were served included hirame (flounder), botan ebi (shrimp), as well as kazunoko (herring roe), a seasonal fish that is consumed as part of the new year festivities in Japan.The dishes have one thing in common, though — they feature some of Hokkaido’s best-loved food products. \n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50% off at picturesque date spots, including Wildseed Cafe at The Alkaff Mansion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHawker Hustlers: Hipster hawker Ray Yeo of Bei-Ing Dimsum Club on reinventing dim sum and his love for all things Japan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe grilled dish we were served — a sashimi-grade awabi (abalone) — was marinated in sake and Hokkaido butter before being carefully grilled and plated. As did the dessert — a comforting bowl of warm sweet potato and Hokkaido milk ice cream.For a more conservative meal, diners can take their pick from 15 lunch set menus, comprising a main course, chawanmushi (steamed egg), miso soup and pickles.\xa0For its lowest price point of S$28, diners have a choice of four mains: Yakitori (grilled chicken skewers), chicken tempura, grilled saba, and tempura.Otherwise, more options are available from S$35 to S$48, including a grilled hokke (mackerel) and sashimi set with wagyu roast beef (S$36).Fans of sashimi will love its decadent premium kaisen don set (S$45), featuring ikura (salmon roe), uni (sea urchin) and botan ebi served atop fluffy granules of Japanese rice.Book a ride to Nagai Hokkaido Cuisine.Suntec City Tower 1, 03-314, Eat at Seven, 3 Temasek Boulevard\nNearest MRT station: Promenade\nOpens: Mondays to Sundays (11.30am to 3pm, 5.30pm to 10pm)Suntec City Tower 1, 03-314, Eat at Seven, 3 Temasek Boulevard\nNearest MRT station: Promenade\nOpens: Mondays to Sundays (11.30am to 3pm, 5.30pm to 10pm)AuthorJia-En has worn several hats in her career — first writing TV scripts, then food and lifestyle stories at Wine & Dine.

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/haig-road-putu-piring/:['Malay putu piring is delicious and hard to come by. I remember only a few outlets from my childhood, many of which do not exist any more.Putu piring is a steamed cake made from rice flour. It encases a filling of pure gula melaka (palm sugar) and served topped with freshly steamed grated coconut tinged with a little salt. There is a Chinese version of the snack called tu tu kueh, which is also very delicious. However, it is firmer in texture than the Malay version, which is one of my favourite childhood snacks.I was told by my Malay friends that the putu piring stall known as Haig Road Putu Piring in Geylang has the best putu piring. One late afternoon, I made the effort to head down to the stall and I’m certainly glad I did so.Upon arrival, the stall was bustling with several neatly-attired women working busily to serve the long queue in front of them. They efficiently steamed batches of these white, fluffy cakes throughout the day, and once ready, wrapped them in brown paper before handing them over to the customer.When I finally got my order, I immediately opened the packet and was greeted by an aromatic whiff of delicious pandan leaves and steamed rice flour. Coupled with the sweet aroma of the gula melaka, the cakes smelled absolutely divine and I couldn’t wait to take a bite.They are delicious. The rice flour exterior is light and fluffy, while the sweet sugary core instantly melts in my mouth. Everything would have been perfect, if not for the slight tang of the brown paper wrapping, which clings to the cakes.I later found out from owner Noraishah Mohamad Hashim that the process of making putu piring is a tedious one.First, the rice flour has to be carefully mixed with the right amount of water to keep it fluffy, otherwise it would clump up too much. Next is a two-hour process of steaming the rice flour with layers of pandan leaves.After that, the flour needs to be cooked for another five hours before mixing in salt water. Finally, to get the flour ready for the actual steaming, it needs to be sieved into fine grains to give it that light and airy texture.Gula melaka is then added as you mould the flour into shape. That’s a lot of work at a really great price of S$1 for three cakes!Tristar Complex, 01-02, 970 Geylang Road\nNearest MRT station: Paya Lebar\nOpen:\xa0Daily (10.30am to 9pm)Tristar Complex, 01-02, 970 Geylang Road\nNearest MRT station: Paya Lebar\nOpen:\xa0Daily (10.30am to 9pm)Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

The eatery offers quality French fare — inspired by Haikal’s expertise in French cuisine — served within a casual setting.Step inside the 40-seat bistro and you will find a soothing interior with muted pastel shades, recessed arches, wood furnishings and a terrazzo bar. The set-up offers a cosy, intimate setting for guests to dine and have meaningful conversations.At Alkove, early risers will be met with the warm, yeasty aroma from the freshly baked bread and viennoiseries.\xa0Its le petit dejeuner (French for breakfast) menu boasts specially created items such as the baklava croissant (S$5.80) and cardamom kouign-amann (S$5.80). Fresh loaves of sourdough, baguette and pain de mie (French for white bread) are available for both dine-in and takeaways.There are several sandwiches on offer, but a standout is the croque monsieur (S$16.90). A classic sandwich loved by the French, this dish comprises a generous serving of thinly sliced Bayonne ham sandwiched between two pieces of warm brioche and melted, oozing comte cheese.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Feuds: Saizeriya vs Milan Shokudo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatisserie Cle brings its well-crafted pastries to new River Valley flagship for fifth anniversary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15 best Holland Village cafes for the ’gram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlkove also serves tartines for its brunch fare, such as the smoked duck tartine (S$18.90).

The thinly sliced green apple scattered on top lends a refreshing sweet-and-sour note to the dish.You can pair your tartine with its range of coffee, tea or cold-pressed juices. The coffee menu was created in collaboration with the renowned Cata Coffee, while the teas were curated by Ette Tea.Come lunchtime, guests can indulge in hearty dishes such as the chicken vin blanc (S$25) and wagyu onglet steak frites (S$32).\xa0The onglet cut, which hangs beneath the diaphragm of the animal close to its flank, is traditionally more flavourful and tender, making it a popular choice in French cuisine.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/missus-cafe/:['EDITOR’S NOTE: Missus closed on Dec 31, 2022.There’s a tantalising scene in the 2014 film Chef, where the main character, played by the incredible Jon Favreau, makes his son a grilled cheese sandwich for breakfast. He drizzles oil on a griddle, spreads it around with sliced brioche, then stacks on three types of cheese.\xa0After a few rounds of flipping, he sandwiches them together and plates the sizzling golden-brown bread and oozing cheese. The kid says “it’s good”, but I’m convinced he was served the best cheese toastie to exist in movie history.You see, excellent grilled cheeses don’t come around often in Singapore. Park Bench Deli on Amoy Street does a decent one with blue cheese and pickled onions, while Micro Bakery in Katong ups the ante with ricotta and raclette, but really, these are exceptions.\xa0Started by former actor and musician Syarif Ahmad and his wife Malaque Mahdaly, Missus joins a legion of cafes that opened on Hamilton Road this year, including La Levain, The Lunar Rabbit Boulangerie, and most recently, Brawn & Brains Coffee.\xa0While not officially halal-certified, it’s worth noting that this is likely the only Muslim-owned cafe in the vicinity.\xa0The story is that the cafe comes inspired by the owners’ travels around Australia, which might have influenced the hand-painted Victorian-style arch at the entrance and vintage furniture pieces strewn about the space.Cheese lover or otherwise, it’s a go. The grilled cheese is undoubtedly the star here — peek at the cafe’s Instagram page and you’ll be greeted with food porn-esque videos to get you salivating. Grilled cheese aside, the all-day menu, desserts and daily bakes carry their own weight, too.\xa0The folks here have clearly put some thought into the execution of their dishes, which, combined with friendly service, a pretty ambience and fun pop songs, make a winning formula.\xa0Missus offers six flavours of grilled cheese, and though it’s arguably well within my skill set to finish everything, a prior health scare would claim that it’s possible to have too much cheese.\xa0We zoomed in on the signatures, starting with the Missus Melt (S$17.90) — a fully loaded four-cheese blend with truffle pate.\xa0The allure of grilled cheese lies as much in its simplicity as the Instagrammable “cheese pull”, and this hits the spot perfectly. Melted cheese oozes from the sides and crisps around the bread crusts, with a light truffle flavour coming through to cut past the richness.\xa0There’s a side of roasted garlic tomato soup (a tad salty) as well as sweet-chilli tapioca chips (incredibly tasty) from Max’s Farm, which you can also buy by the packet at S$2.90 a pop.Have you ever had masala dosa? That wonderfully aromatic blend of spiced potatoes and coriander is cleverly combined in the Slumdog Grillionaire (S$19), which proves once again that potato and cheese make an invincible combination.\xa0The coriander pesto marries the two, and the tomato tamarind chutney on the side is especially thoughtful, adding sweetness, spice and a whole lot of acidity to complement the heaviness of the cheese.A selection of 12 to 15 bakes is on display each day, from sweet cheese rolls and cheese onion scones to potato leek focaccia and kaya butter coconut brioche.\xa0It’d be wise to head there early, as only a few options were left by mid-afternoon, leaving me with the sticky pecan bun (S$5.50). Not that I was complaining — the problem with them, loaded with melted brown sugar and pecans on top, is that they’re irresistible.\xa0I imagine the rest of the bakes are just as good.For dessert, we ordered what appeared to be the most interesting thing on the menu, the Baked Kataifi Cheese (S$14).\xa0Could the magnificence of a kataifi — that saccharine Greek sweet with a fine vermicelli-like pastry — really be replicated like this? The original syrup in its Mediterranean counterpart is replaced by an alluring rose-infused saffron cream, with the crispy pastry giving way to melted cheese in the middle. My answer is a firm yes.On the beverage front, you’ll find specialty coffee brewed using beans roasted by State of Affairs, another Muslim-friendly cafe along Upper Thomson Road. There are also milkshakes and chocolate drinks.\xa0A generous double-shot Iced Oat White can be had for S$7, and I enjoyed the nutty fruitiness of the espresso paired with the sweetness of the milk (Oatside, of course). If you like milkshakes, the speculoos milkshake (S$10) had a nuanced sweetness that was more frothy and fragrant than overindulgent, with just the right amount of caramelised, gingerbread-y flavour dancing around the tongue.\xa0\xa0If I had to be nitpicky, it’d be the French toast (S$14.90) from the all-day menu.\xa0The thick toast, while beautifully browned, could have been soaked in egg mixture a tad longer to get its eggy texture all the way through the middle. The housemade coffee caramel cream on the side doesn’t do itself much favours either, lacking enough coffee flavour to keep the dish from tasting one-dimensional.Still, with standout dishes where the effort and finesse can be felt, Missus is off to a promising start. As the saying probably goes, sometimes happiness is a well-made grilled cheese.\xa0Is it conducive to conversation? Missus can get noisy owing to the acoustics and it’s difficult to have a conversation when it’s crowded.Is a reservation necessary? Walk-ins only!How to get there? The cafe is conveniently located four minutes from Bendemeer MRT station. If you’re driving, parking is available outside and at the Jalan Besar Sport Centre.Things to note:\xa0\xa0HungryGoWhere paid for its meal at this cafe for this review.Missus is on the GrabFood delivery service.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/catkin-by-huishan/:['If there’s one thing pastry chef Soh Hui Shan wants to do, it’s to make dessert a dish worth having at any time of the day and not simply something you save until the end of a meal. For her, dessert can and should exist independently. It’s a philosophy she imbues at Catkin, where an omakase-style menu — served at limited hours of the week — takes centre stage.Here, nestled within the cavernous space of Twenty-Eight Cafe, at the intersection of Wilkie Road and Niven Road, Soh dishes out exquisitely handcrafted sweets shaped and moulded by flavours of Singapore. In an interview with CNA Lifestyle, Soh said the concept at Catkin was inspired by Kyo-Bar in Bangkok, Thailand.\xa0“I want to break into the niche market of dessert omakase or dessert avenues, which are currently not a common sight in Singapore,” she added. I’m familiar with Soh’s desserts.\xa0The first time I tried them was at Willow restaurant, where she was head pastry chef. Her dish of a salted pistachio & nibs macaron served with sour pate de fruit “beetle” was equal parts revolutionary and tasty.\xa0All the praise and accolades are not without reason or training. Aside from Willow, Soh has staged at storied fine-dining restaurants such as Andre and Zen. She also did a brief stint at the now-closed Cheek by Jowl by chef Rishi Naleendra.\xa0From the open oval kitchen island at the centre of the bistro, Soh puts her years of training to good effect, single-handedly creating and plating desserts for guests seated around the island, waiting for the magic to unfold. For S$48, Catkin’s omakase dessert menu offers a three-course plated dessert with two tea pairings. The day I went, I had the rooibos chamomile honeybush and the white tea elderflower, both lightly scented teas that pair elegantly with the desserts.\xa0There are also a la carte options for the three desserts, though ordering them separately makes little economic sense. The prix fixe menu starts with the kueh tutu (S$14 for a la carte), an exquisite plate in subtle hues of white inspired by the local version of the same persuasion.\xa0You can choose between the peanut or gula melaka coconut — I went for the latter, as I always do when faced with the option at my neighbourhood’s pasar malam stall.A quenelle of white pandan gelato sits on a pool of rice flour espuma foam, barely budging or melting in the slightest as I turn the bowl this way and that for the perfect photo. The espuma is airy and incredibly light, mimicking successfully kueh tutu’s finely pounded rice flour.\xa0Hidden beneath this blanket of weightlessness is desiccated coconut mixed with gula melaka, which, though delightfully saccharine, could do with being 20 per cent less sweet to balance with the lightness of everything else in this bowl.\xa0The muah chee (S$16 for a la carte) is an uncanny representation of its namesake, duly elevated to match the elegance on display. The showstopper is a round of peanut gelato mixed with textural specks of peanut that sit under a blanket of mochi that’s mind-bogglingly soft. The balance of textures here is phenomenal.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Feuds: Saizeriya vs Milan Shokudo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatisserie Cle brings its well-crafted pastries to new River Valley flagship for fifth anniversary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15 best Holland Village cafes for the ’gram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatkin’s dessert omakase ends with the sour plum guava (S$16 for a la carte), which does double duty as a dessert and a delightful palate cleanser.\xa0This dessert is where Soh’s artistry as a pastry chef shines. The plate is a canvas on which thinly sliced guava seasoned with calamansi comes served with a quenelle of bright guava sorbet. It’s citric-on-citric action that’s deliberate and incredibly well-planned.There’s also mascarpone cream in this that lends a creamy mouthfeel to the plate.\xa0But it doesn’t end there. Continuing her trajectory of hiding things beneath other things, Soh included dried and freshly diced guava at the heart of the presentation and threw in cheng tng jelly to remind us that she’s an OG Singaporean at heart. Food-wise, nothing is out of place. It’s sweet perfection personified.\xa0The only thing I take issue with is its limited opening hours (four hours on Wednesdays and Thursdays, and five hours on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays).\xa0It’s a strange gripe, I know, and perhaps there’s a perfectly reasonable explanation for it. But it pains me to know that excellence has such time limits.\xa0Is it conducive to conversation? Yes. The dessert parlour shares a space with a cafe mostly filled with working customers quietly typing away on their laptops.\xa0\xa0Is a reservation necessary? Yes. Catkin does not accept walk-ins.\xa0How to get there? It’s across the road from Peace Centre, and is a seven-minute walk from Rochor MRT station or a 10-minute walk from Little India MRT station.HungryGoWhere paid for its meal at this restaurant for this review.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/perghchicks/:['Many of us have fond memories of visiting pasar malams (pop-up night markets) — the bright lights, upbeat tunes, people wending their way through narrow spaces to do their shopping, and of course, the food.Afiq Irwan, 29, owner of Pergh!Chicks, knows this better than most of us, having spent much of his childhood at such markets.His mother Sabidah Borhan, 50,\xa0ran an ayam percik (spicy roast chicken with rice) stall at pasar malams around the island for more than 10 years.\xa0Having brought in the recipe from Malacca, Malaysia, and introducing it to Singaporeans in the 1990s, hers was the OG ayam percik stall, Afiq says. “It was very colourful… my brothers and I grew up in pasar malams. During my O Levels, I’d study there,” he adds. “Our whole lives revolved around the pasar malam scene.”“Our stall would have the longest queue because I was very young,” he recalls. “A lot of customers came to our shop to watch me cook their Ramly burgers or ayam percik. Back then, I was 13 to 15 years old.”Today, he’s still serving up ayam percik, albeit at his two Pergh!Chicks stores in Jurong West and Bugis, and occasionally, at pop-ups.Sabidah\xa0began dishing up Ramly burgers, otah and traditional Malay kueh at pasar malams in 1999, but soon started selling ayam percik based on a decades-old recipe.It’s a family recipe, Afiq says, tracing it as far back as his great-great-grandmother.As with many pasar malam stalls, the stall was nameless. But that never seemed to deter customers from returning for more.In 2010, Sabidah called it a day and shut the business for good.\xa0“She thought it was a good time to focus on me and my brothers,” Afiq recalls. At that time, he was sitting his GCE O Level exams.But that wasn’t the only reason. Rents for pasar malam stalls were on the rise, so it was no longer viable for the family.\xa0From then on, she sold ayam percik out of their home kitchen on occasion, but it wasn’t until 2019 that Pergh!Chicks came into being.In 2019, Afiq was laid off from his job in tech, where he dealt with software-as-a-service solutions, and mulled over the idea of restarting the business.Apart from refreshing its look, he named it Pergh!Chicks, which means “awesome chicken” in Malay. It’s also a play on its signature dish.\xa0It came back to life as a home-based business, but it was a challenge to recapture the hearts of Singapore’s ayam percik fans.\xa0“We had a lot of competition because we’d stopped (the business) for 10 years, so not many people knew of us. We had to slowly gain traction. Then Covid-19 happened, so it became worse.”\xa0The holy fasting month of Ramadan in May 2020 was pivotal for Pergh!Chicks. Unable to head into Malaysia for their ayam percik fix owing to pandemic movement controls, patrons turned to the internet and online deliveries.\xa0The brand’s Instagram following jumped fivefold this period.The limitations of their home space meant there was a lot of smoke, and they also had to rely on an electric grill instead of the traditional charcoal.\xa0They later moved first to a ghost kitchen in MacPherson, then to their first physical outpost — a hawker stall in Jurong West.\xa0In April 2022, Pergh!Chicks opened the doors to its Bali Lane store, which, for the first time, came with a seating area it could call its own.“At a pasar malam, you’ve to move every two, three weeks, so we’d be like nomads. Tearing down is the most painful thing to do,” Afiq says.\xa0“A physical store makes us feel grounded. Our customers know where we are, so they can keep coming back.”Things are a lot better now, says Afiq. Aside from the availability of air-conditioning in the Bali Lane shop, there are also better amenities, such as a karaoke machine and a PlayStation 4 in an upstairs room for staff members, as well as a place for Sabidah to rest or stay the night if needed.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Feuds: Saizeriya vs Milan Shokudo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Afiq, most ayam percik sold in Singapore comes with a sauce containing peanuts or curry powder.This isn’t true to the original recipe, he says. Traditional ayam percik doesn’t usually include nuts but is instead lighter and richer with coconut milk.Pergh!Chicks’ rendition stays true to this principle with tweaks for Singaporean taste buds, such as making it spicier and less sweet.The meats are also steam-marinated, so that the chicken soaks up all that flavour. It’s a process that takes at least five hours, so much so that Sabidah starts her day at 5am to ensure that the chickens are ready to go by the time the shutters go up.Another thing that sets Pergh!Chicks apart? Its signature — an Instagrammable nasi kukus volcano dish (from S$9.50), which incorporates Malaysian-style nasi kukus (steamed rice with curry).The rice, sauce and meats are contained within a cylindrical metal can before being served. Diners then gingerly grasp the can’s edges, lift it from the plate, and voila! The sauce cascades out, much like a volcano.And, since Singaporeans love their spice, Afiq hopes to create several sauces with varying levels of spice, to cater to different tolerance levels, in future.Besides that, there are also souped-up Ramly burgers — in the form of several types of wagyu beef burgers (from S$14) — as well as mentaiko fries (S$6.90) and even a creme brulee milk drink (S$7).Afiq’s favourite? None of his signatures, actually, he says a little sheepishly.\xa0After years of cooking and serving ayam percik and Ramly burgers, he’s had more than his fill of them. The honey barbecued chicken chop (from S$5.20) is more his speed.Regardless, he hopes to share the joys of ayam percik with more people.“With a lot of modern food coming up, people tend to forgo traditional food, which is the root of our culture,” he says.\xa0\xa0“We really hope that our customers support us in preserving this traditional cuisine and share it with other parts of the world.”It’s Afiq’s hope to start another stall in the east in the coming months, and possibly expand into Malaysia down the track.Pergh!Chicks is on the GrabFood delivery service.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/nakiryu-singapore/:['Another Michelin-starred ramen joint has reached Singapore’s shores!\xa0The iconic Nakiryu Ramen, Tokyo’s second ramen restaurant to be granted a Michelin star, has set up shop at Plaza Singapura, joining the likes of Tsuta and Konjiki Hototogisu.Officially opened on Friday (Jan 13), this marks Nakiryu’s first branch outside Japan.Ramen fans are understandably excited as the Tokyo eatery, which opened in 2012, has earned plaudits over the years for its flavourful broth. It has retained its prestigious Michelin star seven years in a row, since 2017. Before this, fans in Singapore could get a taste of Nakiryu’s signature dandan noodles only in cup-noodle form. Now, they can finally get a chance to taste chef-owner Kazumasa Saito’s ramen — prepared in person. The ramen maestro himself will be overseeing things at Plaza Singapura between Jan 13 and 17.While the original eatery in Tokyo is an intimate affair that seats only 10, the spiffy Plaza Singapura outlet is more spacious. Thankfully so, as there was a huge opening-day turnout numbering some 40 people, most of whom were already in line an hour before opening. For the uninitiated, Nakiryu is renowned for its dandan noodles, a style of ramen steeped in a rich spice-laden broth inspired by Chinese cuisine. Its signature is undoubtedly the rich and nutty tan tan men (S$15.90), though the tangy hot-and-sour soup ramen (S$15.90) is also a popular choice.Nakiryu’s classic tan tan men broth is rich and creamy — it’s simmered with a whole chicken, beef bones, oysters and kombu, and mixed with homegrown sesame paste and chilli oil to imbue it with layers of flavoursome complexity and warmth.There’s also the iconic shoyu ramen (S$14.90) that’s made with Nakiryu’s special blend of soya sauces for that extra depth. This can also be enjoyed as a bowl of prawn wonton ramen (S$17.90) and prawn wonton cha shu ramen (S$18.90).Should you prefer a bowl of rice to go with your noodles, the Singapore outlet also offers an array of donburi. Hearty choices include the salmon teriyaki rice set (S$18.90) and the thick cha shu rice set (S$15.90).Book a ride to Nakiryu.Plaza Singapura, 02-35, 68 Orchard Road\nNearest MRT station: Dhoby Ghaut\nOpen: Mondays to Sundays (12.15pm to 10pm; 11.30am to 2.30pm and 5.30pm to 9.30pm in future, after staff training is completed)Plaza Singapura, 02-35, 68 Orchard Road\nNearest MRT station: Dhoby Ghaut\nOpen: Mondays to Sundays (12.15pm to 10pm; 11.30am to 2.30pm and 5.30pm to 9.30pm in future, after staff training is completed)AuthorEvan started off writing about food on Instagram, before joining outlets such as Buro and Confirm Good to pursue his passion.

New cafe, Overbrod, might just be the answer.\xa0Located at Anchorpoint Shopping Centre, Overbrod began as a home-based business specialising in traditional open-faced sandwiches, also known as smorrebrod.\xa0It’s a cuisine that can typically be found in the Scandinavian region, and comprises a piece of buttered rye bread topped with ingredients such as cold cuts, meat or fish, cheese or spreads, and garnishes.The online store took off, and its popularity spurred the owners to begin sourcing for a physical location for the business. They settled on a unit at Anchorpoint Shopping Centre, which is located opposite Ikea Alexandra.The deli-inspired cafe, which had a soft launch in December 2022, is simple but homely. The wooden accents and a smattering of greenery make dining there a rather cosy experience.\xa0\xa0Overbrod’s signature items are its Instagram-worthy open-faced toasts that garnered its cult following in the first place. There’s a variety of toppings that cater to different palates, including cured salmon, smoked potatoes, roast beef, and heirloom tomatoes.A standout is the skagen (S$18), or shrimp toast — an elegant ensemble of Norwegian cold water shrimp, mentaiko mayo, dill, and tobiko set atop buttered rye toast.If you are hankering for some quintessential Swedish meatballs, the frikadeller (S$18) is sure to satisfy cravings. It’s a flavourful dish with six handmade pork and beef meatballs drenched in rich brown gravy, served with a side of roasted baby potatoes, and paired with tangy lingonberry jam.\xa0Wash that down with its selection of drinks, including small-batch craft beers and Aquavit, a distilled spirit produced in Scandinavia.Book a ride to Overbrod.Anchorpoint Shopping Centre, 01-14A, 370 Alexandra Road\nNearest MRT station: Queenstown\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (10am to 10pm)Anchorpoint Shopping Centre, 01-14A, 370 Alexandra Road\nNearest MRT station: Queenstown\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (10am to 10pm)AuthorEvan started off writing about food on Instagram, before joining outlets such as Buro and Confirm Good to pursue his passion.

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/great-singapore-brewed-beers/:['Taking place from 4 to 6 March, Craft Singapore is Singapore’s first festival dedicated to microbrews, homebrews and specialty brews. To gear up for the event, we decided to revisit every microbrewery in Singapore to sample some of the finest beers the country has to offer. From iconic mainstays to new arrivals in far-flung districts here’s the rundown on the 16 microbreweries around the island and the best beers at each of them.The 1925 Microbrewery & Restaurant\nBest beer with a story – Blk 6.22 Dark Ale\nIf you like your drinks to come with a unique story, The 1925 Microbrewery & Restaurant is happy to oblige. Started by two brothers and their uncle, the name of the brewery is a tribute to their grandfather/father who was born in, you guessed it, 1925. This homage continues with their beers including the Blk 6.22 Dark Ale (from $7 a half pint), named after Block 622 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 9, the patriarch’s home where the whole family would gather. Stories aside, the beer actually does weigh in at 6.2 per cent abv, but you wouldn’t guess it. It’s sneakily smooth with slightly sweet, chocolatey flavours.\nThe 1925 Microbrewery & Restaurant | Address: 369 Jalan Besar | Tel: 62949215 | Opening hours: Mon-Sat 10am-midnight; Sun 10am-10pmAdstragold Microbrewery\nBest cider\xa0–\xa0Adstrapple Cider\nAs much as we love our cider in Singapore, there haven’t been many inroads made in terms of anything locally-produced. The most peculiar microbrewery in town has taken care of that since 2013, however. Available at Adstragold’s main Katong outlet and their new craft beer and oyster bar at PasarBella, Adstrapple Cider (from $10.90 for 300ml) is a fresh and sweet sort of cider which puts some English labels to shame.\nAdstraGold Microbrewery |\xa0Address: 417/419 East Coast Road | Tel: 63453378 | Opening hours: Daily 2pm–1amThe Alpine Restaurant & Microbrewery\nBest beer in the heartlands – Dark\nIf you’re a 90s kid, you’re probably gripped by nostalgia whenever you pass by the Science Centre and Snow City. Now you have a pretty good reason to go back – The Alpine Restaurant & Microbrewery. Quietly operating on the second floor of Snow City, they have a line-up of five beers including a green beer brewed with seaweed. Our favourite is the Dark ($10), a smooth, malty beast weighing in at 8% abv. It shows the untapped potential of well-made dark lagers.\nThe Alpine Restaurant & Microbrewery | Address: 2F Snow City, 21 Jurong Town Hall Road | Tel: 65668389 | Opening hours: Tue-Sun 3:30pm-midnightArchipelago Brewery\nBest limited edition beer – X-Bock\nFrom our all-time favourite Archipresso to their caramel apple ale and cherry wheat beer, Asia Pacific Breweries offshoot Archipelago has constantly delivered with its wild and wonderful limited edition brews. The beer currently pouring is X-Bock (from $10 for 300ml), a local take on a German beer style traditionally enjoyed in springtime. Made with ingredients imported from Munich, the X-Bock spent three months ageing in Archipelago’s “brewing cave” before release. Available at an ever-growing number of showcase bars across the island, Archipelago also has a home at Parkland Green’s Full Pint Microbrewery\nArchipelago Brewery |\xa0Address: Various including The Pit, 21 Lorong Liput| Tel: 64683468 | Opening hours: Mon-Fri 3pm-1am; Sat & Sun noon-1amBeerfest\nBest beer cocktail – Beerfest\nIf two trends have taken over the drinks scene in Singapore in recent years, they’re craft beer and cocktails – so why not combine the two? Beerfest at Rochester Park has a stable of six beers and some of them are used in house specialty cocktails. The eponymous Beerfest ($18) is a concoction with a base of vodka and Bols Cacao Brown which they top up with their Cherry Ruby – a lager brewed with fresh cherries. It’s essentially like a Cherry Ripe bar or Black Forest cake in liquid form. And no, they’re not affiliated with Beerfest Asia; Beerfest the microbrewery is a Russian import that opened its first outlet in the Far Eastern city of Khabarovsk back in 2006.\nBeerfest | Address: 4 Rochester Park | Tel: 97227446 | Opening hours: Mon-Thu 10:30am-2:30pm and 5-11pm; Sat noon-1am; Sun noon-11pmBlue Bali Brewhaus\nBest fruit beer – Pink Mamba\nWe’ve heard all about microbreweries, but Blue Bali is an even smaller nanobrewery – the only one of its kind in Singapore. They might be lacking in size, but their beers are big on flavour. Their Pink Mamba ($14 for a hefty 680ml glass) is a wheat beer brewed with red dragon fruit and is the ideal beverage to enjoy in their chilled out, incense-filled back garden.\nBlue Bali Brewhaus | Address: 1D Cluny Road | Tel: 67330185 | Opening hours: Tue-Fri 4pm-midnight; Sat & Sun 11am-midnight\xa0Brewerkz\nMost comfortable beer – Golden Ale\nExpansion has been the order of the day for Brewerkz in recent times – the elder statesman of brewpub culture in Singapore now has outlets at the Orchard Parade Hotel and the Sentosa Boardwalk as well as an outpost at Senayan City, Jakarta. While they’ve been dishing out boozy education with their Single Hop Series, Brewerkz is still all about long beer sessions that start at midday, and there really is only one beer for that. The timeless Golden Ale (from $6 for 375ml) is that old flame you always go back to; its easy drinkability provides comfort with the familiar.\nBrewerkz |\xa0Address: Various including #01-05/06 Riverside Point, 30 Merchant Road | Tel: 64382311 | Opening hours: Mon–Thu & Sun noon–midnight; Fri & Sat noon-1amHospoda Microbrewery\nBest beer for keeping things simple and clean – Mixed Beer\nThe go-to place for drinkers of pure and simple Czech-style beer, Hospoda – which means “inn” or “pub” in Czech – serves just two types of beer, light and dark (from $10 for 330ml). They can also pour you a mixed beer “float” with the two brews (from $12 for 330ml). The menu here features some quality drinking food – sausages, grilled duck and prime baby pork ribs.\nHospoda Microbrewery\xa0| Address: #01-09 Albert Court, 180 Albert Street | Tel: 81184677 | Opening hours: Daily 4pm-midnightLeVeL33\nBest beer with a view — 33.3 Stout\nThe world’s highest urban craft brewery (still), LeVeL33 specialises in authentic European beers with one tap left over for a seasonal special (currently the 33.15 IPA). While good food has always been a part of the LeVeL33 concept, it’s become a bona fide fine dining venue featuring the cuisine of Chef James “Jimi” Tegerdine. It can get a little chilly up on the windy balcony, so it’s fortuitous that they have a top-notch stout on the menu. The 33.3 (from $9.33 for 300ml) is a dark beer with Irish roots and Singaporean sensibilities. The stout is light-bodied with just enough roasted malt to warm you when the wind picks up.\nLeVeL33\xa0| Address: #33-01 Marina Bay Financial Centre Tower 1, 8 Marina Boulevard | Tel: 68343133 | Opening hours: Mon-Wed 11:30am-midnight; Thu-Sat 11:30am-2am; Sun noon-midnightLittle Island Brewing Co\nBest beer off the beaten trail – Islay Porter\nNasi lemak, chalets, haunted hospitals – Changi Village is home to many famous attractions. Now you can add one of the newest microbreweries in Singapore to the list. Opened in 2015, Little Island makes brilliantly-branded numbers like That Old Black Magic dry Irish stout, A Whiter Shade of Pale pale ale and Oh Yeah Singapore pale ale. We really like their innovative self-service Drink Command system which allows you to pour as much or as little beer as you like. Their best beer so far is their limited edition Islay Porter (100ml for $3), a big bold beer infused with the flavours of smoky single malt whisky.\nLittle Island Brewing Co\xa0| Address: #01-01/02 Blk 6 Changi Village Road | Tel: 65439100 | Opening hours: Mon-Thu & Sun noon-11pm; Fri & Sat noon-midnightOn Tap\nBest beer on a budget – English Bitter\nWhen On Tap first popped up around the corner from The Good Beer Company and Smith Street Taps, it was easy to think of them as a piggybacking competitor. However, they’ve very much taken their own path with some of the cheapest beers anywhere (from $5.50 for 330ml) packed with flavour. Their English Bitter ($6) is a heavily hoppy incarnation of an underappreciated beer style. Despite having a limited online presence, word of mouth has brought success and they now have an additional stall at Chomp Chomp, a showcase bar on Tras Street and a restaurant bar at their brewery on Bukit Batok Crescent.\nOn Tap | Address: Various including #02-075 Chinatown Complex Market and Food Centre, Blk 335 Smith Street | Tel: 87221230 | Opening hours: Daily 4:30pm-midnightRedDot Brewhouse\nBest beer for your health — Monster Green Lager\nGoing strong with their outlets at Boat Quay and Dempsey is this local brewhouse. For all you competitive drinkers, they host a speed drinking competition at their Boat Quay outlet on Friday nights with the current record holder taking just 2.06 seconds to down a pint. Our favourite here remains the Monster Green lager (from $6 for a half pint). RedDot’s crisp, lightly bitter and coconut candy-sweet Monster might even be good for you: it’s brewed with the dietary supplement spirulina. To quote the menu: “Preliminary studies have shown that spirulina is able to inhibit viral speciation in vitro, strengthen the immune system and may cause regression & elimination of AIDS virus.” Drink what you will with that.\nRedDot Brewhouse\xa0| Address: 33/34 Boat Quay | Tel: 65354500 | Opening hours: Mon–Thu noon–midnight; Fri noon–2am; Sat 3pm-1amPaulaner Brauhaus\nBest traditional beer — Paulaner Munich Lager\nGerman beers have taken a back seat to modern day craft beer in recent years, but there’s no denying the centuries of tradition in German beer-making. Paulaner’s Munich Lager (from $13.30 for 300ml) is a great example of what beer used to be like in the old days, before the dominance of drab pale lagers. Using only water, hops, malt and yeast as set down by the German Beer Purity Law, the Munich is not very different from the average German lager—smooth, simple and lightly hopped. Since it’s brewed onsite — not poured out of a bottle after a journey halfway round the world — it is also lively and fresh.\nPaulaner Brauhaus\xa0| Address: #01-01 Millenia Walk, 9 Raffles Boulevard | Tel: 68832572 | Opening hours: Sun–Thu noon–1am; Fri & Sat noon-2amThe Pump Room\nBest beer to get grooving —India Pale Ale\nForget overpriced, tasteless beers with wedges of lime in the way — dance all night with an Asian Beer Awards medal winner. The Pump Room India Pale Ale ($10) is as hoppy as the best IPAs, and is suitably inebriating at 6.2% abv. You won’t find a better beer to take to a Clarke Quay dance floor at 3am.\nThe Pump Room\xa0| Address: #01-09 Clarke Quay, 3B River Valley Road | Tel: 63342628 | Opening hours: Sun–Fri 5pm-3am; Sat 5pm–4amStarker Fresh Beer\nBest offbeat beer – Charcoal\nStarker is a bit of an oddity. Their beers began appearing at outlets of the OverTime chain of bars in Malaysia and a bottled version could even be found at coffee shops. All but gone across the Causeway, Starker continues to thrive in Singapore with three outlets around town. Their beers are brewed to be enjoyed fresh with a shelf life of just seven days and you can pour them yourself from their signature two- and five-litre wooden kegs. The Charcoal (from $6.90 a half pint) is perhaps their most interesting beer. Brewed with roasted malt and noble hops, it has a kick of coffee flavour.\nStarker Fresh Beer | Address: Various including 25 Lorong Mambong | Tel: 64658368 | Opening hours: Sun-Thu 3pm-1am; Fri & Sat 3pm-2amTawandang Microbrewery\nBest beer to beat the heat — Tawandang Lager Beer\nThis German brewery that serves Thai cuisine is an unusual blend of East and West. Known more as a place for seafood and live entertainment than as a straight up microbrewery, they also carry some decent beers: the lager (from $12 for 300ml) is proper, with subtle floral hop notes and enough body for it to function as a palate cleanser. It refreshes and helps fight off the heat, whether from a walk around Dempsey Hill or a spicy prawn tom yum soup.\nTawandang Microbrewery\xa0| Address: 26 Dempsey Road | Tel: 64766743 | Opening hours: Sun-Thu 11:30am–midnight; Fri & Sat 11:30am-1amComing Soon: Innocence Brewing\nInnocence Brewing is so new that they’re still an entirely unknown commodity. They’ll be showcasing their beers for the first time at Craft Singapore so stay tuned!Archipelago, Beerfest, Brewerkz, Innocence, Little Island, On Tap and Paulaner will be showcasing their brews at Craft Singapore.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

Calling it “grandma’s recipe” lends an authentic, home-cooked flavour that just makes any dish sound more mouth-watering.In the case of Zhao An Granny Grass Jelly, “granny” isn’t part of the stall’s name just for the sake of it. It really refers the owner’s late grandmother, who started peddling chin chow (grass jelly) back in 1946 when street hawkers plied Beach Road.Today, 48-year old Yeo Hwee Seng runs the stall with relatives and continues what his late grandmother Madam Sim Sai Geok started decades ago.

While it’s smooth and slippery as you would expect chin chow to be, Zhao An’s version is more concentrated in flavour with a delightful springy texture. It’s also not too sweet with a delicate hint of pandan.A chilled cup of grass jelly ($1) is heaven on a hot, sweltering day. You can also soup it up by adding palm seeds ($1.50), longans or sea coconut ($1.80). The three varieties are served in bowls topped with crushed ice — absolutely no-frills but such utterly refreshing desserts!Golden Mile Food Centre, 01-58, 505 Beach Road\nNearest MRT station: Nicoll Highway\nOpen: Daily (11.30am to 6.30pm)Golden Mile Food Centre, 01-58, 505 Beach Road\nNearest MRT station: Nicoll Highway\nOpen: Daily (11.30am to 6.30pm)Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

We feel you — we’re missing the gallivanting life, too.\xa0So what if you can’t transport yourself to a foreign land right this minute? It’s official: Bangkok’s world-renowned Chatuchak Night Market is coming to you!\xa0The popular night market first came to Singapore in 2020, but its stint was cut short due to the pandemic. It will now be returning to Singapore for two months, between Feb 7 and Apr 2, 2023.It will be held at the same spot as its previous run, at the spacious Grandstand South Carpark on Turf Club Road.\xa0Housing some 180 stalls run by both local and Thai vendors, the open-air market will operate from Tuesday to Sunday from 4pm to 10pm. More than 60 vendors will be flown in from Thailand, and will be peddling everything from authentic street food to handicrafts and antiques.\xa0These vendors are brought together under the “One Tambon One Product” (OTOP) initiative, which aims to support the unique locally made products from sub-districts all over Thailand. All the vendors are also said to satisfy a minimum food quality of three to five stars!So you can expect a slew of diverse and authentic delights, such as a Michelin-recommended Thai hor fun, decadent pork leg, and look choob, a photogenic mung-bean-shaped dessert.Southern Thai vendors will also be setting up shop to provide Muslim-friendly bites, including the unique banana roti from Satun, the hoi tord chumpon, an oyster and mussel omelette, and Thai-style chicken satay.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTalad Thai Banana opens at AMK Hub with S$2 opening promotion for the first 100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xa0The night market organisers will also be linking up with Chang Beer as the official beer partner, so you can be assured you’d stay refreshed with pints of authentic Thai beer, if that’s your choice of beverage.

Instead of coinciding with the start of the Muslim fasting month, this year’s bazaar will start five days earlier and coincide with the Hari Raya light-up in Geylang Serai instead.It will operate daily from 10am to 11.59pm, with the exception of the eve of Hari Raya on April 22, when it’ll run until 6am.Besides the extended period, this year’s edition will also have some 700 stalls on-site — a dramatic uptick from the 70 in 2022.The bazaar will be split into two themes of Souq City and Street Bazaar. The former will be housed mainly in organiser Wisma Geylang Serai’s compound and will feature a whole host of food and drinks stalls, as well as retail stalls.To encourage the spirit of giving, there will be community shelves for people to donate non-perishable halal food and clothing for Hari Raya.Due to rising costs, the bazaar is emphasising affordability. Each F&B stall will offer at least one food item at a sample size for S$4.There will be a dining area set up with elderly-friendly tables and chairs, low tables and grass carpeted area for sitting.Separate from Souq City, the Street Bazaar area will stretch from Geylang Serai Market to Tanjong Katong Complex.\xa0The Street Bazaar will feature three different themes, with interactive art installations placed throughout.

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/my-must-eats-hong-hui-fang/:['My Must-Eats is a HungryGoWhere series featuring Singapore’s public figures and their favourite food haunts. This week, we speak to actress Hong Hui Fang.Singaporean actress Hong Hui Fang is experiencing a renewed wave of popularity after decades in the acting business — thanks to her spectacular performance in the film Ajoomma.Her role in the Singapore-Korea co-production was her first leading role in a film, and she’s been flying high since its release in October last year.\xa0The movie garnered worldwide critical acclaim, as did Hong. For her role in it, she nabbed the Best Actress award at the 8th Asian World Film Festival. She also snagged a Best Actress nomination at the prestigious Golden Horse awards (but lost to Taiwanese actress Sylvia Chang).Since then, the 62-year-old Mediacorp actress has been touring the film-festival circuit, travelling, and enjoying time with her friends and family (her husband, son and daughter are all in showbiz).We chat with her about some of her favourite dishes. Hint: They’re all pretty homely, comforting fare.Toasted bread with butter and sugar, which I usually make myself. I haven’t really found anything similar in eateries. But I haven’t eaten this in a long time, as the sugar content is too high.I often head to Far East Plaza on my own to eat seafood soup — it’s my comfort food! I don’t remember its name; I just know how to go there. It’s on the lower levels of the mall.\xa0I’m someone who prefers strong and heavy flavours, so maybe that’s why the taste of this seafood soup suits me. (Editor’s note: We did a check and confirmed with her that she was referring to Yan Ji Gourmet Seafood Soup on level one of Far East Plaza.)\xa0Usually, if I’m hungry in the middle of the night, there’s a place I often go to for supper, and that’s DragonCity Claypot Frog Porridge along Joo Chiat Road.Laksa! It’s tough to find delicious laksa abroad. For all of my other favourite foods, such as chicken rice and curry, I’m able to find these quite easily overseas.\xa0I don’t have a go-to place in Singapore for laksa. Usually, I would eat it if I spot a stall while outdoors. This is especially so if the laksa offers cockles — I will choose to try it!\xa0I like chicken rice, but it’s for a practical reason, too. When I’m filming, and the staff wants to pack lunch for me, I’ll always go for chicken rice because it’s the easiest.I’ve been very lucky — I’ve tried a lot of food! At this moment, I’m not sure what else I want to try.\xa0I’m also someone who eats very simply. I can cook a bowl of plain porridge, and pair that with salted fish, pickled vegetables, salted egg or fermented beancurd, and that’s enough for a meal.So far, I haven’t had a meal that has left a really deep impression on me.\xa0\xa0Yan Ji Gourmet Seafood Soup is on the GrabFood delivery service. You can also book a ride to the eateries mentioned in this article.\xa0\xa0AuthorJoy has more than 14 years of experience as a journalist, editor and content creator.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/qwang/:['We all have our weaknesses when it comes to food. For some, it’s bubble milk tea with 100% sugar, or Chicken McNuggets and fries doused in curry sauce. Mine’s the French bread and pickled vegetables of a banh mi sandwich.It’s timely, too, as there’s been quite a number of small Vietnamese eateries sprouting up across the island in the past two years, many of which are concentrated in Joo Chiat and Paya Lebar.But there are outliers, and recently, I found myself in Kovan outside a nondescript white building. Inside is Qwang, a small shop specialising in bun thit nuong, the classic Vietnamese rice-noodle salad dish, and yes, banh mi.\xa0The restaurant itself — if you can call it that — is the size of three, maybe four, tiny cars. But it’s all about the food, right?Qwang, which recently celebrated its first anniversary, is a quick-serve concept that caters to healthy eaters with less sugar and salt, and virtually no MSG or oil.\xa0Its website says the recipes originated from Vietnamese master cooks, and while we’ve no way of verifying that, the food speaks for itself.If you’re looking for a deliciously healthy option for lunch or dinner, Qwang’s bowls and sandwiches — a hearty mix of fresh greens and marinated proteins — will fill you up without inflicting a food coma. It retains authentic Vietnamese tastes and flavours, and serves excellent Vietnamese coffee to spruce up your afternoon.\xa0Do note that this place is hardly suitable for groups — there are just eight stools and three wooden tables. I’d consider it more of a delivery and takeaway spot.\xa0Unless you live nearby, I’d suggest grabbing its bowls off food delivery platforms such as GrabFood.There are no ovens in sight, so the baguettes for Qwang’s banh mi were most likely made elsewhere. Thankfully, the bread’s mostly airy and crispy with soft insides, with barely a hint of staleness (my visit was late in the afternoon).The banh mi classic (S$9.50) is stacked full of pate and butter spread, Vietnamese pork ham (cha lua), pork floss, pickled carrots and daikon, and enough chilli to make you sweat. It’s the ham that does it for me with its meaty juiciness.In the case of the banh mi beef ribeye (S$13), the premium beef ribeye — sliced fairly thinly — is roasted perfectly with a flavourful tenderness and a touch of five spice. There’s a heap of coriander and fresh chilli inside, just the way I like mine.One thing to know is that the meats here — the pork, beef ribeye, pork belly and chicken — are mostly the same for both the banh mi and salad bowls. So it depends on whether you’re itching for bread or noodles that day.\xa0Qwang’s bun thit nuong is based on the southern Vietnamese style, where the fresh vegetables and garnishing — romaine lettuce, pickled carrots and daikon, Japanese cucumbers, cherry tomatoes, mint and basil leaves, and crushed peanuts — are laid on top of rice vermicelli like a regular salad.There’s also a special sauce, served in another container, that tastes like liquid gold. This nuoc cham is funky, sweet and acidic at the same time, thanks to a trio of fish sauce, vinegar and sugar. Pour this in and give everything a good mix.\xa0The pork belly bowl (S$10.80) is mostly faultless, coming with a generous portion of chunky and fatty pork belly. It’s tender and nice to chew on, and there’s a certain smokiness from the marinade that melds harmoniously with the other ingredients.Since a vegetarian option was out for the day (the staff tells us the main protein is tofu seasoned with a dry spice rub), we opted for the regular pork bowl (S$10.80).\xa0What’s interesting is that it’s not merely less fatty than the pork belly version, but vibrates with a more savoury umami flavour — not a bad choice if you want something really clean.Vietnamese coffee (S$4.60) — pre-brewed into bottles and chilled — is the only drink served here.\xa0If you’ve drunk Vietnamese coffee, you’ll remember the rich and dark flavour profile, with strong chocolate and caramel notes (the fragrant coffee’s made with robusta beans rather than the typical Arabica ones). It’s also somewhat sweet, presumably from condensed milk. The bottle went down very quickly.Don’t miss the opportunity to try the avocado mousse ice cream (S$6.80) — a rare find even at Singapore’s more established Vietnamese joints. Also known as kem bo, it’s a popular street dessert from Da Nang that starts with dark green avocado mousse at the bottom of the bowl, with coconut ice cream, desiccated coconut, almond flakes, and chopped peanuts on top.\xa0It’s a beautiful dance between the decadently creamy mousse and denser, milky ice cream. Try to get a bit of everything in one spoonful.It could just be that I’m not exactly a healthy eater, but I can’t help but notice the lack of sauce (think sriracha) and oil — perhaps olive or sesame — that could take the banh mi here to another level.\xa0Perhaps that’s the price to pay for something that feeds both your body and soul at once. Is it conducive to conversation? Yes, but I can’t imagine it’s the kind of place you’d want to stay at for long.Is a reservation necessary? No reservation needed!How to get there? A 13-minute walk from Serangoon MRT station should get your appetite started. Otherwise, there are several buses from both Serangoon and Kovan MRT stops.Take note:\xa0HungryGoWhere paid for its meal at this eatery for this review. Still hungry?

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/le-matin-patisserie/:['Ion Orchard, with its fancy brands and sleek interiors, is a fitting place for the elegant Le Matin Patisserie to unveil its newest permanent location in Singapore.\xa0The patisserie, which previously operated as pop-up stores in Paragon and at Raeburn Park in Tanjong Pagar, will launch its Ion Orchard outlet on Feb 1.\xa0All other stores and its central kitchen have since closed, and the outlet at Ion Orchard will be the only place you can get your hands on Le Matin’s coveted pastries.\xa0For those unacquainted with the brand, Le Matin Patisserie is helmed by chef Mohamed Al-Matin. The chef-owner has an illustrious resume, having worked at a number of renowned restaurants around the world, including the three-Michelin-starred Noma.\xa0Noma in Copenhagen has repeatedly been rated the best restaurant in the world. It recently announced that it was closing at the end of 2024, after operating for two decades.Le Matin’s soft, pale hues have a sophisticated and calming aura. Upon entering, you’re greeted by lines of tantalising pastries, tempting you to buy everything right that instant.\xa0There’s plenty to try, aside from its usual pastries and cakes. With the new space, Chef Al-Matin has expanded Le Matin’s menu to include brunch (11am to 3pm), dinner and desserts (6pm to 10pm).\xa0The mains are served with a small portion of its house salad. This includes the luscious black truffle scrambled eggs croissant (S$34) and the chutoro brioche feuilletee (S$38) comprising seared tuna sandwiched between a croissant and brioche bun hybrid.\xa0Our preference for mains was the smoked beef cheek banh mi (S$18). The smoked wagyu beef cheeks were well-flavoured and tender, ending on a subtly sweet note.\xa0To help cut through the richness of the beef, black garlic and chimichurri, pickled carrots and daikon were included to bring a refreshing touch to the dish.\xa0However, true to its name, pastries and cakes remain the best thing about Le Matin Patisserie.\xa0\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Feuds: Saizeriya vs Milan Shokudo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sake lees choux bun (S$14), one of Le Matin’s new creations, impressed us with its complex textures, subtle flavour and mild sweetness.\xa0It comprises a choux bun with a macadamia praline centre that’s piped with sake lees mousse (sake lees is a by-product from the Japanese sake-making process). The choux bun is placed on a macadamia yuzu crunch base and topped with more mousse, sake lees jelly and yuzu.\xa0For something a little heftier, opt for the tarte aux noix de cajou (S$20). It’s a nutty dessert made of fragrant cashew custard, cashew nougatine, filo pastry, mulberries and cream.For pastries, you could opt for some of its more distinctive creations, such as the smoked cruffin (S$10), a croissant baked in the shape of a muffin, filled with applewood smoked vanilla custard, and topped with charred eucalyptus meringue.Otherwise, you can’t go wrong with classics such as its celebrated kouign-amann (S$7.50), a layered pastry with butter, sugar, vanilla and molasses, or its almond croissant (S$7.50).\xa0Fans of Nylon Coffee Roasters should give the coffee (from S$4) at Le Matin Patisserie a try. The blend, Le Soleil, was created in collaboration with the coffee powerhouse and is available exclusively at the patisserie.\xa0Otherwise, opt for its housemade kombucha such as the pine, pear and elderflower (S$9.50) or the nitro coffee kombucha (S$11).Finally, here’s the important question to make your experience there less intimidating: How do you pronounce Le Matin?\xa0Matin is the French word for “morning”, but it happens to be its chef-owner’s name as well. You won’t go wrong with either Le Matin (Leh Ma-teen), or Le Matin (Leh Muh-tan).

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/the-coconut-club-siglap/:['The Coconut Club, famous for its gourmet nasi lemak dish, is now available at Siglap. Opened on Jan 30, this is its second outlet so far.\xa0The news comes after the Michelin Bib Gourmand recipient relocated from its old Ann Siang Hill home to a swanky new flagship outlet in Beach Road in the middle of 2022.The Coconut Club’s Siglap outlet can be found nestled among a row of shophouses along Frankel Avenue, which also houses popular brunch spot Dutch Colony Coffee Co. It sports a homely and casual “canteen” theme, unlike its Beach Road outlet that has a more sophisticated vibe.Opened in 2016, the homegrown brand quickly gained popularity for its unique elevated take on the local classic. It was also the restaurant where Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong hosted visiting Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte for lunch in Dec 2016.\xa0Eventually, it got onto the Michelin radar and was awarded the Michelin Bib Gourmand Award in 2018.As with most nasi lemak, the essence is in the fragrant rice. Here, The Coconut Club infuses two-year-old jasmine rice with a specially sourced proprietary coconut milk blend before steaming it to achieve that desired fluffy texture.Most fans would know that the signature here is undoubtedly the ayam goreng berempah leg nasi lemak (S$21). It comes with a tantalising piece of spiced fried chicken, with a choice of leg or breast.\xa0The succulent fried chicken is made with organic poulet that’s marinated for 12 hours in housemade rempah before going into the fryer to give it that crackling red skin. Of course, it’s also accompanied with a dollop of sweet and aromatic housemade sambal, as well as the usual egg, peanuts and anchovies.Diners can also opt for fried fish with the kembong nasi lemak (S$21) or charcoal-grilled otah with the otah nasi lemak (S$17).\xa0The Siglap store will have a special brunch menu, available on weekends between 10am and 4.30pm. It features a spread of hearty bites, such as the outlet-exclusive apom berkuah with pisang pengat (fermented rice pancakes with coconut milk, blue pea flower, banana, gula sauce, and vanilla ice cream, S$16) and dry laksa (S$21).The otah cheese sandwich (S$18) and hae bee hiam tuna sandwich (S$18), two teatime favourites from The Coconut Club’s flagship, will also be made available through the Siglap brunch menu.The Coconut Club is on the GrabFood delivery service.

One is a new smoky chargrilled-chicken-flavoured McShaker fries (S$3.95 a la carte).The other is a caramel frappe with Oreo (from S$4.70 a la carte) that mixes dark roast coffee with rich caramel, while also introducing decadent Oreos to the mix.There’s more good news: McDonald’s is also tweaking some of its classic beef burgers, elevating them with improvements in the cooking methods by the Singapore operations.These include a new bun recipe that introduces a glaze coating, making the buns moist, slightly tender and caramelised.

Mains come by way of entrees, sandwiches, salads and brunch options, while the more modest dessert section boasts plated desserts and bite-sized sweets.I reckon what Haikal needs to do at Alkove is take complex and nuanced French fare and transform it into something accessible, approachable and easy to eat.\xa0What better example of this than with the Fromage Cromesquis (S$9.50), a cheese-stick adjacent served with a honey truffle sauce that’s equal parts fragrant and sweet.Or the Chicken Vin Blanc (S$27.90) that features some of the silkiest and delicately al dente pasta I’ve had in a long while.\xa0This sits in a cream sauce that’s the epitome of refrain — cream-based dishes sometimes tend to be cloying. But not here. The sauce boasts layers of flavour notes — slightly sweet, a little herbaceous, and all umami. That the chicken is fall-off-the-bone tender is but the icing on the cake.I liked the Valrhona Terrine (S$14.50), too, which surprised my dining partner, who knows chocolate desserts are such a cop-out for me.\xa0But if your chocolate terrine sits on a pool of spiced cardamom cream and is sprinkled with a dash of coarse sea salt, you’d best believe I’d inhale it with nary a hesitation. Texture and surprising flavour combinations — that’s how you navigate a chocolate dessert.\xa0\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Feuds: Saizeriya vs Milan Shokudo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatisserie Cle brings its well-crafted pastries to new River Valley flagship for fifth anniversary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15 best Holland Village cafes for the ’gram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile I understand the sentiments behind the maple smoked salmon (S$16.50) at Alkove, I’d have preferred a touch less dressing, such that it doesn’t pervade and soak too readily into the greens.\xa0I’d also have liked it if the red onions weren’t tossed with the dressing — the astringency of the allium could have contrasted poetically with the creaminess of the maple dressing. Thank goodness for the green-apple cubes that lend a slight brightness to the plate.\xa0But I was thoroughly disappointed with the ocean trout (S$26.90). This is a classic case of not judging a food item by its plate because the presentation is dramatic. I suppose that makes sense, though, given how it has to overcompensate for the dish’s blandness.\xa0The error here is probably in thinking trout has the same flavour profile as its similar-looking cousin — salmon. It doesn’t. Without a more forward play on seasoning, this trout unfortunately reminded me of the time I had Covid, and lost all sense of taste and smell.\xa0It’s a shame since every ingredient here — olives, anchovies, boiled eggs, potatoes, couscous, and tomato — is brimming with possibilities and begging to be seasoned. This was a disappointment through and through.Is it conducive to conversation? Yes. The tables here are well-spaced and the music isn’t intrusive.Is a reservation necessary?

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/whiskdom-bagels-1-for-1/:['Here’s a deal for anyone craving bagels — homegrown cafe brand Whiskdom is offering a 1-for-1 promo\xa0on all its hearty bagel sandwiches.The promotion will run from now until Feb 5, where the lower priced bagel, if applicable, will be free of charge. It’s available only at its Orchard Central concept, Ooze by Whiskdom, for redemption between 12pm and 7pm.\xa0Sounds like the perfect brunch date option for you and your bestie over the weekend!Ooze is the dessert cafe concept by\xa0Whiskdom, a bakery which got its start during the pandemic as a home-based business.\xa0It was highly sought after for its ’gram-worthy dessert boxes filled with chunky lava cookies and decadent brownies. At one time, its 750-people-long waitlist meant customers needed to wait more than a year to get their hands on a box. It later ballooned to the thousands, and baker-owner Fiona Loh had to open a central kitchen to cope with the orders.Loh has since left her job as a tech product manager to focus on the brand’s expansion into the brick-and-mortar space as a full-fledged cafe. It now has two outlets, one at North Bridge Road and the other at Orchard Central.Bagel sandwiches were a more recent development during the later part of 2022, when Whiskdom opened the stores and was looking for ways to expand the menu.Even before the 1-for-1 deal, Ooze by Whiskdom’s bagel sandwiches were already pretty affordable compared with some of the more established bagel specialists. Under S$10, options you could consider include the nacho chicken (cajun baked chicken, nacho cheese and lettuce, S$9.90).The menu mainly comprises either the sliced ribeye beef steak (S$10.90) or the cajun chicken as your protein. The flavours vary, depending on the sauce combinations.\xa0Those feeling a little bougie can opt for the truffle chicken (S$12.90) or truffle beef steak (S$13.90) that comes with a luxe truffle aroma.Otherwise, mentaiko lovers can get the mentaiko chicken (S$12.90) or mentaiko beef steak (S$13.90) for a burst of creamy mentaiko aioli richness.The promo will be available only for dine-in and takeaways.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/yole-cafe/:['One evening, while on the way home from work, I saw warm lights glowing from within Yole Cafe along Pagoda Street. “Oh, this must be the business replacing The Tintin Shop. How inventive,” I thought aloud to no one in particular.If you recall, in July 2020, The Tintin Shop announced that it would shut, citing “tough times”.\xa0I was thrilled — a great backstory always makes a good review. Sadly, I was mistaken. The Tintin Shop is still there today, at 28 Pagoda Street. Yole Cafe is two units down, at 30 Pagoda Street.Yole is the brainchild of D+1 Holding, which, after a dispute with Llaollao’s parent company in Spain while it was still the Singapore franchisee of the chain, changed all 29 Llaollao Singapore stores to Yole seemingly overnight in 2017.In a statement, D+1 Holding had told Marketing Interactive then that it felt Llaollao’s menu had been “exhausted after three years” of being in the business. It later said Llaollao’s HQ didn’t react positively to its suggestions of adding more variety and flavours to its menu offerings.\xa0Llaollao said in response that it’d been constantly improving the quality of its products.If you’re wondering what a froyo joint is doing opening a cafe in the middle of bustling Chinatown, believe me, you’re not alone.\xa0My guess is that this endeavour’s an experiment in food pairing, menu expansion, and figuring out what a proper sit-down restaurant would look like for a froyo chain.\xa0And if my hypothesis is true, then I’m glad to report that Yole’s efforts are close to success — barring minor changes that would make it a worthy contender among the crowded F&B mise en scene of Chinatown.What Yole Cafe does really well is in portion sizes. Boy, are the plates here huge. Colossal. Elephantine. Massive. Unreasonable even, given the price.\xa0In most cases, size doesn’t matter, but in this inflation economy, I beg to differ.Take the club sandwich (S$18.50), for instance. It’s thick, hearty, filling and still makes me feel breathless even now, looking back.\xa0I shared a portion with a friend, and we both wondered how we would finish a single serving alone. If you’re getting this, come famished.Size aside, the club is what I reckon people with sandwich cravings desire — not the kind you find wrapped behind glass chillers at 7-Eleven.\xa0Inside, there’s a juicy grilled chicken, two types of cheese, fried egg, and a gold-hued honey mustard dressing that brings everything together rather boldly.You know the folks here take portions seriously when the size becomes a precaution.\xa0“It’s a cake size, yeah, Sir,” the cashier informed me when I ordered the pistachio brioche (S$18.90) alongside all the other things you see in this review.\xa0“Sure,” I replied ignorantly.What came was a thick square of creamy, sweet goodness that’s dangerously addictive for the sweet tooth. If you look up Wikipedia for the definition of dessert, this should be the thumbnail picture.Two one-inch brioches are draped in green pistachio cream, which, though fragrant, could have been less sweet. Inside, there’s a silky, creamy custard, too.\xa0Thankfully, there are fruits on this plate to infuse a citrusy flavour into the entire presentation.The coffee affogato (S$7.50) is something I never thought could be large and in charge, yet here we are.\xa0There’s the usual double shot of espresso with fruity overtones, so that’s great. Along with this come two generous scoops of ice cream — mine was caramel, and it was one scoop too many for an affogato.\xa0But clearly, I was the only one here who felt that way, since the three ladies at the table beside mine breathed their affogatos in with barely any resistance. Still, there are some things even size can’t save.\xa0For instance, the zucchini noodles and prawns (S$16.90) dish comes served with beautifully grilled prawns that retain a great bounce, and impeccably and liberally seasoned roasted vegetables.\xa0But the zucchini ribbons feel somewhat disjointed from the presentation. They were also bland, like a cold salad that hasn’t been seasoned properly. The avocados could have benefited from some salt and pepper, too.I am not a massive fan of the avocado salmon rice (S$18.90) either. But I know who would love this — those fresh from a workout who haven’t eaten a thing since their morning coffee. Yet, texturally, it’s incomplete. Everything is far too soft, though I appreciate that the beetroot puree is seasoned (and, trust me, there’s a lot of beetroot here).\xa0What this needs, crunch aside, is a touch of acidity beyond the wedge of lemon it comes with. Is it conducive to conversation? Absolutely. I can see myself hosting meetings and having dates (if and when that happens, fingers crossed) at Yole Cafe.Is a reservation necessary? No.\xa0How to get there? Yole Cafe is a five-minute walk from Exit A of Chinatown MRT station.HungryGoWhere paid for its meal at this cafe for this review. Still searching for cafes to visit?

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/swirlgo/:['As the unusual bout of sweater weather we’ve been enjoying dries up, it’s time to turn back to a perennial favourite to beat the Singapore heat — ice cream.There are plenty of different ways to get your fix, too. Pretty dessert cafes with unique, artisanal flavours, swirls of fuss-free soft-serve from quick-service eateries, and of course, the good ol’ ice-cream uncle with icy blocks sandwiched between slices of rainbow bread.Spurred by (his wife’s) love of ice cream, Jeremy Tan, 33, came up with something a little different.\xa0Inspired by Nespresso- or Keurig-style coffee machines that operate using coffee pods, his startup Swirl.Go has invented one for ice cream.If you’ve been to Orchard Road lately, you may have caught a glimpse of Swirl.Go’s new ice-cream kiosk tucked away in Orchard Gateway’s East Eight — a ground-floor sneaker and bubble tea concept store.At first glance, it may look like any other dessert kiosk, but Swirl.Go prides itself on being the only one with the tech to serve up different textures and flavours — be it chunky ice cream, silky-smooth soft-serve, and even frozen yoghurt — with all your favourite ingredients within.The concept is simple: Your chosen base flavour and mix-in ingredients are scooped into a special capsule and slotted into the machine, before being blended, aerated and incorporated.\xa0Once ready, the ice cream is piped out of the machine into a cone or cup, where it is then garnished with toppings of your choice.And it’s relatively fast, too — a three- to four-minute process — compared with traditional ice-cream parlours serving mix-in ice cream, where the ingredients are cut up and folded in by hand.Another big plus? There’s no cross-contamination of ingredients within the capsules, so you won’t get funky flavours from someone else’s order mixed into your own.\xa0It merges the best of soft-serve — usually easy to serve once made — and mix-in ice cream, which allows for a bevy of ingredient combinations and flavours.The technology is proprietary as well, so it’s not something you’d find elsewhere.As for how this all started, Tan, who worked at ExxonMobil and Singtel, attributes it to his wife and then-girlfriend’s penchant for ice cream of all kinds.“She really loves ice cream, and she’s always going around and trying different soft-serve ice cream. And then I realised sometimes it’s not good enough for her — (the ice cream served) is probably too sweet or not healthy enough, or not in enough flavours.”Tan says that while it’s convenient, most soft-serve ice cream sold in restaurants usually comes in limited flavours, largely because each machine can churn out just one flavour at a time.\xa0Changing out the flavours means having to clean the entire machine — the insides, tubes and all.“I realised this is an industry-wide problem that persists across all restaurants that serve soft-serve. They try it (for a while) and then they stop, for several reasons: Washing, manpower, and you can basically have only one flavour per machine.”It got him thinking: Why not create a Nespresso-type concept with ice cream?But it was one thing to have the idea, and another to put it together.Tan, who didn’t have a tech or engineering background, had to pick up 3D modelling and printing to create the prototype in 2017.“I didn’t have any money to spend on it, and I found that the National Library Board had a programme that offered free 3D printing to the public at Jurong Regional Library.\xa0“So I went there every weekend and started printing my own capsules, and tested the first ones to see if they would work.”He also built the first blending machine from scratch, using sawed wood and old motors. “It looked really shabby at first,” he recalls, laughing.He assures me that the product has since been refined by his team of engineers.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Feuds: Saizeriya vs Milan Shokudo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith seven base flavours and about 20 mix-in ingredients, there are hundreds of possible combinations.These include Swirl.Go’s signatures: A durian chendol-esque ice cream — comprising gula melaka, D24 durian puree and toasted coconut — as well as a strawberry frozen yoghurt with soursop bits that’ll be available sometime in February.If you’re feeling adventurous, there’s an eye-catching Lao Gan Ma chilli-oil combination (yes, with real chilli oil).“It’s not for the faint of heart,” Tan warns. “Some people like it, some don’t. Some people feel it’s weird, but some people really love it. So it’s quite polarising.”Desserts start from a reasonable S$5.90. A Single includes a base flavour, a mix-in ingredient and a topping, while a Jumbo (from S$7.90) is Swirl.Go’s largest size, comprising a base, five mix-ins and five toppings.Besides the concept store at East Eight, Swirl.Go machines are available at fintech giant PayPal’s Singapore headquarters for staff use, as well as the Chinese Swimming Club. Tan’s also working with partners in Australia, Thailand and Israel, with an eye on expanding farther afield.\xa0Will we see more Swirl.Go stores in future?\xa0Tan’s certainly hopeful.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/shaker-lakers-cafe/:['We ended last year with the poignant news that popular Western food stall Shaker Lakers will close on Feb 25, 2023.Opened on Aug 9, 2019, at Yishun Park Hawker Centre, the hawker stall took some time to re-evaluate its business during the last few months of 2022.\xa0It eventually decided to cease operations due to a myriad of considerations, with rising supply costs being the main deciding factor.Fortunately, that’s not the last we’d see of it. It already has plans brewing, even before its Yishun operations cease, and it’d be back bigger and better.HungryGoWhere has learnt that Shaker Lakers will take up a new space at the Airbus Asia Training Centre in Seletar sometime in mid-March, and it will be upgraded into a full-fledged cafe known as SL@Airways. Although it’s housed within the training centre, the cafe will be open to the general public.For the uninitiated, the concept is headed by Irish chef Michael Quinn and Singaporean Gillian Pua and is beloved for its range of unique creations that fuse Eastern and Western flavours.\xa0The duo met while working at the iconic Swiss farm-to-table restaurant Marche Singapore, and decided to team up to open a hawker stall with Quinn at the helm as head chef.Details about the new space are still being kept under wraps, but we can’t wait to see what its first foray into the cafe space would look like.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Feuds: Saizeriya vs Milan Shokudo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMartin’s Kitchen: New restaurant serves unique Hakka-inspired dishes with Mexican and European influences\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatisserie Cle brings its well-crafted pastries to new River Valley flagship for fifth anniversary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCo-owner Pua told HungryGoWhere that the menu would remain the same, and be lard-free and pork-free.

For bubble tea lovers, that means one thing — LiHo Tea’s beloved “Be My K-Strawberry Sweetheart” drinks are back for the fifth year running.\xa0This year’s edition of the series brings back two crowd favourites — the K-Strawberry Latte (S$7.90 in store, S$9.10 for delivery) and K-Strawberry Jing Syuan (S$7.30 in store, S$8.40 for delivery). And making its debut is a cool K-Strawberry Coconut Shake (S$7.30 in store, S$8.40 for delivery).Fans will recognise the drinks from the iconic cups. The cups, made specially for this series, are shaped adorably like strawberries and topped with a green “leaf” cap — talk about IG-worthy!The drinks are offered only in one size and will be available from Feb 9, 2023 until further notice.\xa0If you’re looking to have the drinks delivered to you, they’ll be available exclusively via one service provider — GrabFood — in the opening weeks from Feb 9 to 23, 2023. (Pro tip: Use your GrabUnlimited subscription for up to 20% off self-pickup orders.)What’s the secret to making these drinks so addictive? It’s the inclusion of Korean strawberries, which are known to be sweeter, juicier and less acidic than the normal varieties.\xa0What’s more, fresh Korean Seolhyang strawberries — one of the fruit’s most popular varieties in Korea — are handpicked and flown in from the gorgeous farms in Goryeong County, Gyeongbuk Province. These shipments happen every three to five days, to ensure the freshest and juiciest strawberries go into your drinks. It’s Korea’s strawberry season between January and March.\xa0Since Seolhyang strawberries are prone to damage and thus aren’t easily found in Singapore’s supermarkets, it’s one of the rare chances for strawberry lovers to indulge in their lusciousness.For the two classics LiHo is bringing back, the K-Strawberry Latte will probably capture the hearts of strawberry-milk fans. There’s a reason it’s the all-time bestseller — you can’t go wrong with the comforting blend of creamy fresh milk and strawberry.\xa0If milky drinks aren’t quite your speed, the K-Strawberry Jing Syuan is a little simpler, featuring the crisp and aromatic jing syuan tea as the base but with a tangy strawberry jolt to brighten things up.If you need to cool down from the enervating Singapore heat as the gloomy weather lets up, LiHo is unveiling the brand-new K-Strawberry Coconut Shake. This comes on the heels of its successful coconut drinks series rolled out recently.The most popular beverage in Singapore, coconut shakes are the perfect remedy to Singapore’s usually sweltering heat. But refreshing coconut slurry given the Midas touch of Korean-strawberry vibrancy? It’s a one-of-a-kind indulgence coconut shake fans wouldn’t want to miss.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNational Bubble Tea Day: 5 bubble tea facts that may surprise you\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReview: Xiabu Xiabu’s single-person hotpot is a treat for solo date nights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAtTea launches limited-edition milk tea series; celebrates 2nd anniversary in Singapore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBesides the drinks, another highlight of this release is the chance to win a trip to Korea.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/valentines-day-couples-food/:['Love is in the air — and on the plate — this Valentine’s Day (Feb 14).\xa0And while you’ve heard the cautionary tale of not dating those with whom you work, we spoke to four couples who have overcome that cliche to put the most important ingredient into your meals: Love.From hawkers serving Singaporean fare to the owners of a bustling cafe, we discover the heartwarming love stories behind these food establishments.\xa0Hawker power couple Elayne Ang, 42, and Samuel Tan, 38, were both fledglings in the F&B scene when they launched their Marine Parade stall, Tian Kee Carrot Cake and Hokkien Mee, in 2019.\xa0Before that, Ang was a senior trainer at a bank and Tan a regular in the army. While both of them were unfamiliar with the inner workings of the hawker trade, they shared a deep passion for food.“We would fight over the kitchen because we both enjoyed cooking,” recalls Ang.When the opportunity to run a stall presented itself through a friend, the couple leapt at the chance. They started selling carrot cake and Hokkien mee — Ang’s favourite hawker fare.\xa0With just time in their home kitchen to guide them, the couple struggled to find the right suppliers and perfect their recipe. Working together in a confined space also cranked up the pressure, especially since both of them had been in leadership roles.Despite the bumpy journey, Ang and Tan agreed that whatever happens at the stall stays there.“Once, I was so upset with him I turned off the lights and we stood in the stall for 30 minutes trying to resolve the problem before we went home,” Ang says.Tan adds that working together has brought them closer, as Ang’s previous job had longer, more demanding hours.\xa0Now, they get to see each other much more often, and even volunteer together at the Federation of Merchants’ Associations Singapore, an organisation dedicated to supporting Singapore hawkers. There, they help with event planning and relay issues hawkers face to the federation.\xa0Their hope? To attain official halal certification and continue building relationships with their regulars.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Junction Westgate opening with promos; will house 23 tenants, including new halal teppanyaki\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHawker Hustlers: Hipster hawker Ray Yeo of Bei-Ing Dimsum Club on reinventing dim sum and his love for all things Japan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith its retro booths, neon lights and casual vibes, Parliament Bar is a space inspired by the American dive-bar experience.\xa0Hidden away on the second floor of a shophouse along Teck Lim Road, it’s the brainchild of the folks behind Marcy’s. The bar launched in 2022.\xa0Bringing the concept to fruition were partners Trisha Lee, 30, and Daniel Raghani, 29, who met at Level 33, their previous workplace.\xa0“We bonded over John Mayer,” Lee recounts. “I remember I said Edge of Desire was my favourite song and told him my favourite part in the lyrics when he completed my sentence for me.”While most embrace fresh beginnings, the pair say opening Parliament Bar was a challenging time.\xa0With Raghani at the helm of much of the work, he was under immense pressure, while Lee was burnt out from toiling away at Marcy’s. Raghani oversees the bar, while Lee handles everything else from the food to administration.\xa0“We just had to retain whatever’s left of our sanity and just help the other person as much as we could,” Lee says.\xa0This thread of understanding and support from working in the same environment underlies the unwavering trust in their relationship.Adds Raghani: “It’s good to know that there’s someone you fully trust and who has your back. I feel like our bond is stronger.”Working in the F&B line comes with colossal demands — from managing customers to keeping a lid on costs — and being able to rely on each other has made a big difference for Lee.“Having someone at work that you can 100% trust usually doesn’t happen,” Lee continues. “It’s tough in the F&B line, as there aren’t many female managers. So it was important for me that someone always ‘saw’ me and I can talk to that person.”While starting another concept is not on the books for Raghani anytime soon, the pair has other aspirations — perhaps even performing music together someday.\xa0Muffin Homme, a new entrant to Bukit Canberra Hawker Centre, has won over patrons with its unique, healthier muffin offerings.\xa0But, really, it’s the love story of the husband-and-wife duo behind the stall that’s warming our hearts.\xa0Wu Yuxuan, 35, and Tan Khal Chiang, 38, met while working at a local bakery about a decade ago.\xa0Wu later took a short break and ventured into a corporate role. But the couple decided to return to their first love — baking — and launch Muffin Homme.It allows the pair, who live near their stall, the flexibility of spending time with their two kids, aged one and three, and experiment with different flavours. Their muffins do not have artificial colouring or preservatives, and are made with a low-sugar formula mixed with natural yoghurt.\xa0\xa0At their previous bakery, Wu and Tan navigated long hours at work, making it difficult to find quality time even for themselves. That, however, did not stop the couple from pursuing their relationship.\xa0“Those times helped me realise that he was a man that I could rely on,” Wu says. “I remember one incident where my leg was swollen from standing for long hours. So he sent me back at 11pm and helped to massage my legs.”But why muffins specifically, you may ask? Wu jokes: “I have a sweet tooth. It’s so sweet that I married him.”\xa0Although running an F&B business is a back-breaking affair, Wu says there are many perks that come with working together.\xa0“We know what the other person’s doing, have common topics, and learn how to put ourselves in the other’s shoes,” she says. “I also like that I get to see a different, more serious side of him when he’s working.”While it’s still early days for Muffin Homme, the entrepreneurial couple hopes to stabilise their venture before looking to expand in future. Homeground Coffee Roasters has been an institution for coffee drinkers since its inception in 2017. Founded and led by couple Elysia Tan and Tay Ho Ming, along with Tay’s cousin, the cafe relocated in 2022 from its Joo Chiat stronghold to Outram Park.The coffee masters have been hard at work since. Last year, Tan put Homeground Coffee Roasters (and Singapore) on the map after she came in as the second runner-up at the World Brewers Cup — the first Singaporean to bag that achievement.\xa0Given that coffee is such a big part of their lives, it’s unsurprising that Tan and Tay met while working at a cafe.“Initially, I didn’t like him. I really hated working with him, too,” Tan says with disarming honesty. “He was quite annoying… I was wondering: ‘Who is this guy?’”\xa0After surmounting initial hesitations, the pair slowly bonded over their passion for coffee and suppers.\xa0Her impression of Tay also turned: “After seeing him at work, I realised there are certain things that he’s just very straightforward about. It’s not like he’s trying to be annoying or to offend you. I came to know that this is just him being him.”Fast forward to the present day and they’ve grown what started as an online business into a bustling cafe.\xa0After almost six years of working together, one thing has remained at the heart of their relationship: Their vision of growing the number of coffee homebrewers in Singapore.\xa0At their cafe, Tan and Tay are clear-eyed about the need to minimise conflict — something especially critical when they’re leading their teams at Homeground Coffee Roasters.“People might feel stressed if they’re working for a couple, so we don’t (argue in front of them). If there are any fights, we bring it home,” Tan adds.\xa0The couple, thankfully, hasn’t fought much since starting work on Homeground.They attribute it to understanding each other fully — from their shared business goals to the challenges faced at work.\xa0Tay says: “Being in the same environment makes it very easy for me to understand what she’s going through from point to point.”\xa0Although the couple got engaged last year, they haven’t had the chance to hold a wedding ceremony.\xa0Tan likens working with Tay to brewing coffee.\xa0“We call it ‘calibration’,” she says, referring to a term common in the world of coffee.\xa0“You have to calibrate with each other, and get to know what the other party’s style and way of communicating are… We do value our day-to-day time together.”\xa0Tian Kee Carrot Cake and Hokkien Mee, Muffin Homme, and Homeground Coffee Roasters are on GrabFood and offering free delivery (up to S$3 off) with GrabUnlimited.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/haidilao-mala-milk-broth-new-menu/:['A heads up to all hotpot fans: There’s now a mala broth that you can gulp down, courtesy of Haidilao.The hotpot giant has unveiled a new, milky version of its fan favourite spicy broth, alongside a slate of nine other new menu mainstays. These will be available from Friday (Feb 10) at all Haidilao stores in Singapore.According to the restaurant, the mala milk broth (single pot S$28, double pot S$16, quarter pot S$11) was formulated after receiving feedback from many customers who loved the taste of its original mala broth, but found it hard to drink.At HungryGoWhere’s taste test, we found it certainly made for easier drinking. The milk tempered the broth’s usual levels of spice and its oily consistency, and gave the soup a creamier body than usual.However, it may still run a little spicy for your liking — if that’s the case, you may request a milder version when placing your order.A post shared by HungryGoWhere (@hungrygowhere)The refreshed menu also comes with a souped-up version of yet another crowd favourite — the Signature Mashed Shrimpwah paste. As its name suggests, the tobiko chunky prawn paste (S$28) comes with a heap of flying fish roe and larger chunks of prawns. This was then thoroughly mixed tableside — thanks to our helpful server — before it’s portioned and deftly dropped into the boiling pot.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15 best fish head curry in Singapore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15 places to get the best fishball noodles in Singapore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe original dish is delightfully chewy in its own right, but this latest addition gives each bite an added dimension of texture. Just think: Tiny popping globules of fish egg with each bite.Another highlight is Haidilao’s new beef in milk bath (S$36), comprising tender wagyu cubes doused in pasteurised cow’s milk. The result is a tender and juicy, albeit small, morsel of beefy goodness. We found ourselves having to cook three or four pieces at a go for a good mouthful.If you love beef tongue, be sure to try the Sichuan Pepperfect Beef Tongue (S$30 for a whole, S$15 for half portion) marinated in Sichuan pepper oil.Three new carb options are joining the menu, too. There’s the low-fat, low-cal konjac slices dish (S$9 for a whole, S$4.50 for half portion) — which bears a striking resemblance to beef tripe — as well as sweet potato noodles (S$8 for a whole, S$4 for half portion) and waterfall potato noodles (S$7 for a whole, S$3.50 for half portion). We found that the latter especially was prone to disintegrating into the soup, so keep a watchful eye out for it and fish it out of the steaming broth early!Round off the meal with the new brown sugar lava cakes (S$8), which can be peeled apart to reveal an oozy centre of brown sugar syrup. Be careful, though — it can be quite hot!Drinks-wise, a new line of fizzy drinks is making an appearance. The Fizzy Sour Plum Pop (S$4) and Fizzy Strawberry Pop (S$4) come in a small jug that’s great for sharing, and we found them a refreshing thirst quencher to wash down the meal.Haidilao is on the GrabFood delivery service and offering free delivery (up to S$3 off) with GrabUnlimited.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/riders-cafe-to-close/:['Popular brunch spot Riders Cafe is set to close its doors for good on Feb 19, 2023, after 15 years of operation at its Bukit Timah location.Announcing the news on Riders Cafe’s social media platforms on Monday (Oct 3), co-founder Jan Yeo said the cafe has to vacate its premises to make way for tunnelling work for the Cross Island Line (CRL).\xa0The CRL, when completed, will be Singapore’s longest fully underground MRT line. It will connect residents from Changi to Jurong Lake district, running through Hougang, Ang Mo Kio and Turf City.\xa0Responding to queries from HungryGoWhere, a publicist for the cafe said it received news of the scheduled urban redevelopment via an online article in September 2021. As Riders Cafe subleases the space from Bukit Timah Saddle Club, it is not privy to information from the authorities — it gets updates only from the club.\xa0Bukit Timah Saddle Club itself is set to vacate its premises by the first half of 2023 and move to its new home in Woodlands.Riders Cafe has been a reprieve for residents who are hungry for nature and in search of tranquillity away from the bustling city.\xa0Housed in a charming two-storey colonial-era building that’s nestled amid lush greenery, the eatery is a popular destination for horse riders, hikers and foodies alike. It serves up delicious food and drinks with a side of ambience — you get to enjoy your meal in a breezy environment while admiring the sight of horses from Bukit Timah Saddle Club galloping across vast fields.Fan favourites from the cafe’s menu include the breakfast platter of eggs, bacon, breakfast banger, mushrooms, tomato, baby spinach, beans and rustic bread from the brunch menu; the fried chicken and corn cakes, and Riders Burger — a classic burger with a 200g Angus beef patty, American cheddar and house burger sauce — from the lunch menu; and kabocha and kale, a vegan option from the dinner menu.\xa0Yeo, who founded Riders Cafe in 2007 with an advertising agency ex-colleague, Willa Wong, said they did not have any experience running an F&B business. They started out with a three-year lease, uncertain how that would go. Along the way, they faced plenty of challenges, including manpower issues — due to the remote location — and frequent power outages.“Riders Cafe has always existed on borrowed time as the lease on the space is renewed intermittently. Despite that, what could be a short summer fling has blossomed into a 15-year love affair,” Yeo said.\xa0“My vision was to introduce and share with people this hidden corner of Bukit Timah, by showing them that special places like Riders Cafe do exist in Singapore.”\xa0While the pair considered relocating their restaurant to continue serving their loyal customers, they could not find a satisfactory location.\xa0For instance, they explored the option of continuing to operate in Bukit Timah Saddle Club’s new Woodlands location. Yet they felt the site does not have the same sense of space as the Bukit Timah location.The duo were also against the idea of moving into a mall, as it would not be a “compelling dining experience”. Given the circumstances, they decided to close Riders Cafe permanently.\xa0Calling the closure “disappointing” but beyond their control, Yeo said they “had a good run”. They are not ruling out the possibility of reopening “if the right location and building comes along that suits the theme”.As for their plans, Yeo and Wong will focus on their other F&B ventures — Red Eye Smokehouse and Rex. Red Eye Smokehouse is a seven-year-old restaurant in Jalan Besar that serves “smoked low and slow” American barbecued meats. Rex, on the other hand, is a cocktail bar next to Red Eye Smokehouse, which opened in August.Riders Cafe is on the GrabFood delivery service.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/white-rabbit-keong-saik-bakery/:['Even though Valentine’s Day is behind us, there’s no reason to stop looking for a rush of sweetness and love.\xa0Keong Saik Bakery, known for its locally inspired sweet treats, is teaming up with the brand behind the White Rabbit candy of our childhood to roll out limited-edition Valentine’s Day desserts.The dessert specials will be sold exclusively at its Chip Bee Gardens store until the end of February. We’re happy to report that the items — available only as a set — are a delightful treat.\xa0The \u200b\u200bWhite Rabbit ice-cream cruffin and White Rabbit ice-cream affogato (S$12) make for a bundle of mouthwatering sweetness that’s a perfect afternoon treat. The affogato combines cocoa-powder-adorned White Rabbit ice cream with an espresso shot served on the side.The bakery uses Tiong Hoe Specialty Coffee’s rich and nutty espresso roast, which was a fabulous counterpoint to the sweetness of the White Rabbit ice cream.\xa0On the whole, it was an enjoyable combination.Afterwards, indulge in the cruffin, a croissant-muffin hybrid that’s stuffed with White Rabbit ice cream and topped with condensed milk. While it sounds saccharine, we found ourselves taking bite after bite.\xa0We expected to be somewhat overwhelmed by the combination. Instead, the cruffin pastry blew us away with its crisp, fluffy texture, while the ice cream added a creamy, milky depth to the dessert, which wasn’t too cloying.\xa0Even if you aren’t a fan of the milk-based sticky candy, you may surprise yourself by enjoying these sweet treats.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Junction Westgate opening with promos; will house 23 tenants, including new halal teppanyaki\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Feuds: Saizeriya vs Milan Shokudo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatisserie Cle brings its well-crafted pastries to new River Valley flagship for fifth anniversary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you’re a big fan, however, get the White Rabbit cup ice cream (S$5.50).

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/habibi-san-haji-lane/:['On first mention, Habibi-san’s name rolls off your tongue like an intriguing premise.We tried picturing what an alternative Middle Eastern-style izakaya gastrobar would serve, but nothing prepared us for the experience, which turned out to be an unexpected foray into the exotic and unknown.Hunting down the restaurant felt like a little adventure in itself.Tucked away among the many shophouses of Haji Lane, the entrance is nondescript.A steep staircase climb up, you’ll find yourself among guests lingering around a communal bar area run by bespoke cocktail trailblazer Bar Stories, known for its imaginative custom-made concoctions.Past a tiny archway, you’re thrust into the world of Habibi-san.At the modern izakaya, the complexity of each dish — lively and bold in its own right — is enough to make the most hardened of food critics sit up and take notice.You can tell the chefs here mean business.Yet there’s a sense of unbridled joy as they play around with the flavours, subverting expectations and dishing out one delicious surprise after another.In Arabic, Habibi means “darling”, while “san” is a Japanese honorific.Founded in December 2020, Habibi-san is the culinary brainchild of chefs Jonathan Lee and Nadine Tay, who have both clocked time at Middle Eastern-inspired restaurant Artichoke in Bugis.Tay, named Rising Female Chef of the Year at this year’s World Gourmet Awards, has more than a decade of experience at Wild Honey and the now-closed restaurants Cocotte and Wolf.At Habibi-san, Tay is the head chef in charge of manning the grill, responsible for infusing the dishes with a smoky goodness. But beyond that, there’s not much online information surrounding the origins of the restaurant, which adds to the sense of intrigue.\xa0Cosy and intimate, the dimly lit shophouse was packed to the gills on the Thursday evening we visited.A Middle Eastern concept wouldn’t be complete without the classic pita bread and dip combination.The mentaiko taramasalata (S$13) was marvellously executed — with mentaiko XO sauce being folded into housemade labneh (Greek yogurt) with a hint of a sharp tang, sweet tobiko, crispy shallots, and chives. Slather it all over pillowy-soft pita bread (S$3 per piece) or savour the creamy umami goodness on its own.Dramatic as it sounds, the biggest regret of the night would have materialised if we skipped out ordering the roasted Brussels sprouts (S$18).Initially sceptical, it took a fair bit of persuading and prodding by my Brussels-sprout-loving companions to give it a go. Best described as life-changing, the unassuming greens were elevated by the chef’s sheer wizardry.An explosion of smoky sweetness, the vegetables were caramelised to perfection, tossed with Kinno Gomadare (a Japanese sesame dressing), pickled red cabbage and jalapenos. And in a stroke of genius, they were laid atop a bed of crunchy and flavourful bonito flakes. The interplay of flavours and textures was simply addictive.There’s much to rave about the other dishes at Habibi-san as well.Take the DeRaza Iberico pork collar shogayaki (S$39), cooked over coals to a perfect blush of pink, and elevated by burnt broccoli tabouleh dressed with wafu vinaigrette.The meat was charred, tender and juicy, with just the right amount of fat.The dishes went beautifully with cocktails from its neighbour Bar Stories.I requested something refreshing, citrusy and strong, and the waiter presented me with flourish a bespoke cocktail of my desires (S$24) that melded Scotch whisky, absinthe, lime and lemon.My dining companions had a cocktail (S$23) with dark rum and gin as well as gula melaka, ginger, spiced liquor and cinnamon.After all the drama and flair from the previous dishes, the Fremantle octopus (S$25) was sadly underwhelming.With a single, lonely, chopped-up tendril presented with sauce, the plating was disappointing.Thankfully, for the taste profile itself, the octopus was decently fresh and chewy, with an accompanying macadamia tahini sauce bursting with nuttiness.As for desserts, we reckon you can give them a miss.Habibi-san’s Nama-style chocolate tart (S$13) was ordinary — almost pedestrian — and tasted like an average chocolate tart you’d find elsewhere. It comes with 70 per cent Guanaja chocolate, dulce de leche (cooked condensed milk), peanuts, and kinako cream with sea salt.Likewise, the sakura malabi (S$13) — a cherry blossom milk pudding with rhubarb jam and compressed strawberries — was incredibly light but forgettable.And just like that, two hours whizzed by.With grudging reluctance, my companions and I gave up our seats for the next round of diners arriving at 9pm. We gazed longingly at one group of diners still merrily tucking into omakase (S$68 per guest, or S$100 per guest for a more premium option) at a long table by the windows. Perhaps next time.We’re all fired up for our next visit.\xa0Is it conducive to conversation? It’s hard to talk above the din.Is a reservation necessary? It can get incredibly packed, so make a reservation here.How to get there? It’s a short walk from Bugis MRT station.\xa0HungryGoWhere paid for its meal at this restaurant for this review.\xa0 \n\nBook a ride to Habibi-san.55 Haji Lane\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (5.30pm to 10.30pm)55 Haji Lane\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (5.30pm to 10.30pm)AuthorEe Ming is a storyteller with a love of photography, insightful reads, films, and offbeat and obscure places.

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/rooftop-bars-singapore/:['Singapore, while small, boasts a phenomenal city skyline.\xa0Its cityscape is a magnificent one filled with towering, modern skyscrapers of striking designs, offering diners picture-perfect opportunities for an after-dark sojourn at a rooftop bar.\xa0Now that the city’s nightlife has returned to full swing, it’s the perfect time to impress a date over some drinks while being accompanied by the resplendent sight of buildings such as architectural marvel Marina Bay Sands. It’s an ambience to get lost in and a core memory that will linger long after.\xa0If that sounds like what you need, then reserve a table at one of these rooftop bars that promise to provide the greatest views in Singapore and the most memorable experiences.National Gallery Singapore, 06-01, 1 Saint Andrew’s Road\nOpening hours: Monday to Wednesday (6pm to 12am), Thursday to Saturday (6pm to 1am), Sunday (5pm to 12am)Why visit?

Also, don’t miss out on the crispy fries (S$12), which come with an option of thick, silky truffle paste (+S$4) on the side.Faber Peak, 109 Mount Faber Road\nOpening hours: Monday to Friday (12pm to 10.30pm), Saturday and Sunday (8.30am to 10.30pm)Why visit?

Compared to many of the swanky rooftop bars on the list, Foxtail comes with a much more laid-back vibe. It’s a quaint second-floor hideout where you can chat the night away against the backdrop of pulsating beats, lush potted greens, and a bird’s eye view of the bustling Keong Saik Road.Oh, and did we mention that all drinks are presented with nett prices between S$18 to S$22, and the bar doesn’t impose GST or service charges? A rare thing to see at a cocktail bar!Price range: $$Crowd favourites: The drinks menu boasts a whole range of styles, from the refreshing Doses & Mimosas (S$18) that comes with a hint of fresh basil, to the spirit-forward 1 for Da Road (S$22) with mezcal, honey and lime. While it doesn’t have a kitchen, it offers food from neighbours Pastaria Abate, in case anyone feels peckish. Expect simple, hearty bites such as the margherita pizzette (S$15) and focaccia (S$15).Courtyard by Marriott Singapore Novena, Level 33, 99 Irrawaddy Road\nOpening hours: Tuesday to Friday (5pm to 1am), Saturday and Sunday (11am to 1am)Why visit? Las Palmas Bar is one of the newest rooftop bars to pop up in Singapore, and it sets itself apart with a chic and vibrant Californian theme. It’s dominated by swathes of tropical and pastel tones — a quirky and eccentric atmosphere that gives off a Wes Anderson vibe.There’s nothing quite like sinking into one of its comfortable sofa seats, with a cool drink in hand, while revelling in the vibrant pool party ambience. More importantly, the poolside setup makes this an exceptional spot for that all-important OOTD.Price range: $$$Crowd favourites: Las Palmas Bar’s food menu mainly comprises Western bites with an Asian twist — think salted-egg-loaded chicken tacos Clock Out Cluck In (S$15) and churros (S$13) served with nostalgic kaya and peanut butter. On the other hand, the drinks menu is meant to whimsically recreate the mood of the 60s. So expect pop culture references in drink names, including Cheesecake Factory (S$25) and Big Trouble in Little China (S$25).Beauty World Food Centre, 04-61, 144 Upper Bukit Timah Road\nOpening hours: Monday to Friday (4pm to 10.30pm), Saturday and Sunday (3pm to 10.30pm)Why visit? Wiped Out represents a small departure from the other rooftop bars on this list. Instead of the usual suspects in the CBD, it’s located in the far-flung Beauty World Centre at its fourth storey-food centre.Don’t be daunted by the location though — the no-frills industrial-style bar boasts a certain rustic charm, where you can admire the sunset while surrounded by neat rows of houses in the Bukit Timah area. Also, how unique is it to find a rooftop bar inside a hawker centre? Prices are affordable at this bar, especially with happy hour offers running from opening till 7.30pm daily!Price range: $Crowd favourites: Wiped Out is one of the more popular watering holes in the west, where 300ml bottles from brands such as Asahi and Heinken are affordably priced at S$5 during happy hour or S$6 during regular hours. There are also fresh pints available straight from the tap starting from S$8 for a pint during happy hour or S$9 during usual hours.Customs House, 02-02, 70 Collyer Quay\xa0\nOpening hours: Monday to Saturday (12pm to 3pm, 6pm to 10.30pm) Why visit? Located by the water, The Customs House is known to be a hot date spot and Kinki is just the cherry on top, offering stunning waterfront views. Little wonder why — the edgy contemporary Japanese bar boasts groovy beats, cool murals and an unbeatable bustling energy.Besides its fun atmosphere, Kinki is also an establishment known for pushing the envelope with its creative style of fusion that incorporates bold Western elements into familiar Japanese flavours. If work allows, pop by between 5pm and 8pm to enjoy its happy hour deals.Price range: $$$Crowd favourites: Many fans swear by its photogenic sushi rolls, such as the Golden Age (seared salmon, mentaiko sauce, mango puree, cucumber, avocado, chives, salmon roe, soy reduction, S$32). If you’re not too keen on fusion flavours, another popular order is obviously the tried-and-tested salmon sashimi (S$21 for five pieces) — can’t go wrong with that. Wash it down with one of its cheeky cocktails, such as the Naughty Kopi (S$22) with rum, kahlua coffee liqueur, espresso and Baileys Irish Cream.36 Keong Saik Road, Level 4\nOpening hours: Monday to Sunday (5pm to 12am)Why visit? A familiar name for regular visitors to the city of Bali, Potato Head is the Singapore outpost of the group behind the wildly popular Indonesian beach club — except our local version isn’t a beach club. Instead, it’s a multi-concept establishment that features a specialty burger bar and a bar, all under one roof(top).Festooned with lines of fairy lights and surrounded by potted plants, the eclectic setup at Potato Head‘s rooftop is cosy and comforting — almost like you’re being hosted for a dinner party in a friend’s backyard.Price range: $$Crowd favourites: Burger lovers can order the juicy burgers from Three Buns Singapore while at the rooftop bar. That means you can pair the tropical or tiki cocktails offered there with decadent meals such as the Smokin’ B-Boy (S$25), an earthy bun with smoked applewood cheddar, Dingley Dell beer bacon, BBQ ketchup and bawang goreng, and the punchy Burning Man (S$21) with gochujang, ketchup and jalapeño relish. Other bites include rice bowls and loaded fries.Waterboat House, 03-01, 3 Fullerton Road\nOpening hours: Monday to Sunday (11am to 12am)Why visit? Picotin may be a new find even for regular bar hoppers. It’s nestled atop the Fullerton Waterboat House, a history-rich colonial building from 1919 that resides at the entrance of the Singapore River.This riverside rooftop bar gets you up close and personal with Marina Bay Sands and the surrounding skyline, while also keeping you cool and relaxed as the seafront breeze ruffles your hair.\xa0Price range: $$$Crowd favourites: Picotin has been in operation since 2007 and has amassed plenty of fans with its hearty range of European classics. This ranges from the signature Pinto pizza (tomato, mozzarella, parma ham, rocket salad, parmesan cheese, S$26) to juicy rib-eye (S$46 for 300g) cooked with wood fire.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/koi-the/:['In love with bubble tea, or\xa0all things Matcha? Well, there’s ‘Matcha’ to love about the new bubble tea creations from KOI. (Sorry, couldn’t resist.)\n\nOriginating from Taiwan, the Matcha latte and macchiato bubble tea were first offered by Taiwanese bubble tea chain 50. The striking, contrasting green and white layers of the drinks made them highly instagrammable, which led to them growing wildly popular. The fact that they were sold in limited quantities daily further boosted the hype.Now the drinks are available in Singapore, thanks to KOI, and locals can finally taste what the craze is about.The Matcha latte bubble tea ($4.10/$5.70), unlike many of the other bubble teas sold at KOI, isn’t shaken for you; you do the shaking yourself. We couldn’t tell what all the ingredients that went into the drink were, but it’s obvious that milk and matcha powder went into the mix.When shaken and mixed, the lattes have a light, dirty green hue that was certainly visually arresting. But taste-wise, the drinks fared pretty well too.The service crew recommended the ‘normal’ sugar level (100%) to fully mask the bitterness of the matcha, but we found it too sweet. In comparison, the less sugar (70%) option tasted better — we could discern the (mild) bitterness from the matcha powder, which blended well with the sweetness of the drink — an ideal matcha mix in our opinion.The Matcha Macchiato ($4.10/$5.70) differs from the latte in terms of texture. The milk used for the macchiato was creamier as compared to the one used for the latte, which resulted in a milkier and smoother aftertaste.With that said, there are mulitple ways to enjoy the drink. You can either make an small cut on the top of the cup, taking sips of the creamy milk togther with the matcha goodness, or just shake the whole thing and enjoy it as one complete whole. But one thing is for sure, whichever way you drink it, this is certainly an indulgence to watch out for.From 1-7 June, KOI Singapore is giving out ‘GotMatcha’d 1FOR1’ vouchers\xa0for KOI Card registered members. Simply present your KOI card at any outlet to redeem a one-for-one offer! Available for redemption once only.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/pepper-lunch/:['Most people will consider wagyu steaks a pretty expensive meal, but Pepper Lunch is planning to change that, by offering the cuts of premium beef for as low as $19.90 a set.Pepper Lunch, the Japanese fast-service chain known for its hotplate meals, has introduced a new Premium Beef Series made from Washugyu Wagyu. This will be the first time this beef, which is a cross between the US Angus and the Japanese Wagyu breeds, is available in Singapore.Part of its permanent menu, the Premium Beef Series will be prepared differently according to the season. For the autumn season, which I tried, Pepper Lunch is serving Washugyu Wagyu Flank Steak.One of the things I liked about Pepper Lunch’s concept is that you can play chef and cook the beef to your preferred doneness. However, amateur cooks need to beware, leave your beef lying for too long and you might overcook the underside like I did!Despite the well-doneness on one side, the wagyu was still extremely tender and sweet. To make things even tastier, I added a generous amount of Honey Brown Sauce to the beef, which I think went really well with it.Have it with rice and you will find that the juices from the steak mix really well with the sauce which made every bite is satisfyingly good. I was never a steak-with-rice type of person but after this, I am definitely converting.Pepper Lunch offers its Premium Beef Series hotplates in two portions, $19.90 for 180g of steak, or $23.90 for 230g. You also get a small side dish plus a bowl of rice.Diners have a selection of side dishes to choose from: Corn and Broccoli, King Oyster Mushroom and Corn, as well as Cheesy Prawn and Broccoli Casserole. While I loved the Washugyu steaks, the sides were nothing much to shout about. I went for the prawn and broccoli casserole as I am not a big fan of oyster mushrooms. I found the portion of prawns quite generous (I counted about 4 in there), but I thought that the casserole as a whole was slightly too watery for my liking.Also new on Pepper Lunch’s seasonal menu is its limited-edition dessert item. The Chocolate Tiramisu Soft Serve ($3.60) comes with coffee crumble, light mascarpone cheese, cocoa powder and chocolate sauce, all layered to form a dreamy dessert.While I found the chocolate sauce very reminiscent of the Hot Fudge Sundae from McDonald’s, the combination of the lightly sweet mascarpone cheese and the cocoa powder elevates the flavour of this dessert and made it a winner. Plus, the crunchy coffee crumble bits give you that added crunch too! Try this before its promotional period ends on the 13th of November.Pepper Lunch has always been a great option for good food especially when you are in a pinch. Now, with premium new items such as their Washugyu steak and the limited edition Chocolate Tiramisu Soft Serve, you can live it up even if you are on a budget.The Washugyu Wagyu Flank Steak and The Chocolate Tiramisu Soft Serve are available from now till 13th November 2019.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/mcdonalds/:['Have you always wanted to know what goes into preparing your McDonald’s Happy Meal? We do. So when we were invited to take a peek at what happens at its JEM outlet, we seized the chance. Were we surprised? Yes, and surprisingly not in a bad way.While the McDonald’s kitchen is no Michelin-starred kitchen (it is just burgers and fries), and there are no chef’s whites or toques here, the ubiquitous burger empire\xa0runs with the smooth efficiency of a well-oiled machine that’s hard to replicate.With 36,000\xa0outlets in more than 100 countries globally, Singapore’s first outlet was opened in 1979 at Liat Towers\xa0and today there are over 130 outlets in on the island serving up to 6 million customers\xa0every month. One of the reasons why Macs ranks as many individual’s favourite burger joint is a combination of familiarity and a rotating menu of new products like the Prosperity Burger, Veggie Burger, and Ebi Burger\xa0and thus new food experiences for their fans.First stop: The French fries stationAh, the famous fries. Russet Burbank\xa0potatoes are used; to crisp them and to add flavour, no animal extract or seasoning is used, just a shower of salt. For a healthier option, McDonald’s switched to canola blend oil since 2014, a move which they claim has reduced the level of saturated fat in their Chicken McNuggets by 30 per cent. While we’ll have to take their word on it, we’re comforted that the icky stuff in the oil (above) is managed. Back in 2012, McDonald’s installed high tech frying vats with filters to auto prompt and remind cooks to change the oil after six rounds of frying.Now to dispel some urban legends. Remember that one about McDonald’s grinding up pink slime — beef trimmings treated with ammonia — to make their Chicken McNuggets? Not true, at least according to their “Our Food, Your Questons” series.For today’s tour, according to their spokesperson, their\xa0chicken comes from Thailand and Malaysia and are raised on hormone-free feed. They use 100 per cent white meat for McNuggets while the McSpicy burgers are made with thigh meat, and the new Crispy Chicken Sandwich is made with 100 per cent chicken breast meat.Food prep wise, McDonald’s takes extra care for the patties to be stored in heated containers of 93 degrees Celsius to be assembled as and when the orders come in. There’s a different holding time for evey meat and protein. It’s 15 minutes for beef and 30 minutes for chicken and they are discarded if they aren’t used within that time, to maintain quality control.To minimise wastage, McDonald’s has adopted a ‘Made For You’ production management system that forecasts the quantity of products that the kitchen needs to prepare; this means that they only prepare what is necessary. They cook in smaller quantities but cook more often.\xa0This is the station for workers to customise the popular Create Your Taste burgers. The concept was introduced in 2015 and fans can choose from more than 25 ingredients like grilled pineapple, Pepper Jack cheese, and guacamole\xa0to build the burgers of their dreams. This could be the answer to the hype surrounding McDonald’s secret menu\xa0although the options are not very extensive at the moment.The Quarter-Pounder burger patty is also called the “4 to 1” which refers to the measurement of the beef weight per patty — “4 to 1” means four pieces of patties equals to one pound of beef.\xa0To avoid contamination, blue plastic gloves are worn to handle raw ingredients while white plastic gloves are meant for the preparation of cooked food.The beef in your classic cheeseburgers and Quarter-Pounders come from Australia and they use the clam-shell method to cook their patties in these futuristic machines. Again, they claim no extra fat added — just salt and pepper.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

A pity.\nWhat they still retain are their cheap abalone slices in every bowl.\nIt comes reasonably soft and upps the seafood flavour a bit.\nThe clear soup on the side comes nicely rounded and peppery.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/o-m-g-cafe/:['This stall was once known for its sweet potato balls in the Pasar Malam scene. Recently, they unveiled their first-ever container-themed outlet – the O.M.G cafe.Spotting graffiti of our local food scene on their walls, this new eatery serves the crowd-favourite sweet potato balls and other Pasar Malam signatures like the Ramly Burger.Located at Haji Lane, the O.M.G cafe was packed with people when we visited early evening.The guests were not just busy purchasing the savoury and sweet treats on the menu, but they were also snapping photographs with the Instagram-able wall art.Though it was crowded at the start, the staff prepared the orders quickly, so it took us only about 10 minutes to receive our orders.We purchased the mixed signature sweet potato balls, Chicken cheese Ramly burger, Cheese Nana, Thai Milk Tea, Strawberry Milk with Jelly and their Grape Sparkling drink.OUR REVIEWTheir sweet potato balls come in plain, cheese and peanut with milk flavours (priced from $5 to $7).\xa0We picked the plain charcoal and signature ones as we wanted to taste the traditional flavours.This sweet treat was not just aesthetically pleasing, but they were delicious as well.You could taste the fresh sweet potato notes that were complemented by the texture of the balls. We enjoyed how crispy yet chewy the texture of these sweet potato balls was.Thankfully, they had not compromised this dish for the other new items on their menu.Speaking about new items, we decided to give their Cheese Nana ($7) a try.The serving for this dish is perfect for sharing among three to four people. It holds four slices of battered crispy bananas.If you love Goreng Pisang, this is a must-try for you. However, they have added a sweet and cheesy touch to the traditional banana dessert.Atop the banana fritters, you can find generous servings of shredded cheese and sugar. The cheese balanced out the sweetness in the dish, so it was just nice for our taste buds.Next, we went for a savoury bite with their Chicken Cheese Ramly burger ($6).Just like the usual beloved Ramly burgers, this came with an omelette wrapped chicken. However, this version had a little more cheese and was not too spicy or peppery as well.The cheese balanced out spice and pepper, while the omelette was not too thick, allowing you to enjoy the flavours of all the ingredients well.This had to be one of our favourites as it was such a good throwback to the physical Ramadan bazaars that we got to enjoy in previous years.To finish off our meal, we drank their Thai Milk Tea. Firstly, all their beverages were packaged in pocket-sized rectangular bottles and came with a little hat too.The portions of the drinks were rather little for the price point of about $4 to $5. Nevertheless, their bottle designs made for good photos, so we aren’t complaining.This Thai milk tea was a little sweeter than the other variations we have tried before. But, if you love Thai milk tea, you can’t go wrong with picking this beverage.Their Strawberry Milk with Jelly was visually pleasing as it had a layer of milk over some fresh strawberries and red jelly compote.After stirring it together and sipping it down, we realised that it tasted like an elevated version of strawberry milk.This might not be the best pick for those who want a lighter or more refreshing beverage. However, it is not often you get to enjoy fresh whole strawberries in milk so perhaps this would make for a good takeaway drink.The last drink that we had was their Grape Sparkling beverage. This beverage hit us with a mixture of sour and sweet notes and left us feeling a light burn in our throat.There was a bitter aftertaste that we did not quite enjoy.This was more of an experimental drink for us, but we did appreciate their fresh servings of grapes at the base layer of the drink.There are many other treats like their churros and roti john that we did not get to try yet, but overall, the dishes that we tried were surely worth the hype.While the drinks were not as exciting as we had hoped for, they are definitely worth trying for the colours and bold flavours.With a surge of scrumptious food, drinks and desserts popping up along Haji Lane, O.M.G cafe surely has quite a competition.So, the real question is: will we go down to Haji Lane for O.M.G cafe again?Yes, if we are in the mood for some childhood favourites!Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/bismillah-biryani/:['When Bismillah Biryani first burst onto the scene in 2001, it caused quite a stir among foodies because it sold the same style of biryanis only found in high-end North Indian restaurants but for much cheaper.Bismillah is the brainchild of Arif Salahuddin, now 41. Originally from Pakistan, he immigrated to Singapore a few decades ago.He was inspired to open Bismillah Biryani because he couldn’t find the sort of biryanis he was used to anywhere in Singapore.Cheap biryanis in Singapore are normally one of two styles: the Indian biryanis from south and central India and the local Indian muslim/Malay street “nasi” style of biryanis.At Bismillah, the biryanis are more “central Asian” in style — the area where the Middle East and South Asia meet (Afghanistan/Pakistan/Delhi).There is no curry gravy or dalcha on the side and the flavour comes from the meat, rice and masala spices. It is also cooked dum-style, where the meat and rice are steamed together.He opened a small shop in Dunlop Street and his cheaper-than-restaurant biryanis were an instant hit.Fast forward to 2019 and he has expanded to three more outlets — One North, Sixth Avenue and another at Shenton Way.When you tuck into a biryani at Bismillah, it’s clear why his food is so coveted.Only top grade long grain basmati rice is used and it comes wonderfully fluffy with no broken pieces. However, unlike other biryanis, the aroma is not as intense due to much less ghee used in the rice.Bismillah Biryani is marketed as a “healthier biryani” where supposedly no ghee is used but that’s strictly not true.While sunflower oil is used as the main oil for cooking, a few dollops of ghee is in fact spooned over every 14 portions of rice as an aromatic.The rice also has a complex flavour to it. On one level, there is a delicate savoury stock taste.But on top of that is a powerful taste of spices in the rice and in the highly savoury masala that is spread throughout the rice and the meat.The spice presence is much more prominent here as compared to the other biryanis in our best-of list.Examine the rice and you’ll see lots of peppercorns, star anise, cloves, dried chillies and the like.Every other spoonful of rice will contain a black peppercorn but it is okay to chew on them. There won’t be any sharp peppery burst as the flavour has gone into the rice.The fried onions sprinkled on top are especially nice as they add a nice herb sweetness to the dish.While Bismillah Biryani have seven biryani options listed, they will only have three or four on offer at any one time.Always on offer is the kid goat biryani and this is the main reason to go to Bismillah Biryani ($10/15/20). It uses young goat meat which means very tender and soft meat.The marinade has penetrated right through such that even the inner bits of meat are nicely flavoured.However, what you won’t get is the strong flavour of mutton, only found in older goats — a good or bad thing depending on your preference.They also do not debone the meat in the belief that it adds more flavour, so you will have to pick out small broken bones while you eat. A nuisance for some.There are also generous fatty bits thrown in and that helps with the richness of the rice especially as there is less ghee used.Portion wise, the $10 option is perfect for a small eater, but you’ll have to pay more if you have a large appetite.The other popular chicken option ($6/9/14) was much less appealing to us.While the dish is still nicely flavourful, the chicken meat always comes a bit dry as the skin is taken off the meat. The rice is not as oil-rich and far less compelling as a result.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/chao-ji-shao-la/:['Among the many roast meat stalls at Chinatown Complex, there are two sorts of stalls you will usually see — the highly popular Michelin type frequented by many tourists and some locals or stalls which only sees the occasional traffic\xa0 — usually by locals who work in offices nearby and who are in search of a quick meal.Then there is the third option, the rarest of them all —stalls which get a lot of foot traffic by a mainly local crowd of nearby residents and seasoned foodies because the food is seriously good, or good for the price, as it sometimes turns out to be.Chao Ji Shao La (Chao Ji Roasted Meats) falls into the third category because all three of its roasted meat options — roast duck, Char Siu and roasted pork — are very well executed in a traditional style.A business which began in the 1980s, this roast meat stall is run by 63-year-old Charence Leong who has been in the business for 30 years and will likely not continue the trade as none of his children are interested in taking over.His roasted ducks come very nicely roasted with crispy skin depending on which part of the duck you opt for. The texture of the meat is generally speaking nicely moist and tender but tends to have more of a meaty chew.The marinade is also scaled back with no herbal accents as it relies on the traditional Cantonese sauce comprised on meat drippings, Hoi Sin and dark soy sauce which they drizzle on top.The char siu (barbecued pork) is also the other highlight because it relies on pure roasting technique. Instead of the recent trend of using slightly fattier cuts of pork to keep the Char Siu “moist” or meat tenderiser, Chao Ji uses the very traditional shoulder meat which has relatively little fat.Leong employs a low fire roasting technique to yield a soft-textured meat and caramelised bits on the outside. Char Siu lovers will rejoice as the texture is reminiscent of a more old-school char\xa0siu texture where the meat has an almost moist but chewy tenderness.The Char Siu marinade is sweet and savoury but leans more towards the savoury side.The other big highlight is oddly enough, the rice itself. Steamed a little underdone, you can still see whole pearls of the rice and they are bouncy and slightly firm.Also on the menu is roasted chicken and roasted pork belly, of which the latter comes with the requisite crispy skin and moist meat.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/cooking-prawns/:['There are over 300 different species of prawns. The most popular ones available in local markets and supermarkets are tiger prawns and white prawns. You might also occasionally get the much larger Angka prawns.Prawns are an extremely good source of protein, omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin B12, zinc, iodine and potassium. Although they are high in cholesterol content, they are low in saturated fat, which is the unhealthy fat that raises cholesterol levels.How to choose? \nFor the best flavour, live or fresh prawns should always be purchased. You should look out for the following when buying:Fresh prawns:\n– They must always be displayed on ice\n– The shell (including the head) should be intact and not broken or slimy. The meat should always be firm and full to the shell.\n– The eyes should be shiny and not shrunken inwards, with discolouration on the head and shell.\n– They should smell fresh. Avoid those that are very fishy or with any hint of ammonia smell.Frozen prawns:\n– There should not be any signs of too much ice particles within the bag of frozen prawns – a sign that the prawns have been defrosted before through mishandling.How to store?\nIf bought fresh, prawns should be kept in the coldest part of the fridge, preferably on some ice and in an airtight container to prevent cross-contamination. They should be consumed by the following day. Alternatively for freezing, place the prawns in water in a container and store them in the freezer. They can last for up to three months. However, a better option would be to purchase IQF (individually quick frozen) prawns, which are commercially flash frozen upon harvesting, hence having much better results than doing it at home. Some come already peeled and de-veined, which is a very good choice for people with busy lifestyles. Simply take the quantity you want and proceed to defrost them.Defrosting should ideally be done in the fridge the day prior to using as rapid thawing out in the sink at room temperature can cause the prawns to lose some of its flavour and increase the risk of bacteria building on the prawns.Tips on preparing and cooking prawns\n– A recipe that call for prawns to be peeled should also be deveined (removal of the intestinal tract that could sometimes be sandy). Simply make an incision along the back of the prawn and this should expose the thin black line. You can remove it easily with a toothpick.– Never marinade prawns in any citrus juice (or anything acidic) for more than 30-40 minutes as the prawns will start ‘cooking’ in the acids and cause them to dry out.Try these prawn recipes from Meryvn:Recipe: Steamed prawns in fragrant whole Thai coconut \n\nThe longer preparation time for this delicious dish is well worth it!Recipe: Grilled prawn kebabs & zucchini Mediterranean-style \n\nThis prawn recipe is great for barbeques and house parties.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/tans-tutu-coconut-cake/:['When it comes to kueh, it’s the nonya variety that receives the lion’s share of the glory. But I still have a soft spot for tutu kueh, a uniquely local creation that was a regular childhood snack for many people of my generation, even if it is no longer as popular as it once was.It’s Tan’s Tutu Coconut Cake to which the humble local snack’s origins can be traced.\xa0(This is not to be confused with the very similar putu piring, which has a gula melaka filling instead of peanut or coconut, and is often smaller in size. Putu piring is said to have its origins in South India.)Tan’s Tutu Coconut Cake was founded some time in 1932 by Tan Eng Huat. He started his stall selling\xa0song gao, a rice flour cake popular in Fujian, China. Later on, he turned the rather hefty rice flour cakes into bite-sized snacks, and chose to pack it with a filling of either peanut or coconut.The family business has endured — even flourished — since then, and it’s now his daughter, Tan Bee Hua, who manages its day-to-day operations.\nIt was on a Saturday when I visited Ms Tan at Tan’s Tutu Coconut Cake’s Havelock Road outlet. Even at 56, Ms Tan works swiftly, nimbly sifting flour and filling it into moulds. And, despite the afternoon heat, people patiently queue for their mid-day snack.“I’ve been doing this for many years, and I first started when I was a teenager,” Bee Hua explains. “My siblings and I helped to clean the pandan leaves and fry the peanuts.”During the 90s and early 2000s, when Tan’s Tutu Coconut Cake expanded and boasted five to six outlets, they had to hire workers to help out. They had since cut down to just two stalls due to manpower issues, with Bee Hua mostly manning the stalls herself. “It’s hard to find and train workers,” she says.Still, Tan’s Tutu Coconut Cake is not a purely one-man show; other family members still find ways to get involved. It is Bee Hua’s nephew, Jacky, who responds to media queries, and who was the one who facilitated the interview for us.To a bystander, making tutu kueh may look like a simple process. But like all other confections, tutu kueh-making is a craft that demands attention to detail.“When filling the moulds, you musn’t press the flour too hard, if not the tutu kueh will come out dense, and the moisture and softness won’t be there.”“The quality of flour is very important. We use jasmine rice flour because it is more moist and has a softer texture when cooked,” Bee Hua tells me. “It’s also more fragrant, and is not as rough or coarse as other flours.”“The jasmine rice flour we use is pounded for hours, and we make sure to sift it so that the flour becomes lighter.”According to Bee Hua, the way the filling is prepared always matters greatly. Lazy hawkers take short cuts and come up with lacklustre tutu kueh.“If you go to the pasar malam, you will sometimes find tutu kueh with dessicated coconut that has been mixed with orange sugar. And you can tell those don’t taste good.\xa0For us, we make sure to fry our coconut with gula melaka, so that it is not just sweet but the flavour is rich.”While some other hawkers use pre-packaged peanut, they pound and roast the peanuts inhouse.Tan’s Tutu Coconut Cake has also launched a new chocolate flavour recently. The dark chocolate chips which are used for it contain 60% cocoa content, according to Jacky, as they wanted the chocolate to taste more deeply chocolatey and less artificial.As far as we know, Tan’s Tutu Coconut Cake is the only stall to offer a chocolate-flavoured tutu kueh. Why the decision to launch a new flavour?“It’s to appeal to the kids. We have a lot regular customers who are adults,” Ms Tan says. “But the younger generation… many of them have never tried tutu kueh. So we came up with the chocolate flavour for them.”“We want to help young people to appreciate heritage food. We want them to continue to enjoy tutu kueh.”Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/menya-kokoro/:['Mazesoba — mixed noodles, dry ramen or soupless ramen — is arguably the latest Japanese trend that’s hit Singapore, with more than 10 eateries starting to capitalise on the dish in the past two years.Menya Kokoro — the world’s largest mazesoba chain — entered the market in 2018 with an outlet\xa0 at Suntec City and the response has proven so popular that they have subsequently opened up two more outlets in town.The brand is started by Chef Takuma Ishikawa who trained under the originators of Mazesoba (Menya Hanabi in Nagoya, Japan) before venturing out on his own to start Menya Kokoro in 2013.His version of mazesoba went on to win the Best Mazesoba 2014 award by Tabelog, Japan’s biggest food review website.The business has since aggressively expanded to 27 outlets in six countries — Japan, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, Vancouver and now Singapore.The menu at Menya Kokoro has a fairly wide selection of mazesoba but the original Nagoya-style, the Tokyo Mega MazeSoba ($12.80/14.80) is still the most alluring.Dressed soba noodles are topped off with generous amounts of spicy minced pork, soy-braised pork belly, spring onion, fish powder, garlic, chives, nori seaweed and raw egg.Everything is mixed together and the overall effect is a complex flavour and texture mix that has meat and fish flavours, spiciness, vegetable herb tastes, garlic and is gently creamy because of the soft boiled egg. The good thing is that the flavours are balanced and no flavour over-dominates.The soba noodles have a good thick, chewy bite and are apparently good for you as it has a high content of fibrous whole wheat.Alot of the flavour comes from their signature minced meat which has a highly concentrated flavour made with more than 10 ingredients.That said, the meat is not soft and fatty like how a good Bak Chor Mee would have it. It’s more dry and has a hardier texture. The same goes for the soy-braised pork belly.The base sauce (tare) is imported from Japan and so is the fish powder (gyofun) which is made of several types of fish, not just bonito.You have the option to add some of their house-made white vinegar and it gives the dish a bit of a zest.It is because of this sour tinge that people say that mazesoba is the Japanese version of our local Bak Chor Mee.Judging by the basic flavourings, it is somewhat true. The soba noodles are dressed using soy sauce, pork lard and you have the option of adding white vinegar. Instead of a sambal chilli, spicy minced pork is used.As the toppings are so generous, there will be a lot leftover after you finish the noodles, so you can request for omeishi — a small saucer of rice that you can request to finish up the remaining sauce in your bowl.There are variations on the original mazesoba theme —which is just vegetarian, adds beef, cheese and spicy options.Also interesting is their new creations of Beef Sesame Hiyashi Ramen (#13.80/15.80) where white Goma paste and sesame oil is the main flavouring and the Mentai Ebi Mazesoba ($13.80/15.80) which uses Mentai butter (cod roe, oil and cheese).Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

To add on to the many choices of ice cream out there,\xa0Europe’s most splendid range of ice-cream\xa0by EKSELENCE® has joined the spread as well.EKSELENCE® is made from the richest of all creams,\xa0fresh whole milk and egg yolk, combined with carefully selected local ingredients sourced from\xa0the finest purveyors throughout Europe, and is crafted in the heart of the lush green country\xa0of Latvia.With every bite into the different ice cream flavours, you will be able to notice that special attention has been paid to every detail.Mostly priced from $12.90, EKSELENCE has a range of Mini Classic pack which contains Chocolate coated and Almond chocolate coated sticks.The ice cream has a good balance of Chocolate and vanilla and with the Almond bits, there is a crunch with every bite which tastes like genuine Almonds rather than processed ones.Other flavours include White Chocolate & Raspberry, Pistachio, Coconut & Almonds, Raspberry Pomegranate, Caramel, Mango Sorbet with Vanilla and Wild Berries with Vanilla.For those who like the earthy tones of Pistachio or the bite of Coconut flakes, you would enjoy those ice cream choices as the EKSELENCE ones have a good mix of the Latvian cream and milk, along with the ingredients, which ensures that the ice cream sticks are not too sweet.A personal favourite would be the Mango Sorbet as the tangy sour and sweet notes of the rich Mango, goes perfectly well with the Vanilla flavour. True to their description, you can taste the natural flavours of the Mango and Vanilla portions.The Wild Berries sorbet, on the other hand, has a sharp sweet taste that pairs well with the Vanilla. But when devoured by itself, it could be a little too much to handle.The fruity and natural notes of the Mango with Vanilla sorbet goes well. Many fruit flavoured ice cream scoops has a thick gimmicky taste which does not go down smoothly after a few bites.However, because of the natural ingredients used the line of EKSELENCE ice creams, the ice cream does not leave the consumer feeling surfeited.Due to the light taste, unique textures to the different ingredients and pop of colours, the ice cream scoops are worth the price points.While all of the ice cream choices can be found at major supermarkets and hypermarkets, the Raspberry Pomegranate and Caramel Double-layer Chocolate ones are only exclusive to Cold Storage. They are priced from $13.90.For more information and to view all the current promotions, you can visit their account on Instagram: @ekselencesgAuthor© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/hubers-bistro-good-meat-lab-grown-cultivated-chicken/:['If you’ve always been curious about the latest in the alternative protein sphere, you can now taste lab-grown chicken for yourself at Huber’s Bistro in Dempsey.The homegrown butchery and bistro has been working with foodtech company Eat Just — and its cultivated meat arm Good Meat — to dish out a specially curated, limited menu from January.A little background: Eat Just is one of the few companies to obtain regulatory approval from the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) for its cultivated — or lab-grown — meat in Singapore.\xa0At that time, it was also a world-first, and since then, work has continued apace — the company is slated to launch its S$61 million meat production facility in JTC Bedok Food City later this year.A post shared by HungryGoWhere (@hungrygowhere)Cultivated meat is developed by culturing animal-based cells in a special serum, which is often bovine-based. Lab-grown meats produced in this fashion can run the gamut from chicken to seafood, such as shrimp and lobster.You might have had the chance to sample Good Meat’s wares at limited-time pop-ups — its latest was in June 2022, in conjunction with the likes of Loo’s Hainanese Curry Rice and Keng Eng Kee Seafood.Its current partnership with Huber’s is slated to run for the foreseeable future — with “no announced end-date”, says Good Meat, in response to HungryGoWhere’s queries.We just had to pop by for a taste test.The bistro was largely quiet when we arrived for lunch on a Thursday. Besides a sandwich standee at the entrance and small menu cards announcing the collaboration, there didn’t seem to be much fanfare.\xa0Besides two to three tables, most of the other diners were digging into dishes from Huber’s usual stable.HungryGoWhere understands that the collaboration has been receiving healthy interest from foreigners and tourists, but not so much from local foodies.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50% off at picturesque date spots, including Wildseed Cafe at The Alkaff Mansion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrice-wise, Good Meat says that it has priced its plates on a par with conventional chicken dishes on a given partner’s menu. At Huber’s, the meals cost S$18.50 each.Taking a peek into the kitchen, we got the chance to see the meats before they were cooked and plated. And despite its provenance — rather anticlimactically — the meat looks pretty much as it should.Says Andrew Noyes, vice-president and head of global communications and public affairs at Good Meat: “We are able to apply traditional and modern cooking techniques when preparing Good Meat cultivated chicken. The cooking experience is like cooking conventional meat.”The meat is admittedly shredded and camouflaged under a rainbow of accoutrements, so it’s a little harder to make a discerning judgement on its looks.It’s then sprinkled liberally with salt and dunked into the deep fryer, before forming the main protein for the collab’s Good Meat cultivated chicken kebab with grilled vegetable couscous dish (S$18.50).Digging in, we found the dish a well-balanced and decently portioned one, with a mild yoghurt dressing to offset the herbaceous, tangy flavours of its olives and mushrooms.The meat itself had been fried to a crisp, with a good bite. But otherwise, the innate chicken flavour of the meat, while present, was mild. It seemed to be overwhelmed by its fellow skewered buddies — largely slices of capsicum in an assortment of colours — as well as the oil from the deep fryer.There is another option if that doesn’t tickle your fancy: A fried Good Meat cultivated salad with cilantro lime dressing (S$18.50).By contrast, I felt this dish was a better canvas for showcasing the true quality of the cultivated meat. Its companions on the plate — pumpkin, grapefruit, cranberries and sunflower seeds in a light, citrus dressing — allowed the fried chicken meat more room to shine.Looks- and texture-wise, the meat here seemed to be missing a little something that was hard to pinpoint at first glance. It definitely took on a slightly spongy consistency that reminded me of fishcake — rather more fibrous than sinewy — and lacked the usual layers of fat, meat and skin that we naturally associate with conventional chicken meat.By extension, the meat didn’t quite have the varying pockets of flavour and oil that I would expect, too — even comparing it to a piece of lean breast meat that’s been traditionally reared and cooked the same way.Nonetheless, the dishes stood well on their own — diners who aren’t in the know might be none the wiser.It was a memorable outing — one that Huber’s and Good Meat encourage you to mark with a souvenir folio containing your receipt that you can take home for posterity.If you’re keen to cast your own judgement — and I encourage you to — you can make a reservation on the Good Meat website. Limited tables are released each Sunday at 11am for a table the following Thursday.According to Noyes, Good Meat is in the midst of collecting feedback from diners, and new dishes may be on offer in the future.Book a ride to Huber’s Butchery & Bistro.22 Dempsey Road\nNearest MRT station: Napier\nOpens: Mondays to Sundays (9.30am to 7pm)22 Dempsey Road\nNearest MRT station: Napier\nOpens: Mondays to Sundays (9.30am to 7pm)AuthorJia-En has worn several hats in her career — first writing TV scripts, then food and lifestyle stories at Wine & Dine.

Because they have been so popular with customers, the restaurant’s decided to offer it all year round!Available in all the same flavours as what they offer for Sticky Bones — Kansas Sweet BBQ, Garlic BBQ, Spicy Asian, Smoked Peppercorn and of course their signature Hickory BBQ — baby back ribs can be had as a half slab ($19.90; lunch only) or as a full slab ($34.90; available all day).But hang on, ribs are ribs right? Well, no. Not really.According to Morganfield’s, there are noticeable differences between spare ribs — the ribs used for the restaurant’s famous Sticky Bones — and their newly introduced baby back ribs.Not only do they look different, they taste different too.Spare ribs (aka Sticky Bones)Meaty, juicy and with rich marbling, they are also known as side ribs and they come from the belly section of the pig (where bacon comes from).They usually come with the sternum (the rounded bit at the end of a full slab of Sticky Bones) and the flap (the pointy end at the other end) still attached.Baby Back RibsAlso called loin ribs or just back ribs, baby back ribs come from the upper back of the pig. They’re not as fatty which can be a good thing when you want all that pork rib goodness but with less guilt!And no, they’re not called baby back ribs because they come from baby pigs! They’re just called that because they’re smaller and leaner in relation to the bigger spare ribs.But here’s the stumper: what if you want both types of ribs but you only have limited stomach space?Well, to celebrate the permanent introduction of baby back ribs into the Morganfield’s menu, the restaurant is offering a limited time promotion called the Half & Half ($38.90; 10 September to 4 November).Here you get half a slab of Sticky Bones Spare Ribs and half a slab of Baby Back Ribs, with any two of the five flavours they have and two sides.

Now you can get it in Toa Payoh.Opened in late 2018, Chef Kang’s Noodle House is run by brothers Moo Yun Kheng and Moo Yun Wah who have worked with Chef Kang in his previous now-defunct cafe for seven years.Located at Jackson Square, an eating place within an industrial place in Toa Payoh, the eatery has now\xa0made it onto the Singapore Michelin Bib Gourmand list for 2019.I have heard that the waiting time here can go up to two hours long but it wasn’t the case on a weekday morning when I arrived. There were only a few queuing at around 10am but the flow of customers was constant when I was there.Chef Kang’s Noodle House has three dishes up on their menu:Noodle with Char Siew and Wanton – $5.00Noodle with Shredded Abalone, Char Siew and Wanton – $10.00Char Siew (per plate) – $10.00My friend and I got basic plate plus the upsized one with shredded abalone.After mixing up the noodles and with its black sauce, the first thing you notice is that they are very generous with their noodle portions, so it’ll be perfect for big eaters.Aside from char siew, you can also find a few pieces of raw vegetables, deep-fried crispy pork lard and a bowl of two wantons. The abalone options adds a whole pile of shredded\xa0abalone.Their noodles are springy but fall on the stiffer or “harder” spectrum but it perfectly complements with the sweet, dark sauce.Their char siew slices are an absolute winner in my book. Not thinly-sliced and dry, Chef Kang’s char siew is sliced thick, moist and soft.It also has a good ratio of meat to fat with a nice charcoal-burnt aftertaste.\xa0However, I had wished there was more black sauce as the noodles can get a little dry.Their wantons were also like mini-shui gaos — as they were stuffed with prawns, minced pork, black fungus and water chestnuts. The soup is also different as it is opaque, not clear, as it is made from pork bones.On another point, the shredded abalone. Whether it is worth $5 is up to the individual — you can get another bowl of wanton noodles for that price — but that’s what canned abalone costs. Order it if you’d like more of a sea taste thrown into the mix.Chef Kang’s Noodle House definitely ranks near the top when it comes to wanton noodles, but my search for “the ultimate best” continues.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

The Hokkien variety doesn’t add crispy prawn fritters and there is no mashed yam in their meat rolls.Now run by third-generation Teo Ho Soon, the stall has moved six times from its original location at China Street (to Chin Swee Street, Empress Place, Maxwell market and People’s Park Centre) before settling in its present location at Maxwell Food Centre some 10 years ago. Even though they sell a range of 12 items, only four are handmade everyday due to a lack of manpower and time — pink sausage, ngoh hiang, liver rolls and egg lard cakes.The ngoh hiang itself (meat roll) has nice fatty minced pork flavoured with five spice powder, spring onion and vinegar wrapped in soybean skin, while the guan chang (fresh pink sausage; $0.80) is filled with \xa0twee bak (lean meat) and contains minimal sweet potato flour mix. The ter kwa (liver rolls; $0.90) are stuffed with chives,\xa0liver chunks and a stick of lard to hold the roll together. Thre is a little creamed liver added to give the illusion of a softer texture.You can also get handmade neng kway (egg lard cakes; $0.80) which are an increasing rarity in Singapore. Egg is mixed with lard and flavoured with fish sauce, sugar and salt before being steamed then deep-fried, the cakes are sliced thin so they turn into almost crispy biscuits, but the centre remains soft and moist.

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/spicy-korean-instant-noodles/:['It’s easy to see why our kitchen larders have been invaded by Korean instant noodles! With hot, piquant flavours and al-dente noodles, spicy Korean instant noodles are so popular that even local supermarkets commission their own house brands.Although slightly pricier, Korean instant noodles normally come in bigger packets of 120g, compared to 70g for locally made brands. In an attempt to make them more healthy, many Korean instant noodles are now MSG-free (four out of the five noodles in this review have no MSG).For the most authentic taste, go to a Korean supermart such as Shine Korea and Korean Trading, which often stock a mind-boggling variety of made-in-Korea instant noodles. inSing.com taste-tests five spicy flavours to find out what’s hot and what’s not! Just look out for our spicy level rating!Paldo – Bibim Myun\nWeight: 130gms\nPrice: $1.80, from Koreana Trading\nSpice level: 4/5\nOverall rating: 4.5/5\nNot all instant noodles come in broth! Bibim myun means ‘mixed noodles’. First, you boil the noodles, rinse them in cold water, drain the noodles, then toss them in the accompanying chilli paste. Served cold, the noodles are light and springy, and taste very appetising with the sweet, spicy, and vinegary chilli paste. It’s a refreshing change from the usual soup noodles, and is great on a hot day. You can also jazz it up with julienned cucumber, lettuce, omelette or ham.Nong Shim – Bogle Bogle Jigae Myun\nWeight: 120gms\nPrice: $1.20, from Shine Korea\nSpicy level: 3.5/5\nOverall rating: 4.5/5\nJigae means stew, and this flavour replicates the taste of the popular Korean “army stew”, where kimchi, Spam, sausage, rice cake, and vegetables are cooked in one pot. Indeed, there’s a subtle fragrance of sausage, but the dried sliced sausage that came in the packet tastes like cardboard.Luckily, the dried kimchi tastes natural. There’s also rice cake, leek, and sliced chilli. The spicy, tangy and savoury soup smells and tastes tantalising. The thick noodles soak up the broth nicely, while remaining smooth and springy. Also, the noodles are shaped like a round cake, which makes it convenient if you want to put the noodles in a bowl to cook in the microwave. Nong Shim Shin Ramyun\nWeight: 120gms\nPrice: $1.60, from Koreana Trading\nSpicy level: 5/5\nOverall rating: 4/5\nShin Ramyun is one of the bestselling instant noodles in Korea, and it’s easy to see why. The soup base is wickedly spicy, yet addictive! It’s tasty with a subtle taste of beef. There’s also plenty of mushroom, carrot and spring onion. The smooth, chewy noodles are quite thick, but compliment the potent soup well. Shin Ramyun is not for the faint-hearted. Be prepared to sniff and sweat through this potent bowl of noodles!Ottogi Jin ramen (mild)\nWeight: 120gm\nPrice: $1.60, from Koreana Trading\nSpicy level: 1/5\nOverall rating: 3.5/5\nOttogi’s Jin ramen comes in ‘hot’ and ‘mild”‘ options. The ‘mild’ version is just right for those who don’t want something too spicy. We found the soup base to be pleasantly savoury and flavorful, even though there’s no MSG added. Smooth and springy, the noodles have great texture. There’s a generous amount of shitake mushroom, carrot, and leek. Overall, it smells and tastes delicious! A pity it’s too salty. Otherwise, this would be a great all-rounder.Samyang Kimchi Ramen\nWeight: 120gms\nPrice: $0.80, from Shine Korea\nSpicy level: 1/5\nOverall rating: 1/5\nAlthough it’s supposed to be kimchi-flavoured noodles, there’s hardly any taste of kimchi in this ramen. The soup base is mildly spicy and sour, but tastes disappointingly bland and flat. The noodles aren’t any better either.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/momolato-cafe/:['What We Like:What We Didn’t Like:If the recent hot weather is anything to go by, we are right in the middle of dessert season. Gelato maker Momolato, which supplies many of Singapore’s restaurants and cafes, has opened its own store at Haji Lane.The Halal-certified gelateria prides itself in offering gelato made with no additives or artificial flavouring. There is even a range of Keto flavours that are sugar-free and diabetic-friendly, which we were especially excited to try out.We sampled all 18 flavours that Momolato had to offer and three flavours really stood out: Kochi Yuzu Shiso, Keto Salted Caramel, and Oolong Hojicha Tiramisu.Our “best flavour for a hot afternoon” prize goes to the Kochi Yuzu Shiso flavour, which was the first one we tried upon stepping into the store. This lifesaver worked its magic right away, with its soothing citrus notes producing a calming effect that instantly made us forget the blistering heat outside. The one-two punch of the sour Yuzu and the refreshing Shisho herb (which tastes similar to mint) was an effective combination, giving the gelato its unmistakable taste.Next up was the Keto Salted Caramel, which impressed us with its light, airy taste. True to its Keto label, this creamy smooth gelato carried its salted caramel flavour well while remaining relatively unsweet. It will not exactly tickle the fancy of those with a sweet tooth, but for those seeking healthier, low-carb desserts, this will be right up your alley.Whereas the previous two favours were tried in small cups, we got to savour the Oolong Hojicha Tiramisu flavour in a fragrant pandan-flavoured cone. The rich, aromatic taste of the oolong and hojicha tea leaves features prominently, while the gentle sweetness of the tiramisu completes this exotic dessert. Tea lovers will find much to love with this gelato.Other items worth trying include the Watermelon Mint and the Watermelon Kiwi Popsicle Spritzer. The popsicle, which was served “bathing” in a spritzer drink, had the right amount of fruity sweetness, and the slice of kiwi fruit, which was frozen inside the popsicle, was fresh and juicy.We also got to try their pandan waffles, which turns the gelato into a heartier dish for when you are hungry. The waffles work well as a supporting act to the gelato, but can be a little lacking in the taste department when eaten on their own. And although we acknowledge that it was probably a conscious decision, especially given the store’s belief in Keto diets, we just felt that the waffle lacked a little oomph for our tastes.For the environmentally-conscious, it is also worth pointing out that Momolato Café only uses biodegradable tableware.As a gelateria, Momolato Café has a lot going for it: the plethora of unique flavours, the authentic, health-conscious gelato, and the refreshing popsicles. If dessert is your favourite food and you love gelato even more, this place should be on your must-visit list.For more information on Momolato Café, visit https://momolato.com/.Momolato Café\n34 Haji Ln, Singapore 189227Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/hong-kong-mongkok-tim-sum/:['What we liked:\n— The char siu baos are one of the best we’ve had from a hawker stall\n— The dim sum are restaurant quality for half the price\nWhat we didn’t:\n— The chee cheong fun could be made better\n— The siew mai could use more pork fatLocated in the sprawling Chinatown Complex, Hong Kong Mongkok Tim Sum serves restaurant quality dim sums for literally half the price.\nHow much? How does $2.50 for three char siew baos sound?\nOwner-chef Chi Shu Kei, worked at East Ocean Teochew Restaurant for several years before deciding to venture into his own business, opening Hong Kong Mongkok Tim Sum in 2003 and the response has been overwhelming with long queues outside his stall everyday.Dim sums here are handmade every morning and the constant queue means your food is always served fresh and hot. The dim sums here are of restaurant quality, though some are better than others.\nThere are six items on the menu, each priced at $2.50. A relative steal as dim sums at East Ocean Restaurant cost more than double the price.The star of the show is undoubtedly the Char Siew Bao (barbecued pork buns). Buns here come nicely fluffy\xa0— a rare find in hawker stalls. The filling is made of pork meat chunks coated in a nicely robust and concentrated savoury-sweet\xa0sauce. Served in threes (as with everything else on their menu), the baos were also slightly larger than expected.This is a must-try.They have upped the quality in the recent years as the meat used come shredded.Their next best item is the Xia Jiao. (har gao; prawn dumplings). The dumplings are filled to the brim with chunky shrimps that are lightly seasoned, allowing the natural sweetness of the prawn to come through.The Shao Mai (siu mai, pork dumplings) here comes better than the average hawker options. There are strong notes of garlic and sesame oil, as well as some sweetness from bits of fresh shrimp. The skins are soft and thin skin but the filling could do with more pork fat.Their Steamed Chicken Feet, or phoenix claws, are a must-have if you eat them. You get a serving of around five claws. Deep-fried, braised, then simmered, the texture of the chicken feet comes appropriately soft and melting and the savoury sauce oil-rich, garlicky and not too sweet.The Rice Flour Rolls (chee cheong fun) — drenched in\xa0 were above average but not spectacular. Fillings were generous (choice of char siew or shrimp), but the skins were rather inconsistent, sometimes too thick and sometimes breaking apart on occasion. The char siew\xa0complemented the sauce better than the shrimp, in our opinion.Overall, this stall is definitely value-for-money if you keep your expectations in check. A worthy option if you’re in the Chinatown area.The stall runs by a take-a-number queueing system where you’ll have to wait for your number to be called. You won’t be able to spot a queue outside, unlike other popular hawker stalls and a boon as it makes the long wait a lot less unpleasant, as you can wander around and get a drink.\nIf you arrive early, don’t be fooled by the half-closed shutters. You can actually take a queue number before they open fully (as we learnt the hard way, ending up 14th in line despite reaching before 11). Just shout through the grills and they’ll pass you a laminated number. If you turn up exactly when they open without a number, be prepared to wait at least 40 minutes or more for your turn.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/best-indian-buffets/:['Mention Indian cuisine and it conjures up images of rich, aromatic curries, fiery orange chunks of tandoori items, and sweet, sweet desserts. Those who love their Indian food will swear nothing tantalises quite like the rich, spicy flavours of South Asian dishes.From the Mughal-style cuisine of the North to the spicier and coconut-laced specialities of the South, a delectable buffet feast awaits at four of our favourite Indian restaurants. The naan and roti are baked in the tandoor only upon ordering, so that you can enjoy the Indian breads piping hot.Vegetarians aren’t left out and have a mouth-watering variety to choose from. Chaat lovers can also get ready to chomp away as some of these restaurants serve chaats (Indian street side snacks) as part of the buffet.Rang Mahal\xa0|\xa0EDITOR’S PICK |\xa0BEST NAAN & DESSERTS\nLevel 3, Pan Pacific SingaporeTel: 63331788Available: Mon-Fri: 12pm-2.30pmThe buzz: First opened in 1971 at the old Imperial Hotel, Rang Mahal is the oldest fine-dining Indian restaurant in Singapore. Since its move to Pan Pacific Hotel in 1998, it has been constantly reinventing itself – be it the interior or the menu. With its contemporary Indian-inspired interior awash in neutral tones and ambient lighting, Rang Mahal ranks as one of the most beautiful restaurants in town.What’s special: The lunch buffet ($58, sun-fri) has a starters section with some of the most refreshing salads and fancy canapes you’ll find at an Indian restaurant — make sure to try the sweet-sour blueberry raita (yoghurt). As with any Indian buffet worth its salt, there are the must-try biryani staples here. Since the buffet menu/offerings changes daily, it could be lamb biryani one day and mutton another, but regardless, the rice is always fragrant.The main courses are a good mix of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes. There’s paneer offered (on the day we went, it was paneer makhani, orcottage cheese in a butter chicken-like gravy) as well as — who can forget — kebabs.We can also say without hesitation that their naan is the best we’ve tried. Plain, garlic or butter, the naan is baked to perfection, slightly crisp at the base yet fluffy and soft inside. The desserts department is also a droolsome spread, featuring traditional Indian sweets with a twist. There are masala brownies with a soft hint of spices, strawberry shrikand (a creamy yoghurt concoction) and classics such as mango barfi (a type of milk candy), gulab jamun and chena pyaas (small balls of milk dumplings).TandoorBasement 1, Holiday Inn Singapore Orchard City Centre11 Cavenagh RoadTel: 67300153Available: every Sunday: 12pm-2.30pmThe buzz: This smallish basement restaurant has been a fixture of the hotel since 1985 and is among the stalwarts of the Indian fine-dining restaurant scene. Classical sitar music plays in the background, which adds to the authentic experience of dining here.What’s special: Their Sunday brunch buffet ($52) is a wide spread of classical Northern Indian faves such as chicken tikka (boneless pieces of tandoor-bake chicken), mutton biryani\xa0and samosa chaat. The vegetarian options are excellent, with four to five varieties ranging from\xa0subz pudina biryani (traditional vegetable briyani flavoured with fresh mint leaves) to Palak Panner (cottage cheese with spinach).We also gravitated towards the chaat corner where a chef was on hand to dish out a selection of Indian street food such as pani puri (a fried hollow crisp filled with ingredients such as potatoes, chickpeas or beans with tamarind water) and papri chaat (crispy crackers garnished with an addictive combo of potatoes, chickpeas, spices and chutneys, and drenched in yoghurt). Another “live” station is the South Indian corner with its array of dosais (plain, filled with potatoes or in a cone shape). There are also at least two types of South Indian snacks like vadai on display. It’s quite a spread at this one, so come hungry Sunday afternoon.Yantra\xa0\n#01-28/33 Tanglin Mall, 163 Tanglin RoadTel: 68363088Available: Mon to Thurs: 12pm-3pmThe buzz: An uber chic fine dining restaurant that looks even more beautiful in the evening when the lights dim and tea lights come on.\xa0 Their a la carte dishes are pricey (their garlic naan costs $10 and their tandoori avocado, $30+), so you wouldn’t expect their weekday lunch buffets to be very wallet-friendly. We were wrong. Their lunch buffet from Mondays to Fridays is a real steal at $33 while Saturday’s and Sunday’s brunch is at $52 (with a spread of 25 dishes and includes beverages!). Their buffet dinner on Sundays to Tuesdays ($52) even comes with a complimentary glass of wine.What’s special: For just $33, you get quite a variety of Northern Indian-style vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes including two kinds of soups, starters, tandoori items, main courses, biryani and desserts.Lest you think it’s the usual North Indian suspects, the buffet surprises you with unique items such as the Ab-e-Hayat (literally translated as “water of heaven”), a light vegetable soup cooked in coconut water and tandoori chaat (a melange of veggies and fresh fruit such as apples, guava, bell peppers and tomatoes coated in tandoori spices and roasted).If you love tandoori meats, you’ll relish the chicken malai kebab – moist, chunky boneless pieces coated in a cheese marinade. Special mention must be made of the dum biryani (one veg and one meat) – the aromatic and fluffy rice is presented in huge brass pots with a layer of flour covering the top to seal in the saffron- and spice-rich flavours. Very addictive, and don’t say we didn’t warn you!We know how notoriously sweet Indian desserts are, but Yantra’s two offerings on the buffet table are worth a try. The suji halwa and rice kheer are rich and satisfying without being too sweet.The Courtyard\xa0\n1 Fullerton Square, Singapore 049178Tel: 6877 8129Available: Mon to Fri:\xa011.30am-2.30pmThe buzz:\xa0The Courtyard\xa0at The Fullerton Hotel\xa0offers two lunch buffets at opposing sides of the hotel: the Japanese Buffet at the North Courtyard, and the Indian Curry Buffet, which offers creamy curries in dishes such as\xa0Gosht Do Piaza (Lamb Curry with Sautéed Onions) and Jhinganisha (Prawn\xa0Curry with Saffron). The Fullerton Hotel, Singapore, which houses the restaurant, sometimes brings in chefs for special collaborations for their buffets.What’s special:\xa0You can have your fill of an Indian curry buffet that includes carving stations brimming with tandoori fish, Indian-spiced lamb chops, chicken\xa0tikka\xa0and more.\xa0There is a live station serving up fresh roasted\xa0masala thosai, and an array of piping hot curries like\xa0Sali Gosht\xa0(tomato-based lamb curry)\xa0Chana Masala\xa0(chickpea curry) and\xa0Gobi Keema\xa0(minced cauliflower with onion-tomato gravy).Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

Their longtime outlet Circular Road closed late 2018.There are constant long queues who don’t mind the higher prices as the food, no matter what the dish, are generally of a high standard.The star dish is their Sinar Pagi Special BBQ Chicken which comes nicely charred and served with a balanced coconut-y and turmeric-heavy gravy.Standard dishes are extremely noteworthy like the bergedils which are full of coriander spice and has crispy egg bits, rendangs with a thick, reduced gravy and rich-fried sambal goreng with bits of liver in it.Our other favourites were the\xa0sotong masak hitam\xa0which has a beautifully soft-texture and the\xa0ikan assam pedas\xa0whose thick, robust sauce has an earthy sourness and a potent spicy kick.The\xa0sambal petai\xa0and\xa0chicken kalio\xa0are also crowd favourites.However, we have encountered occasional fluctuations in quality: average chicken curry, a\xa0daun singkong santan\xa0that has come heavily over-salted and the beef tripe Kalio with tough tripe pieces.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/the-white-label/:['Could the latest trend in the Halal F&B landscape be French cuisine? At least it could be the case judging by the crowd at The White Label.This Muslim-owned cafe describes their food as being “French Malayan Cuisine”.\xa0Opened on Christmas eve, 24th December 2020, The White Label has been a hot favourite among the Malay community, with fully booked tables during the weekends.While French classics like French Onion Soup, Duck Confit and Lyonnaise Salad (turkey bacon and egg with lettuce) are on the menu, the big hits among customers are their dishes which mix French and Malay influences.\xa0And good news, the ideas do work quite well for the most part.The star of the show is undoubtedly the Short Ribs Bourguignon ($32) which is an impressively huge chunk of beef short rib (300g), and the meat comes very soft and tender because it is marinated for four hours (or sometimes overnight) with the unique ingredient of sparkling water.The fact that the water is carbonated helps break down the meat fibres, and indeed, the meat does come very soft and fork-tender.\xa0The taste is very rich, meaty, and a little sweet, though we would have liked a little more oomph in the savoury department.It comes with a tomato assam sauce on the side, which adds a little more sweetness and tanginess to the taste.\xa0Thankfully the mash comes nicely seasoned, and it helps to fill in the savoury middle in the overall taste.The other must-order is the Squid Ink Spaghetti ($26) which seems simple until you tuck into it.\xa0It’s actually the traditional Malay dish of Sotong Masak Hitam (squid in black ink stew) made more robust with even more squid ink and more luxurious ingredients like large prawns and mussels in addition to squid.The thick gravy is wonderfully robust with a big squid ink flavour, a big, complex seafood savouriness and soft onion, kaffir lime and lemongrass flavours.\xa0You can choose one of three spice levels — the medium would be a good heat for most people, and the highest level ramps it up quite significantly.The Herb Crusted Lamb Rack ($38) is the most traditionally French on the menu, and it comes with three large rack pieces, done to a nice medium tenderness and served with a nice tangy mustard sauce.It’s also refreshing that they’ve opted for Asian long beans as one of the vegetables to pair with the mash to give it a more local flavour.Another interesting dish is the TWL Vol-Au-Vent ($14) which is the cafe’s Asian-ised version of the classic French Vol-Au-Vent (puff pastry with fillings).Here, kueh pie tee shells are used as the “pastry”, and it’s stuffed with a very rich filling of duck rillette mixed with pulled beef and topped off with chilli belado (a cooked sauce of tomato, onion and chilli) and serondeng (seasoned cooked coconut).It is slightly sweet with crunch and complex flavours, and comes very moist and soft though we would have appreciated a little more savoury notes to round out the flavour.They also offer a small range of desserts, like the Ondeh Ondeh Gateau ($9), which is interesting because they drizzle Gula Melaka and sprinkle coconut shavings over layers of pandan chiffon sponge and pandan fresh cream.It’s a nice modern take on a classic Southeast Asian dessert.The White Label is also busy during weekday lunches and afternoons as it operates an all-day cafe. Hence, they have a great selection of French pastries, cakes and teas infused with local flavours like “Pandan Chiffon” and “Seri Kaya”.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/fried-carrot-cake/:['Simply called Fried Carrot Cake, this stall commands long queues every morning for its old-school carrot cake which is chopped up into tinier than usual pieces.The stall was started in the 1960s by Ng Keng Chow, who is now in his 80s. He migrated from China when he was 15 and he used to sell fried carrot cake from a pushcart in Tiong Bahru Market in the mornings before shifting to Bukit Ho Swee to sell in the afternoons.The stall shifted to Clementi 448 Market & Food Centre in 1980 where he sold carrot cake with his wife. Older customers will remember him with his signature straw hat which he wore while frying.\nKeng Chow passed the business to his now 54-year-old son, Ng Joong (Hiong) Yew and his wife, Jessy Lee, 49, in 2010 and now their 24-year-old son, Brandon is helping out in the business.Every element of their carrot cake ($3/4/5), whether black or white, has been carefully thought through.The radish cakes used to be handmade but now they source from a factory, but the textures are still decently soft as it is double fried.The dish is also left on the pan a little longer so the egg bits are nicely crispy.They use a mix of sweet and salty chye poh (preserved radish) and pork oil is used to fry the dish.The result is a light balance of savoury, pork oil richness, bursts of chye poh saltiness and sweetness and a mix of soft and crispy textures. Even though there are crispy textures, there is still enough moisture in the dish.Ask for chilli and the chilli paste just adds gritty spiciness with no additional saltiness or dried prawn flavour.The black version which adds sweet soy sauce into the mix, adds smokey light caramel sweetness to the dish but never goes overly sweet.Be prepared for the wait, which can be as long as 45 minutes on a Saturday morning.If you can, try to gauge when to join the queue. The carrot cake is fried in batches but when done, the fire is left on, so the carrot cake served towards the end of the batch is crispier than at the beginning.In the early years at Clementi, the stall used to switch between selling chwee kway and carrot cake every two, three years but they have since switched over to selling carrot cake on a permanent basis.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

The four hae bee hiam-infused dishes are available at all White Restaurant outlets from 27 April to 26 July 2021.The highlight of this special menu is the Dried Scallop Hae Bee Hiam XO White Beehoon ($10.80++). This spicier rendition of White Restaurant’s signature dish features a mix of dried scallops, prawn, squid and hae bee hiam for a muskier flavour. A dash of XO sauce, made in-house, is also added to the dish.

When it was demolished in 2000, Ng relocated his stall to Bedok South Market & Food Centre and it has been there ever since.In its time, Hill Street Fried Kway Teow has been consistently hailed by many in the media as one of the best char kway teow in Singapore.However, the reputation and quality of their dish threatened to come to an end when Ng died in 2018 from Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS).But fans of Ng’s char kway teow needn’t have worried as he had been training up his third son, Ng Yeow Kiat to take over the business for some years prior.Yeow Kiat took a year to learn how to fry the dish before being added to frying duties in rotation with Ng and his aunt. When Ng was diagnosed with ALS in 2014, Yeow Kiat became responsible for frying duties in rotation with his aunt.Whether Yeow Kiat’s version of char kway teow is as good as his father’s will continually be up for debate, but the version currently being fried actually hold its own with the best that is offered in Singapore right now.The char kway teow has a slightly wet thickness and the flavours are incredibly well balanced with an even mix of fish sauce savouriness, rich lard and seafood cockle flavour. Ask for chilli and it gets spicy but it stays in the background. It doesn’t dominate the other flavours.It’s especially nice that the added sweet black sauce isn’t as sweet as how many other stalls do it.The noodles and kway teow — which are first fried in garlic and dark soy and then fried again individually in a second wok for a double frying effect — comes soft with a little bit of bite and spring.Some chives and towgay are thrown in for vegetable crunch and the stir-fried eggs come nice and soft. Some lap cheong slices are also thrown in and they give a nice burst of sweetness when you bite into one.It’s arguably one of the most well-rounded plates of char kway teow. The only thing we would ask for is a little more of a smoky wok hei which would make a great dish even greater.They used to offer two sizes — $3.50 and $4 but now they’ve standardised it to a single price of $4 to quicken the process.However, the waiting time is still long — an average of 20 minutes to as long as an hour during peak times.There is also another stall named “Hill Street Fried Kway Teow” which is located at Chinatown Complex. It also sells char kway teow but the taste is completely different to this one.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/xiu-ji-ikan-bilis-yong-tau-fu/:['From a roadside stall at Sago Lane in the 1960s, Xiu Ji Ikan Bilis Yong Tau Fu moved into Chinatown Complex in 1987 and sees long queues every morning for its incredibly cheap handmade yong tau foo.How cheap? Six pieces plus beehoon (or yellow noodles or kway teow) for $3 or eight pieces with soup, no noodles.The stall is now in the hands of third-generation owner Lee Siew Khim, 46, who took over the stall with her husband in 2009 and nothing has changed in the many decades of business.Each yong tau foo set comes with the same basic four items of stuffed tau pok (tofu puff), tau kwa (hard tofu), fishball and fried tau kee (tofu skin).But now there is the addition of extra premium yong tau foo items like fishcake ($0.80), fried stuffed bittergourd and stuffed brinjal ($0.50 each).The yong tau foo are made every afternoon once they shutter the stall at 2pm but the result can be a bit of a hit or miss affair.The big plus point is that yong tau foo items are overstuffed to the point of overflowing.The stallmade fish paste is savoury but sweeter than most other hawker stalls who use it to hand-make fishballs — something which yong tau foo connoisseurs either love or hate.It makes sense eaten with the chilli sauce, soup and beehoon and as there is no sweet brown sauce served on the side, that is as sweet as the dish gets.The tau kee and tau pok items have a nice soft springy texture but their tau kwa comes very firm.The same goes for their fishballs which come firm and bouncy, different from the softer-texture which are common in handmade fishballs in Singapore.The soup is decently flavoured with predominantly salted ikan bilis and fish bones, but alas with no yellow beans. The result is a stock flavour that isn’t as full-flavoured as it could be.Beehoon (vermicelli), yellow noodles and kway teow (flat rice noodles) are available and while you can have it with soup, opt for the dry version if you can.They put the yong tau foo items in a bowl of soup and the noodles are dressed in a simple soy, nutty oil mix and topped off with crunchy chewy ikan bilis.Mix some of the chilli sauce they have on the side —very similar to chicken rice chilli — and the taste is simple but addictive.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/meng-kee-fried-kway-teow/:['Located in the central part of Singapore, Meng Kee Fried Kway Teow is one of the better rated char kway teow stalls in the country but only if you like your char kway teow sweeter than usual.The family who run the stall are rather private people — preferring not to give full names and declining video requests — but they were willing to share the long history of the stall.Meng Kee started the late 1970s in a coffeeshop at block 88, Zion Road and it was run by Mr Tan, affectionately known as “Ah Meng” by his customers (Meng was his last name).Ah Meng’s brother-in-law ran another char kway teow stall at a coffeeshop in block 22, Havelock Road (Wei Xuan Eating House).Because of a disagreement with the landlord, Ah Meng swapped locations with his brother-in-law in 1983 and would be based at Havelock Road for 36 years.In the last decade or so, the stall was run in conjunction with Ah Meng’s daughter and in July 2019, the stall moved to its current location of Havelock Cooked Food Centre and the char kway teow is now solely fried by Ah Meng’s daughter.The first thing you’ll notice when you observe the char kway teow being made is the intense temperatures generated when the dish is being fried. That results in lots of charred wok hei in every dish.\nPriced at $3/4/5, the char kway teow is double fried, has a thick wetness and is comprised of lard, lap cheong (Chinese sausage), cockles, bean sprouts, egg and kway teow.The taste profile, however, is something which you’ll either love or hate. It has generous lard notes, spiciness if you ask for it, smokiness but a more pronounced sweet black sauce flavour.\nSome like the sweetness but some might not and it gets sweeter whenever you bite into a lap cheong, so bear that in mind.\nIt’s likely because the savoury body (cockle juice mixed with fish sauce) flavour is a little toned down. Some people love it but some others might feel that the char kway teow lacks body.As for the kway teow, it still retains its springiness and the cockles and bean sprouts fresh and barely seared.\nThey also have another dish called “Beansprout Cockles” ($5/8/10) which is basically char kway teow minus the kway teow, lap cheong and sweet black sauce.It’s a good stir-fried dish, full of fish sauce, lard, cockle, bean sprout flavours. It comes a bit wet as the towgay releases quite a bit of water but the flavours are still nicely prominent, with a bit of smokiness.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/dian-xiao-er/:['The history of duck roasting can be traced back to as early as the Yuan Dynasty when it was listed among the imperial dishes. Now, it’s the staple at every banquet and family dinner. Yes, the roasted duck is one of the greatest hits in every compilation of Chinese dishes. Here’s what makes Dian Xiao Er’s signature roasted duck stand out from the rest:Providence and breed.\xa0They use only Cherry Valley breed of ducks for its tenderness and flavour. Any excess fats under the skin of the duck is trimmed off manually.They offer three variations of herb-roasted duck —with angelica herbs, with Ten Wonder herbs, and with wild ginseng. The fowl is first stuffed with choice of herbs, then roasted in a special Germany-imported oven for one hour. The bird becomes perfumed with the scent of herbs and the skin turns a golden brown. The herbs are removed before the duck is chopped up and served with sauce.The secret is in the sauce.\xa0To match the herbs that have been stuffed into the fowl, Dian Xiao Er offers three different types of sauces to drizzle over their herb-roasted duck.Ducks that has been roasted with angelica root (dang gui), gets a sweet/ savoury angelica root sauce poured over it (small $15, medium $28.90, large $41.90, whole $49.60). Ducks roasted with wild ginseng gets an intense ginseng sauce (small $16, medium $30, large $43.90, whole $50.60).One of the most common sauce for roast duck \xa0is the Ten Wonder herb sauce—you can get this nearly every other Chinese restaurant. At Dian Xiao Er, birds that have been roasted with Ten Wonder Herbs (includes condonopsis root, foxglove root, licorice root) are accompanied with the “Ten Wonder” herb sauce. There’s something slightly medicinal about the black sauce but it’s bittersweet flavour goes really well with the roasted duck. (small $15.50, medium $29.60, large $42.60, whole $49.90).What the duck? It has traditional Chinese medicinal (TCM) qualities too.\xa0Because of all the herbs that are used in the preparation of the duck. Angelica root nourishes the blood and treats those who are anaemic. Wild ginseng reduces heatiness and has a soothing effect on the lungs while the Ten Wonder herb mix has a calming effect.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/captain-k-seafood-tower/:['While the craze for Korean bingsu, Korean fried chicken, and Korean barbecue rages on\xa0in Singapore right now, and everyone is busy clambering onto the bandwagon of the latest hallyu (Korean wave) trend, you’ve got to ask yourself: what’s next?The answer is the nine-tier seafood tower at Captain K Seafood Tower. Unlike the Louisiana seafood boil where you get a mixed bag of crustaceans, the great thing about these Nine Layers of Steamed Shells (as it is known in some parts of Asia) is that each tier is cooked somewhat separately so you get to relish all the shelled seafood in its orginal natural flavour.Opened a few days ago at Prinsep Street (near Rendezvous Hotel), the 120-seater restaurant is airy, spacious, and modern with a few TV’s on the premises screening K-Pop music videos, in case you had any doubt that this is a Korean food concept. For the more privacy, there’s a 12 pax private room where you can enjoy your seafood feast away from the crowd.A typical feast includes scallops, prawns, squid, shellfish, and crustaceans (the\xa0offerings are not fixed and depend on seasonal availability) individually stacked but collectively steamed with the seafood juices dribbling down to the last layer where the soup base is. You are supposed to eat the seafood layer by layer, starting from the top and working your way down the tiers until you reach the soup at the bottom.Currently,\xa0The Punggol Settlement is only other place in Singapore we know of that offers the Korean seafood tower but unlike Captain K they bring the ingredients to the table raw and cook it from scratch which may result in overcooked and chewy seafood. At Captain K, the fresh ocean catch is steamed in the kitchen until they are almost ready to eat before it is moved to the induction cooker at the table and finished off at a low heat. A timer set at 5 minutes ensures the seafood doesn’t overcook.The 9-layer seafood tower ($288.90) looked impressive when it arrived at the table; the set\xa0feeds 8 pax comfortably.\xa0They cater to smaller groups too—3 layers ($52.90) is good for 2 pax; 5 layers ($98.90) is good for 4 pax; and 7 layers ($188.90) is good for 6 pax. Each set comes complete with a free flow of barley tea and five banchan dishes like kimchi, soya bean sprouts and spinach, depending on the day.Layer 1: The live prawns from a local kelong were sweet and fresh. Prawns are usually put on the top tier because once overcooked the flesh becomes mushy. The recommended condiment is a tangy yuzu Doenjang dip but we preferred ours with the homemade Korean soy sauce.Layer 2: Scampi flown in from France. We cracked open the shells to reveal succulent and firm flesh. Although they recommend you eat it with fiesty sambal belacan, it really didn’t need other sauces except for its own natural juices.Layer 3: Rock lobster from the Dominican Republic. Lobsters are usually on the top few layers as overcooking could turn its meat into an unappetising mush.Layer 4: White clams that arrived from Thailand on that day.Layer 5: Half shell Hokkaido scallops were steamed with chopped garlic and spools of rice vermicelli. The big and meaty scallops tasted great unadorned but you could also add some zesty Thai chilli sauce. The vermicelli was delicious, having soaked up all the tasty juices from the scallops.\xa0This is, by far, our favourite tier.Layer 6: Local green mussels to be eaten with the spicy Korean bean paste for best results.Layer 7: Most Singaporeans like their oysters raw but they may change their minds after tasting these babies. These U.S oysters were fat and plump — ripe for the picking. After the ‘sauna’ session in the steamer, the flesh became creamier; to the taste and bite.Layer 8: The last layer will always be the crab as these hardy crustaceans can withstand a longer cooking time. You can overcook these a little and it will still be good. The Sri Lanka crabs were steamed with strips of ginger and tasted incredible with just a little Korean soy sauce.Layer 9: Saving the best for last. The kimchi soup tasted like no other we had. Free of MSG, it was brewed from kombu, vegetables, miso, and bean paste. Then, it was flavoured and naturally sweetened with cooked seafood drippings.There are also less spicy soup bases like the nourishing ginseng chicken broth (additional $15) and the classic kombu dashi.We were close to bursting at the seams after all that seafood but if you still feel hungry, you can have add-on ingredients like vegetables, corn, mushrooms etc ($2-$ 4 per plate) to throw into the soup a la shabu shabu hotpot style. Add some Korean Maggie noodles so you can round up your meal with some carbs.[UPDATED] Captain K Seafood Tower has just obtained its liquor license and is planning to roll out Korean beers, soju bombs, and refreshing watermelon soju in the coming weeks.Menu credit : Captain K Seafood Tower\xa0Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/loh-mei-specialist/:['Also known as loh kai yik (Cantonese), Lo Mei Specialist at People’s Park Food Centre is probably the only stall in Singapore which has been consistently selling this old-time Cantonese dish since the 1990s. A stewed dish ($4/6/8) comprising a variety of ingredients: pork belly, chicken, pig’s intestines, pig skin, mushrooms, tau pok, cuttlefish and kang kong, the central ingredient to the stew is nam yu, a red fermented soybean paste that has a very distinctive flavour.It was actually a common hawker dish in Singapore in the 1950s and 1960s. Back then, you would see many street hawkers on bicycles, typically elderly Cantonese selling it in the HDB estates, door to door, especially in the Tiong Bahru and Joo Chiat areas shouting “loh kai yik” “loh kai yik”!Sadly, the standard of the dish from this stall has been falling over the years. The gravy used to be thicker, with a redder hue, and a stronger fermented bean curd taste but it seems that they use a lesser amount of nam yu (red fermented bean curd) in it, probably because of cultural changes, people don’t like the strong taste of nam yu. They also used to sell pig’s liver but no longer do so.Even though the gravy has a thin consistency, the flavour is still fairly intense and the ingredients like the pork belly and pig skin come beautifully soft.However, it’s still worthwhile going back to this stall because it’s so hard to find this dish and it probably won’t be long before you won’t find it any more. There is also one other stall, Charlie’s Peranakan, which sells the dish. Priced at $20, it comes in a claypot dish, feeds four people and has a gravy which is thicker and more robust. It opened in the beginning of 2017 at Golden Mile Food Centre.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/koungs-wan-tan-mee/:['What we liked:\n— Every aspect of this wanton noodle dish is incredibly well done\n— They add copious amounts of lard in the dish, a practise which is increasingly rare in Singapore\nWhat we didn’t:\n— We hope they bring back their shui jiao (water dumpling) soup dish\n— Queues can be long in the late morningsKoung’s wanton noodles harks back to an old-school style which is so “politically incorrect” that not many wanton noodle hawkers dare serve it so boldly these days.We’re referring to the outlandish amounts of lard in the sauce at Koung’s.Health experts might frown but foodies in Singapore absolutely love it.In fact, this stall is so well-loved that almost every Internet forum or group has unanimously voted Koung’s the best wanton mee in Singapore.The business was started by 70-year-old Koung Boon Kong who emigrated from Indonesia as a child and worked as a stall assistant at a wanton noodle stall when he was of age.Years later, Boon Kong started his own stall in 1964 at Sen Loan Eating House, Geylang Lorong 12, before shifting to Lorong 13 in 2000 and to its current location at a coffeeshop at Lorong 21A in 2013.Once you tuck into a plate ($4), you’ll understand what all the hype is about.The key is the sauce which has an incredibly lard-rich, slightly sweet chilli, slight savoury flavour and it’s paired with higher grade factory-made egg noodles which adds to the richness.\nThe other highlight is the char siu — the local slightly sweet and savoury version — which is stall-made and slow-roasted onsite on a daily basis.It comes very tender and is sliced thicker than usual.You get a mix of fatty and lean pieces in every plate, the ratio of which depends on your luck.The noodle portions are fairly generous and taste-wise, you might find the lard-iness a little overwhelming at times and that’s where the pickled green chilli on the side actually makes sense for once — because it helps in cutting through the greasiness of the dish.Crunchy fried pork lard pieces are available if you so wish but are not automatically given out, so request for it during your order.In the early days, the soup version of Koung’s wanton noodles was actually the highlight as it was made using a combination of ikan bilis, pork bones, flatfish and scallops. No MSG is added.When served, light soy sauce is added into every bowl to boost the flavour a bit.We’re not sure if they’ve changed the recipe or that’s the way it has always been but whatever the case, we’d recommend the dry version instead.The soup does taste very homely — nice and rounded and not too salty — but we’ve tasted more robust, complex versions. Koung’s soup is a little on the plain side.The soup comes with three wantons and they are reasonably well done with nice, slippery skins with decent amounts of well-seasoned minced pork fillings.For those of you looking for a change, Koung’s does sell the Malaysian style of wanton mee, where dark soy sauce is mixed in.It gives the dish an earthy sweetness but it’s not overly sweet, it’s nice and rounded.We’d say that it beats a lot of Malaysian-style wanton mee offerings in Singapore, simply because there’s a generous amount of lard taste and aroma in every dish.Koung’s has another outlet at Jurong Eest’s JEM shopping mall which opened in mid 2020.\xa0It was started by the Boon Kong’s son, Bernard, who is using his father’s original recipes but we wouldn’t recommend it quite yet.\xa0For now, the quality is still better at Geylang Lorong 21A but we’ll do another retest a few months later to see if the food improves.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

The hardcore Teochew braised duck fans will order the duck’s head, feet and wings which has chewier meat but is great if you’re into textural eating.The main attraction is, of course, the\xa0lor\xa0(gravy) which comes with mild herb accents and a more rounded flavour without it being sweet. It is also not overpoweringly salty — some traditional Teochew-style braised duck stalls have a tendency to be so.It can be an issue when eaten with rice as there is not enough savouriness in the overall eating. Ask for more gravy.They serve two chilli sauces — the traditional Teochew stingly sour chilli and garlic dip which comes with powerful garlic notes and a fuller, smokier chilli sauce similar to what you find in Teochew kway chap.The traditional Teochew version still works the best as the taste is more straightforward and compliments the flavours of the duck and\xa0lor.A tip: if you order half a duck or more, you can request it to be sliced diagonally.

Often served with slices of raw fish, this year, there’s been a rise in popularity of non raw fish options.Some people imagine that yusheng\xa0(raw fish salad) must have originated from Hong Kong – why else would so many know it by its Cantonese term,\xa0yoo sang, and call the ceremonious toss of its colourful ingredients,\xa0lo hei (Cantonese for “toss your way up”)?There is also a myth that claims it was a young couple in ancient China who discovered the first version of the dish: they were stranded in a temple due to bad weather after having gone fishing. While waiting, they chanced upon a bottle of vinegar and decided to pour it over the raw fish to consume it, and they found it appetising.The story behind\xa0yushengYusheng was created by the Four Heavenly Kings of Cantonese cuisine in Singapore in the 1960s. Chefs Lau Yeok Pui, Tham Yui Kai, Sin Leong and Hooi Kok Wai first developed the idea of a raw fish dish that was common in Malaysia into this festive must-have here. Lai Wah Restaurant, helmed by Lau and Tham, claims to be the first in the world to have served it.In that tradition, yusheng is meant to be enjoyed on ren ri, the seventh day of the Chinese New Year, in celebration of the day mankind was created, though many now consume yusheng throughout the festive season.\n___________________________________________\xa0Yusheng rituals and symbolismYummy factors aside, this dish remains popular today largely because of the auspicious meanings associated with its ingredients.Service crew at restaurants recite well wishes in the form of Chinese idioms linked to each ingredient as they prepare the dish at the table.Each restaurant applies their own tweaks to the sayings, and the order of the sayings.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/kfc-4/:['When we first saw KFC’s new Zinger Mozzarella Burger on our newsfeeds, our hearts skipped a beat.I mean, look at that beauty. We knew that we had to get our hands on it, and that we had to get our hands on it fast.Given a choice between the Zinger Mozzarella Meal (Zinger Mozzarella Burger, Spicy Potato Bites, and regular Pepsi – $8.80) and the Zinger Mozzarella Box (Zinger Mozzarella Burger, 1 Piece Chicken, Spicy Potato Bites, Regular Whipped Potato and regular Pepsi – $10.50), we decided to go all out and opted for the box. The meal doesn’t look particularly impressive at first glance, but reserve your judgment for later…Now, let’s talk about the Zinger Mozzarella Burger. This features the iconic KFC Zinger fillet, turkey bacon, shredded lettuce, pizza tomato sauce, and an utterly decadent fried cheese patty which is made using a combination of mozzarella and jalapeno cheese. What we found a little disappointing was the fact that we couldn’t taste even the slightest hint of jalapeno in the cheese – but the patty is fried to perfection, which does earn it extra brownie points.Warning: it’s almost impossible to consume this burger daintily (unless you don’t attempt the cheese pull – but where’s the fun in that?) You will drop lettuce everywhere. You will get pizza tomato sauce on your fingers. But if that’s what it takes to witness an amazing cheese pull, hey, we’re down.Moving on the other components of the box: the chicken, whipped potato and pepsi are standard, but the Spicy Potato Bites are new. We’re sorry to say that these are a bit of a misnomer – they weren’t spicy in the least, and they were also less crispy than we would’ve liked. Also, the container which these came in was only half-filled – what’s up with that?All in all, we love the Zinger Mozzarella burger, and we’d gladly pay for it, but the other elements of the meal are pretty perfunctory. KFC has really impressed us with its burger and incredible cheese patty – now, if only these came in a frozen pack, so that we could heat them up in the microwave and consume them whilst we’re binge-watching Netflix…Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/mcdonalds-7/:['After a six-year hiatus, MacDonald’s has decided to bring back the Ebi Burger again for a limited run. This time, it also introduced a new White Choc Strawberry Cream Pie to go along with it.People who enjoyed this burger way back in 2013 will probably remember the chaos that took place then, when the buns were so popular they went out of stock soon after the initial launch. Now that they are back, we ordered an Ebi Burger Feast at our nearest Golden Arches for a taste test revisit.\xa0\xa0Ebi BurgerIn Singapore, seafood burgers are quite a rarity. The Ebi Burger, like its name suggests, traces its roots back to Japan (“ebi” means “prawn” in Japanese), where prawn burger patties are quite common at fast food chains such as Lotteria and MOS Burger.Compared to its Japanese cousins, the MacDonald’s Ebi Burger looks pretty similar. A deep-fried, breaded shrimp patty, served with a dash of sesame mayonnaise and sandwiched between buns topped with black sesame seeds. I expected this burger to taste similar to those from the Japanese chains, but when I sank my teeth into it, I instantly found it quite different.The first thought that came to my mind was how similar the Ebi Burger patty tasted in comparison to the filling inside a har gow (steamed prawn dumpling) from a dim sum cart. You get chunks of prawn meat distributed evenly between a gooey, starchy, prawn-flavoured filler paste. Like har gow, it had a savoury, umami taste.MacDonald’s also made a unique choice in pairing the Ebi Burger with sesame mayonnaise instead of Thousand Island this time, and I can’t say I like either very much. In the 2013 original, the Thousand Island was a little too tart and overwhelmed the taste of the prawn patty. In this version, the sesame mayo did complement the Ebi Burger patty better, but lacked the acidity that would have enhanced the flavour of the seafood. If I could choose, I would have gone with tartar sauce instead.In all, the Ebi Burger tastes pretty decent. I like that it was not greasy and that despite it reminding me of dim sum, it was a pretty satisfying treat. Since it is a limited edition item, I would probably choose to eat this again before it runs out, but the Ebi Burger will not be my first choice if it was a regular menu item.\xa0White Choc Strawberry Cream PieMaking its debut in this latest limited edition run is the White Choc Strawberry Cream Pie. MacDonald’s has come up with some rather awesome pies before, and I am quite a fan of them. I even liked the not-so-popular creamy chicken pie, that some people thought tasted odd.Well, not this one. By its name alone, the White Choc Strawberry Cream Pie promised a lot. It was fair to expect that it should contain white chocolate, strawberries, and be creamy to boot. It was none of those.Upon opening the packaging, I noticed that this pie is a little tinier than its Apple Pie cousin (which I totally adore). The White Choc Strawberry Cream Pie also comes with a Danish pastry shell, which I found to be a tad soggy and greasy.But what undid the whole deal for me was the filling. The white chocolate strawberry filling had a dry, sandy texture. I liked that it was not too sweet, but I could hardly taste the strawberry flavours at all.If you like greasy, fried pastries like curry puffs, and are also a sweet tooth, this limited edition dessert pie may be worth a shot. Otherwise, order an ice cream sundae instead.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

This is what we ate, and why we liked it.Peppery, saucy goodness in the chicken Prosperity Burger.We are big fans of the chewy, curled potato snacks that are lightly coated with seasoning .“These are, in our opinion, McDonald’s best seasonal offering.\xa0The best part is easily the full-bodied sauce, with just the right amount of peppery kick.”\xa0Prosperity Burger\xa0with beef patty\nThese are, in our opinion, McDonald’s best seasonal offering.\xa0They may be ordered a la carte (single patty $5.40, double patty $7.25) or as part of a meal (with regular fries and Coca Cola, single patty $7.20, double patty $9.25; as a Prosperity Beef Feast with a single patty burger, regular fries, Orange McFizz and Taro Pie, $8.65)The Prosperity Burger usually has a chicken version as well, however this year’s offering is only a beef version. The beef patty is succulent, with a full-flavoured black pepper sauce slathered on it, garnished with slivers of onions and then sandwiched in a mini-baguette-sized sesame toasted bun. The best part is easily the full-bodied sauce, with just the right amount of peppery kick. We found ourselves dipping even the fries in the sauce that oozed off the side of the burgers.\xa0Our only wish? That the buns have a bit more hold and do not “disintegrate” so easily with the sauce-to-sandwich ratio. Size-wise, this is a substantial offering even with a single patty.The fries:\xa0The popular Twister Fries (small, $3.20; large $3.40) were made available a week after McDonald’s launched the Prosperity menu. Better late than never, as we are big fans of the chewy, curled potato snacks that are lightly coated with seasoning and perfectly fried. They are also available at a $0.25 top up to any value meal. When we tried the burger earlier, we had to make do with regular fries that came as part of the meal, or at $1.95 per a-la-carte order of fries.The drink: The Orange McFizz ($3.10) is a\xa0fruity, fizzy drink that when paired with the burger’s peppery-pungent sauce, is a welcome respite in between bites. This is also available with a 50-cent top-up to every value meal.The pie: The Taro Pie is exactly like the Apple Pie, but with taro paste within. The taro paste is quite sweet but the taro flavour is rather muted. Stick to the burgers, we say. This retails at $1.45 a piece, or at a top-up of $1.20 with every value meal.Value for money:\xa0The prices are in line with McDonald’s seasonal offerings, such as the\xa0McAloo Tiki\xa0($3.40), the Samurai Burger (meal, $7.95) and the Ebi Burger (single patty, meal, $6.40).Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/mcdonald/:['At around 12.09pm this afternoon, McDonald’s Singapore posted on the wall of their Facebook page a “new condiments policy”\xa0that limits the number of free Chicken McNugget sauces\xa0customers can have.Customers will now have to pay $0.30 for each extra packet of Curry, BBQ or Sweet & Sour Nuggets Sauces across its 186\xa0outlets in Singapore.In their Facebook post, McDonald’s Singapore cites waste reduction as the reason for the introduction of the policy and\xa0reassures that this policy does not mean the absence of free sauces: “[Customers will]\xa0still have at least one free Nuggets\xa0Sauce with your Extra Value Meal or Chicken McNuggets orders, [only] customers who consume larger amounts of sauce need only to pay $0.30 for each additional unit.”The considerate fast-food giant also included a chart for customers who respond better to visual representation. The ‘Love more, waste less’ chart does not merely detail how many free sauces customers are entitled to, it is also a plea: “To help reduce wastage, we need your support to\xa0save our sauces.”\xa0Here is the gist of\xa0it: if requested, you can get one packet of Curry, BBQ or Sweet & Sour\xa0sauce. If you buy six or more pieces of chicken McNuggets; it’s one complimentary sauce for six pieces, two for nine and four for 20. Anything more is $0.30\xa0per packet.The wall post has ruffled up a lot of feathers – the post is going strong; after five hours of posting:\xa0it\xa0garnered 412\xa0likes and 404 comments, and these keep on coming. Commenter Wei Siong Ang said, “Honestly, this initiative does helps to deter customers from asking more than its required and prevent wastages. However, it should have been more tactful.” While\xa0Adele Pang asked, “Will you give me back $0.30 for not taking your curry sauce?”Tan Li Jia posted a piece of constructive criticism: “McDonalds, I hope all your staff are educated on the new policy on the sauces. All staff must know they have to offer a packet of sauce for 6pcs nuggets and upon request for one more packet, give it for free. Many are charging 30cents [sic]\xa0for the first packet upon customer’s request. That will only frustrate the customers as it’s not the same as what the policy had stated in black and white.”The much-loved curry sauce was temporarily discontinued due to compromised packaging\xa0in November 2011. McDonald’s was largely praised by the Facebook community for explaining the sauce’s discontinuation in November, but the response this time is less positive.This current charge-for-sauces policy was on trial for a month from 25 July at 30 of McDonald’s north-area outlets.In countries such as Japan, the United States and Australia, McDonald’s already charge customers for their McNuggets sauces.\xa0Singapore, then, seems to be slow in comparison on the uptake. Perhaps the long-standing free-factor explains why Singaporeans have grown so\xa0attached and feel entitled to the McNuggets sauces.Whatever the reason, please don’t take it out on the waitstaff. After all, they’re only paid $4.50 per hour to carry out orders.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

Now McDonald’s has another new item to ruin diets of Singaporeans everywhere: the Chocolate Pie ($1.40), which was first available in South Korea and Japan. I mean, it’s chocolate, and it’s pie — you can’t go wrong with that combination right?Well, not quite. If you’re gonna have it, have it warm — make sure to microwave-heat it if you’re taking away or ordering delivery — since the dark chocolate lava sauce tastes strangely stale and artificial. The sauce possesses the bitter-sweetness of dark chocolate but none of the richness or decadence (fine, okay, it’s $1.40, understandable). Also, the sauce is more creamy than runny-oozy, though that’s probably because of the (lack of) heat — hence our recommendation to eat the Chocolate Pie when it’s warm.\xa0I’m a fan of McDonald’s other new item, the Fish & Fries ($7.90 for value meal), featuring a crispy battered fish filet and McDonald’s fries (one of the best in the world if you ask me). It ticks all the boxes of what I ask for in a fish filet: a crispy exterior — theirs is legit crispy, so much so that it reminded me of Long John Silver’s offerings — and tender flesh. Nothing special, but a welcome alternative to burgers and McNuggets.McDonald’s has also launched the Sweet Chili Fish Burger ($7.50 for value meal), featuring the same fish filet, but jazzed up with sweet chili mayo and vegetables, and served on a chili bun. Decent enough that I don’t mind busting my calorie quota for it.\xa0All items are available after breakfast hours in all restaurants and via McDelivery and Uber Eats from 1 March 2018.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

The burger croquette is made of potatoes, peas, breadcrumbs and spices, topped with tomatoes, onions and a sweet tomato mayonnaise.Besides the burger, other new limited-offering introductions to the menu include curry drumlets ($2) and a butterscotch sundae ($1.50).The McAloo Tikki is available after 11am from Mondays to Fridays, and after noon on Saturdays and Sundays. It is not available for order via McDelivery, at instituitional stores and within Resorts World Sentosa.The announcement has been met with mostly positive responses on McDonald’s Singapore’s Facebook page. The post garnered nearly 620 ‘likes’ and over 810 ‘shares’ within six hours of its posting at 10am.Facebook user Fern Lee is pleased: “Finally! Something for the vegeterians (sic).

The bite is complete with crisp, fresh lettuce. The peri sauce contains peri-peri, or piri piri, Africa’s hottest pepper measuring up to 175,000 Scoville units. That’s about 20 times hotter than the jalapeno peppers we are generally familiar with.With a much spicier, and tangy, kick than the McSpicy, the Red Peri Scorcher is definitely looking to more than glaze taste buds.\xa0A long bun with a top slit holds all those elements together. It is soft, warm and adequately toasted, and more delicate than I had expected.Like everyone else, I found myself succumbing to the all-too-tempting option of having sides.

This dessert pie has a crispy outter pastry shell, similar to that of the regular Apple Pie, and an all-new mango-passionfruit filling.Our verdict? This new pie is pretty good. We like how the crispy crust and oozy fruit filling made a great combination. The mango and passionfruit filling was also chock-full of fruity flavouts, with the right balance of sweet mango and tart passionfruit notes to guarantee that it’s satisfying.Prosperity Beef Burger and Double Prosperity Chicken Burger (from $5.70 and $7.70, respectively)Available in chicken or beef, the Prosperity Burger comprises a long sub-style sandwich bun, with either single or double meat patties dipped in a black pepper sauce, served with a sprinkle of fresh sliced onions.A favourite among McDonald’s fans over the years, this burger will settle well with people who like their black pepper sauce to be spicy. However, people who prefer a milder black pepper sauce may find the Prosperity Burger’s taste a little too overpowering.If you have to choose between the options, get the beef burger. The patty is tender and flavourful, and goes well with the black pepper sauce.Prosperity Twister Fries (from $3.90 (M) ala carte)Some people like these fries because of their unique swirly shapes, while others believe that eating them will help to “twist” their luck for the better in the coming Lunar New Year. Whether you’re a believer or not, we’d recommend trying these fries anyway.The Twister Fries are a little different from McDonald’s usual outing.

The first thing that caught our eyes was the industrial design of the place.This layout is meant to depict the process that goes behind creating Yanmi Yoghurt products. This is contrary to the pastel layout that you may be accustomed to at the Funan outlet.We were given four drinks to try- Yanmi’s Purple Rice Yogurt ($4.80), Chewy Oats Yogurt ($4.80), Man-mango Yogurt ($5.30) and Refreshing Watermelon Yogurt ($5.30).These drinks are part of their 10 fan favourites, which you can find out about at the store itself.The Yanmi Purple Rice Yogurt has a sweet, sour and chewy combination. The drink has a substantial bite to it which makes it enjoyable while every bite has a sour aftertaste.We think that it could even substitute for a meal as it left us feeling full.The next drink we tried was the Chewy Oats Yogurt. This is exactly what you would expect from an Oats Yogurt combination. It is smooth, creamy and has small oat bits in it that would satisfy the needs of oat lovers.Yanmi Yogurt’s Man-mango Yogurt is slightly different from the other drinks because of how refreshing it is. We shook the drink before sipping the Yogurt drink, and it balanced out the sweet and sour notes well for us. The Mango flavour was distinct, and we would say that it is worth a try.The last drink would be the Refreshing Watermelon Yogurt. This drink would be a hit among berry lovers as though it is a watermelon flavoured drink, and there was an interesting berry taste.Would we visit this aesthetically pleasing cafe again?Yes but only to purchase the Yanmi Purple Rice Yogurt and Man-mango Yogurt as the flavours complement each other well and the texture is more than decent.The price points of Yanmi Yogurt products make their drinks worth a try as well.Visit the new outlet at Wisma Atria, 435 Orchard Rd, #B1-44, Singapore 238877 to try out the drinks for yourself today.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/hoe-hokkien-mee/:['A stall with killer fried Hokkien mee, no media attention and no long queues? This is a real hidden gem.\nThis stall quietly opened in late 2016 at North Bridge Road Market and Food Centre and has slowly gained a modest following for having a killer soupy-style fried Hokkien mee.That said, this review comes with a fair warning: it is only for those who love very soupy-style fried Hokkien mee. If you like it dry or only with a little bit of gravy, you can click away now.Run by a husband and wife team in their 60s, Henry who does the cooking, learnt the basics of cooking fried Hokkien mee from a veteran hawker before refining the recipe to where it currently is at.Yellow noodles and the thinner version of chor (thick) bee hoon is cooked to a firm, bouncy texture and the stock used — a mix of pork bones and prawn shells — is reduced to a thick soupy consistency that gets thicker and richer the more you leave it to sit.The garlic-laced stock is very robust and potent with a sheen of pork fat richness and gets better when it is ordered takeaway. The dish is packed in opeh leaf which imparts a light woody aroma to the taste.The portions ($4/5/8) are nicely generous and are much more than what you would get at other fried Hokkien mee stalls for the same money.For a $5 portion, you get three medium sized prawns that are nicely blanched and not dry and also some squid ring bits that come very soft and nicely undercooked.Swirl around the noodles and you’ll see cooked eggs and a nice number of pork belly slices but they don’t throw in any bean sprouts at all.Also lacking is any smoky wok hei which would have enhanced the dish even more.The chilli given out is nicely oil rich and has a strong dried prawn flavour to it. It adds more complex savouriness to the dish but add with restraint as it can easily over-dominate the natural potent taste of the stock.A modest amount of crunchy pork lard is given out but only if you ask for it. They keep the lard in a small container next to the chilli and the lady boss, Lucy will gladly give out as much as you want.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/chindamani-indian-restaurant/:['The Place\xa0With several branches in Singapore,\xa0Chindamani Indian Restaurant\xa0is a convenient spot for me to satisfy my prata craving given that it has an outlet at Serangoon North Avenue 2. Located at the corner stall of a coffee shop, long queues is often spotted at the popular stall where most people are really here for its Roti Prata. You can only do takeaways during this circuit breaker period but in normal times, the coffee shop is very packed and finding a table can be challenging.The Food\xa0I have been here a couple of times and tried both the egg and plain (‘kosong’) ones, and the kosong prata remains to be my favourite. Priced at $1.20 for the kosong prata, every piece is prepared freshly and the best part for me is the crispy texture. I put the pratas to test by doing a takeaway recently, and the prata still remained relatively crispy even after the journey back home.The curry is also noteworthy, as the fish curry is luscious and delicious to go with the prata.You can also find other branches of Chindamani in Hougang (Blk 121 and Blk 682), Tampines (Blk 201C and 829), Bishan (Blk 284) and Ang Mo Kio (Blk 443).

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/starbucks-3/:['Starbucks is no stranger to limited-edition beverages, but its two latest outings are a little different: only Starbucks Rewards Members are able to purchase them.Called, rather uncreatively, The Pink Drink and The Yellow Drink, these two thirst-quenchers were introduced on Monday (13 January) to celebrate the coffee chain reaching one million Starbucks rewards members this month. Both drinks are available for one week only, from 13 – 19 January, and only come in the Grande size, priced at $6.80 a pop.HungryGoWhere tried both The Pink Drink and The Yellow Drink on launch day.Read on for our review:\xa0The Pink Drink, $6.80Having seen the photos of this pretty-in-pink drink illustrated on the menu, we had high expectations as it looked so refreshing and vibrant. However, we were more than a tad disappointed when we collected it from the counter. The actual thing appeared to have a more lavender hue than the powder pink colour seen in official photos.Taste-wise, The Pink Drink came across as very sugary, and each sip was accompanied with strong floral aromas. “It’s like drinking a liquid air freshener,” one of our tasters said.Verdict: Buy this only if you want an Insta-worthy drink.\xa0\xa0The Yellow DrinkIn the looks department, The Yellow Drink doesn’t appear too different from your average cup of orange juice. So while the beverage looked exactly like what was advertised in the menu, it certainly didn’t wow anyone when it comes to Insta-worthiness.It may be the Plain Jane when compared to its pink counterpart, but The Yellow Drink certainly won our hearts (and tastebuds) in the taste test.\xa0Tangy and refreshing, The Yellow Drink is a mix of mango and passionfruit flavours. Even though we did find it a tad too sweet, the fruity flavours made for a pretty decent thirst-quencher.\xa0Verdict: Looks really normal, tastes pretty good.\xa0For HungryGoWhere, we are definitely Team Yellow.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/ima-sushi/:['To borrow a line from the esteemed food critic Jay Rayner, there is only one thing worse than bad cheap sushi, and that is bad expensive sushi. Thankfully, the food at the recently opened Ima-Sushi was neither of those.\xa0I may even put it in the cheap-and-good category, which is saying something for a restaurant in the basement of a university.Remember Burnt Cones, that popular gelato spot at Sunset Way?\xa0It turns out churning ice cream isn’t the only thing it excels at.\xa0Its barely-six-month-old Japanese joint at the Singapore Management University (SMU) has been building a reputation on social media, courtesy of the school’s Instagrammers.\xa0Cones are replaced with seaweed and rice, and ice cream replaced with impressive Japanese fare — at an affordable price point, too.The queues at Ima-Sushi are nasty during lunchtime, but it’s worth putting up with for raw fish this good.\xa0The food selection ranges from S$2.40 for a small plate of salmon nigiri to S$21.90 for an indulgent kaisen don.\xa0If you’re not into sushi or raw food, its cooked rice bowls and noodles average around S$8, which is pretty incredible. With sushi that’s easy to pine after and a comfy space, it’s a go from me.As a self-professed sashimi geek, ordering sashimi is always something of a thrill.How thick are the slices going to be? Is the fish fresh and of good quality? The salmon belly sashimi (S$6.20) turned out fabulous, cross-cut for extra tenderness and cut thick, so that it gave more bite.I also sample a selection of its nigiri and gunkan. The aburi mentai maguro sushi (S$2.80), where slightly fatty tuna and a dollop of mentaiko mayo are blowtorched for a smoky-umami aroma, is a real crowd-pleaser that melts away on the tongue.\xa0The spicy salmon gunkan (S$2.80) comes in exceedingly hot, with fresh salmon ladled in a fiery and tangy signature sauce that’s worth a sweat.\xa0Ima-Sushi does some creative maki rolls, such as the SMU dragon roll (S$16.90) with thin slices of unagi and avocado layered cleanly over the top of a crispy prawn maki.\xa0It’s then drizzled with mayo, teriyaki sauce and bits of crunchy tobiko. What’s great about this place is how well the sushi is made; nothing falls apart when we pick them up with chopsticks.The aburi mentai salmon roll (S$13.90) is another competent sushi roll that’s heads above the kind you’d find at mass-market sushi joints. It comes with a chunky slice of torched fish, and plenty of sweet tamagoyaki and crabstick inside.\xa0\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50% off at picturesque date spots, including Wildseed Cafe at The Alkaff Mansion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHawker Hustlers: Hipster hawker Ray Yeo of Bei-Ing Dimsum Club on reinventing dim sum and his love for all things Japan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy this point, I realise what makes the sushi here so satisfying: The rice, slightly sticky but capable of letting go with barely a tap, and lightly vinegared with a hint of umami and salt.If sashimi isn’t filling enough, and sushi doesn’t give you enough carbs, then the kaisen chirashi don (S$21.90) is that culmination of raw seafood and rice.\xa0Served with deft slices of the best raw stuff, you get tuna with a hint of fattiness, that glorious salmon belly from before, meaty swordfish, and a large botan prawn served with its head intact.\xa0There’s also a generous, briny scoop of ikura, grilled egg, pickled ginger, sliced cucumber, and radish slivers. Each type of fish is served with two slices, making it easy to share with my dining companion.Also from the donburi list is the volcano chicken karaage don (S$9.90), featuring nicely fried pieces of leg meat that are crispy without the oiliness.\xa0Don’t get me started on the dressing. It’s creamy, tangy, deceptively spicy and wholly addictive. It’s a good thing there’s free tea and iced water to quash the burn. An obvious choice if you like it spicy.A crispy ebi udon at S$9.90? Yes, please.\xa0Although it’s deep-fried till golden brown, the coating is light and not greasy, and the airy flakes give it a nice crunch.\xa0The shrimp is on the smaller side but is quite succulent, while the noodles are slightly chewy with a bouncy texture.I ordered a vanilla taiyaki (S$2.50), which turns out to be one of those packaged desserts you get at Don Don Donki or Meidi-Ya.It’s an old-fashioned taiyaki ice cream — a goldfish-shaped wafer filled with red bean azuki and vanilla ice cream. The wafer is half crispy and half soft, and is quite a delicious and unique thing to try, especially if you’re a fan of Japanese sweets.While we’re on the topic of dessert, the ice cream here — supplied by Burnt Cones — is served a tad frozen.\xa0We waited a good three minutes before our cup of uji matcha (S$5) was soft enough to scoop, and even then, it barely tasted anything like the creamy treat you get when the ice cream is scooped fresh in front of you.Can I also say that the wasabi here is tepid? I’m not expecting the freshly grated stuff, but the artificially green wasabi here is rather mild, lacking any vibrance or spicy kick whatsoever. Then again, how can I complain when I’m paying a little more than a dollar for a piece of sushi?While you can help yourself to free green tea and water at the side, it’d be nice if the place also serves specialty beverages such as green tea lattes and coffee drinks. The drinks at Ima-Sushi are limited to canned drinks such as Coke, Qoo White Grape and Ayataka. Is it conducive to conversation? Ima-Sushi can get really noisy from the 11am to 1pm mark, so come during off-peak hours for a more peaceful meal.Is a reservation necessary? It’s wise to make a reservation on weekdays if you’re heading there during lunch hour.How to get there? Walk for six minutes from Bras Basah MRT station through the underground linkway to SMU.

The pies cost S$8.90 per piece in stores island-wide, and on food delivery platforms, they cost S$9.20 each.The pie is a locally-inspired take on Starbuck’s classic meat pies, and serves as an alternative for vegetarian diners who miss the creaminess of rending, as well as meat eaters who want to try something healthier.Made with flaky shortcrust pastry, it is filled with ground Impossible Burger from the food company Impossible Foods. The burger tastes exactly like meat, but is made entirely from plants. Reviews of the Impossible Burger has generally been positive, with many meat lovers not being able to tell the difference between real meat and the vegetarian alternative.The plant-based filling is slow-cooked in a creamy rendang gravy with carrots, edamame and potatoes. A hard-boiled egg lies in the centre.The pie is a part of Starbucks’ limited-edition SHIOK! Food Menu, a selection of six food items celebrating local flavours.

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/best-frozen-pizza/:['What do you do when the hunger pangs hit at midnight? What about when guests unexpectedly turn up? Or when the guys come over for a late-night soccer TV session?For occasions like these, it’s a good idea to stock up on frozen pizza. Just pull one out of the freezer, pop it into the oven, and 10 minutes later, you can all enjoy a freshly baked, piping hot pizza!We taste-tested five popular supermarket brands for frozen pizza. Which ones are worthy of a spot on your freezer shelf?\xa0Dr Oetker Ristorante Pizza  EDITOR’S PICK!Price: $9.95 (10-inch pizza). Available at major supermarkets.Available flavours: Salame, hawaii, mozarella, funghi, quattro formaggi, vegetaleMade in: GermanyRating: 4.5/5Dr Oetker’s Ristorante Pizza range is one of the bestselling frozen pizzas worldwide. At first bite, its appeal was evident. Neither too thick nor too thin, the crust was of the perfect thickness. The edges were crisp while the centre part retained a pleasant bite.For all the flavours we tried, the pizzas were liberally spread with mozzarella cheese and delicious tomato sauce. Topped with premium quality ingredients, the pizzas tasted fresh and juicy. We nearly forgot that we were eating frozen pizza!The wide range of flavours meant that there was something for everyone. The clear and easy-to-understand pictorial cooking instructions was another big plus. Dr Oetker’s Ristorante Pizza is definitely worth stocking up!\xa0Gourmet Pizza DelightsPrice: $9.90 (10-inch pizza). Available at major supermarkets.Available flavours: Chicken proscuitto New Yorker, al fungi, cheeseMade in: SingaporeRating: 4.5/5Gourmet’s pizzas stand out from the crowd with their cream-based sauce. It’s a delightful change from the usual tomato-based pizza sauce.The smooth and tasty sauce was deliciously addictive, and paired superbly with the cracker-like pizza crust. We liked how the thin and light crust stayed delectably crispy even when cold.Their range is limited, but what they lack in quantity, they make up for in quality. Our favourite was the chicken proscuitto New Yorker–a lavish creation of tasty chicken ham, fragrant parsley, and juicy sliced onion.\xa0Ital PizzaPrice: $8.15 (10-inch pizza). Available at Cold Storage (Centrepoint).Available flavours: 4 formaggi, vegetariana, capreseMade in: ItalyRating: 3.5/5Handmade, leavened for 24 hours and cooked in a wood-burning oven, this made-in-Italy pizza looks like authentic wood-fired pizza.Unlike machine-made crusts that are of uniform thickness, Ital Pizza’s crust has that uneven thickness—thinner in the centre, thicker around the edges—that could only by achieved by hand.We liked the crisp, delicate and airy crust, which was topped with fresh-tasting ingredients. The 4 formaggi (4 cheeses) pizza was surprisingly addictive, but the vegetarian pizza was rather bland. For both flavours, they could have used more tomato sauce to provide additional flavour and moisture.\xa0Sunshine PizzaPrice: $6.25 (two 6-inch pizzas). Available at major supermarkets.Available flavours: Hawaiian, satay, turkey ham, seafood, cheeseMade in: SingaporeRating: 3/5\nEach box of Sunshine Pizza has two separately-sealed pizzas, which gives you the option of having just one as a light snack, or two as a full meal.The robust tomato sauce was lip-smackingly good. With generous amounts of pineapple chunks and chicken sausage, the Hawaiian pizza was a crowd favourite. The satay chicken pizza was rather dry and overly strong on spices, but the tender chicken and sweet pineapple chunks saved it from being a total mess.Unfortunately, the great toppings were marred by a less-than-ideal crust. Too dense and thick, the doughy-tasting crust didn’t do any justice to the pizzas.\xa0Pedro’s PizzeriaPrice: $10.25 (9-inch pizza). Available at major supermarkets.Available flavours: Hawaiian, supremo, pepperoni, meat lovers, margheritaMade in: AustraliaRating: 2/5The pictures on the boxes looked extremely enticing. We were also very impressed with the liberal amount of toppings on the pizzas. However, they looked better than they tasted.There were several things we didn’t like about this brand. To start with, the pizzas had a highly “processed” taste. We were unimpressed with the dry crust as well. The watery tomato sauce lacked richness in flavour. Also, there wasn’t enough sauce and cheese.We tried the Hawaiian and supremo, with the Hawaiian faring slightly better. Overall, both pizzas were dry and tasted rather artificial. It’s pizzas like these that give frozen pizzas a bad name.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/yew-chuan-claypot-rice/:['After learning the trade for six years from none other than\xa0that famous claypot rice stall in Geylang Lorong 33, Pan Nip Chang started his own claypot rice business some 10 years ago and employs the same twice cooking method that his previous workplace uses to make the claypot rice nice and roasted.The claypot is first cooked over gas then switched over to a gentle wood fire to get some of that smoky aroma into the pot and to crisp up the bottom of the pot for the\xa0fan chiew\xa0(roasted/burnt rice).\nWhen it arrives at your table, you can definitely smell the smoky aroma and it is one of the few places which has a thicker-than-usual layer of crusty rice ($12 to $30) — though to nitpick — the rice does occasionally come more on the burnt side than is normal.\nThe other highlight are the pieces of chicken which come very incredibly well-marinated and with a killer soft texture that has to be tasted to be believed.The dish comes with very sizeable pieces of semi-dried salted fish along with\xa0lap cheong\xa0(chinese sausage) and also slices of\xa0yun cheong\xa0(liver sausage), an ingredient which is not very common in claypot rice at the hawker level.Dark soy sauce and sesame-flavoured oil are left on the table and you can mix in however much you like.They used to sell individual claypot portions for $6 but it has been phased out. $12 is the minimum portion which is good for two people.They also offer claypot bak kut teh ($4.50), Claypot Braised Pork with preserved vegetables ($4.50) and vegetables with oyster sauce as supplementary dishes.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/symbolic-dishes-for-chinese-new-year/:['The most important festival in the Chinese calendar also comes with longstanding traditions. Spanning at least 2,000 years to the time of the Han Dynasty, Chinese New Year – or Spring Festival\xa0– began as an end-of-harvest celebration to give thanks for the year’s crops.Food, then and now, is the main preoccupation of Chinese New Year, though the last 50 years have given us some newfangled modern favourites. If you look forward to chilli bacon bak kwa more than grandma’s steamed fish, that’s just a sign of the changing times. But give the timeless recipes a chance too – there’s a reason why these auspicious dishes and food items are served for reunion dinner. Here’s a look at what to eat to start the year right:Nian gao\xa0 –\xa0“Year cake”Mandarin for “year cake”,\xa0 this glutinous rice-based cake can be found year round, but is traditionally consumed during Chinese New Year for good luck. Nian gao\xa0is a homonym for ‘higher year’ – literally raising yourself in status in the coming year. It’s a popular gift during this period, especially when shaped in a pair of carps to symbolise surplus, or ingots to represent wealth. The cakes we’re familiar with are in the Cantonese style, sweetened with brown sugar and can be eaten as is. However, the favourite way is to pan-fry it with an eggwash to add a crispy bite to the sticky, chewy treat.Yu\xa0–\xa0FishThe Chinese word for “abundance” or “surplus”, yu (a homonym for “fish”) is inescapable during Chinese New Year, and this makes fish the inevitable star of any Chinese New Year meal. A whole fish with the head and tail is de rigeur, as it symbolises the year’s beginning to end, and freshwater is usually preferred. However, tradition also has it that you should deliberately leave some of the fish uneaten to truly represent the “surpluses” of the coming year.Yu sheng\xa0–\xa0Raw fish saladThe contemporary version of this dish proudly debuted in Singapore in the 1960s at Lai Wah Restaurant. Yusheng or yoo sang (in Cantonese) translates to “raw fish”, but also symbolises abundance. The humble dish was thought to have been inspired by a dish that originated in Guangdong, China – strips of fresh, raw fish to accompany porridge. It is meant to be served on ren ri, the seventh day of new year, but the combination of condiments such as plum sauce and sesame oil, alongside shredded fresh vegetables and raw strips of fish or seafood has become so popular that it’s eaten before, during and even after Chinese New Year, as part of any gatherings or reunions.Jiao zi –\xa0DumplingsDumplings traditionally resemble ingots, or money, hence eating dumpling is believed to usher in wealth. In Northern China where this tradition is more popular, jiao zi are made with a soy-ginger cabbage and pork filling, and eaten at midnight. To make it more literal, a gold coin may be hidden in one of the dumplings to bring extra luck to the eater. More popular in Singaopore is tang yuan – sweet glutinous rice balls; its name sounds like tuan yuan, or ‘reunion’.Fatt choy ho see –\xa0Black moss with dried oystersChances are, you will be confronted with a vegetable dish studded with black moss (fatt choy – which sounds like “strike it rich” in Cantonese) and braised dried oysters (ho see – Cantonese term signifying “good things”). The name of the resulting dish sounds like “successful, prosperous business” – and is usually served casserole-style with lettuce (sang choy which sounds in Cantonese like “rising fortune”). Slurp it up.Chang shou mian –\xa0Longevity noodlesThe longer the noodle, the longer the wish for a long (and healthy) life. Chang shou mien, or longevity noodles, are eaten all year round, but bring extra meaning to birthday and new year celebrations. To boost the longevity wishes, cook your noodles with mustard greens, which symbolise long life for parents.The phoenix and dragon –\xa0Whole chicken and lobsterBring hope to your table with a whole chicken. The chicken, or phoenix, represents a good marriage and the coming together of families. The Cantonese will opt for fried chicken, as the dish name in Cantonese, kum gai bo hay, means “golden rooster reporting good news”. According to Martin Yan, the “phoenix and dragon” dish is a must for Chinese New Year – using chicken to represent the phoenix and lobster for dragon.Pencai\xa0 –\xa0“Big bowl feast”\n\nA braised dish attributed to the Song Dynasty and associated with Hong Kong, pencai has become an attractive dish for Singaporeans during Chinese New Year for its large portions and luxe ingredients, rather than festive symbolism. In a wooden or ceramic basin or pot, ingredients are layered according to textures – vegetables are arrayed at the bottom to soak up juices, pork, chicken and mushrooms in the middle, and seafood such as prawns, abalone, sea cucumber and scallops are crowned on top. The dish is prepared over a few days to bring out the flavours of each ingredient.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/best-ngoh-hiang/:['Ngoh hiang (literally “five spices”) is a much-loved hawker snack of fried items. It has its roots from the Hokkien and Teochew dialect groups.Traditionally, ngoh hiang consisted of four classic items—meat roll (popularly known as “ngoh hiang”), liver roll, pink sausage and egg slice. Later, prawn fritters were also added. Now, most hawkers include supplied items like tau kwa (firm beancurd), fish ball, and century egg to extend their range.We taste-tested some iconic ngoh hiang specialists and pit them against one another in this review. Who will emerge as the champion of fritters?\xa0China Street Fritters  EDITOR’S PICK!#01-64 Maxwell Food CentreOpening hours: Tue-Sun: 12pm-7.30pmRating: 4.5/5China Street Fritters had its beginnings as a roadside stall in China Street during the 1940s. Now, this heritage hawker stall is run by the second generation owners. Specialising in Hokkien-style ngoh hiang, they offer the four classic items—sausage, meat roll, liver roll, and egg slice—as well as tau kwa, fish ball, and century egg. Prawn fritter is not on the menu.For the four classic items, they were very fresh and well-made. The sausage was bouncy and had a good balance of lean meat and fat. The meat roll and liver roll were meaty, tasty and aromatic. But our favourite was the egg slice, which had a crispy crust, while the inside was melt-in-the-mouth.Overall, we liked how all the items were well-fried but managed to retain a clean taste. The bee hoon was tasty and sufficiently moist, acting as a more-than-decent accompaniment to the fried items. However, the watery chilli sauce could have had more punch.\xa0Lao Zhong Zhong Five Spice Stall BEST VARIETY & BEST CHILLI29 Tai Thong Crescent, Lao Zhong Zhong Eating HouseOpening hours: Tue-Sun: 11.30am-11pmRating: 4.5/5Be spoilt for choice at Lao Zhong Zhong’s amazing variety of Teochew-style ngoh hiang. In addition to the four classic items, there are 10 other kinds of items available here.Besides century egg, tau kwa and fish ball, the rest of the items are freshly made on the premises. For the four classic items, they were much better than average, but lacked the finesse of China Street Fritters.More memorable items include the hae cho (prawn roll), braised cuttlefish and prawn fritters. The prawn roll was fat and full of crunchy chopped water chestnut and onion. Also, do try the two types of prawn fritters—both the pancake and crispy versions. The crispy prawn fritter was very light and airy.Deserving special mention is their super shiok chilli sauce. It was very aromatic and piquant, and had chopped raw onion and peanut which gave it that extra special kick!\xa0Five Spice Prawn Fritter 1 Tanjong Pagar Plaza, #02-04/05Opening hours: Daily: 11.30am-1.30pmRating: 4/5The range here is minimal, but this doesn’t deter the daily stream of customers who wait for up to 20 minutes for the elderly stall owner to fry each order one plate at a time.The main draw here is the prawn fritter, which is cooked upon order. It’s a fascinating process to watch—the stallowner spoons batter onto a spatula, tops it with prawn and beansprouts, covers it with more batter, then deep-fries it. The result is a crisp pancake with soft, mushy insides with bursts of refreshing beansprout. The whole sensation was immensely homely and comforting.The other items on the menu are homemade egg slice, meat roll, and pink sausage, as well as supplied tau kwa and fish ball. They were decent but not as memorable as the prawn fritter. The fried items were also rather oily. However, we enjoyed the rather unusual fried bee hoon. A thicker variety of noodle was used, which gave more bite. We liked how it was moist and lightly seasoned, completing the rustic food experience.\xa0Hup Kee China Street Ngoh Hiang#01-97 Maxwell Food CentreOpening hours: Tue-Sun: 11.30am-7.30pmRating: 3.5/5Against their established peer in the same food centre, Hup Kee has proved to be a worthy competitor. They also offer Hokkien-style ngoh hiang without prawn fritters, with the same range of items as China Street Fritters.On the whole, Hup Kee’s homemade offerings were better than those from run-of-the-mill ngoh hiang stalls, but stopped short of being outstanding. Their pink sausage was a bit too sweet and soft for our liking. Also, the meat roll was pathetically thin. It was so thin we could hardly taste the filling.Thankfully, the fried items demonstrated good control of temperature and oil. They were crispy without being greasy. The bee hoon was extremely flavourful, airy, and bouncy, but it also made us rather thirsty.\xa0Bukit Merah Central Wu Xiang Guan ChangBlk 163 Bukit Merah Central, #02-26 Bukit Merah Central Food CentreOpening hours: Mon-Sat: 1pm-9pmRating: 3/5There are hits and misses here, but their fresh and hearty ngoh hiang is certainly worth a try if you’re in the vicinity.Hits included the meat roll and liver roll. We enjoyed their fat and tasty meat roll and liver roll. Another must-try is the homemade spring roll, filled lots of juicy yam bean and other vegetables. Although the tau kwa is supplied, it was of good quality. The beancurd was fried till crispy on the outside, but the interior was gorgeously moist and melt-in-the-mouth.Skip the overly dense and heavy yam roll. The crispy prawn fritter wasn’t greasy, but it wasn’t light and airy enough. The bee hoon could have been more moist, but at least it wasn’t overly salty or greasy.\xa0inSing.com made anonymous visits and paid for its own meals at the stalls featured here.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/selera-rasa/:['In business since the early 1980s, this stall is popular for its very cheap biryanis.While normally you would have to pay $5 and upwards for a plate, at Selera Rasa, it is only $3.50 which is incredible value-for-money.The best biryanis in Singapore for $10 or lessThe flavour is also far better than what you’d get from an average stall.The stall’s cheap biryani offer started just 10 years ago and the reception was so positive that they stopped selling their other dish of nasi lemak to focus solely on biryani.What you get is the local Malay-style “nasi” biryani — with average biryani rice portions, a standard meat portion on top, sliced cucumbers and dalcha (lentil-based curry) on the side.You can also add a boiled egg for an additional 50 cents.The chicken and mutton options come spicier than normal but the savoury curry flavour is rather moderate. A little more oomph would be appreciated but you can’t complain at this price point!While the chicken meat textures are decent, the mutton pieces stand out as they are especially tender.The rice — we suspect — is a mix of jasmine and long grain basmati rice and it comes reasonably buttery with occasional scatterings of fried onions.A bit of savoury masala is scooped on to the rice but not enough to seriously upp the savouriness of the dish.That’s where the dalcha comes in — modestly thick and savoury. It helps to put a little more flavour into the dish.The surprising bonus are the chunky pieces of brinjal, carrots, potatoes and/or the occasional mutton fat that they dish out.They have four different biryani options — mutton, fried fish and curry chicken but the main highlight is their fried chicken, also their most popular dish.It comes crispy, is well-spiced and has a big savoury flavour. The meat is also nicely moist and never dry.They only fry one trayful at a time, a good thing so that the chicken is always freshly fried.Additional pieces of fried chicken are only $2 each so you can have a fantastic fried chicken biryani indulgence for only $5.50!On the other end, the fried fish is the least popular among all the options, but it is also excellently done.The cutlets are thick cut and fried using the same spices as the fried chicken. The batter provides a little of that crispy crunch and the flesh is always nice and moist.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/ali-nachia-briyani-dam/:['When this biryani stall first opened at the old Tanjong Pagar railway station in 2002, it quickly gained a loyal following for its excellent and value-for-money biryanis, but all that was put to a stop when the railway station had to shut down in 2011.Ownership of the 26km track from Woodlands to Tanjong Pagar reverted from Malaysia to Singapore, so the stall relocated to Dingxin Mei Shi coffeeshop on the second floor of Tanjong Pagar Plaza bringing along their loyal fanbase.Helmed by Mohammed Ali Latif, 69, the father of three —who previously worked as a butcher and a football coach — learnt how to cook dum biryani when he worked as a wedding caterer in the 1970s. He is the father of ex-national football player Rafi Ali.The stall offers three kinds of biryani — chicken ($7), mutton ($8) and fish ($7, only available on Fridays). The biryanis are dum-style — where the cooked rice and meat combine in one pot for the final steaming process.Ali Nachia is one of the very few hawker-level stalls which practises the dum method as most stalls cook the meat and rice separately. That said, we’re unsure as to how the dum method contributes to the overall flavour as the quality of the meat and rice is as good as any of the top hawker biryani offerings in Singapore and those are done non-dum style.The meats, especially the mutton, have soft and tender textures, also helped by the fact that the mutton parts they select are close to the bone. Meat close to the bone tends to be more tender.The masalas (the thick resultant paste you get from cooking the meats) are thick and nicely intense and goes well with the generous amounts of long-grain basmati rice that is served. While pleasingly buttery, more aromatic spices would have sealed the deal for us.The fish biryani which they only offer on Fridays deserves a big shoutout. Thick cutlets of ang go li (sea bream) are fried then cooked with masala spices. The savoury fish flavour is very distinct, and it has a great richness in its taste, even more than the mutton or chicken offerings.The meat portions are similar to what you get at other biryani stalls — the chicken is a standard thigh portion, which means that the amounts of meat can sometimes be a bit lacking, especially if you’re a big eater.Thankfully, they are very generous when it comes to the dalcha (Hyderabadi Indian curry) ingredients. You always get huge chunks of brinjal, potatoes and carrots, with the occasional mutton fat thrown in for good measure.It has a big savoury flavour with spice flavours and a nice sheen of tanginess and spiciness.In addition to the dalcha, they also give out a savoury sour onion and cucumber raita\xa0(yoghurt dip) and nicely crunchy lightly savoury and sweet cucumber acar\xa0(pickled vegetables).This, plus the more generous ingredients in their dalcha, partially justifies the higher prices at this biryani stall. Most biryanis at the hawker level costs cheaper at $5.50 to $6.50.The raita (yoghurt dip) is a nod towards the dum biryani style where thick raita is customarily served, while the achar (and dalcha) are commonly served in local biryani offerings.While the gesture of offering both sides is appreciated, it does mean that there are too many tangy, fresh vegetable side offerings for the amount of rice and meat that you are given.If you’re at the coffeeshop, observe the tables where they are eating biryanis from Ali Nachia, you’ll very often see the achar or raita being left aside.The other downside is that the raita is on the watery side, though still reasonably flavourful.That said, the negatives at this stall are relatively minor as the biryanis at Ali Nachia are easily one of the best in Singapore.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/aburi-en/:['There are plenty of places selling Japanese donburi (rice bowls) in Singapore but among them, Aburi En has been notable for offering very affordable pork and beef dons with a surprising premium feel to them.There are two key specialities at Aburi En — their wagyu beef and pork donburi which are all done aburi-style (grilled/roasted).The best part is that they’ve managed to keep the prices mostly below $20 which means they’re occupying that elusive middle ground price point between cheap ($10) and the more expensive ($25 and up) when it comes to donburi in Singapore.And they haven’t compromised on the quality where it counts.All the meats are grilled using charcoal and all the dons use Nanatsuboshi rice from Hokkaido which has a nice balance of stickiness and sweetness in the eating.When it comes to the meats itself, the quality is where it counts and here, they offer normal pork and beef options but also premium ones for those who want something a little extra special.For the pork rice bowls (butadon), they have normal pork loin for sale (Buta Don; $12), but considering their Premium Buta Don ($15) is only $3 more, it really is worth the extra money.Meat from “chestnut pigs” are used instead and these are pigs that have been fed a natural diet which includes chestnuts.The diet of chestnuts causes some changes to the levels of fatty acids and antioxidants in the pork, which results in a more tender meat that has a little natural sweetness in the taste.Decently sized meat pieces are charcoal grilled and brushed with layer after layer of savoury sweet “tare” sauce resulting in a smokier, deeper flavour.The texture of the meat is extremely tender.In fact, it is sometimes almost too tender, that one wishes for a little more chew in the meat texture but that’s a minor niggle overall.It is also nice that the “tare” sauce has prominent ginger notes and together with the shaved spring onions, there are nice herbs notes in the overall taste.The other dish to look out for is the Premium Buta Bara Don ($16) which uses premium pork belly for more fat richness in the flavour.Three or four very thick and fat grilled pieces are given out in each bowl and they have a little better meat chew with that nice deep smoky tare sauce brushed on top.Over on the beef side (gyudon), they manage to keep the prices affordable by using cheaper Australian wagyu instead.In the Wagyu Karubi Don ($19), the meat comes decently grilled with a balanced savoury sweet sauce. It’s also nice that they pair it with Shijimei mushrooms for that extra nutty mushroom flavour.But the real indulgence comes if you ever decide to order the much pricier Premium Waygu Jyu ($28).Premium Miyazaki A4/A5 wagyu — the real deal — is used and the quality difference is immediately noticeable.\nThe meat is super soft, fatty with a beefier flavour and the “tare” is not so strong that it overwhelms the natural flavour of the meat.The only complaint is that the meat portions are a little on the small side but then again, we are talking about proper Miyazaki beef here.They also offer Miyazaki beef as a side dish — Wagyu Roast Steak ($28) — grilled to a nice medium doneness on a sizzling hotplate with a savoury sauce, and topped off with garlic chips, spring onions and Shimeiji mushrooms or as an all-in-one meal — Wagyu Roast Steak Jyu ($30) — with rice and assorted vegetables.Both are well worth the extra expense.Aburi En offers other mains and sides of unagi, chicken, ramen, salmon and the like — all of which are serviceable but the one that stood out most is the Sumibi Chicken Yaki ($8.80).A classic dish, chicken thigh meat is grilled over charcoal and comes smoky, lightly salted and juicy.A little Japanese yuzu kosho (spicy Japanese yuzu pepper paste) is provided on the side for some additional kick and flavour.\xa0A must-have side dish.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/wedang/:['It is hard enough to find hawker stalls that are good in one dish, but Wedang, which specialises in Malay cuisine, manages to have impressively high standards across many dishes.Located in Golden Mile Food Centre since 2005, the stall sells Malay dishes like mee rebus, mee soto, gado gado, tahu goreng and satay.Started by Azman Kamis who in his late 50s, he left his job at PSA International in 2003 to sell tahu goreng and epok epok (Malay curry puffs) in a coffeeshop. In 2004, he joined his cousin’s satay stall in Golden Mile Food Centre, took over the reins a year later and started Wedang.The tahu goreng ($3.50) is easily the best dish. You can taste the natural taste of the peanuts in the thick sauce and the overall flavour is very balanced — sweet, slightly spicy but with just a light tanginess to balance it out.It can also easily feed two as they use an impressively large piece of softly firm, fresh hard tofu and it is fried to a nice crisp.The other highlight is the satay ($0.70 a stick) as there is more than the usual amount of meat on each stick and the grilled meat manages to remain soft and juicy.Their satay sauce is also not overly sweet or oily. There is instead an emphasis on the taste and crunch of the peanuts.Their other three dishes — mee rebus, soto and gado gado — while not excellent, still manages to be admirably good.The chicken stock used for their soto dishes (soto options; $4 and up) is nicely robust but it has less spice flavours, so the flavour isn’t as three-dimensional as it could be.A soft begedil comes with every soto dish but the overall price is the same as other Malay stalls.The gado gado ($3.50) is also well made as it has tempeh that stays nice and toasty and lovely fried potato and tofu cubes.Their mee rebus ($3) comes with a nice, thick gravy with rounded stock flavours and is not overly sweet.They used to sell Nasi Ayam but have since done away with it. They have instead expanded their soto options to include soto babat (tripe) and soto campur (chicken and tripe).Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

The event, held indoors at Singapore Expo Hall 6, is air-conditioned for the first time.It will run from Feb 24 to 26, and March 3 to 5, from 12pm to 10pm daily. Visitors require an entry ticket that’s priced from S$6 onwards.Boasting almost 300 fashion, food and lifestyle brands, you’ll likely be stumped by what’s on offer, and overwhelmed by the sheer number of stalls and activities to go through.\xa0From tarot readings and jagua ink tattoo stalls (that use a temporary fruit-based ink) to arcade games and stage challenges, there’s plenty to be entertained by while you’re at Artbox.\xa0And while we can’t advise you on the best things to do there, we can advise you on what’s there to feast on. Here are some of our food picks.Hangry but still want to assess the stalls on display and weigh your food options? Then snacks are the way to go.If you’re fans of the TikTok-famous Rappu Handroll Bar, try the wagyu onigiri (S$8) at The Proper Concepts Collective (Stall 324).\xa0You’ll be able to find this creation only at its Artbox pop-up as the onigiri is the team’s newest experiment, and is not available for dine-in at the restaurant.Also available at the stall is the Feather Blade meatballs (S$8) made with minced beef, served with foie gras mushroom cream and cranberry jam.\xa0If you’re in the mood for something sweeter, opt for the pisang goreng (S$4 for five pieces) from Bo-Geh (Stall 267).\xa0If everything looks too good to choose from, you can’t go wrong with the classic dishes — burgers, pizzas and hotdogs. Mahmud’s Tandoor’s (Stall 252) burgers are one of the most economical options you can find at the event. Its baked burger and crispy doori (S$10 each) have earned the Muslim-owned eatery loyal fans since its inception.\xa0We recommend topping up S$2 for its perfectly fried masala fries.If sinful, greasy cheeseburgers are more your thing, head to the underrated OOTB (Stall 306), also known as Out of the Bun, for a classic cheese slider and tater tots combo (S$11.90). The Chicago-inspired hotdog stand, Miss Chardog (Stall 284), is also on the F&B lineup this year. Its Miss Beefchilli (S$14.50) consists of a smoked chicken sausage tucked into a brioche roll and topped with sambal beef chilli cheese, served with wanton skin crisps.\xa0\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHawker Hustlers: Hipster hawker Ray Yeo of Bei-Ing Dimsum Club on reinventing dim sum and his love for all things Japan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet this 28-year-old 2nd-gen zi char boss and her struggles to keep family-run business alive; made S$50 sales during pandemic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEasties can now indulge in dim sum suppers at Swee Choon’s new 24-hour Changi Airport outlet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor groups, consider the New York-style pizzas from Mia Tavola (Stall 304). Headed by chef Nick, a Brooklyn native, the NYC pizzas (from S$9) are freshly baked. Must-tries include the Damn Spicy (S$12) that comes with fresh mozzarella, tomato sauce and Italian chilli crisp.If there’s one thing Artbox has plenty of, it’s dessert.We spied the famous Burnt Cones (Stall 317), selling its single (S$6) scoop ice cream and waffles (S$4), as well as Whiskdom (Stall 289), a homegrown cafe brand known for its sweet delights, such as the creme brulee cookie (S$6.50) or the salted dark chocolate brownie (S$6.50).If you’ve a soft spot for donuts, Kobashi (Stall 234) has made its way to the east to sell its famed Sourdo’nuts (from S$3.50). The donuts are a must-try with its soft, fluffy interior and well-balanced cream filling.\xa0These sourdough doughnuts are made fresh daily, so head there early, as there is a limited number available.\xa0For something easy to munch on, try the ondeh-ondeh churros with gula melaka sauce (S$5) from Loco Loco (Stall 266).\xa0Packed with the fragrance of pandan and the sweetness of gula melaka, this is a treat you shouldn’t miss. Do note the long waits, though, as the churros are freshly fried.\xa0While it was tempting to simply skip past the retail section near the entrance, since our sole focus was Artbox’s food offerings, we were glad we didn’t.\xa0Hidden amid the stalls selling clothes and trinkets, there were stalls selling some delicious food gems.One of them is Fossa Chocolate (Stall 73), an artisanal bean-to-bar chocolate manufacturer that sells unique local chocolate flavours. You’d likely be thrown off by its satay sauce or spicy mala flavours (S$12.50 each), but both had a pleasant savouriness that balanced out the sweetness.\xa0La Creamery (Stall 100), a handcrafted ice-cream cafe, is also camouflaged within the retail section. It’s serving a large selection of tea-based ice cream, such as osmanthus jasmine (S$3.60) and blue pea honey chamomile (S$4.60).\xa0The food section is located towards the end of the Expo Hall, and stalls can be identified by their numbers marked by a square box protruding at the top of the stall.We know navigating bazaars can be painful, so we’ve compiled a list of the places mentioned in this article for your easy access.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/ms-durian/:['Durian may be one of the most divisive food items in Singapore. The decadent but pungent king of fruits can either make one crave a piece desperately, or send someone running the other way once a hint of its scent is detected.If you’re in the former category, then you have to check out Ms Durian, a durian-specialty cafe that’s recently launched an afternoon tea set filled with exquisitely crafted durian pastries.Founded in 2019 as a shoebox bakery store in Potong Pasir, the shop closed in 2021 before it re-emerged in February 2022, this time as a full-fledged cafe in a 10,000 sqf compound at Jalan Besar that also features a capacious al fresco dining area. For durian-loving “pawrents”, the breezy outdoor area is also pet-friendly!Ms Durian focuses on specialty durian desserts and pastries that are baked in-house daily. It has even developed a durian intensity meter to rate its creations’ potency on a scale of one to five. There are also fresh durians to be had at its al fresco area during durian season.Since the cafe has forged a strong relationship with its dedicated durian supplier, you can expect top-quality fruit — specifically Mao Shan Wang durians that are deseeded freshly in-house.The new afternoon tea set (S$25 per person, minimum order of two sets), available on March 1, features pastries of a variety of intensities, starting from the lightest, the fried durian that’s a croquette-like ball (durian intensity: 2/5).It’s accompanied by the tantalising baby MSW craquelin (durian intensity: 3/5), dainty durian macaron (durian intensity: 4/5), and potent durian cheese mousse (durian intensity: 5/5). The set comes with a bespoke tea pairing.If you want to live your best tai-tai life, Ms Durian has you covered with its high tea set (S$45 per person, minimum order of two sets) that provides a more exquisite experience. It’s available only from Thursday to Monday, and during two timeslots — 1pm or 3pm.\xa0The high tea set starts off with a trio of savoury bites: The truffle mushroom on a wheat cracker, pan-seared salmon served with mentaiko sauce and orange oil, and the fried cheese paired with berry compote.You’re then pampered with a bevy of decadent and unique Mao Shan Wang durian treats that include the same craquelin, macaron, and cheese mousse from the afternoon tea set, along with two other creations.These are the durian coffee (durian intensity: 3/5), a durian-infused cold-brew latte, and durian tart (durian intensity: 2/5), comprising Mao Shan Wang and hand-kneaded thousand-layer skin.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Feuds: Saizeriya vs Milan Shokudo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe high tea set also includes a bespoke tea pairing and a choice of drink, with options such as peony tea, salty lychee soda, and Valrhona hot chocolate.

Her culinary loves are wide-ranging, from pasta, sashimi and desserts to local delights such as orh luak, or oyster omelette.If you ask her, she’d be a food reviewer if she wasn’t a full-time radio host.Cheng’s attachment to food is borne out in her show. She has a daily food news segment on her lunchtime radio programme as well a weekly segment, Gastro Guide, where she talks about her meals at restaurants in Singapore.\xa0Cheng has been a radio host for more than two decades, anchoring shows on then-Passion 995 (later acquired and named Lush 99.5FM, which is now defunct), 987 and Class 95.\xa0She is also a familiar face at events and on TV, fronting programmes such as The 5 Show on Mediacorp’s Channel 5.We chatted with her about some of her favourite eats.A hearty breakfast of baked beans, hash brown, sunny-side-up eggs, cheese toast, sausage and bacon. This is something my mum would fry up every single Sunday as it was my dad’s favourite. She didn’t cook much and we would always look forward to this.\xa0A neighbour loved it so much he would often invite himself over for this; we welcomed him with open arms, of course. He and my dad would spend hours shooting the breeze, and I would sit and listen to their conversation. For Chinese food, it’d have to be the Famous Treasure restaurant at Capitol Piazza. It has delicious food that’s consistently good, and it’s at a convenient location.\xa0Must-eats would be the baked flower crab with rock salt; pan-fried hor fun with chai poh (preserved radish) and kailan; volcano chicken; crispy fish skin with salted egg yolk; roasted Irish silver hill duck; wok-fried squid with cincalok and lady’s fingers; and orh nee.\n\nThere are so many other eateries I love, but we’ll be here till tomorrow (laughs).\u2002Laksa.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/ah-chew-desserts-cineleisure-orchard/:['Mention old-school Chinese desserts and most people would think of Ah Chew Desserts — a popular dessert brand that has been a stalwart in the industry. Its original stall at Liang Seah Street has been in operation since 2003 and often draws long queues, while its Novena outlet has been there since 2014.\xa0But in an unexpected turn of events, Ah Chew Desserts announced last week that it would be shutting its Novena outlet in early March and moving to another location — to, surprise, surprise, Cineleisure Orchard.Once a hugely popular hangout among the young in its heyday, Cineleisure Orchard is now merely a shadow of its former self. Earlier this month, The Straits Times reported that the mall is one of several with high vacancy rates and low footfall. Many empty units are boarded up, and social media has been rife with talk of the mall’s desolate state.Understandably, the move came as a surprise to many, with fans speculating whether the iconic household name will be able to revive Cineleisure Orchard. After all, Ah Chew Desserts, which opens till midnight, has been competent in drawing the post-dinner crowd. If you’re keen to pay a visit to the Novena outlet before it closes, make sure you do so now. The last day of operations is March 1, and Ah Chew Desserts will move to Cineleisure Orchard from mid-March onwards.After eight years in Novena, many residents will be sad to see their favourite desserts leave the hood. On the flip side, if you’re in town and nursing a dessert craving, it’ll be more convenient to satisfy it, since Cineleisure Orchard is just a short walk from prime malls such as Ngee Ann City and Paragon Shopping Centre.We expect to see familiar all-time favourites on the menu, including the refreshing grass jelly (from S$2.80), classic mango pomelo sago (S$5.20), and the decadent durian sago (S$7.20). Other much-loved traditional desserts include the silky yam paste with gingko nut (S$3.50), thick and chunky black glutinous rice with vanilla ice cream (S$4.80), and comforting Chinese almond paste (S$3.80).Ah Chew also offers a chewy and addictive rice ball mochi (S$2.80) coated in rich peanut powder, which we hope to see at Cineleisure Orchard.\nIt remains to be seen how it’ll fare, and it’s unclear whether the Orchard outlet will open till late, but we hope this will bring a much-needed revival to the area.Ah Chew Desserts is on the GrabFood delivery service and offers free delivery (up to S$3 off) with GrabUnlimited.

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/cny-snacks/:['Chinese New Year – a time when the streets of Chinatown are decorated with beautifully designed lanterns and the wonderful aroma of smoky bak kwa (barbequed pork) and buttery pineapple tarts fills the air.Festive goodies are always a highlight during the Lunar New Year and no matter where you go, these tasty treats are bound to make an appearance.Bite-sized, delicious and terribly addictive, it seems almost impossible to stop yourself from reaching out for yet another handful of these yummy snacks. What we often don’t realise is that these tiny snacks pack a punch in terms of calories, leaving us a few extra kilos heavier at the end of the New Year celebrations.“Because these snacks are so small, it’s easy to pop a few into your mouth at one go. Don’t be deceived though, for a few small treats each time add up to a lot of unwanted calories,” says Ron Jayabalan, fitness programme director at Power Fitness PT.Echoing his sentiments is Jaclyn Reutens, dietician at Aptima Nutrition & Sports Consultants who adds that most Chinese New Year goodies are typically made from white flour, butter or margarine as well as sugar, which contribute little nutritional value but loads of calories._______________________________________________________Calorie counterSo just how much calories are you piling on from a day of snacking? Here is a guide to some of your favourite New Year treats.Pineapple tartsA familiar sight at every house, these bite-size treats are small buttery pastries generously topped with pineapple jam.2 pieces of pineapple tarts (40g) contain 165 caloriesBak Kwa (barbequed pork)Another traditional favourite, these sweet pieces of barbequed pork are a hot-seller every Chinese New Year.1 piece of Bak Kwa (57g) contains 230 calories.Love lettersMade primarily from eggs, sugar and flour, these sweet treats can be found in every household during Chinese New Year3 pieces of love letters (40g) contains 170 calories.Kueh LapisThe yummy kueh lapis is a common snack during the festive season and involves painstakingly baking each layer of cake before completion.1 slice of kueh lapis (50g) contains 240 calories.Shrimp rollsThese little fried rolls are filled with savoury fillings made from dried prawns and chilli.10 pieces of shrimp rolls (45g) contain 230 calories.Kueh bangkitThis sweet tapioca rice flour cookie melts in your mouth not in your hands.5 pieces of kueh bangkit (20g) contain 75 calories.Kueh buluThis sweet mini sponge cake is a favourite among children for its fluffy texture.3 pieces of kueh bulu (30g) contain 100 calories.Peanut puffDeep fried pastries in the shape of curry puffs, these peanut puffs contain ground peanuts and sugar.3 pieces (20g) contains 120 calories.Calorie count provided by Aptima Nutrition & Sports Consultants and the Health Promotion Board (HPB)._______________________________________________________Knowing when to stopFrom love letters to bak kwa to kueh lapis, there is probably a snack to suit every palate and most households lay out a veritable feast when it comes to New Year treats. But while you may indulge in a little festive eating during the festive season, bear in mind that moderation is key to having a good time and keeping your weight in check.“The easiest and most effective way to maintain your current weight is to control your food intake and what you eat,” advises Ron. “Take control of what you put on your plate and make smart choices. Look out for healthier alternatives and choose those instead of the usual snacks,” he says.Indeed, a little effort goes a long way in battling the post-celebration bulge, something Ang Wei Shun knows well.“I love pineapple tarts and can eat a lot at one go,” says the financial analyst. “However, my pants always felt super tight after the holidays. Nowadays, I cut down on the number of snacks I have. I still have my favourites but I try not to eat so much,” he says.Some healthy alternatives to your usual Lunar New Year treats include mandarin oranges and almonds, or any dried fruit, nuts and seeds like kuah chee.Another option is to go for unsweetened drinks. Packet and carbonated drinks are a common sight during the festive season and contain a lot of unwanted sugar. If you are out visiting, make it a point to choose drinks such as Chinese tea, plain water and even coffee without sugar for a calorie-free way to quench your thirst.For those who plan to invite friends over for the New Year, try using fresh and natural ingredients for your snacks and desserts.“Provide fresh fruit instead of the usual sugar-laden desserts,” recommends Benjamin Lee, nutritionist & manager at the Health Promotion Board (HPB).“If you do serve sweetened desserts, use natural sweeteners like dried longan, dates or persimmon,” he adds.___________________________________________________Tips on healthier eatingIf you have plans for week-long visiting sessions with friends and relatives, keep these handy tips from nutritionists in mind:\xa0Snacks– Before heading out, have a small snack e.g. a small sandwich or a bun to fill your stomach. This will fill you up a little and combat the urge to snack.– Every house you visit will have lots of snacks to offer and you might end up being asked to try all the different snacks by your host, so try to limit your intake to one piece of each goodie and take smaller portions of each.– Be wary of hidden sugar found in snacks like sour plums or preserved foods– Do not sit close to where the goodies are placed as you will be more inclined to reach out and have a piece or two.– If you have a sudden craving for something sweet, try eating a few slices of mandarin oranges before having a piece of your favourite goodie.\xa0During a meal– During meal time, try to pick the lean meats among the spread of dishes and trim off excess fat as well as remove the skin before eating. Also, try not to take meat that is drenched in gravy.– If you feel it is rude to refuse food offered to you, especially from an older person, just take some of it but stop at one piece.– At the dinner table, eat slowly and always have some food on your plate so your host will not top it up for you.– Focus on quality, not quantity. You are not expected to have a serving of each dish so choose 3-5 dishes that you find the most appealing and take smaller portions of each. Enjoy your favourites and skip the rest.– Decide at the beginning how much you want to eat, fill your plate once and do not go back for second helpings.– Have an extra serving of vegetables, especially if it’s steamed or in soup. Fiber present in the vegetable will help you feel full with fewer calories. An extra serving of vegetables is always a good option if you’re not full.\xa0Desserts– Limit your dessert intake and share the treat with a friend or relative– Get nutrient-rich, not calorie-rich options and try to have a serving of fruit if they are available\xa0\xa0Drink up– Whenever possible, choose plain water, coffee or tea without sugar instead of sweetened or carbonated drinks. Drinking a packet of sweetened chrysanthemum drink is equivalent to eating one roti prata.___________________________________________________Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/kebabs-n-curries/:['Is there anything Mustafa hasn’t covered? From a giant retail mall, it has expanded into travel services, moneychanger business…and there was even a mini car mart at one point. Recently, a 400-seater restaurant called Kebabs ‘n Curries opened at the rooftop of Mustafa’s spanking new wing.As you amble through the sprawling restaurant space looking for the perfect spot to park yourself and your shopping cart, you’ll see fountain features and green corners all around, which call to mind Orchard Central’s rooftop landscaped garden deck. At the centre of the restaurant is an imposing glass dome. Amid the constant shopping frenzy on the other floors, Kebabs ‘n Curries is a sanctuary of calm, especially on weekdays when it doesn’t get too crowded.The menu is quite an epic list of South Asian specialties and a smattering of “Chindian” dishes (Indian-style Chinese cooking). Here’s one restaurant you can enjoy a Maharajah-worthy spread without the fine-dining prices (mains are priced below $10 and a cup of masala chai here costs just $1.20).Forget the usual papadams. Dig into chaats ($4 to $4.50) or Indian street snacks to start off. Go for perennial faves such as papri chaat (crisp crackers topped with boiled potatoes, chickpeas and chillies and doused in yoghurt with lashings of tamarind chutney) or samosa chaat (triangular samosas halved and blanketed in the same yoghurt dressing). The chaats were almost authentic but we would have preferred more yoghurt for a richer, zestier taste.Papri chaatThe tandoori meats (from $7.90) were very well done. The malai murgh kebab (juicy chunks of chicken marinated with cream and spices) was moist with an aromatic chargrilled flavour. The mains feature cuisine from different parts of India and a few specialties from Pakistan. The methi fish ($7.40) was the highlight among the mains we ordered. Its gravy luscious, accented with kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves), is sure to call for a second helping of rice or freshly baked naan. However, the prawn malai curry ($9), supposedly a Bengali dish, did not impress like the fish. The gravy lacked oomph with no distinct flavour of fresh prawns.We’d recommend that you veer a little away from the Indian dishes and order the chicken achari handi ($7.90) from the Pakistani list of specialties. A dry curry, this boneless chicken dish gets its punch from the sliced green chillies and lime juice. The mutton rogan josh ($8.40), a popular dish from the North, is also worth trying. It did not have a heavy mutton flavour and the cubes of meat were tender.Malai murgh kebabWe also ordered the dum biryani ($8.80-$9.90), which wasn’t exactly “dum” as stated in the menu. The dum method calls for the biryani to be cooked in a brass pot under high pressure, but both the Hyderabadi mutton and Lucknowi chicken biryani – though quite tasty and generous in portion – were not done that way and came served in bowls. However, a wait staff told us that authentic dum biryani will be available soon.Kebabs ‘n Curries brings eating out in Little India to a new sophisticated level with its rooftop-dining concept, but it has to tweak and perfect some of the dishes before it can be taken seriously as a gourmet destination.\xa0Rating: Food: 3/5; Value: 3.5/5; Ambience: 4/5; Service: 4/5\xa0Kebabs ‘n Curries Level 7 (rooftop), Mustafa Centre (new extension)171 Syed Alwi RoadTel: 6419 0749Open: Daily: 11am-1amAuthor© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/58-minced-meat-noodle/:['Based at Taman Jurong Market and Food Centre since 1973 and now run by second-generation owner, 48-year-old Deon Ang, you’d be hard-pressed to find a better bowl of bak chor mee (minced meat noodles)\xa0at these prices ($3/$4/$5).Pork slices and liver pieces are tender and soft, as is the fatty pork mince. Compared to the other bak chor mee, the noodles are slightly on the softer side but they’re not overcooked — they still have a decent bite to them.They are dressed in an addictive sauce with generous lard notes and a fiery chilli sauce that has a hint of sweetness to it. A bit of black vinegar is added but there is no discernable sour notes in the taste. There is a bottle of it on the side should you want more.They top it off with a mix of sliced black mushrooms and chopped canned mushrooms (champignons) that have a decent stewed seasoning to them and the portions are decent for the prices.A minor niggle is that the noodles reek of kee (alkali), but that’s common In many noodle stalls in Singapore.\xa0The other niggle is the clear soup on the side which has not much flavour to it.Residents in the area will know that there is actually another 58 Minced Meat Noodle stall directly opposite the food centre at Taman Jurong Shopping Centre.Located inside 399 Food Court within the shopping centre, that particular stall is run by Deon’s other family members and very often if you peek in at the back of the stall, you’ll see Deon’s father — the first generation owner who created 58 Minced Meat Noodle back in 1973 — busy preparing the ingredients for the stall.The portions and flavours here are roughly the same, though there are no $5 or $3 options. If the stall at the food centre is closed, try you luck here and you’ll be able to get virtually the same bowl of noodles.This stall also opens a bit earlier — 8am as compared to 9am at Deon’s stall.There is another bak chor mee stall along Upper Changi Road with a similar-sounding name — 58 Minced Meat Mee — which serves a soup-based version but the two are not related.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/ippudo/:['The ramen that most of us are familiar with comprises a bowl of noodles in steaming hot soup, topped with slices of meat and an egg. You may be surprised, but this isn’t the only way that ramen is eaten in Japan. When the weather gets warm, especially in summer, ramen is sometimes served cold.Local ramen chain restaurant IPPUDO is bringing this cold ramen dish, known as tsukemen, to our local shores with its Tsukemen Japan. Part of the chain’s Chef Special Series, the Tsukemen Japan is only available at its Mohamed Sultan outlet from 16 March to 30 April 2021.Each $22.95 serving comes with a bowl of chilled, dry ramen noodles topped with two slices of pork chashu, a piece of nori seaweed, one half of a hard-boiled egg, plus a bowl of warm dipping broth. The noodles and all its toppings are served chilled. To eat this dish, you will have to take a portion of noodles, dip it into the broth, and slurp it all up.For people who have never tried tsukemen, this dish can be quite unlike any other kind of noodles you’ve ever eaten. The ramen noodles IPPUDO uses are quite a bit thicker than its usual variety. Springy and chewy, these 3mm-thick noodles have great texture and a good bite: imagine udon but springier and with more flavour. The unique blend of the cold noodles and warm broth work well together: with the tepid broth giving you the heartiness of a noodle dish, and the cool noodles a welcome respite from our recent bout of warmer weather.The broth, which is more concentrated than your usual ramen soup, is itself chock-full of ingredients, including diced pork belly chashu, menma (bamboo shoots), and naruto (fish cake). Made using bonito, iriko (dried sardines), and mackerel, as well as IPPUDO’s signature tonkotsu pork bone broth, this bowl of goodness gives each portion of noodles a satisfying umami taste. If you like your Japanese food to be more strongly flavoured (think traditional Osaka dishes such as takoyaki and okonomiyaki), then you’ll love to slurp this broth on its own as well. Otherwise, you can ask for some dashi stock to dilute the leftover broth and drink it as a soup once you’ve eaten all your noodles.For people who like their noodles with a bit of spice, a complimentary dollop of Original Spicy Paste can be served upon request. This paste can be mixed into the chilled noodles, and the mixture dipped into the broth, for a more local flavour.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/cho-kee-noodle/:['Originally a pushcart stall along Old Airport Road, the business was started by the Cho family’s first generation matriarch and its wanton noodles is seen as a competitor to Hua Kee Famous Wan Ton Mee which is located just two stalls away.Now run by the third generation, the stall moved into Old Airpot Road Food Centre in 1973 and unlike Hua Kee which focuses only on making the ultimate egg noodle wanton noodles, Cho Kee offers five other varieties of noodles — spinach, tomato, seaweed, multigrain and vegetable — all of which are made in their central kitchen. The noodles are free from additives and are low in sodium.Also made in the central kitchen is the char Siu and the dumplings.While they offer a wide variety of noodle dishes where you can add fried wantons, mushroom or chicken feet, their standard wanton noodles ($3.50/4.50) is still the dish that gets ordered the most and rightly so as the quality of the noodles and saucing is very good.Noodles are nice springy, has bite and still has a bit of that eggy fullness in the taste.A chilli-based dressing is standard — like most of the wanton noodle stalls in the Joo Chiat area — and the taste is a predominant subtly sweet chilli sambal flavour with generous oil richness and less of a soy savouriness.The char siu is unfortunately not a feature — like most wanton noodle stalls in the area, the meat can be rather dry.\nThe dumplings are small but nicely made with tasty minced meat fillings.While Hua Kee has admittedly the overall edge here — and the crowd knows it, there is more business at Hua Kee — it would be a top wanton noodle stall in any other location.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

Online orders for delviery or self pick-ups can be made here, or Whatsapp your order to +65\xa09772 2587.What We Like:What We Didn’t Like:\nWhen it comes to local fare, wanton mee is as old school as it gets. These messy, sauced noodles served in plastic plates are a staple of hawker culture and have fed hungry Singaporeans for generations. But innovative takes on the dish are hard to come by, with most stores choosing to prepare one established variant over another.And that is exactly what makes Wanton Seng’s special – this restaurant serves up modern and innovative wanton mee that still pays homage to the past.People who work in town will be familiar with Wanton Seng’s Amoy Street branch, which has been serving up noodles for about six years now. Recently, they opened a brand new eatery at Millenia Walk.The new restaurant has a hip-hop concept, which means that you’ll be treated to some bangin’ rap tunes as you eat. Now this might raise a few eyebrows, but rest assured – wanton mee and Wu-Tang Clan are a surprisingly good mix.The first thing we tried was their Signature Char Siu Noodles ($12.80), which is a modern take on the Malaysian-style wanton mee.Here, the thin slices of red char siu that typically accompanies the noodles are replaced by thick slices of slow-cooked pork belly, which we found to be piquant and tender. They were joined by runny soft-boiled eggs (similar to those you’d find in ramen), broccoli, and of course, the wantons themselves. Arguably the most important ingredient in wanton mee, the dumplings did not disappoint. They were modestly sized and each bite was a burst of meaty flavour. The springy noodles were slathered in a savoury sauce that made each mouthful a real treat.Next up was the Mala Bah Chor Noodles ($9.80), which fans of the devilishly spicy seasoning must try. The minced pork, alongside the roasted peanuts and sesame seeds, worked in tandem with the springy noodles to give the dish a nice textural contrast that you can feel in spite of your increasingly numb tongue. The presence of the soft-boiled egg, coriander and wanton gives your tongue a pleasing respite from all that spiciness.To pit the new against the old, we also tried the more orthodox Seng’s Char Siu Noodles ($9.80). In contrast to the previous dish, this one had all the hallmarks of wanton mee, such as red char siu, kalian (Chinese kale), and a mix of boiled and fried wantons.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/75-peanuts-soup/:['Peanut soup is very often just a base for the star of the show, the tang yuan (glutinous rice balls with sweet fillings) but here at Zhong Guo Jie Peanuts Soup (or 75 Peanuts Soup as it is commonly referred to), the sweet soup bases — peanut soup and red bean — are the main attraction here.Now run by the third-generation Peh Cheng Giap and his wife, this tong shui\xa0stall (Cantonese desserts stall) is located at Maxwell Food Centre, is over 70 years old and was started by his grandmother, an immigrant from China’s Anxi province.The best-selling is the peanut soup ($1) which is meticulously done. Using just peanuts, sugar and water, the soup is boiled for four hours over a heat that is carefully controlled. The result is peanuts that look whole but have a soft, yet firm, melt-in-your-mouth consistency when you bite into it.The flavour of the dessert is extraordinary as the peanut flavour is very distinct, partly thanks to a restrained sweetness such that the natural flavour of the peanuts comes through. The dessert soup also has a natural nutty creaminess that is refreshing, yet rich, if that makes any sense.The other two offerings — the red bean and tau suan — are not as compelling as the peanut soup but are still several notches better than the average offerings in food centres.The red bean soup ($1) has a thick texture and sago pearls are added for a textural difference. They used to put dried orange peel and lotus seeds but they seem to have phased out this practise.The tau suan (mung bean dessert) is very often the last one to sell out here but it is still no slouch as it comes packed with a generous amount of mung beans that have been cooked to a soft, yet firm consistency. The yu tiao (dough fritters) is nothing to shout about and is available for the tau suan at an extra charge.They offer factory-made tang yuan to go with the soups — peanut, black sesame — ($1.50/2) but ask any longtime customer and they will tell you that they tend to order the soups alone as the overly sweet tang yuan fillings tend to mask the natural flavour of the soups.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

HungryGoWhere heard him curse when the trays of food were misdirected: “Try not to pick up (the trays) from the back, always from the front. I don’t give a f*** about the VIPs, just pick up from the front, okay?”Ramsay’s supporters could not get enough of him, screaming every time he appeared near the edge of the tents. He took a break one time, after he greeting his supporters outside of the tent. Nearly 5,000 supporters were reportedly there.The hawkers had it easier; Foo Kui Lian of Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice, Ang Kiam Meng of Jumbo Seafood Restaurant and Ryan Goh of 328 Katong Laksa had time to concentrate on dishing out consistent portions of their dishes.Goh’s mother, Lucy Lim of 328 Katong Laksa, was a little nervous. She admitted in Mandarin: “This is the first time I’ve ever met a celebrity with such global presence, so when I hear of his arrival, my heart would race and my legs would go soft.”EVERYONE IS A WINNEREven though Ramsay lost the challenge, he walked away with more than a few hawker secrets.“(The hawkers) were instrumental in giving away some of their secrets. Chefs are obsessed with other chefs beating them, but to see the generosity and the way they treated me inside their hawker stalls… I’m the disruption; I’m the one that is turning their little world upside down and being a pain in the arse. For them to still be that gratifying and tell me how to cook their food, honestly, is humbling, really humbling,” he said, after the results were announced.The Hawker Heroes also had good things to say about the celebrity chef.When asked why she thinks Tian Tian won in the chicken rice category, Foo said: “Because his time (in Singapore to learn from us) was too short, he wasn’t able to learn the Chinese way of cooking. If you asked me to learn the Western techniques for his type of cuisine, it would be impossible for me to win.”Ang, who lost in the chilli crab category, was also generous towards Ramsay: “I think it’s a good sign that chef Ramsay comes to Singapore, looks into our chilli crab, and probably discovered something that we have not seen before.”The diners and viewers were also winners.Apart from being able to dine for free on food cooked by hawkers and a Michelin-starred chef, they were able to enjoy the excitement of watching the cook-off “live”.Singapore’s food culture had yet another boost this weekend. Foo summed it up: “The SingTel Hawker Heroes challenge was a wonderful celebration of the good food we have here in Singapore”Ramsay was quick to shift the spotlight back to the hawkers at the end of the challenge.“Forget the corporate stuff, forget the sponsors\xa0– tonight is about them (the hawkers). This, for me, was about highlighting how good I’ve always thought Singapore hawker food is.“Now that I’ve experienced the best of Singapore cuisine, I can say without doubt the people of Singapore have much to be proud of\xa0– authentic, genuine, simple food that is of amazing quality and full of flavour.“If you want the real food in Singapore, get yourself to a hawker stall.”When asked if he would be setting up a restaurant in Singapore soon, he simply replied: “I would love to.”Watch out, Jumbo Seafood Restaurant.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/gordon-ramsay-hawker-heroes-challenge/:['Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay lost SingTel’s Hawker Heroes challenge by six per cent of the total votes.The challenge, held on Sunday 7 July at Newton Circus Food Centre, pit the celebrity chef against Singapore’s top voted Hawker Heroes, who each excel in one dish.Of the three hawker dishes contested, Ramsay won Ang Kiam Meng of Jumbo Seafood Restaurant by a five-per-cent vote margin for the chilli crab dish. Foo Kui Lian from Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice beat Ramsay by six per cent for chicken rice, while Lucy Lim and Ryan Koh from 328 Katong Laksa finished significantly ahead by 19 per cent for the laksa dish – thick rice noodles in a curry coconut milk-based soup served with cockles and shrimps.A total number of 3,000 votes were cast.To win the challenge, Ramsay had to beat all three dishes in cumulative votes. Voting was done by SMS and was opened to the 1,000 guests who showed up to taste the hawkers’ and Ramsay’s dishes.WHY WE THINK GORDON RAMSAY LOST\nRamsay had Singaporean tastes to win over, an uphill task.His chicken rice had fragrant, well-cooked grains, with tender white chicken meat. But his chicken was not cut proportionately, and the chilli sauce was heavy on the vinegar while lacking on the bright, citrus notes that come from limes. Both the skill and ingredients are essential to this hawker dish.HungryGoWhere thought Jumbo Seafood Restaurant’s chilli crab was better\xa0– its sauce sweeter and denser with more substantial flecks of egg. But the voters liked Ramsay’s bright, tart sauce with the egg finely worked in.The crabs on both sides were fresh, although Ramsay chose to serve crab legs that contained bigger chunks of meat than the claws that Jumbo Seafood Restaurant served.For the laksa, Ramsay’s version did not have the rounded, nutty notes that 328 Katong Laksa’s robust, fattier gravy did. His noodles were also a little bloated, and it was unclear if it was because they sat in the broth longer than usual or were overcooked.From the start, Ramsay struggled with serving the dishes as quickly as possible, worried his dishes might have been sitting for too long.Ramsay admitted that the laksa was the most difficult dish for him. “That was a tough one because of so many variations. I was struggling. I knew, within the first 45 minutes, that we were slightly running behind on that. And I changed the recipe. Which might have been a dumb thing to do.”Ramsay had merely two days to get his act together before the competition, and that included one visit to each of the hawkers to learn the recipes and the skills needed to prepare the dishes.Look for Part 2 for more.!Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

A little of it would improve the dish immensely.\n\nSimilar to other wanton noodle stalls, the noodles, dressing, green vegetable and soup have the same taste and quality no matter the dish and the only thing that varies are the toppings.\nAnd among the toppings, the dumplings in their Dumpling Noodle ($4) are noteworthy.They give you three dumplings per plate but they are amazingly fat with lots of minced meat, water chestnuts and prawn pieces so the dish is well worth the money.They are also generous with the meat portions in their Pork Rib Noodle ($4).You get three large pieces and they are nicely braised with a good soy flavouring that’s not sweet and the texture is fairly soft.Also a big highlight is their Yong Tau Foo Noodle ($4).You get six pieces which is again very generous for the price.\nThe yong tau foo items are mainly fried and it adds additional flavour to the soup.Also nice is the fact that the dish comes with their stall-made garlic chilli dip.It comes mildly sweet which is a good thing as you can still taste the chilli and the garlic notes in addition to the spice.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

The stall was located at Shunfu Mart Food Centre before relocating to Marsiling Mall in 2018.Ang also uses costlier fresh (not chilled or frozen) pork as he feels that it tastes better.The char siu is the big highlight as it loosely emulates the KL (Kuala Lumpur) style with a dark charred look and has no red colouring. That said,\xa0 the meat has been adapted for local tastes to have a little bit more chew and less sweetness.The savoury sweet tasting meat is tender, moist and fatty, thanks to the use of bu jian tian (pig’s armpit) in their cuts, thoughThe siu yok (roast pork)\xa0 has excellent biscuit-like crunch to the skin, the meat is wonderfully moist and properly seasoned through.The roast duck is not as alluring as the char siu and the siu yok but only relatively-speaking. It would still be considered good in any other roast meats stall.The duck comes with a nice, crisp skin and moist meat, though the breast meat could do with a bit more tenderness. The taste is decently savoury and there is a more prominent five-spice seasoning as compared to before.No matter the meat, they all have a smoky roasti-ness to the taste as all the meats are roasted onsite using large charcoal steel roasters.Try the noodles which come with a nice springy texture, a gentle soy seasoning and lots of pork lard bits.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/sohgood-bak-chang/:['There are only a handful of hawker businesses who make bak chang (rice dumplings) throughout the year and Sohgood Bak Chang is one more which we can add to the list.Started by “Mr Soh” in the middle of 2020, he switched careers during the COVID-19 pandemic to focus on making the Hokkien bak changs which his Anxi, China-born grandmother used to make when he was younger.The preparation process is painstakingly detailed — the rice and meat are fried separately, chestnuts are pre-soaked and cooked until soft and Mr Soh even uses bamboo string to tie up his bak chang, instead of the more commonly used plastic raffia string.Mr Soh only sells one type and the resultant bak chang ($3.50) is slightly larger than normal and is generously filled with generously cut pork belly slices, a whole chestnut, a large cut mushroom and — depending on the order — a whole salted egg yolk ($4.30).If you’ve ever eaten bak changs from some of the well-known popular brands around Singapore, you’ll realise that sometimes the rice dumplings can come a little too salted and oily.Sohgood Bak Chang avoids that with a very well-balanced seasoning where you can taste the five spice and white pepper.The savouriness doesn’t go overboard either.Examine the ingredients further and you’ll notice that the pork belly slices are also carefully selected so that there are no overly fatty bits.Sohgood Bak Chang is run solely by Mr Soh who gets occasional help from his family, so he only makes a limited amount per day.So when the rice dumplings run out, it runs out for the day.

Owner Li Feng Cai, 47, has been cooking for over 30 years ever since he started his training as a chef at the tender age of 16.While they serve a range of seven noodle dishes, their main speciality is their dumplings, which are a must order.Its main staple of Xiao long baos cost $6 for 10, on the cheaper end of the scale when it comes to hawker stall Xiao long bao offerings.The dumplings are by and large executed very well with beautifully soft, fatty minced pork and a very robust, rich stock. The taste is nicely savoury, not heavily so and with only a slight sweetness to round out the flavour.The dumpling skins are thin and chewy but are unfortunately prone to occasional breakage — thanks to their quest to obtain the thinnest, most delicate dumpling skins. Out of an order of 10 dumplings, expect one or two broken dumplings.Even when it comes to Guo tie (pot stickers; $6), the skins are slightly thicker here, but there are still some breakages, albeit much fewer.Thankfully, everything else makes up for it — the slightly chewy skin, the crusty starch “wings” at the bottom and the soft fatty minced pork filling with a rich, robust, slightly stock sweet flavour, enhanced with chives.Their noodle offerings are sold at very reasonable prices, especially considering the quality.Across the board, their noodle textures have a nice bouncy chewiness but we have — on the rare occasion, had them overcooked.Their Zha Jian Mian (noodles in meat-bean sauce: $3.50) has a reasonably potent bean flavour in their sauce but could come a little thicker in the sauce texture.Their Beef noodle soup (Niu rou Mian; $4) comes with a generous number of stewed beef slices and a broth that’s on the lighter side of robust but is free of any MSG. You can taste the spices and aromatics of but its not overwhelming. A good or bad thing depending on how you like them.Chilli oil is optional but highly, highly recommended.The main downside to this stall is that their spicy dishes are toned down, to cater to the tourists who flock to their stall, we suspect.It is true of their Szechuan Spicy Wantons ($4) which basically dresses dumplings in a potent concoction of Chinese black vinegar and Szechuan chilli oil. It has the right look but unfortunately could be spicier.Their Szechuan Spicy Noodles (dan dan mian; $4) also could do with more spiciness but thankfully the other flavours are very well balanced, with a light creaminess from the ground peanuts, nicely marinated minced pork and a balanced sauciness.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

Instead of the usual blend of pork and prawn stock flavours, Tian Tian Lai relies on a dominant prawn stock flavour, enhanced using a generous amount of fried pork lard bits which is thrown in.The fried Hokkien mee here is of the wet variety, so it comes with more than the usual amount of gravy, fried to a wet gooey consistency. This ensures that every bite has a dominant stock taste to it.The downside is that the pork lard doesn’t come as crunchy as it should be due to the gooey gravy.The taste is also more savoury as compared to Hokkien mee from other stalls, most won’t mind but it might be a minor deterrent for those committed to a low sodium diet.The dish uses a mix of chor (thick) bee hoon and yellow noodles which have no alkaline smell to them and a texture that is nice and bite-y.However, the noodles have no wok hei charring to them so there is hardly any smoky aroma to the dish. This is where the sambal chilli comes into play.Oil rich, but with a moderate savouriness and hints of tanginess and sweetness, the sambal chilli is dried prawn based and has a stronger than usual smoky aroma to it.It apps the flavour quite a bit but it’s almost not necessary if you’re one who appreciates the naked flavour of the stock.The dish comes with prawns and squid pieces which are decently blanched They used to put in sliced pork belly but have since done away with that ingredient in recent years.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

With its long history, it is no surprise that this popular food centre houses several famous hawker legends. This list is certainly far from exhaustive. It was a tough choice, but we had to narrow down to the following 10 stalls. At a recent re-visit, we joined the queues to see if these legendary stalls still live up to the accolades.Nam SingThe legendary Nam Sing has been one of our all-time favourites for fried Hokkien\xa0prawn mee. However, at a recent re-visit, we were disappointed to discover that\xa0they’ve changed their cooking style. In the past, the yellow noodles and thin bee\xa0hoon would have fully absorbed all the stock, resulting in drier noodles bursting with\xa0flavour and wok hei (wok breath). Now, the noodles are more wet and “soupy”.\xa0Perhaps they’ve modified their cooking style to cater to tastebuds of the younger\xa0crowd. We miss the old style. That said, we could still taste the sweet and rich\xa0flavours of the seafood stock used to cook the noodles. Prices start from $5.00 per\xa0plate.Nam Sing Hokkien Fried Mee | #01-32 | Daily: 10:00 – 17:00 (earlier if food runs out),\xa0closed on ad hoc basis\xa0Rui Ji KitchenRu Ji Kitchen has established themselves as one of the\xa0more popular stalls in this food centre. Operated by the daughter and son-in- law of\xa0the original Ru Ji Kitchen in Holland Drive, this stall stands out with their handmade\xa0fishballs and in-house sambal chilli. Made fresh daily, their fishballs and fishcakes are\xa0delightfully bouncy and juicy. The noodles are also well-executed. Tossed in a\xa0mixture of soy sauce, tangy vinegar, and fiery sambal, the noodles are delectably\xa0satisfying. A bowl of fishball noodles starts from $3.00.Ru Ji Kitchen | #01-37 | Tue – Sun: 07:00 – 13:00\xa0Western BarbequeWe’ve reviewed this stall before in our taste test of best old-school chicken chop,\xa0and we’re happy to report that their chicken chop ($6.50) still tastes the same. To\xa0the modern health-conscious diner, Western Barbeque’s cooking style might be a tad\xa0oily for their liking. However, we find their slightly charred and greasy chicken chop to\xa0be rather comforting in an old-fashioned way. The well-marinated boneless chicken\xa0leg is tender and juicy. Another nostalgic touch is the accompanying soft bun split\xa0and smeared with margarine and sugar. Besides chicken chop, they have other\xa0grilled meats such as pork chop and beef steak.Western Barbeque | #01-53 | Daily: 11:00 – 23:00\xa0Mattar Road Seafood BarbequeOver at Mattar Road Seafood Barbecue, the specialty is crab ($48 per kg), cooked\xa0in four ways: with chilli sauce; white pepper; black pepper; and salted egg yolk. We were\xa0recommended their signature white pepper crab. Stir-fried with garlic, leeks, and\xa0punchy white pepper-based savoury sauce, it was likeable but didn’t knock our socks\xa0off. The crabs could have been meatier; however, it was very fresh. They also serve\xa0the usual range of hawker-style grilled seafood, such as sambal stingray and squid.Mattar Road Seafood Barbecue | #01-63 | Thu – Mon: 16:00 – 22:00\xa0Chuan Kee Satay\xa0Chuan Kee is often named as one of the best Hainanese-style satay in Singapore.\xa0The friendly couple running this stall has been selling satay for nearly 50 years.\xa0Perhaps due to their age, we find that their satay has not been so consistent in\xa0quality during our last few visits. On one occasion, the satay was over-grilled,\xa0resulting in tough, dry meat. But when they get it right, their satay is deliciously\xa0tender and fragrant, especially the pork satay which has alternating pieces of meat\xa0and fat. Each stick of pork or chicken satay costs $0.60 (minimum order 10 sticks).Chuan Kee Satay | #01-85 | Open: 17:00 – 23:00, closed on Mon & Thu\xa0Toa Payoh RojakNow run by the daughter and son-in-law of the original founder, Toa Payoh Rojak still\xa0serves up one of the better versions of Chinese-style rojak in Singapore (psst: we\xa0think the son-in- law makes a slightly better version than the daughter). We love their\xa0piquant and refreshing rojak sauce, made with a mix of good quality prawn paste,\xa0sugar, ginger flower, freshly-squeezed calamansi zest and juice. They are generous\xa0with the other ingredients too – pineapple, jicama, kang kong, beansprout, jellyfish,\xa0crushed peanut, and freshly toasted you tiao and tau pok. Each serving starts from $3.00.Toa Payoh Rojak | #01-108 | Mon – Sat: 11:30 – 19:00\xa0Xin Mei Xiang Lor MeeThis hugely popular lor mee stall has upped their minimum spend to $4.00, but the\xa0price hike has not deterred their faithful followers. That said, each serving is a large\xa0amount of noodles and fair amount of toppings. The toppings consist of fresh fish\xa0meat, braised pork slices, and half an egg. The best part is the gravy. Flavourful with\xa0good depth, yet not overly salty nor gooey – the smooth gravy binds the noodles,\xa0toppings, vinegar, chilli, and minced garlic to make this a super satisfying bowl of lor\xa0mee.Xin Mei Xiang Lor Mee | #01-116 | Open: 06:00 – 13:45, closed on Mon & Thu\xa0Wang Wang Crispy Curry PuffIf you’re looking for one of the best crisp curry puffs in the land, Wang Wang is a must-visit. These amazingly addictive curry puffs are hand-made daily by the stall owner.\xa0Fried in small batches to keep them hot and fresh, these gorgeously crisp and flakey\xa0puffs ooze with moist curried potato filling. This combination of buttery, airy crust and\xa0fragrant, spicy potato is simply irresistible. Each puff costs $1.40. Other fillings\xa0include sardine, black pepper chicken, and yam paste.Wang Wang Crispy Curry Puff | #01-126 | Wed – Sun: 11:00 – 20:00\xa0To-Ricos Guo ShiMore familiarly known as “Blanco Court Food Centre 3rd Storey” kway chap stall, To-Ricos Guo Shi has enjoyed brisk business ever since they moved here in 1994.\xa0Indeed, this is one of the better kway chap we’ve had. We like how the braising liquid\xa0is light and flavoursome without the heavy use of herbs or spices. The intestines are\xa0well cleaned and sufficiently stewed, resulting in a delightfully tender and chewy\xa0texture. As for the rice noodle sheets, they are delicately thin and slippery. You can\xa0pick your own selection, or ask for a basic mixed set consisting of offal, braised pork\xa0belly, taupok, and noodle starting from $4.40.To-Ricos Guo Shi | #01-135/136 | Wed – Sun: 11:00 – 15:30\xa0Dong Ji Fried Kway TeowThere is often a queue at this stall during lunch hour. Single-handedly operated by an\xa0elderly uncle, he takes his time to fry each order of kway teow one customer at a\xa0time, unfazed by the long line forming. Though he looks somewhat surly, he breaks\xa0into a wide smile when we attempt small talk. “I’m getting old already, it’s very tiring\xa0for me to operate this business. I have to wake up at 3AM every day to get here and\xa0prepare the stall,” he tells us softly. His style is certainly unique, resembling Penang-style fried kway teow. Instead of the sweet, dark, and wet Singapore-style fried kway\xa0teow we are used to, this version is drier, with charred bits of noodle kissed with wok\xa0hei (wok breath). The regular $3.00 portion comes with prawn, cockles, and lup\xa0cheong. Add $1.00 for squid and extra prawn.Dong Ji Fried Kway Teow | #01-138 | Daily: 08:00 – 13:00Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/bangkok-cafes-for-instagram/:['With Bangkok a hop, skip and a jump from Singapore — well, two-and-a-half hours by flight, to be exact — the capital of Thailand is top of mind for many Singaporeans mulling over a weekend getaway.Apart from food, massages and shopping, you’ll definitely want to put aside time to check out these Instagram-worthy cafes in Bangkok. They’re guaranteed to jazz up your feed and add a special touch to those holiday shots.\xa0264/4 Siam Square Soi 3, Pathum Wan, Bangkok 10330\nNearest Bangkok Mass Transit System (BTS) station: Siam\nOpen: Daily (10am to 8pm)From the creators of the Cassette Music Bar, a popular night-time music spot in the trendy Ekkamai district of Bangkok, comes the all-pink Cassette Coffee Bar, with the same retro-chic vibes sans alcoholic drinks.The interior isn’t too in-your-face, but it does make you feel as though you’ve stepped into a candy shop, albeit a classy one.For such a pretty cafe, I was half-expecting the drinks to just be decent, since many cafes appear to be vested in one or the other. Yet Cassette’s coffee was fragrant and robust, and gave me a much-needed kick to carry on with my sightseeing.The sweet creaminess of the baked button cheese tarts, sold in a trio, complemented the strong coffee and left me wanting more.What to order: Orange latte (120 baht, or S$4.80), button cheese tart (three for 120 baht)\xa0119, 80 Soi Chalermla, Khwaeng Thanon Phetchaburi, Khet Ratchathewi, Bangkok 10400\nNearest BTS station: Ratchathewi\nOpen: Tuesday to Friday (8.30am to 5pm); Saturday and Sunday (9am to 5.30pm)Close to popular shopping spots such as Pratunam Market and Platinum Fashion Mall, Stockroom offers a great respite post-shopping, with its good coffee, minimalist Scandinavian aesthetic and soothing vibes. The cafe is fairly new, but it’s already caught the eye of Bangkok’s cafe-hopping crowd. Try going in the mornings for that uninterrupted shot for the ’gram.If coffee isn’t your thing, we hear its 100 per cent housemade sangria and butterscotch milk provide quite the kick, too.For those who enjoy their brews, the coffeehouse works with WonderRoom BKK, a hole-in-the-wall cafe, for beans that are specially profiled for Stockroom.What to order: Creme brulee latte (140 baht), almond tart (180 baht)\xa025 Ari 4 Fang Nua Alley, Samsen Nai, Phaya Thai, Bangkok 10400\nNearest BTS station: Ari\nOpen: Daily (10am to 6pm)Located in the up-and-coming Ari neighbourhood of Bangkok, Mugung Cafe is right next to Gump’s Ari Community Space, a spot built for Instagram with its colourful signs, installations and murals.Unlike Gump’s Ari, though, Mugung is a way smaller outfit, more understated, and extremely cosy with its soft white furnishings and curtains.Its name “mugung” (Korean for hibiscus) also stands for eternity. The owner chose it because she loved the word’s meaning and sound. Its name also explains the Korean-esque vibes you’ll experience. Besides its look, everything on the menu, particularly its dessert-inspired coffees and cakes, is great for the ’gram.What to order: Coffee with banoffee — banana, cream and toffee (120 baht), strawberry croffle (115 baht)\xa0Lat Phrao 26 Alley, Lane 4, Khwaeng Chom Phon, Chatuchak, Bangkok 10900\nNearest Bangkok MRT station: Ratchadaphisek\nOpen: Monday, and Wednesday to Friday (8.30am to 5pm); Saturday and Sunday (9am to 6pm)Brooke is a standalone cafe in a car park in the Lat Phrao area of Bangkok, with a penchant for all things blue — from its decor to its food, and we’re talking about a vibrant cobalt blue, not the pastel sort.Its blue theme has made it a hit with those wanting that prized high-contrast #OOTD shot for the ’gram.A note that the cafe doesn’t have indoor seating. All seating is outdoors or non-air-conditioned, so make sure you slather on enough sunscreen before heading down and come prepared to take in a bit of sun with your cuppa. It’s a rather long, unsheltered walk in, too.What to order: Black coconut — americano topped with a scoop of coconut ice cream (130 baht), Brooke custard croissant (100 baht)\xa0180 Lat Phrao 26 Alley, Khwaeng Chom Phon, Chatuchak, Bangkok 10900\nNearest MRT station: Ratchadaphisek\nOpen: Daily (8am to 12am) If blue isn’t your colour of choice, take a 300m walk to Jolie Cafe & Bar, a red-and-white themed cafe with a unique arched pillar front.The cafe, which doubles up as a bar by night, opened in 2021 and has been steadily attracting a strong crowd.The compound, which is spacious with plenty of seats, also houses a small nail salon and a pedestrian crossing, which could offer other photo angles if you’re gunning for that unique shot. If you’re there for afternoon coffee, stay behind on Fridays and Saturdays for live music and hearty modern Thai mains.What to order: Tropical orange — cold brew with orange juice (110 baht), croffles in assorted flavours (from 69 baht for an original croffle)\xa046, 1 Thetsaban Nimit Nue Road, Lat Yao, Chatuchak, Bangkok 10900\nNearest BTS station: Mo Chit\nOpen: Tuesday to Friday (9am to 5pm); Saturday and Sunday (10am to 6pm)This cafe’s a little farther out from the centre of Bangkok, but it’s well worth the trip if you’re heading to the famous Chatuchak weekend market. We must add, though, it’s still a 15-minute bus ride from the nearest BTS station, Mo Chit, and short distance from the weekend market.I’ve visited many Korean cafes and Cuppa Beluga’s vibe — from its pastel theme to its picture-perfect sweet treats — matches that of quaint cafes in the trendy Seoul district of Yeonnam-dong to a T.The best part is that unlike some of the other popular cafes on this list, Cuppa Beluga’s menu, where an original croffle starts from 25 baht, isn’t at all overpriced, which means you can order more.If you’re not done with shopping, the owner of Cuppa Beluga stocks its clothing label Studio Kath within the store — complete with a fitting room.What to order: Strawberry milk latte (80 baht), cream cheese croffle (70 baht)\xa0Section 4, Room 007, Chatuchak Market, 587/10 Kamphaeng Phet 2 Road, Chatuchak, Bangkok 10900\nNearest BTS station: Mo Chit\nOpen: Saturday and Sunday (11am to 7pm)Wedged between two clothing shops along Bangkok’s main Chatuchak weekend market street, Omise Coffee is easy to miss.But the smell of freshly brewed coffee is unmistakable. I was browsing around a row of shops across from the stall when I caught the pleasant aroma of its coffee, which thankfully distracted me from spending more baht.Calling itself a manual coffee bar, Omise uses an all-manual espresso machine, complete with a hand-lever press for its brews. Another quirky thing about the cafe: It claims that the taste of its drinks differs every time because the staff members can’t remember the recipe.What to order: Es-yen — Thai-style iced coffee comprising espresso with condensed milk, evaporated milk and fresh milk (65 baht), matcha latte (65 baht)\xa083 Bamrung Mueang Road, Sao Chingcha, Phra Nakhon, Bangkok 10200\nNearest BTS station: Sam Yot\nOpen: Daily (7.30am to 6pm)Housed in an once-abandoned century-old printing house, Craftsman Roastery at Bamrung Mueang is a Bangkok coffee-shop pop-up that embraces the history of its location with a touch of modernity.Aside from its modern furnishings and lighting, most of the compound retains its original look, even if it means peeling paint, uneven walls and graffiti.We hear the space will be renovated later this year, so swing by while you can to drink in the old-school charm and explore the compound.What to order: Yuzu americano (175 baht), chocolate fudge cake with dark rum sauce (175 baht)\xa0267 6 Thonglor 13 Alley, Khlong Tan Nuea, Watthana, Bangkok 10110\nNearest BTS station: Thonglor\nOpen: Daily (9.30am to 6.30pm)Previously available only in Chonburi, a province in the eastern gulf of Thailand, Aunties Coffee has opened its Bangkok outpost in the heart of Thonglor, a trendy district brimming with cafes and fashion and nightlife establishments.In spite of its flashy neighbours, Aunties occupies a tiny, nondescript space in a small alley and is mostly available for takeaways and delivery — save a small table inside and two lone chairs outside.Most people visit for a shot outside the white-walled cafe or for its gram-worthy kraffle cake, which is essentially a croffle stacked into a tall cake and layered with cream in between. If you want to get one, remember to preorder one or two days ahead via its channel (@aunties.thonglor) on messaging app Line.What to order: Aunties coffee (100 baht), banoffee pie (150 baht)\xa032 Chuea Phloeng 2 Alley, Thung Maha Mek, Sathon, Bangkok 10120\nNearest BTS station: Khlong Toei\nOpen: Daily (10am to 6pm)Calling itself a “healing and chilling” space, Hilling Cafe is a calm respite in the middle of bustling Bangkok, giving off camping site and beach resort vibes. Once you make your way into the compound, a big campervan greets you, surrounded by wooden seating and camping chairs.You order from a tiki-style bar counter and take your pick from campfire-inspired drinks with toasted marshmallows, or if you prefer, a more tropical-looking fizzy coffee.Whether you’re a fan of the wilderness or the beach, you’re sure to fall in love with this cafe’s understated charm.What to order: Camp fire ar’cocoa — iced cocoa topped with a toasted marshmallow (150 baht), lemon tart (130 baht)AuthorSarah is constantly seeking out new coffee spots and cocktail bars around the world, and should probably drink more water while at it.© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

Remember to watch for traffic and motorbikes when you’re getting around.\xa045 Nguyen Truong To, Phuong 12, Quan 4, Thanh pho Ho Chi Minh\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (6.30am to 9.30pm)Pho is a must-have when you’re in Vietnam, but instead of going for the usual noodles in a bowl of broth, spice things up at Pho Thin by Sol. The restaurant serves different kinds of pho such as pho with stir-fried beef, wine stew beef pho, pho in a hot stone bowl, and even pho that’s been deep-fried into a puffy snack.It has a few outlets around Ho Chi Minh City, so you’ll be able to get your pho fix at Pho Thin by Sol pretty easily.What to order: Flaming stir-fried beef pho (VND68,000 or S$4.10), pho chien phong — puffy fried pho noodles with stir-fried beef and vegetables (VND118,000)\xa0216 Pham Thai Buong, Tan Phong, Quan 7, Thanh pho Ho Chi Minh\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (9am to 9pm)Hailing originally from Vung Tau, a port city in southern Vietnam, Co Ba Vung Tau is well-known for its take on banh xeo, a crispy Vietnamese crepe that comes with seafood, meat and bean sprouts, and many other toppings. It’s also famous for banh khot, a mini savoury pancake with assorted toppings.Located in the city’s District 7, Co Ba Vung Tau has airy outdoor seating for you to enjoy your Vietnamese feast at — make sure you’ve got mosquito repellent on to keep those pesky bugs at bay.What to order: Banh xeo tom thit gia — crepe with shrimp, meat and bean sprouts (VND100,000), banh khot thap cam — an assortment of mini savoury pancakes (VND95,000)\xa0Crescent Residence 1, 103 Ton Dat Tien, CR1, Tan Phu, Quan 7, Thanh pho Ho Chi Minh\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (11am to 9pm)Also located within District 7 is Veganizta, a new fully vegan eatery that’s been a hot Ho Chi Minh City food spot for its inventive take on vegan cuisine. The restaurant prides itself on serving vegan food that looks good and tastes good, and delivers dishes with different styles primarily inspired by Southeast Asian flavours.You’ll find Vietnamese staples such as pho and spring rolls, as well as veganised dishes from around the region such as larb, a Laotian meat salad. There are also laksa and Western mains such as toast and yoghurt.What to order: 24-hour slow-cooked forest mushroom pho (VND135,000), summer platter to share — grilled bread, dips, vegetables, dumplings, and spring rolls (VND250,000)\xa0221 Tran Binh Trong, Phuong 3, Quan 5, Thanh pho Ho Chi Minh\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (6.30am to 10pm)The first time I had banh canh cua, a steaming hot bowl of crab and tapioca noodles in soup, in Ho Chi Minh City, I wondered why it took me so long to learn of this dish. If there’s anywhere you should get your first taste of banh canh cua, it’s Banh Canh Cua 14, a busy eatery in District 5 popular among locals and tourists.The crab broth is fresh and flavourful. Coupled with the chewy texture of tapioca noodles, it makes an incredibly comforting treat for the senses. You’ll probably finish every drop of your soup — yes, it’s that good.What to order: Banh canh cua (VND48,000), dac biet tom cang xanh — noodles with crayfish (VND65,000)\xa0126 Le Van Sy, Phuong 10, Phu Nhuan, Thanh pho Ho Chi Minh\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (7am to 11pm)Bun Thit Nuong Anh Ba specialises in bun thit nuong, a dish of vermicelli noodles topped with grilled meat (usually pork), fried spring rolls and some herbs, and finished off with a sweet, salty sauce called nuoc mam. Aside from bun thit nuong, we love that it also serves good banh hoi, a dish comprising vermicelli woven and bundled together and presented as flat rectangular sheets.The shop is a small outfit and located at a busy intersection, so it can get quite crowded. But thankfully, service is fairly quick and you’ll be able to weave in and out pretty fast.What to order: Bun thit nuong (VND59,000), banh hoi (VND59,000)\xa0140e Ly Chinh Thang, Phuong 14, Quan 3, Thanh pho Ho Chi Minh\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (10am to 10pm)The first thing that strikes you when you come to Bun Dau Mam Tom – Hem Dau is how incredibly narrow this restaurant is. It’s because it was set up in an alley by a bunch of enterprising young people who love bun dau mam tom, a vermicelli dish originating from the north of Vietnam that comprises tofu, shrimp and other ingredients.Food aside, the restaurant’s location in itself is a reason to visit — how often do you get to dine in an alley converted into a restaurant? We must warn you, though, that the shrimp sauce can be quite pungent and strong if you’re trying it for the first time.What to order: Bun dau thap cam — vermicelli, beans, meat, spring rolls, shrimp rolls, and vegetables (VND49,000), nuoc sau — dracontomelon juice (VND15,000)\xa0142 Ba Dinh, Phuong 10, Quan 8, Thanh pho Ho Chi Minh\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (10am to 11pm)I know what you’re thinking: You didn’t go all the way to Vietnam to have a Singapore staple of chicken rice, but hear me out. Hidden in District 8 is Com Ga 142, a shop that stood relatively unknown for a decade until food delivery apps shot this store to popularity.The double-fried chicken Com Ga 142 serves up is incredibly juicy and crispy. Its signature dish com ga mam toi, fried chicken with a garlicky fish sauce, is the perfect blend of sweet, savoury and crunchy. The crowd of delivery riders outside Com Ga 142 bears testament to how popular it is, and we’d recommend ordering if you don’t want to travel all the way out to District 8 and wait. But if you prefer your chicken piping hot, then Com Ga 142 is well worth the trip.What to order: Com ga xoi mo — fried-chicken rice (VND43,000), com ga mam toi — fried-chicken rice with garlic fish sauce glaze (VND43,000)\xa026 Le Thi Rieng, Phuong Pham Ngu Lao, Quan 1, Thanh pho Ho Chi Minh\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (11am to 9pm)Besides pho, you’ve probably had your fair share of banh mi even before visiting Vietnam — for good reason. Banh mi is a convenient and accessible dish that’s filling and packs good flavour. But you really haven’t had banh mi till you’ve gone to Banh Mi Huynh Hoa.The restaurant is a hot favourite among locals and tourists. And be warned: The lines can get long. Nevertheless, you won’t regret waiting your turn the moment you lay your hands on a freshly baked baguette packed to the brim with flavourful toppings, especially the liver pate.There are no seats at the restaurant, so we recommend getting a banh mi or two, and popping by Tao Dan Park nearby to have your sandwich. The restaurant provides an extra bag of salad, herbs and pickles, wet wipes and plastic gloves, so you’re all set for a picnic lunch. I’d grab a cup of ice-cold Vietnamese coffee, too, if I were you.What to order: Banh mi dac biet huynh hoa (VND59,000)\xa0158 Pasteur, Ben Nghe, Quan 1, Thanh pho Ho Chi Minh\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (11am to 10pm)Secret Garden is a rustic-style restaurant located on a rooftop in the heart of District 1 that serves up Vietnamese staples. It’s a four-storey climb up a flight of stairs, but don’t let that deter you because you’ll be rewarded with good views and hearty homecooked-style Vietnamese food.A little tip: When reserving, request a table around the edge of the rooftop for a view of Ho Chi Minh City’s skyline as you dine.What to order: Com chien toi — fried garlic rice (VND85,000), cha gio — fried spring rolls (VND116,000)\xa010 Dang Tat, Tan Dinh, Quan 1, Thanh pho Ho Chi Minh\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (9am to 11.30pm)Cuc Gach Quan is a perennial favourite and prices can be steep here, compared with what you’ll pay in the rest of Ho Chi Minh City.But it’s well worth the dining experience, given its quaint French colonial setting, variety of food and hospitable service. We hear Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt dined there a decade ago when visiting Vietnam, so that should provide an indication of the quality of the place.The menu is extremely extensive and can be intimidating for anyone new to the restaurant or Vietnamese cuisine. Speak to the friendly wait staff and ask for their recommendations before you make your order.What to order: Barbecued pork (VND130,000), sauteed morning glory with garlic (VND100,000)AuthorSarah is constantly seeking out new coffee spots and cocktail bars around the world, and should probably drink more water while at it.© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

With more than 60 years on the job, he’s passed the skill of mastering the temperature and wok to give the fried rice noodles just the right amount of wok hei.\xa0It typically gets crowded during lunchtime and on weekends, but even during off-peak hours, you might have to wait for at least 45 minutes to get your hands on a plate.\xa0What to order: Char koay teow (starting from RM6.50)\xa0Sri Weld Food Court, Beach St, Georgetown, 10300 George Town\nOpen: Monday to Saturday (7am to 2pm)Wrapped in soft banana leaves, these parcels of fragrant coconut rice topped with a generous pour of sambal is what brunch dreams are made of.\xa0Located at the popular Sri Weld Food Court, come by early to avoid the lunch crowd.

The selection may change, but her staple of a Foret Noir, an apple-shaped black forest cake, is available on most days.\xa0What to order: Foret noir (RM22), croissant (RM7)\xa0164, Lebuh Campbell, George Town, 10100 George Town\nOpen: Saturday to Thursday (10am to 11pm), Friday (10am to 12.30pm, 3pm to 10pm)Another institution to visit is Hameediyah that’s been open since 1907. Serving nasi kandar for more than a century in Penang, it recently entered the Malaysian Book of Records for the oldest nasi kandar in Penang and has two stores in Penang as well as another in Kuala Lumpur.Its name was derived from the way the food was sold in the past — cooked food was transported in baskets balanced on a pole (kandar). The sixth generation of the Rawther family keeps the culinary legacy alive at their restaurant.\xa0In addition to savoury murtabak, they’re famous for a smattering of dishes ranging from lamb shank curry to fried whole sotong. They’ve kept their winning recipes exactly the same and even use the same masala recipe that they grind and roast themselves.What to order: Varies depending on the dishes ordered.\xa038, Lebuh Tye Sin, 10300 George Town\nOpen: Daily (11am to 9pm)Vegans can also get in on the gorging at Pinxin Vegan Cuisine, founded by Madam Xin. Unlike the average vegetarian restaurant, most of its dishes do not feature mock meats. Instead, it uses natural ingredients such as mushrooms or konjac as meat substitutes.\xa0Championing eco-conscious dining, the eatery works with local farmers and producers in an attempt to lower their carbon footprint. For example, its rice comes from padi fields in Malaysia’s Sarawak state, and a network of farmers grows an assortment of organic fruit and vegetables that the eatery uses in its cooking.\xa0Noodles and breads are also handmade with entirely natural produce, including its popular bao buns and burgers. And the same philosophy is translated into the desserts, too, with the likes of vegan crispy almond cake slices and smoothies.\xa0\xa0What to order: Signature assam laksa (RM15), Pinxin nasi kandar (RM23)AuthorYawen has written a lot about food in her previous roles as the editor-in-chief of Wine & Dine and later as the associate digital editor of The Peak.

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/jakarta-eateries/:['Jakarta is full of hidden gems serving up a multitude of traditional Indonesian dishes with rich and complex flavours. Many popular Singaporean food items, such as satay and sambal, originated from Indonesia, so it stands to reason that we go straight to the source to try them out.\xa0Here are five eateries in Jakarta serving up our favourite hot and spicy foods – and more.\xa0Gedung Lot. 4, 7th Floor, Jalan Jendral Sudirman Kav. 52-53, SCBD Jakarta 12190\nOpen: Saturday to Thursday (11am to 11pm), Friday (11am to 12am)We reckon a trip to Indonesia wouldn’t be complete without trying its sambal. Fans of the iconic chilli paste might want to try the different varieties of sambal (15,000 rupiah, or S$1.42) that Kila Kila by Akasya serves, as it uses different spices and herbs from the ones typically found in Singapore.\xa0For mains, you can dig into a variety of other traditional Indonesian dishes, such as its ayam Aceh (95,000 rupiah), an Aceh-style fried chicken cooked with curry leaves. If you’re feeling adventurous, try its lidah bakar cabe ijo (135,000 rupiah), a grilled ox tongue dish that’s cooked with green chilli sambal.The restaurant-and-lounge is lavishly decorated with nice views overlooking the city – perfect for date nights or celebrations. If you’re lucky, you might even catch the occasional live performance there.\xa0What to order: Rawon iga komplit (125,000 rupiah), ayam Aceh (95,000 rupiah), tempe mendoan (25,000 rupiah), lidah bakar cabe ijo (135,000 rupiah), nasi goreng sibolga (80,000 rupiah)Various outlets available across Jakarta\xa0\nOpen: Daily (10am to 9pm)You may have heard of Padang and Sudanese cuisine in the Indonesian food scene, but have you tried Manado fare? Originating from the Minahasan people of North Sulawesi, it has grown in popularity over the years in Indonesian cities such as Jakarta.One place to find authentic Manado cuisine in Jakarta is at Sarang Oci Resto Manado.\xa0The cuisine is known for its spicy seafood, so be sure to try the sirip pari bakar rica (from 85,000 rupiah), a fried stingray dish served with rice. Another popular Manado dish is the sop sapi brenebon (from 50,000 rupiah), which combines kidney beans and slices of tender beef to create a sweet and savoury broth.\xa0All dishes come in rather large portions, so it’s best to visit as a group.\xa0What to order: Sirip pari bakar rica (from 85,000 rupiah), sop sapi brenebon (from 50,000 rupiah), perkedel jagung (from 30,000 rupiah), klappertart (from 15,000 rupiah), ice brenebon (from 25,000 rupiah)Various outlets available across Jakarta\xa0\nOpen: Daily (10am to 9pm)The name Mie Bandung Kejaksaan 1964 is a tribute to the stall’s origins in Bandung City on Kejaksaan Street.

This version from the Betawi people, widely recognised as the native inhabitants of Jakarta, uses ketupat, a Javanese rice cake, instead of the noodles you might be familiar with.\xa0And you know Laksa Betawi Assirot is doing something right if it’s been selling a single item on its menu since 1972. It resides in a small shop along the street, tucked away in a quiet corner.\xa0Dig into its fragrant soup base that has a unique taste, courtesy of the ground shrimp added. You can add on sides of tempeh, tofu, potatoes, eggs, or meat to complete the meal.

So while you’re at the restaurant, be sure to check out its signature boiled sliced chicken (白切雞, from NT$300) or its kung pao beef (宮保牛肉, NT$315) for a more savoury alternative.\xa0What to order: Braised tofu (紅燒豆腐, NT$170), kung pao beef (宮保牛肉, NT$315), seaweed egg drop soup (紫菜蛋花湯, NT$50), boiled sliced chicken (白切雞, from NT$300)\xa0No 46號, Section 2, Kaifeng St, Wanhua District, Taipei City, Taiwan 108\nOpen: Daily (11am to 9pm)Tian bu la, if you know Mandarin, is exactly what it sounds like — sweet and non-spicy. It’s a popular Taiwanese street food that’s similar to an oden, where fish paste is moulded into various shapes and sizes, deep-fried, then boiled in broth and enjoyed on a skewer. 賽門鄧普拉 happens to be one of the more famous Taipei restaurants offering this item.\xa0To complement that cool Taipei weather in December, ask for the store’s bonito soup that’s packed with umami flavour. We recommend opting for its signature tian bu la (small for NT$70, large for NT$80) that features wonton, meatball, radish and more.\xa0What to order: Fried wonton (NT$70), signature tian bu la (small for NT$70)\xa0No 37, Lane 76, Section 2, Xinsheng N Rd, Zhongshan District, Taipei City, Taiwan 104\nOpen: Daily (12pm to 11.30pm)宮田白鶴創意蔬食料理 is a vegetarian restaurant that emphasises healthy and innovative vegetarian dishes. Expect items such as skewers and hotpot, as well as more typical stir-fried dishes you’d have at home.\xa0The restaurant is populated with wooden tables and chairs, creating a cosy atmosphere for small gatherings over a meal. Some of its more popular dishes include its signature noodles (招牌炒麵l, NT$130) and its Hakka vegetarian stir-fry (客家素小炒, NT$160).\xa0An underrated dish to try is its mustard cheese balls (芥末乳酪球, NT$150), a deep-fried ball with an explosive cheesy centre — a testament to the restaurant’s reputation for creative dishes.What to order: Signature noodles (招牌炒麵l, NT$130), mapo tofu (麻婆豆腐, NT$160), Hakka vegetarian stir-fry (客家素小炒, NT$160), mustard cheese balls (芥末乳酪球, NT$150)\xa0\xa0\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEat 3 Bowls opens at Compass One after closing Crawford Lane outlet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy Must-Eats in Seoul, Korea with… Nat Ho\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTaiwan Night Markets in Singapore: Authentic Taiwanese street food at Cineleisure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3樓, No 68號, Section 5 of Zhongxiao East Road, Xinyi District, Taipei City, Taiwan 110\nOpen: Monday to Wednesday, and Sunday (11am to 9.30pm), Thursday to Saturday (11am to 10pm)One of the fancier restaurants on this list, Yonshin Tea & Cake Selection Bar is popular even among the locals for its modernity.

Although this hidden gem is slightly more difficult to find, it’s well worth the effort for delicious and authentic local cuisine.\xa0Similar to Singapore’s tze char restaurants, 北投上享 is a place that serves dishes more suited for sharing. While there are essential dishes such as steamed prawns and minced garlic (from NT$360), the menu also features more interesting items such as coconut and taro casserole (from NT$300).\xa0Though the Taipei restaurant sells meat, it has a vegetarian section on its menu. Dishes include sweet-and-sour pork (NT$200) made of mock meat as well as the fan favourite, curry and vermicelli in casserole (from NT$300) .What to order: Crispy chicken (from NT$550), steamed prawns and minced garlic (from NT$360), curry and vermicelli in casserole (from NT$300)\xa0Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

You’ll get flavours of universal comfort food, such as peanut butter and chocolate (NT$65, or S$2.90), and Asian comfort food, such as red bean and milk (NT$55).\xa0Most of its outlets operate on a takeaway-only basis, except for two — the outlet at Xinyi and its newest outlet at Da’an, where you can pair the bagels with a drink such as the ruby black milk tea (NT$160).Fans of bagelwiches may want to try its Real Bagels series exclusive to the two dine-in outlets, though both stores have different menus for this series. There are classics — smoked salmon bagel (NT$480) from its Xinyi outlet — and sweet options, such as red bean and sencha bagel (NT$109), from its Da’an outlet.\xa0The dine-in bagel shops also offer salads and hot plates, cute merchandise as well as the occasional collaboration with other Taiwanese brands.\xa0What to order: Oolong milk tea bagel (NT$65), peanut butter and chocolate bagel (NT$65), ruby black milk tea (NT$160)No 27, Section 2, Zhongxiao E Rd, Zhongzheng District, Taipei City, Taiwan 100\nOpen: Daily (10am to 5pm)Fans of hand-pour coffees, put Simple Kaffa on your itinerary.

So it’s worth a try, especially if you love matcha.\xa0The coffeehouse also has a retail section, where you can buy different drip bags, a coffee grinder and similar equipment to help kickstart your journey in brewing your specialty coffees.\xa0What to order: Hand-pour coffees (from NT$200), cappuccino (NT$140), brown sugar latte (NT$200), matcha roll (NT$150), honey cake (NT$150)\xa0Various outlets across Taipei\nOpen: Operating hours vary across storesNo trip to Taiwan is complete without bubble tea.

Its pearl milk tea (from NT$65) features a light, aromatic tea base with soft and chewy pearls. Available in both hot and cold, you can choose your choice of tea, such as jasmine and tieguanyin.\xa0Having been around since the 1980s and with stores in Hong Kong and Japan, the store specialises in tea. Its refillable brewed pots (NT$200) offer a variety of oolong — from lightly fermented to the lightly oxidised Wenshan pouchong — for an educational flight of tea.\xa0The cafe’s menu includes a small selection of one-bowl meals and savoury snacks, too. Popular with the locals is kung fu noodles (NT$80), a dry noodle with minced pork dish and mushrooms.\xa0What to order: Milk tea with pearls (from NT$65), signature black tea (from NT$60), kung fu noodles (NT$80), braised beancurd and rice cake (NT$135)\xa0No 17號, Lane 189, Section 2, Anhe Rd, Da’an District, Taipei City, Taiwan 106\nOpen: Monday to Friday (10.30am to 9pm), Saturday and Sunday (10am to 8pm)Tucked away in a quiet corner along Anhe Road, The Haowu Spirit Cafe (好物 Spirit 咖啡) shot to local fame when it appeared on the Taiwanese drama Someday or One Day.Locals have grown fond of it for its cosy interior and relaxing atmosphere. It’s a great place to relax after a long day of exploring Taipei, especially if you’re looking for a quiet place to unwind at.\xa0The cafe has an extensive menu of sweet and savoury food options. Some of the most popular items include its Haowu beef noodles (from NT$250), a dry beef noodle dish, and its Haowu philly cheesesteak sandwich (NT$380) that’s available only in limited portions.\xa0For those looking for a teatime snack, try The Haowu Spirit Cafe’s creamy cheesecake (NT$150).

On the speakers, ethereal, dream-pop artistes such as Cigarettes After Sex play softly.\xa0It’s a quiet spot often frequented by students or those looking for a space to read, so don’t be surprised if you get some looks from making too much noise here.\xa0The cafe mostly serves a variety of drinks, such as iced chocolate (NT$160), lemon Americano (NT$180) and matcha tea latte (NT$160). And the limited food menu ranges from berry pancakes (NT$180) to boiled dumplings (NT$130).\xa0This place is one for the locals, so the menu is written entirely in Chinese on a blackboard behind the counter.

The space features bronze and lavish finish with a pastel outlook.Some of the usual things you may indulge in tcc would be their wholesome gourmet dining, tête-à-têtes,\xa0 Parisian high tea affair, luscious desserts and a wide range of beverages.With this new opening, tcc has also suggested some new and old favourites that you have to try out.Start your meal with a light touch, tcc’s Broccoli and Cheese Tortilla Bites ($11.80).This starter holds broccoli, three types of cheese, corn and potato filling.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/the-peranakan/:['HungryGoWhere sat down and chatted with 52-year-old Raymond Khoo, the owner/executive chef of The Peranakan. We found out that he came out of retirement to start a Peranakan restaurant out of passion and to preserve the food and culture of the Straits Chinese.How did The Peranakan come about?I’ve actually been in the restaurant business for about 30 years, working as an executive chef, cooking all sorts of cuisines from French, American to Mexican and Italian (Tong Shui Café, 3 Monkeys, Rasa Singapura Macau).I learnt all the Peranakan recipes from my mother and godmother but the only time I had to cook Peranakan food was over the weekends and I did that for many years.Funny thing is that when I was younger, I would tell them what I wanted to eat and they would cook it. Now after 15, 20 years, it’s the reverse. They tell me what they want to eat and now i have to cook it for them!\xa0Why open a Peranakan restaurant and why come out of retirement to do it?I retired about three years ago as I had enough of the restaurant business. So The Peranakan is mainly for passion as Peranakan food is a cuisine which I have not done before.My mother and godmother always kept on saying: “you open so many restaurants, how come you never open a Peranakan restaurant?” Save the recipes, the heritage and the culture behind it. So when this space (at Claymore Connect) became available, I said ok, let’s do it. Let’s start a restaurant that’s an incredibly authentic introduction to Peranakan food. It was quite a quick decision after that. Within a month, we got started.I sent a note out to all my ex-staff and suddenly everyone wanted to join, including Benny and Kenny (Benny Choo and Kenny See) who have been veteran waiters for many years. They’re all semi-retired but provide a lot of the colour to the restaurant.\xa0We’ve heard that The Peranakan has managed to win the approval of many old-time nyonyas in the Singapore Peranakan community. Why do you think that has been happening?Well, about 20 per cent of our customers are true blue Peranakans. Then you get a larger percentage who are like one quarter Peranakan, one eighth Peranakan. Anyone who is remotely Peranakan will tell you that all the real true blue Peranakans prefer to just eat at home. But yes, we do have a fair bit of the older Nyonyas coming here to eat.Usually when they go down to a Peranakan restaurant, you’ll find that they will be very critical. “The food is not good, not right” and so on. But here they come over to me and they’re sharing their experiences of the dish and saying things like “you cook this very good” or that they haven’t eaten this or that dish for so long.We also try to be accommodating. For example, a lot of the older generation Peranakans like to eat kuah lada (fish and brinjal in black pepper and turmeric gravy) with you char kueh (dough fritters, you tiao) so they would ask the staff for it. So I’ll arrange for them to have some.\xa0We hear they also like Benny and KennyYes, they’re old-timers who have gone through the era, so they can all speak English and Malay and it makes all the older Peranakans feel at home. They like it that they can come here and find people they can talk and relate to. Very often, you’ll see the menu being put aside and they will chat away in Malay about what they want to eat.\xa0Why do you think they are so approving of the food?We truly believe that what we do here is very authentic and we try very hard to make it so.Take the nasi ulam (mixed herb rice). We can safely say that we’re the only restaurant to put this dish on the menu. Everywhere else, you’ll find it offered only on a special order basis because it is such a laborious dish to prepare.We have to finely julienne (cut into long thin strips) the herbs, no blending. So one hour before mealtimes, there are two guys in the kitchen just cutting up all the herbs. Then there is all the other preparation: you have to deep fry the fish then debone it, then mince it, then you need to prepare the rempah (spice paste), plus the salted fish which you need to mince.Back then when we did the dish at home, it was the only dish we would eat for dinner because it takes half a day to prepare it.Plus, you’ll often see my mother and my godmother sitting outside in a table by the corner. They come twice a week to check on the quality of the food.\xa0We hear the Ayam Buah Keluak (Chicken stew with Indonesian black nut) is also a big hit?They like what we do here because we take out the flesh, blend it smooth, then put double the amount back in, so each buah keluak you eat here is actually two. We have four buah keluak in one portion and no restaurant will give you that much. Actually as there’s double the portion in one buah keluak, we’re actually giving you eight.Plus we don’t put minced meat. I’m quite the purist that way. There’s no cutting corners here. That’s the way we eat at home, so that’s the way we serve our customers here.We blend it smooth because the buah keluak nut is actually quite coarse and can be a bit sandy, so for first-timers who eat it, it can be very off-putting — the taste is quite new, then there is the texture to deal with.\xa0We notice you serve beef rendang which is a Sumatran dish and not Peranakan. Did you have to debate whether to serve it?Actually there are a few ways we tweak the original cuisine and beef rendang is one which we decided to add in.We don’t have any Peranakan beef dishes, so the beef rendang is the closest which fits into the menu. We also don’t do it like the Indonesians do it. There’s more kaffir lime leaf and more coconut flavours in ours. There’s also some Malaccan influence in the food as well as my father is from Malacca.Besides the traditional tok panjang (a lavish spread of dishes laid out on a long table during special occasions), we also offer a six-course degustation and an omakase-style Peranakan set, plus we have wine pairings and sake pairings to appeal to the higher end crowd.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

To top it off, it had a generous amount of sugar sprinkled over. But, the buttery and thin layers of the danish cut the sweetness for us a little as well.We enjoyed it but were glad we had the tea as it helped to cleanse our palate after every bite.You can try out their other new danishes such as the Kaya Butter or Nutella Banana. If you clinch all three, you can get it at a promotional price of $12.50.Next, we tried their Silky Roll Cake (which has won the Guinness World Record for being the Best- Selling Roll Cake). It had a thin layer of cream within the roll, and the sponge was so soft, we did not feel surfeited.It also has drops of raisins in the layers, making it a little different from other roll cakes out there.You have to try this Silky Roll Cake ($14.90) if you have yet to.We then tried their Pizza in a Cup. This is the new dish that they have in the Kids Menu but, to be honest, almost anyone will enjoy this.Priced at $8.90 (or $10.90 as a set), this Pizza in a Cup is basically a deconstructed pizza with lots of melted cheese, sliced chicken sausages, pizza sauce, corn and other diced vegetables.We enjoyed the layers of cheese and how well it went with the sweet and tangy sauce below. The Pizza Bread that was atop tasted like it was only toasted with light butter yet held so much of flavour and soaked up the flavours of the other ingredients as well.This got to be our favourite dish from the whole lineup offered at Paris Baguette.You can choose between this main dish, their Mini Burgers with cute emojis drawn on it or their Double Cheese Tortilla Pizza for the kids’ meal set.The set comes with Nutella Marshmallow Danish and either plain or chocolate milk, depending on your choice.For those who love sweet treats, the danishes are not the only one with sweetness to offer. Their limited stock Ice Cream range is also available for you, and their prices start at $5.50.We tried the Macaron Cookies and Cream Ice Cream Sandwich and were pleasantly surprised.It was chewy, sweet and the ice cream within held little cookie bits yet was milky and creamy.To complete your experience at Paris Baguette, you may want to bag their special-designed and limited edition tote bags as it is simplistic yet cute.They come in two sizes and are priced at $20 for the big one and $16 for the smaller one (which can double up as a sling bag for your little ones).In all, we enjoyed the meals and ambience of the bakery, and we would recommend visiting when you need a time out or just a chill family day.As part of their unveiling, the bakery chain is running the following special promotions: Redeem either a free PB Big Tote Bag (priced at $20.00) or a PB Mini Tote Bag (priced at $16.00) with a minimum spend of $55.00Redeem a free Cafe? Latte with any shortcake purchasePurchase a bundle of three Soft Breads at a promotional price of only $3.00 (U.P. from $7.50).The new outlet is located at\xa01 Yishun Ave 2, North Wing, #02-16/17 Northpoint City, Singapore 769098.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

Growing up, I ate a lot of home-cooked food because Dad seldom brought us out. So you could say that I’ve been deprived of good hawker fare and am trying to make up for all that lost time! (laughs)Which was the first stall that came to mind when you embarked on your mission of reviewing hawker fare and why?\nI can’t really recall but I think it must have been Kim’s Hokkien Mee at Joo Chiat Place.\xa0 I love all sorts of local fare, hokkien mee, chicken rice, char kway tiao but hokkien mee always has a special place in my heart.What is the most interesting/ unforgettable encounter you had while reviewing for your blog?\nWow, I’ve had so many wonderful encounters with our local hawkers but I must say that the nicest experience is always the warm welcome you get after you’ve blogged about them. I usually revisit hawkers whom I’ve reviewed and when I see them again and hear how their business has tripled because of my review, it’s just a really great feeling.How do you manage to constantly source for new places to eat at and review?\nI receive invitations from PR agencies as well as from restaurants to dine at their establishments. Sometimes I read about interesting hawkers in the papers or hear about certain must-try places from friends. There are lots of ways of hearing about great places to dine.You have a pretty huge following on your blog, how did you manage to garner so many fans?\nI think it’s about having the right product and experience for readers when they visit my blog. Pictures play a big role as does writing. I believe there is a great breadth of content in ieatishootipost and this comes across in the extent to which I cover the stalls and review the food.Singaporeans love to eat and being the tech savvy generation we are, surfing the net for good food and places to dine has become the norm for most of us. ieatishootipost grew through word of mouth and now, my blog is also linked to other sites like STB and 93.8LIVE so that also helps spread the word – ieatishootipost has been visited 6.5 million times since it’s inception.As a doctor, how do you manage to strike a balance between healthy eating and your love for hawker fare?\nWell, it all boils down to eating in moderation. If I know that I’m going to have a heavy meal at night, then I’ll make sure I have smaller meals in the day. It’s really a simple way of looking at it and achieving balance in your food intake.What is the one hawker fare you will never tire of?\xa0 \nThat’s not a very good question because I love all sorts of hawker fare! Hokkien mee, satay, chicken rice – you name it, I love it. I could drink teh tarik every day, but that’s not very healthy. Neither is eating prata daily, so in the end it’s back to eating in moderation.Do you embark on every meal with a camera in tow and a mission to review it for your blog? What does your family think of that?\nIn the beginning, they were very irritated because they had to wait for me to finish taking all my pictures before they could eat. But they got used to it after a while and now James, 10 and Megan, 7, both know that daddy has to work so they ask me to take the pictures first before they eat.Having sampled such a wide variety of good/ not-so-good hawker fare, you must have pretty high expectations when it comes to home-cooked food. So, when you dine at home, who does the cooking? \nMy maid does the cooking but I trained her. It helps that mom’s a chef and I learnt all my basic skills from her, so I gave my maid intensive training.I cook over the weekends though, when I have more time on my hands. At the moment, I’m experimenting with pizza and pasta. I make my own dough for the pizza and try out different sauces. I also don’t fancy the pasta you get from the supermarkets and I enjoy making pasta from scratch with flour and eggs. My kids join in too and they make teddy bear-shaped pasta from their pasta sheets; it’s good family fun.If you were to start your own hawker stall, what would you sell and how would you differentiate yourself from your competitors?\nHaving reviewed so many hawker stalls, I would definitely not set one up because it’s a lot of effort and hard work. Also, there are so many good hawker stalls around and it probably wouldn’t be a good idea to start another hokkein mee or prawn mee stall. I prefer to think of new ideas, help hawkers reinvent their dishes and then come and taste it.Instead of a hawker stall, I might open a restaurant – a small, cosy place where you have different dishes marinated in local flavour but served in bite-sized portions so that one can sample a variety of food. You’d definitely find me by the bar reading papers while enjoying a good cup of teh tarik.\nStarting from 15 July 2009, Dr Leslie Tay will be sharing his favourite hawker stalls on inSing.com every alternate Wednesday.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/jin-ji-teochew-braised-duck-and-kway-chap/:['Walk in front of this braised duck stall and you’ll see plenty of newspaper articles plastered everywhere, and in this particular instance, the quality of the braised duck here matches the hype but with a few caveats.Now in the hands of the second generation, 39-year-old Melvin Chew left his took over his parent’s braised duck stall when his father died four years ago. He now runs the stall with his 62-year-old mother, Lim Bee Hong.The stall, which used to sell fruits at the now-defunct Majestic Theatre in Eu Tong Sen Street, started business at Kreta Ayer Complex (now Chinatown Complex) in 1983. They switched over to selling braised duck as not many hawkers were selling them at the time.Melvin has introduced some modern thinking to his parent’s traditional braised duck stall, some of which work and some of which don’t.Besides renovating the stall for a more modern look, the stall substitutes braised boiled eggs for\xa0 Japanese-style ajitsuke tamago, which has gooey yolks instead.Some other hawker stalls like Teo Heng Porridge, which sells lu wei (stewed options) dishes has also opted for tamago eggs and there have been very well received by customers.The change which doesn’t quite work is the introduction of a Japanese-style bento set using braised duck ingredients.Called the Bento Braised Duck Set ($6/8), the dish has worked as a marketing gimmick as it has attracted a lot of media attention to the stall and to be fair the ingredients are nicely done.However, the use of a Japanese bento tray is quite impractical as there isn’t enough room to properly tuck into the dish, plus the sauce keeps spilling over. At the same time, there is never enough sauce for the ingredients given.In short, avoid the dish. Order the braised duck the normal way and you’ll be rewarded as the actual braised duck, plus associated ingredients are very good indeed.The pork belly is nicely stewed with soft fat and skin, plus it is chunkily cut and the meat nicely moist. The duck liver has a nicely soft texture and the gizzard, a soft springiness.The tau Kwa (hard tofu) is fresh and has a soft but firm texture. The soup also has a nicely present savouriness and herbal notes.The dark-coloured rice is cooked with the gravy. It has a soft rice texture but it still has bite. Instead of small yam cubes, they use mashed up yam bits.The gravy veers a little away from the traditional. Instead of an intensely salty thin gravy, the gravy at Jin Ji has less salty accents, more rounded, slightly sweeter notes and the gravy consistency thicker than usual.True Teochew braised duck fans might frown at this rendition but for everyone else, it’s a good braised duck.Be warned as well, that the stall is not that consistent. We’ve encountered occasions where the ingredients have been overcooked.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/toh-kee/:['With almost a 90 to 100-year history, Toh Kee is possibly the longest surviving Cantonese roast meats business in Singapore, but it has an uncompromising old-school taste which you’ll either love or hate, with less sweet accents and hardier meaty textures. The business started out about 1918, when the original proprietor walked around the Chinatown area, selling his roast ducks on poles. The family business proper started in 1926 and has been in existence ever since.For many decades, they were touted for having some of the best roast ducks in Singapore, but that reputation has somewhat faded due to better roast ducks from other stalls and whispers of inconsistent management and rotating chefs of late.The roast ducks here come darker and more charred, and it is partially due to the over 60-year-old charcoal steel roaster that is apparently impossible to build these days (they didn’t say why). Ducks are marinated in garlic, spring onions, salt and five-spice powder for about one and a half hours, then immediately after roasting, malt syrup is brushed on the skin to crisp it up.The roast duck is still supremely good with a nice crisp skin and a robust, meaty texture that still retains its moisture. Compared to other stalls, the texture of the meat here is meaty as opposed to it being soft which is something you’ll either love or hate. The meatiness is intentional as the older generation prefer their meats with a bit more bite.The same applies to their char siu which has gotten a lot of flak as it comes relatively lean and not a lot of fat. It comes with a fair amount of red colouring and taste-wise, more savoury and not as sweet. Texture-wise, there is still a fair amount of juiciness even though the meat is lean, which is impressive, to say the least.The\xa0siu yok\xa0(roast pork belly) is pure perfection with a slightly charred, crispy skin, juicy meat and is cut into thick pieces. A soy reduction\xa0— made with fermented soybeans —\xa0comes on every plate has an old-school intensely savoury taste with a thin consistency and a prominent five-spice powder aroma. No plum sauce is available, but the smooth chilli sauce comes well-balanced with a fresh sweetness and a slight amount of tang.Interesting bit of trivia: they used to serve sliced cucumbers with their roast meats but switched over to roasted soybeans as they felt the moisture from the cucumbers affected the crispness of the duck skin.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/shi-xiang-sha-die/:['One of the heritage hawkers at Chinatown Complex, Shi Xiang Sha Die specialises in satay, but not the Malay or Indonesian versions of satay which are more commonly found in Singapore but specifically the Hainanese Chinese variant of the dish which is increasingly hard to find in current times.In operation for about 35 years, the stall is now run by a mother/son team who is 75 and 50 years old respectively and they moved into Chinatown Complex about two decades ago.When it comes to Hainanese satay, the food is not halal as they offer pork satay where the meat is skewered such that there are two chunks of pork meat and a piece of pork fat in the middle.They have two varieties: pork or chicken ($0.60 a stick) but whichever one you order, the meat is done with a nice charring, yet still with a soft moist meat texture. Like all satays, the taste is savoury and sweet and the marination is on the lighter side and is less sweet compared to Malay-style satays.The other difference between Malay/Indonesian and Hainanese-style satays is that the satay peanut sauce which they use to dip the meat in has a dollop of fresh pineapple puree in it.Usually the addition of tangy pineapple adds a fruity freshness to the taste and it helps to cut through the richness of the pork fat and rich peanut sauce but in this case, the taste of the fresh pineapple is lost somewhat as the flavour of the peanut sauce is very dominant here.That said, the flavour of the satay sauce is as how you would expect it: oil-rich, moderately thick and rich, but not as powerfully flavoured as some of the top Malay satay hawkers execute it.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/boon-kee-wanton-noodle/:['Open from the early mornings until late afternoons, there’s always a long queue at Boon Kee but their noodle offerings ($3/4) are something which you’ll either love or hate.\nOn the surface, there isn’t much to be impressed about.Their popular wanton noodles have thicker-than-usual char siew\xa0(barbecued pork) slices\xa0which are lean and bordering on being too dry with no charred or fatty bits.The boiled and fried wantons are nice but the fillings are minimal.However it is the sauce dressing which makes the dish truly captivating. It’s a rich, dark sauce that has complex savoury and lard notes with light sweet and sour flavours augmenting the overall flavour.The sauce was concocted by now 63-year-old Sally Lee, the wife of Henry Tan, 64, whose parents ran Boon Kee in the 1960s.Back then, Henry’s parents were street hawkers selling chicken rice at Tanglin Halt. They shifted into Clementi 448 Market & Food Centre in 1980 and that was when Sally introduced the additional option of wanton noodles to their repertoire.Due to space constraints, Henry and Sally who took over the stall, decided to focus on selling wanton noodles only. The stall is currently being run by Henry’s two sons, Adrian and Alex Tan, who are 35 and 29 respectively.According to Sally, the sauce is comprised of a multitude of ingredients that include lard, oyster sauce, sesame oil, white pepper and the like.The sauce changed a lot in the initial few years but started to stabilise after five years or so. Even now, Sally says that she is still tweaking the recipe to make it even better.The sauce is so popular that Boon Kee has customers even as far away as Tampines.It is this “mother sauce” that goes into all their noodle dishes. They have four in total — wanton noodles, dumpling noodles, soya sauce chicken noodle and Ipoh hor fun.The noodles always come springy and they stay firm through the eating. The hor fun rice noodles are nicely soft and slippery as well.Their Sui kow (water dumplings), are also properly done with a nice mix of minced meat, prawns, water chestnuts and spring onions.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/wang-bbq-and-grill/:['Those of you who have been religiously crossing the Causeway and heading to Malaysia whenever your lok lok (skewered meats and vegetables, served either boiled or deep-fried) cravings hit, we’ve got good news for you. We’ve found the best lok lok in Singapore at Wang BBQ & Grill, located in Chomp Chomp, Serangoon Gardens!To be fair, there’s been an influx of places offering lok lok in Singapore in the recent years. There’s Zao Lek Lok Lok at Paya Lebar Kovan Community Centre, Malaysia Local Delights Restaurant at Tanjong Katong Road, Chuan Le Xiang Lok Lok in Jurong, and more. That having been said, Wang BBQ and Grill was one of the first few lok lok stalls to open shop back in 2013. Since then, they’ve won over legions of die-hard fans with the secret sauce that their lok lok is charcoal-grilled in.When we visited, the owner was not present, but we were greeted by his mother, Susan, a petite, sprightly lady who was hard at work taking orders from customers. In the spirit of full disclosure, she warns each customer that they’ll have to wait for 45 minutes. Why does it take so long to cook a single order of lok lok? That’s because the process involves coating the chosen skewers in their homemade sauce and either laboriously grilling these skewers over a charcoal grill, or deep frying them.Whilst a 45-minute wait can be slightly off-putting to those who are hungry and want to dig into their food immediately, Susan is quick to point out that Wang BBQ and Grill’s skewers are worth the wait (“just ask any of the people who have tried our food before!”) When asked about their secret sauce, however, she dodges all our questions good-naturedly, and refuses to share a single detail about the ingredients used or the process by which the sauce is made. Fair enough – this sauce is what distinguishes them from their competitors, after all.The menu at Wang BBQ & Grill consists of over 50 types of lok lok, from the traditional to the new-fangled. If you love your greens, you’ll appreciate that there are plenty of veggie-based lok lok available for you to choose from. There is a minimum order of 7 sticks; prices range from $1.20 to $2 per skewer. We went with the Cheesy Chicken Ham ($2), the Udon with Sliced Pork Belly ($1.50), the Enoki with Sliced Pork Belly ($1.50), the Baby Pea Sprouts with Sliced Pork Belly ($1.50), the Fried Wanton Skin with Bak Kwa ($1.50), the Cockles ($1.50), and the Carrot Shred with Sliced Pork Belly ($1.50).Our top pick of the night was the Udon with Sliced Pork Belly; the udon had an extremely springy, bouncy texture and soaked up all the juices of the secret sauce extremely well. We also liked the Cheesy Chicken Ham (you can’t really go wrong with a combination of ham and gooey cheese, can you?), the Carrot Shred with Sliced Pork Belly (crunchy and sweet), the Fried Wanton Skin with Bak Kwa (addictively crispy, and sweet and savoury at the same time), and the Baby Pea Sprouts with Sliced Pork Belly (a welcome change from the typically heavy, jelak flavours of lok lok).The ones that didn’t fare as well were the Enoki with Sliced Pork Belly (no specific complaints; this was just a tad boring in comparison to the other ones we tried) and the Cockles (although this was extremely flavourful, we didn’t enjoy the slightly chewy texture).All orders are served with three different sauces including a Thai Sweet Chilli sauce, a Sesame sauce, and a Fiery Spicy Chilli sauce. We found the Thai Sweet Chilli sauce tasty enough, but rather forgettable. The Sesame Sauce was too sweet for our tastebuds, but we particularly liked the Fiery Spicy Chilli sauce, which was slightly zesty and had a strong, bitter aftertaste. If paired with other foods, you might find this chilli sauce too bland – but because you’re having it with the flavourful lok lok, it provides a nice balance without being overwhelmingly salty.Wang BBQ and Grill operates from 5.30pm to 1.30am daily; to minimize your wait time, place your order immediately upon arriving at Chomp Chomp (you can slowly take your time to find a seat after that!) Whilst it might be more cost-effective to go to a lok lok buffet if you want to go all out and indulge, we’d still recommend you to head down to Wang BBQ and Grill to try some of their more innovative lok lok creations, which you won’t be able to find anywhere else.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/simply-wrapps/:['I have never eaten healthy food in my life.So what’s it like to eat it for three days in a row for lunch?Naturally, I wasn’t looking forward to it and who does? The mere thought of anything healthy sends me running in the opposite direction.You see, the HungryGoWhere team was in the midst of refreshing our best food guide to Plaza Singapura and many of our health freak foodie friends suggested we try Simply Wrapps.Even people who are not into healthy food would love it, they said.So me the grease-lovin’ hawker food editor got tragically nominated for this abomination of an experiment.So I said to myself, I might as well try and lose weight since I’m at it.\xa0Day oneSo I forgo-ed my nasi padang and fried Hokkien mee and off I went to Simply Wrapps to face my demons.My first impression was that everything seemed rather confusing.I stood there looking at the menu boards for five minutes before deciding to feel impressed that there’s actually quite a lot of choice and complexity to healthy food, even though I would never admit it to anyone.To make it easier for people, you can choose one of 20 ready made dishes at Simply Wrapps — either as a wrap or a salad.The other option was to customise your own wrap or salad and choose your favourite ingredients.While that option sounded attractive, I know from experience that it can go horribly wrong if you don’t know the menu.So I picked the Martian’s Delight. You can choose to have it as a wrap ($11.50) or as a salad ($10.90). I chose to have a wrap for just a little bit of carbo.It has romaine lettuce, roasted mango chicken, pumpkin, cherry tomatoes, carrots, cucumber and covered in wasabi mayo dressing, it’s a chef’s recommendation apparently.The portion was impressively big but I later discovered that “big” isn’t any indication that it will fill you up, especially when it comes to healthy food.Taste-wise, it was delicious and nicely balanced. The chicken meat came nicely seasoned but not overly flavoured, with creaminess and a slightly fruity taste, plus the natural sweetness of pumpkin.You can hardly taste the wasabi but that’s common in Californian-style wraps and salads like this.I was worried that I would be hungry, but I wasn’t. I felt just nice thanks to the cream, the wrap and just a bit of sweetness.That said, I was ravenous when dinnertime came and possibly ate too much as a result.I felt sick, my diet was busted and I was back to square one. Ah well.\xa0Day twoOkay, change of tactic. I went back to Simply Wrapps ands tried targeting one of their bigger meals. That will keep me fuller through the day so that I don’t overeat during dinner.Scanning through the menu, I saw a menu range that looked interesting — bowls. Keto bowls, soba bowls and grain bowls. Grilled pieces of meat or fish with vegetables with noodles or rice if you like. Perfect.I picked the Soba Bowl with Grilled Cajun Chicken ($9.90) — cold cajun chicken, cold soba noodles with a poached egg, sautéed mushrooms, broccoli, kale, spinach, zucchini, seaweed, onions, lettuce and a liberal amount of sesame ginger dressing.Sounds good but upon eating it, ehhh.The cajun chicken was decently seasoned with nice spices and had a bit of chicken skin on it but the rest definitely lacked seasoning.Maybe they’re doing the healthier choice thing and trying to lower salt in all of their dishes, but for me, that was my limit.I’ll go low carb, even eat smaller amounts but I need my food to taste of something, anything.Don’t get me wrong. Everything was cooked well, the ingredients were fresh and it was nice tasting the naked flavour of food for a change, but I just need a bit more flavour.I later found out that I could go back to the counter and request for more sesame ginger dressing. Ah, that makes sense.Okay, my fault. Dammit, I never knew eating healthily had such a steep learning curve.At the end of the meal, I was hungry and miserable. I popped into a BreadTalk, bought a fried cheese bread and ate the whole thing.I felt even more miserable after that.Afternoon approached and I was ravenous yet again. I ate too much AGAIN for dinner. Miseryyyyyyyy.Learnt a couple more lessons today. You can’t do drastic changes to your diet overnight, you’ll just overcompensate and overeat.If you want to lose weight, try eating a bit less carbo. Portion control just a bit and gradually reduce it over the weeks.\xa0Day threeI am still determined to make this work. I went back to Simply Wrapps, seriously scanned through the menu seriously and picked out the highest calorie dish there was — a Classic Caesar ($10.90).It had the most caloric dish that Simply Wrapps had and it was more than double that of the Maritan’s Delight at a whopping 500 calories.Still, its comparatively healthy compared to a plate of char kway teow which is almost 750 calories.Lettuce, shredded grilled chicken, parmesan cheese, croutons, a whole boiled egg and creamy Caesar salad dressing.“Do you want more dressing, sir?” asked the counter staff. Hell, yes. Pour on the dressing PLEASE.I sat at the table, tucked into my salad and it was….utter bliss.You can’t go wrong with a classic great-tasting Caesar salad — creamy, cheesy with generous meaty chicken chunks. It’s also nice that they use flaked parmesan instead of the processed fake table parmesan at pseudo Italian restaurants.I was eating less calories and the food tasted so good that I was scraping every little bit off the bowl. Now this should be the way to lose weight.One niggle though. It was too much dressing and the dish actually got a bit too salty towards the end. Yes, it was my own fault for agreeing to extra dressing.Lesson of the day? Trust your counter staff, she knows best. Taste it before deciding whether you need to add more.I left Simply Wrapps feeling satisfied and when the afternoon came, I ate some mixed nuts to stave off my hunger. Dinnertime came, I ate a normal meal and didn’t overeat.Finally, success. Albeit, three days late.Okay, now that that’s all over, back to my char kway teow.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/best-char-siew-bao/:['When it comes to savoury bao (steamed Chinese bun), char siew bao is definitely one of Singapore’s most popular choices. We all just love to eat them, whether for breakfast or as a day-time snack on the go.An affordable alternative to elegant restaurant char siew bao, its hawker counterpart is widely available, and can be just as delicious and satisfying. This week, we taste-test some of the most well-known names for char siew bao. So read on to find out which is our steamy-hot favourite?Tiong Bahru Pau & Snacks EDITOR’S PICK!30 Seng Poh Road, #02-18/19 Tiong Bahru Market & Food CentreOpening hours: Tue-Sun: 7.30am-8.30pmPrice: $0.80Rating: 4.5/5Even though it isn’t flawless, Tiong Bahru Pau’s char siew bao will delight even the most finicky tasters’ palates. What impressed us most at Tiong Bahru Pau & Snacks is the char siew filling. Moist and tender, the meat is tasty without being overly sweet. The sauce is robust and smooth. Best of all, it is free of artificial red coloring that plagues most char siew bao fillings.The dough—soft and fluffy—has excellent texture too. But while the skin is thin around the sides, the top of the bun has a rather too-thick fold. And while their standards are pretty consistent, we have noticed that lately, they have tended to be less generous with the filling.That said, Tiong Bahru Pau’s char siew bao has the winning formula that will appeal to most of you.\xa0Teck Kee Tanglin Pau83 Killiney RoadOpening hours: Daily: 9am-10pmPrice: $0.90Rating: 4/5Like Tiong Bahru Pau, Teck Kee Tanglin Pau is one of the oldest hawker dim sum establishments in Singapore. They too, have got the char siew filling just right.The meat has a wonderfully alluring smoky fragrance. Generously cut and well-marinated, the char siew has a lovely balance of sweet and savoury flavours. The sauce that binded the filling is also just right, neither too thick nor too thin.Unfortunately, the dough is too dry and not soft enough. Otherwise, this would have been a killer char siew bao.\xa0D’bun358 Joo Chiat RoadOpening hours: Daily: 8am-10pmPrice: $0.70Rating: 4/5 D’bun’s char siew bao are smaller than its competitors, but they are no less satisfying!Amply filled with moist and well-seasoned char siew, these mini buns are lovely to munch on. The dough, though not the fluffy kind, is very soft and thin. Even after it cooled, the dough stayed soft and moist.Most of us were happy with the filling, but to nitpick, it tasted a tad too sweet and artificial. Also, D’bun’s char siew bao was rather pricey for its small size.\xa0Hong Kong Mongkok Tim Sum  BEST VALUE!Blk 335 Smith Street, #02-097 Chinatown Complex Food CentreOpening hours: Wed-Sun: 11am-6pmPrice: 3 for $2.00Rating: 3.5/5This is one of the rare hawker dim sum where the top of the bun “blossoms”. Usually, this kind of “smiling” bao is more commonly found in upmarket Hong Kong dim sum restaurants.Indeed, the cottony and airy dough is really addictive. It is so good we could eat it on its own. Sweet and sticky, the char siew filling has tender meat. But it is also rather starchy, and gets quite cloying after a while.Overall, this is still a very charming char siew bao. Another plus point is that the items here are made on the premises in small batches, so freshness is guaranteed. Big and bursting with filling, the bao here offer exceptional value.\xa0Ho Kee Pau43 Geylang Lorong 7Opening hours: Daily: 24 hoursPrice: $0.80Rating: 3/5Ho Kee’s char siew bao is perfectly adequate. But compared to its better peers, it isn’t quite as memorable.The char siew filling is sufficiently flavorful, but lacks a distinctive fragrance. And while the meat is tender, some parts are too finely chopped, which results in an uneven texture. Also, the sauce is a little too thick.The dough—which has a somewhat gummy texture—could do with improvement too.\xa0inSing.com made anonymous visits and paid its own meals at the stalls featured here.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/zhong-yu-yuan-wei/:['Pop by Tiong Bahru Market in the mornings and you’ll easily spot the long queues at Zhong Yu Yuan Wei.While their normal wanton noodles ($4/5) is decently executed, it is their pricier wanton noodles using premium “bu jian tian” (armpit) char siew ($6) which is in hot demand.Run by Lee Meng Joo, now 60, he started the business some 30 years ago in the early 1980s and currently runs the stall with his wife.The pig’s armpit char siu is made with the meat in between the shoulder and pork belly, this cut of meat is fattier and more tender than the more commonly used pork shoulder.Charcoal-roasted in-house, the char siu is cut into big, thick slices and has a delicate marinade — lightly sweet and savoury and has a chewier texture as compared to other stalls who specialise in char siu. The slight burnt bits on the meat complete the experience.\xa0The premium bu jian tian wanton noodles at Zhong Yu Yuan Wei is good and is pricey at the minimum price of $6.That said, other Cantonese roast meat stalls which sell similar char siu and noodle portions sell for between $5.50 and $6.50 as well.Whatever the case, their patrons feel that it is worth the price. The cut is so popular that it can sometimes sell out as early as 9am in the morning.The flavour of the noodle dressing has a savoury stock taste, with perhaps a dried prawn base. The savoury chilli has a gritty spiciness and a slight tanginess and does well in not interfering with the overall flavour. Though not very oil-rich, it’s a nice sauce despite its watery appearance.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

While the new restaurant hasn’t increased in seating capacity, diners are no longer sitting on top of each other.\xa0What to expectThe North and South Grandstands will have six and seven storeys of lifestyle services.The Grandstand Car Mall remains with 150 showrooms selling a total of 3,800 used cars. The Grandstand aspires to be the leading lifestyle hub in the Bukit Timah area, so they have been selective in their collection of retailers and restaurants.

Many of these have signed on but premises are currently unopened. They are expected to be operational by the end of the year.Newer tenants have been moving in – in the last few days bespoke cake shop ET Artisan Sweets, Flair Nails and Cuban bar Ocio have opened their doors for business. Several children-related businesses are expected to also open in November including MindChamps and The Kiddiewinkle Place.\xa0Big space(s) for big groupsIn addition, The Grandstand has several large outdoor spaces in which they hope to host large events. This added drawcard provides another option to attract large crowds, especially as the Bukit Timah location makes for a welcome change from battling the traffic of destinations such as Fort Canning and Kallang.Already 75 per cent of the space at The Grandstand has been tenanted, and landlord Cogent Land Capital Pte Ltd is optimistic the rest will be filled by the end of December 2012.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/joo-siah-bak-koot-teh/:['Anyone who lives in the westside of Singapore will know of Joo Siah Bak Koot Teh which is a well loved culinary institution in this area.The bak kut teh eatery started in 1985 in a coffeeshop in Woodlands by the brother-in law of the owner of the famous Rong Cheng Bak Kut Teh.The business relocated to Yuhua Hawker centre in 1996 and In 2015, they relocated once again to a coffee shop (Kai Xiang Food Centre) just two blocks away, with the second generation taking over at the same time.Their main dish of bak kut teh ($5.50/$7.50) is outstandingly done with an addictively robust pork broth which has very balanced stock, garlic and prominent pepper notes.No frozen pork is used and all the pork comes from Indonesia and Australia. Thanks to a special low-heat cooking technique, the normal pai kut (spare ribs) and short ribs come so soft and tender that it’s not really necessary to order the much-coveted prime rib.That said, the prime ribs is very worth the money because there is an impressive amount of meat on every rib.Some bak kut teh eateries will only give you the bottom half of the rib because the meat is soft and tender but Joo Siah gives you the top half as well. It’s good and bad — good because there’s a lot of meat but bad because the meat is very lean, so it can be rather dry and tough.The premium loin ribs soup comes in at only $8.50 for two ribs so it is incredible value for money for sure.If you’re aiming to order some, note that they only have a limited supply of it. Morning breakfasts and brunch are the best times to get it.The other must-have dishes at Joo Siah are the Braised Pork Leg and Braised Pork Belly ($5.50/$7.50) dishes.The meat textures are wonderfully soft and tender and the skin and far come meltingly soft. The gravy as well has a great balanced taste: it’s a big, bold flavour that isn’t over-salted and with a prominent five-spice flavour and a rich collagen flavour, so rich that you can feel the sticky feeling between your lips.Sadly, their side dishes can be a hit or miss affair.The stewed mui choy (preserved mustard greens, $1/2/3), tau kee (dried beancurd skin, $2/3) and peanuts ($1/2/3) are nicely done, though you wouldn’t travel half across Singapore for them.The sides which we would definitely avoid are the sliced you char kueh (dough fritters; $1) which had a disappointingly soft texture and the pork kidneys ($5.50/$7.50) and liver ($5.50/$7.50) frequently comes over-blanched.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/matsukiya/:['It really is a case of unfortunate timing.A concept by the folks behind Sushi Tei, kushiyaki restaurant Matsukiya quietly opened late last year at Paragon shopping centre but when they wanted to officially launch the restaurant in early 2020, Singapore’s circuit breaker measures were imposed.So the poor restaurant’s been flying under the radar and chasing customers all this time.A real shame because the eatery is attempting to offer authentic premium kushiyaki (grilled skewers) in Singapore to people who are willing to pay a little extra for it.Firstly all the ingredients at Matsukiya are grilled over bincho-tan (white charcoal made with Japanese oak) — considered the best charcoal by Japanese grill masters for grilling food.All the best kushiyaki restaurants, including the ones in Singapore, use it because it burns cleanly with a high steady heat.It neutralises protein acids and the far-infrared radiation quickly seals the natural flavours of the food.Secondly, all the meats, seafood and other produce are imported from Japan.The only exception is the chicken, of a French breed, which is raised in Johor Bahru.They are allowed to roam freely and live up to 90 days as opposed to 30-40 days in other farms and are fed a 100% natural and vegetarian diet, which is free of antibiotics and growth hormones.The result is a chicken flavour that is a little more distinct and robust when it comes to the grilled chicken items like the thigh, wings, skin, gizzard or heart.The restaurant has introduced two new executive set lunches to entice diners who may be interested in what authentic premium kushiyaki is all about.\nThe first is a S$25++ set where you choose three kushiyaki from a premium selection of chicken thigh, gizzard, heart, asparagus, shiitake mushroom and more.It comes with Aka Misoshiru on the side, a prawn broth enhanced using aka miso, shimeiji and chives and Gobou Gohan (burdock root rice) made using dashi and served with pickles. Seasonal ice cream caps off the set.The other set ($30++) is a choice of unagi served with shiyo and taro; or tontoro with pork cheek.\xa0The pork cheek originates from Spain and is chosen for its good ratio of marbling and meat. The fat lends a complex depth of flavour, and it melts and permeates the meat upon grilling.Accompanying it is edamame, chawanmushi with Kagoshima pork and truffle oil, gobou gohan and seasonal ice cream.But arguably just as interesting are some of their side dishes. The chef’s special Ika ($18) is a whole squid, perfected grilled to a soft texture and with smoky flavours and served with mashed potato darkened with squid ink.Another side dish — the Yuzukosho Tori Ramen ($18) — would make for a great lunch special in itself.Dry ramen noodles dressed with spicy yuzu paste and cooked using a broth made with homemade spicy tontoro sauce. A perfectly grilled chicken on top\xa0 and lovely fried crunchy chicken skin bits on top. Heavenly.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/alhambra-satay/:['What better place to get good Malay satay — grilled marinated meats with sliced cucumbers, red onions, ketupat (compressed rice cakes) and spicy peanut sauce — than in Geylang Serai, the biggest Malay enclave in Singapore. Right?Not necessarily and truth be told, it really depends where you go to.It wasn’t a situation where every satay stall in the area had some form of minimum standard. Quite the contrary, the standard of Malay satay varied quite a bit — from excellent to very average.At least they all retain the classic condiments of a Malay satay dish with big, chopped cucumbers with the skin on and big slices of red onions.A welcome sight as many satay stalls in the rest of Singapore have largely done away with cucumber skin. Many places have even omitted red onions altogether.The other downside is that all the satay stalls have switched over to factory-made ketupat (compressed rice cakes) which come in green plastic coverings, instead of the palm leaf shell which traditional ketupat comes in.While it hasn’t changed the rice texture — smooth and slightly soft — it unfortunately lacks the green fragrance which palm leaves impart.There are three big names which do satay in the area — all of them heritage stalls which have operated for many decades and some with more than one outlet.Sadly, only one emerged as the clear favourite.\xa0*critic’s pick*\xa0ALHAMBRA SATAY (Geylang Serai Market) |Alhambra Satay can trace its history all the way back to the old Satay Club at Beach Road when they started in 1964 and they use an original Javanese recipe which was concocted by the stall’s Javanese owner who has since passed on.We tried that version from the\xa0Alhambra outlet located at the Mr Teh Tarik coffeeshop below the Market.While it was reasonably appetising,\xa0we actually prefer the version done by the lady (ex-wife of one of the owners ; she declined to be named) who runs the Alhambra outlet at the main Geylang Serai Market itself.She has taken the original recipe and adapted it using her mother’s own satay recipe, resulting in what we feel is the best Malay satay in the Geylang Serai area.Only three varieties are on offer — chicken, beef and mutton — but all of them have a lovely tender, moist texture with a slight smoky charring on the meat.The mutton is especially worth your attention as each stick has a piece of mutton fat in-between the meat which boosts the richness immensely.Also nice is the present spice flavour and slight herb textures that is a result of the spice mix being rough blended.The quality of the stall-made satay sauce varies depending on the time and day you taste it. A fresh pot of satay sauce is made about every two days and when tasted fresh, the taste is a bit flat and bland.Taste the sauce the next day when it has had time to simmer for many hours and the flavour is very well-balanced with the right sweet, savoury and oil-rich flavours.While it doesn’t have the thick richness that the satay sauce has at Warong Sudi Mumpir, it has a pleasant medium-thick and chunky consistency which satay lovers will be happy with.The making of the satay sticks at both stalls are all done by hand.\xa0None of the satay is factory supplied — all the meat is bought raw from suppliers, chopped up, marinated using a proprietary blend of spices and hand-skewered everyday.However, whatever is made by the Geylang Serai outlet is sold at the Geylang Serai outlet. Though the wife admitted that they do occasionally take stocks from “downstairs” (the Mr Teh Tarik outlet) whenever their supply is low.So ask where the sticks come from before you order as the quality between the two is very different.Babat (beef tripe) is available at their outlet at the Mr Teh Tarik coffeeshop but we would give it a miss. The texture was tough on both occasionas that we tried it.As compared to the Mr Teh Tarik outlet, the meats have a slightly sweeter finish but isn’t overly so but the herb and spice flavours are masked a little more as a result.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/tips-for-starting-whisky-collection/:['Can an everyday single malt lover get into the world of fine and rare whiskies?The Macallan recently launched its fifth decanter in The Macallan in Lalique Six Pillars Collection at the Raffles Singapore Bar & Billiard Room.Named “The Spiritual Home” (pictured, right), the decanter pays tribute to Easter Elchies House, an iconic Highland manor house at the heart of The Macallan Estate that dates back to 1700. Within the decanter is a whiskey that has spent a staggering 62 years in sherry-seasoned American oak casks, making it the second oldest whisky that the distillery has ever released. It’s an extraordinary product that will only go up in value, but with a price tag of $33,000 and only 400 bottles available worldwide, you’d have to be a person of some means to own it.That got us thinking: we asked David Cox, The Macallan’s parent company’s –\xa0The Edrington Group –\xa0director of fine and rare whiskies how someone with a modest amount to invest can get started on their own whisky collection:\xa0How does one identify a whisky worth buying?\nThe first thing I’m going to say firmly is that we don’t make Macallan as an investment. We make Macallan to be enjoyed and to be drunk. What’s been happening in the market in the last five to ten years in terms of increases in value has been quite extraordinary. It’s amazed us and I think it’s amazed everyone else in the industry.\xa0Why do you think Macallan whiskys have been increasing in value?\nI think it’s been fuelled by a number of things: it’s come in on the back of a massive increase in interest in fine wines as an investment, particularly driven by the financial crash of 2008. People have been looking for other stores of value and they’ve discovered single malts. Old and rare single malts are, by their very nature, limited in availability, and if you combine that with production from one of the top houses or distilleries like The Macallan, you’ve got a very potent combination.\xa0Is the price of a whisky a good indication of its collectability and potential future value?\nNo, I think the key thing is rarity. Anything that is not limited in supply in going to achieve less value in the long term, so what people are seeking out are rare, limited edition and limited production bottlings, or bottlings made by distilleries that are no longer active. If it’s rare, it’s going to achieve value.\xa0Considering the heat and humidity in Singapore, what’s the best way to store your whisky?\nYou’re always better keeping it out of direct sunlight. Interestingly, if you have a whisky that’s been artificially coloured – which is perfectly legal and quite frequently done – direct sunlight will fade that colour. If the colour is natural, as it is with Macallan, it’s fixed in the whisky and is less susceptible to fade. Keep it in a shaded, cool spot, ideally at an ambient room temperature – not too hot, not too cold.\xa0So the conditions should be similar to storing wines?\nWe’re really the complete opposite of wine. We take the risk when the whisky is maturing in the wood, once it comes out of the wood, it goes into glass or crystal which is inert. It’s really not going to change in character unless you open it and close it repeatedly and you get a lot of oxidation. And because of the strength of whisky – it’s got to be a minimum of 40 per cent alcohol by volume – you’re always going to get a certain amount of evaporation which will keep the cork moist.\xa0Wine is typically 13 to 14 per cent alcohol by volume, so it’s not enough to keep the cork moist if you store the bottle upright; that’s why wine bottles are kept on their side. For whiskys, you should look after it, but you don’t need to be overly fussy.\xa0What would you say to someone deciding on drinking a bottle that was initially purchased as an investment or for a collection?\nI would say good on them! We’ve always made whisky to be drunk and to be enjoyed. We invest a lot of money, and take a lot of time, and we put in a lot of labour to create something a bit special. We want people to enjoy it and share it with their nearest and dearest, not hoard it for years. Can you imagine if no one had ever seen the Mona Lisa? If it had been tucked away in somebody’s attic? What a shame it would’ve been if it wasn’t shared with the world. We want to share as much Macallan with the world as possible.\xa0A beer enthusiast first and a writer second,\xa0Kurt Ganapathy\xa0has tried over a thousand brews from 80 countries. Some of his most memorable exploits include tackling the one-time world’s strongest beer – BrewDog’s 41% abv Sink The Bismarck! – and getting his name on the wall of an Irish pub in Melbourne for drinking 100 pints of Guinness (not in one sitting, of course).Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/soup-or-viagra/:['I once heard a joke that if Adam and Eve were Chinese, they would probably have eaten the serpent in the Garden of Eden instead of allowing it to tempt them to eat the forbidden fruit. This is because the Chinese are known to be adventurous with food. To prove my point, I’ll introduce you to an unusual dish–turtle soup.When my makan kaki suggested we go try this turtle soup, I felt an emotional mix of excitement and trepidation at the same time.Turtle soup is not for everyone and there’s a lot urban legend surrounding this dish. Many believe that turtle soup is an aphrodisiac and that it warms the body and increases alertness. I am no expert in this, but I think it is believed that some ingredients in the soup cause blood vessels to dilate, thus increasing blood flow, mimicking the effect of Viagra!Now, eating turtle soup in Geylang with two other men might be especially risky as it may invite unwanted attention. It was 2.30pm in the afternoon and the restaurant was quite packed that day. It was common knowledge a few years ago that if you were in Geylang for food, then you should head for the odd number Lorongs and avoid the even ones.Now, the beauty of turtle soup (so I was told) is all that soft gelatinous skin and shell which you would love if you love fish head. Boiling all that cartilage makes the soup a little smoother and viscous, very much like shark bone soup. Taste wise, the turtle soup tasted like the standard herbal soup to me and all that soft gelatinous stuff didn’t thrill me that much. I suspect that psychologically it may help some to feel more revitalised after consuming a bowl of soup that is rich and filled with ingredients. At $40 per claypot of turtle soup, it seemed a little pricey to me. I gave it a 3/5. However, one of my makan kaki came away feeling seemingly rejuvenated and glowing with renewed energy. He gave it a 4.25/5. I guess turtle soup is something you either love or eat it only once in a while.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/ratio/:['Brewing a cup of coffee may not come across as a very high-tech affair, but a cafe by day, lounge by night establishment is hoping to change that perception. Ratio, located at Centrepoint in the heart of Orchard Road, proudly serves up coffee and cocktails prepared by robots.Ratio is home to three robots, all of which are visible even before you step through the entrance. One serves as the cafe’s barista, able to brew local-style Nanyang coffee using a coffee sock. Another robot serves as the barista’s assistant, pouring coffee and serving up cups of beer. The third robot is the lounge’s bartender, serving up cocktails including the Tom Yum Maritini, one of Ratio’s signature drinks.Anyone who enjoys using an electronic ordering system will feel right at home in this place: orders can be made via the electronic board at the entrance, while regulars may want to consider downloading an app that lets customers customize their drinks.\xa0After a drink order is made, the robots get to work. It was pretty fun to watch the robots as they pour, mix, and serve the drinks. The barista robot was particularly fascinating to watch, as it was programmed to mimic the actions of a master Nanyang coffee brewer, complete with the “tarik” motion as it pours the coffee from pot to pot.\xa0You’d imagine that a cocktail made by a machine would taste different, but we are happy to report that Ratio’s high-tech cocktails tasted just as good as if they were prepared by a human bartender. The lounge offers a small selection of speciality cocktails, with the Pink Mule (vodka, ginger beer, grapefruit juice, and lime), as well as the Tom Yum Martini (Tom Yum vodka, Malibu, pineapple, and lime), being amongst the most popular.\xa0We loved how refreshing the Pink Mule was, with the slight bitterness of the grapefruit complimented nicely by the ginger beer and lime. The Tom Yum Martini was also a pleasant surprise. Even though we were initially hesitant to try a savoury cocktail, we were very impressed by how well the Tom Yum flavours mixed so well with the tartness of the pineapple and zesty lime.If you’re looking for a mid-day pick-me-up instead, Ratio’s local-style Nanyang coffee starts from $1 for a cop of Kopi O, with every drink prepared by its resident robots. We liked how well-balanced the coffee was: aromatic and robust, and free of any sour notes. For people who prefer Espresso coffee, the Banana Latte ($5), which can be served hot or iced, is a fun, delicious drink.\xa0Aside from its high-tech drinks, Ratio also serves a small all-day menu of some very tasty cafe bites too. While these are not prepared by the robot staff, they are certainly just as delicious. Our favourite was the Chicken Lemak, Sambal In Cruffin, which is essentially the cruffin (muffin-croissant hybrid) version of a plate of Nasi Lemak.We loved how the flaky, crispy cruffin pastry goes so well with the Lemak Chicken filling that is bursting with a rich, satisfying coconut flavour. The filling is topped with a bit of sambal that adds a much-appreciated fiery kick to the entire dish.\xa0People who are looking for something with more European flavours may want to check out the Signature Truffled Egg in Multi-grain Loaf. This egg sandwich, which is enough for a satisfying meal, boasts delicious filling that has a good balance of truffle flavours. At just $3.90, this is a pretty good deal.For a healthier food option, try the Pesto Chicken Farfalle Salad ($6.90). We liked how the refreshing pesto blended so well with the farfalle pasta, with plenty of veggies to provide an extra crunch in each bite.\xa0The VerdictBoasting an extensive and customizable drinks menu as well as a very tasty all-day food menu, Ratio is certainly worth a visit. With its resident robots and its high-tech approach to dining out, visiting this cafe/lounge establishment is also an all-new digital experience in itself as well.\xa0Ratio\n176 Orchard Road,\xa0#05-06 CentrepointAuthor© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/coba-coba/:['For a neighbourhood that’s come to be somewhat of a joke (with worms in durians, cat abuse, brothel raids, and cows roaming around lift landings being de rigueur), Yishun is doing pretty well for itself in the way of food. Apart from the old-school favourites, such as the Chong Pang Nasi Lemak and 928 Yishun Laksa, there’s also Coba Coba, a hipster halal eatery that is (relatively!) new to the scene.At Coba Coba, which is a family-run establishment, they’ve spared no expense in decking out the place. Sitting proudly on the patch of grass in front of the eatery is a trishaw with the eatery’s name emblazoned all over it.Inside, you’ll find vintage display shelves and cabinets lined with relics of the past, including gramophones, sewing machines, radios, and more.Bless their hearts; there’s even a brick wall which makes us feel like we’re visiting our new homeowner friends in their hipster BTO flats.While the decor is very firmly in the territory of “hipster”, we’re glad to report that the menu and accompanying prices aren’t. You won’t find cafe grub here – instead, they serve nasi padang (veg, $1; meat, $3-$3.50, seafood, $3-$5) as well as nasi lemak sets ($3-$4.90).Also available is a variety of noodles and other dishes including mee siam ($3), mee rebus ($3), mee soto ($3.20) and lontong ($3.20).Then there are their Nasi Ambeng sets (classic, $23.90 for 2 or $32.90 for 3; deluxe, $32.90 for 2 or $43.90 for 3) which contain a bit of everything.We ordered a Classic Nasi Ambeng for 2 – given the large portion, this can be shared pretty comfortably amongst three unless you’re ravenous.Starting with what we liked – the telur belado (hard boiled eggs with chilli sauce) is a simple dish, but one that proved to be exceptionally tasty.Same goes for the sambal terung (sambal eggplant) – which scored extra points for not being overly oily.There’s also the beef rendang, which is a relatively rich and flavourful, and the milky ayam kalio (chicken rendang cooked “halfway” in a red curry).Last but not least, the paru (cow lung) took us a while to place. While some nasi padang places serve it crispy, however, this version that we tried at Coba Coba was chewier, and bore a slight resemblance to beef jerky.Others though were forgettable – the begedel (deep fried potato patty) is pretty standard, and we couldn’t get too excited about the urap (steamed vegetable salad) consisting of bean sprouts, long beans, and spicy grated coconut.The sambal goreng (stir-fried tofu and long beans in sambal), which is commonly found at Malay stalls throughout Singapore, is also nothing to shout about.While there isn’t any air-conditioning at Coba Coba, there is an assortment of mismatched fans turning lazily overhead, rewarding patrons with a cool breeze at all times. Because of the large and roomy interior, it doesn’t get too crowded, even during peak hours.They’re located just 5 minutes from Yishun MRT station, so don’t fret – chances of you getting lost in Yishun are slim.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/hua-kee-hougang-famous-wan-ton-mee/:['What we liked:\n— The sauce is very compelling at this stall\n— Fried lard bits and fried onions are a nice addition to the dishWhat we didn’t:\n— The quality could be more consistentEstablished in the 1930s, Hua Kee was previously from the Hougang area and is now run by the third generation. It shifted to Old Airport Food Centre more than a decade ago and the wanton mee here is generally regarded as one of the best wanton noodles in Singapore’s east side.The main attraction is the stall’s dry noodles and sauce dressing.\xa0Its egg noodles used to be handmade but are now factory made to their own specifications, costing four times that of factory noodles, likely because of a higher egg content.\xa0The result are the best egg noodles of any wanton noodle stall — springy with a soft but resilient texture, plus they don’t clump up even if you leave them for some time.There is also an eggy bite of sorts which is hard to describe but is very satisfying to eat.\xa0The sauce is a nice mix of a big, slightly sweet spiciness, soy stock flavour and oil richness. The noodles are always well dressed no matter how big the portion you order.\xa0The problem with this stall is that the dressing is not always consistent. When the third generation owner does it, the mix is always right but not when his other helpers do it. Sometimes they add too much or not enough oil and the chilli levels also vary quite a bit.They are also inconsistent when it comes to the fried lard bits and fried onion mixture and green chilli. It’s nice when its added as it adds a nice crunch into the mix but it doesn’t get added all the time. Also missing half the time are the pickled sliced green chillies.\xa0The other main highlight are the wantons, which are consistently made and are filled with fatty minced meat and well-seasoned with tee po (dried sole fish).The same can’t be said of char siu (barbecued pork) but at least it is a few steps better than factory made — its not dry and not cut to cardboard thinness.\xa0The soup is unfortunately nothing to shout about.Also note that the stall is not exactly the most polite of stalls. The stallholders can be quite gruff and short but it shouldn’t be any issue if you’re straightforward in your ordering.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/chef-kangs/:['Whilst Chef Ang Song Kang said that he never expected to receive a Michelin star (they are one of the 11 new recipients in 2017) , his road to success was fraught with many challenges. The 53-year-old has experienced his fair share of hardships, including having to close down his first F&B business, Canton Wok, in 2002. Following a failed business venture in China, he also filed for bankruptcy in 2009. Chef Kang proceeded to work at several restaurants (including Canton Kitchen and Canton Recipes House) before embarking on his own F&B venture again with his namesake, Chef Kang’s.Located within walking distance of Little India MRT, Chef Kang’s is an intimate, 40-seater space. There are just two chefs that helm the kitchen, and Chef Kang personally prepares every dish that his customers order. Because he’s currently undergoing treatment for cancer, however, he’s forced to close the restaurant on days when he’s feeling unwell – so be sure to call ahead to make sure they’re open before making a trip down.\xa0Chef Kang is known for his Omakase Menu, which is priced at $80 onwards per pax for lunch and $120 onwards per pax for dinner, both with a minimum of four pax to order. For those who find this pricey, however, the dishes on the ala carte menu are more affordable, and equally delicious.\xa0\nTopping our list of recommendations is the Fried Eggplant with Pork Floss ($28 onwards), which is eggplant like we’ve never tasted it before. Forget the typical oil-laden eggplant dishes that you find at zichar stalls – Chef Kang’s rendition is crispy and dry on the outside, and soft and juicy on the inside. The highly fragrant and aromatic pork floss is also a great addition to the dish, and complements the eggplant well without stealing the show.\xa0\nAnother must-try is the Sauteed Kailan With Prawn Paste ($28 onwards) – this will blow you away. At first glance, this dish looks rather wet and gloopy, but given how flavourful and potent the prawn paste sauce is, your first mouthful is all it takes for that initial impression to be completely reversed. Special mention goes to the crispy pork skin bits and the melty garlic pieces in the sauce; we’ve never particularly liked kailan, but this dish is show-stopping enough to convert even the most stubborn carnivorous eater.For those of you who can’t live without carbs, also order the Simmered Rice Noodles in Superior Stock ($25 onwards), which makes Sembawang White Beehoon look like a joke. This is chock full of ingredients such as crunchy kailan pieces, and prawn and scallop bits, but the star of the dish is undoubtedly the “superior stock” – this is double boiled chicken soup made with a special in-house recipe. The Simmered Rice Noodles is undoubtedly comfort food at its best – and if this stock is commercially available, we’d be the first to get in line and buy an entire carton.\xa0Our least favourite dish of the night was the Signature Dual Flavours Pork Ribs ($28 onwards). Comprising of pork ribs in mustard sauce as well as coffee sauce, this dish wasn’t bad per se, but it paled in comparison to the other more outstanding dishes that we tried. Out of the two flavours, we preferred the mustard sauce; the coffee sauce was a tad too sweet for our liking, and some pieces seemed to be sweeter than others.\xa0In a nutshell: Chef Kang’s is too good to miss out on. Yes, diners these days face an increasingly large array of cuisines to choose from, including “exotic” and less mainstream options such as Caribbean, Lebanese and Russian food. There’s also a noticeable trend towards good looking or Instagrammable food, which Chinese food doesn’t tend to be. But with traditional Chinese restaurants as stand-out as Chef Kang’s, we’re confident that Chinese cuisine is still relevant in today’s food scene. Chef Kang, we’ll be back for more!Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/no-18-zion-road-fried-kway-teow/:['In operation at Zion Riverside Food Centre since the early 2000s, this stall has built up a reputation for frying one of the best char kway teows in Singapore but whether you’ll love it depends on how sweet you like it.Now 65 years old (2021), Ho Kian Tat cut his teeth learning under the late Ng Chang Siang, the char kway teow master of Hill Street Fried Kway Teow, when Kian Tat was a 10-year-old boy and when the Hill Street stall was located along the street side at the now-defunct Thong Chai Medical Hall in the 1970s.Now Kian Tat runs a tight ship at Zion Riverside Food Centre, frying up hundreds of dishes of char kway teow while his Filipina wife handles the orders and money.\nFun fact: his stall number is actually #01-17, not “No. 18” as the name suggests. #01-18 was the original number of the stall before Zion Riverside went through a major renovation in 2003.Kian Tat’s char kway teow ($4/5/6/8) is firmly in the slightly wet camp, so the dish comes a little sticky and moist with lots of sweet savoury flavours and the dish helped along with a healthy amount of crunchy pork lard and oil, so the texture is nice and smooth.Order it with chilli and it just adds spiciness with no extra flavour.There is also cockle blood juice mixed into the dish for a slightly earthy flavour but more is always welcome.\nThe medium-width kway teow and yellow noodles have a nice soft bouncy texture but as with all char kway teow, it tilts towards being slightly mushy if you leave it for longer than five minutes or if you order it to go.All the classic ingredients are present in the dish — cockles, fishcakes, sliced lap cheong (Chinese sausage), chopped green chives and bean sprouts — and it’s also good that fishcakes and lap cheong are cut a little thicker than usual for a fuller flavour.The cockles come barely seared and the vegetables still retain their crunch and despite the dish’s wetter consistency, there is still a little wok hei in the dish.\nIt’s partly because the noodles and kway teow are batch fried with garlic and soy sauce and left aside before ingredients are added for a second frying.Also thanks to the lighter savouriness, you can taste the inherent flavours of every added ingredient, especially the slightly seared cockles which have a nice earthy, bloody seafood flavour when you bite into it.As for the sweetness, Kian Tat fries it to a moderate sweetness but he does occasionally fry it a bit sweeter.\nAlso a first for the stall, the dish of Cockles Bean Sprouts ($8) was officially introduced into the menu in April 2021.We say “officially” because Cockles Beans Sprouts is an off-menu dish that could be ordered all this while but they’ve made it official by pasting a laminated paper in front of the stall.Essentially char kway teow minus the kway teow, noodles, lap cheong and sweet black sauce, it’s a good stir-fried dish, full of fish sauce, chilli sambal, lard, cockle, bean sprout flavours.It comes a bit wet as the towgay releases quite a bit of water but the flavours are still nicely prominent, with a bit of charred smokiness.\xa0Eat these dishes while you can as Kian Tat is pushing in age and none of his three children have any plans in taking over the business.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

Indonesia remains the largest archipelago in Southeast Asia today, consisting of 17,580 islands.With so many islands, it’s expected that cuisines in Indonesia differ from region to region.

The traditional Javanese dish literally translates into ‘smashed chicken’, describing the end process of smashing a piece of deep-fried marinated chicken with a wooden mallet. Served with a large dollop of homemade sambal belacan (chilli paste) and fried tahu (Indonesian for ‘beancurd’), this Indonesian staple is also best paired with white rice and a tangy sayur asam (sour vegetable soup).

The restaurant, heavily adorned with traditional Balinese house décor, offers a signature cumi Bali (from $28): a tender, flame-grilled squid with black sweet sauce. The ikan bakar (from $28) is also wonderfully unique as it is flavourful: prepared by spreading otah paste on top of a peculiar ‘chicken fish’ and steamed (prices vary according to how big your fish is). Don’t worry about it being too fishy, the kaffir lime leaf is most pronounced among the 18 different spices used in the paste, creating the sprightliest aroma of herb and spice.\nCumi Bali | Address: 66 Tanjong Pagar Road | Tel: 6220 6619 | Opening hours: Mon-Sat 11.30am-3pm, 6pm-9pm\xa0CRITIC’S PICK Djanoer Koening\nMSG-free East Javanese\nThis family-run business, led by Javanese head chef Suharmi Wiryatmoko (affectionately known as Ibu) prides itself in their healthy, no-MSG policy. Even the most savoury of dishes in East Javanese cuisine like the bakso urat (beefball soup) is cooked in a fragrant bone-boiled broth.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/limoncello/:['Oh, burrata—you charming cheesy fellow. This relatively new invention was only introduced around the 1920s, and because it has to be eaten very fresh, it was rarely seen outside of Apulia where it was made. Today, we are able to indulge in fresh burrata from Italy as it is air flown in. Before you tuck into the specially created Antipasto Limoncello served at Limoncello Pizza & Grill,\xa0discover all you need to know about this truly IT(alian) ingredient.HOW TO SAY IT: It’s more like burr-ah-ta not boo-rah-tah, but don’t worry too much about saying it to an Italian—whichever way you pronounce it, it still sounds delicious.IT MEANS: Butter, or “burro” in Italian. Because it’s a fresh cheese, the taste is delicate, milky, soft and creamy—kinda like butter.IT’S MADE OF: Cow’s milk, rennet and cream, but was originally made from buffalo milk.BUT WHAT IS IT? Firm mozzarella shell is filled with fresh cream and mozzarella curd, which makes it just like a chocolate lava cake, but in cheese form. Burrata was created to maximise pieces of leftover mozzarella curds (called “stracciatella”, or little rags) from going to waste. To make each ball, a rectangle of warm mozzarella is filled with thickened cream and stringy mozzarella scraps. The package forms a pouch-like shape when closed at the top and tied up.THAT SECRET CREAM: Each cheese maker uses their own recipe, so your burrata might be filled with a mix of mascarpone, ricotta and heavy cream. The thickness of the mozzarella shell also differs depending on the maker. The pleasure of burrata lies in cutting open your pouch to reveal the rich, oozy cream.HOW TO EAT: Serve burrata whole, straight from the fridge, with some salt and cracked black pepper to heighten its delicate milkiness. It also pairs well with earthy or sharp flavours to create a truly gourmet dish.WHERE TO EAT: Readers, you’re in luck. In the city fringe by the Robertson Quay waterfront, you’ll discover one of the most passionate Italian restaurants in town, where chef and owner Fabio Iannone has set up his stage for Italian cuisine. Limoncello offers the Antipasto Limoncello ($45++, ideal for two to three to share, or $24++ for half portion) to highlight the soft, creamy and sweet burrata, together with healthy mixed grilled vegetables and cold cuts such as sweet San Danielle ham with air-dried bresaola (beef tenderloin) slices. This lean, healthy dish combines protein, calcium, antioxidants and fibre for the ultimate guilt-free indulgence!Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/store-and-reheat-leftover-food-safely/:['Leftovers can cause food poisoning. Learn how to store cooked food in the fridge and the best way to reheat them.\xa0Even a tiny amount of harmful bacteria can be dangerous when we eat leftover food. While that packet of nasi lemak bought earlier in the morning might still seemingly smell and taste fine later in the day, it might have already harboured enough toxic pathogens to leave you feeling nauseated and ill.“The immune system in healthy adults can deal with small amounts of bacteria and viruses. But larger numbers of such bugs can make us quite sick,” explains Ms Charmaine Toh, a dietitian with National Healthcare Group Polyclinics (NHGP).Indeed, vulnerable people such as pregnant women, people with weakened immune systems or the elderly can die from food poisoning.\xa0\xa0Common symptoms of food-borne illness — usually known as food poisoning — can be mild or severe. These can include nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, stomach cramps, headaches and fever.While most episodes last only a day or two, some infections can be nasty. Hepatitis A or typhoid can cause severe illnesses lasting many weeks. Some food-borne illnesses can even result in long-term health issues involving the immune system, gut or kidneys.Ms Toh says one of the most common causes of food-borne illness is the improper storage of cooked foods. While cooking destroys most pathogens, bacteria can be reintroduced to food later on, and leftovers can become a breeding ground for toxic strains such as Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enteritidis, Escherichia coli and Campylobacter.\xa0\xa0Eating reheated food is safe as long as we observe food safety. Here are the best ways to reduce the risk of food poisoning when taking care of leftovers:\xa0Once food has been cooked, it should be stored in the fridge or freezer within two hours, says Ms Toh. Leftovers must be put in shallow containers or distributed into smaller portions for quick cooling and refrigerated at or below 4°C within two hours.In general, refrigerated leftovers can be stored for three to four days in a covered container. Food destined for the freezer should be labelled with the freeze date and stored in freezer-quality resealable bags or sturdy glass/plastic containers.\xa0When food is left to thaw at room temperature, bacteria present can multiply to unsafe levels. While freezing does inactivate bacteria, some may remain alive and can begin to multiply when the food returns to room temperature.Thaw frozen food in the refrigerator in a container to catch the drips (thereby preventing cross-contamination), or use a microwave oven. Thaw small items quickly under running water and place them in a leakproof bag.\xa0Cook all thawed food immediately\xa0and do not refreeze.\xa0Take-out food containers are often made of foam, plastic or paper and may not be microwave-safe. Store and reheat take-out items in food-safe containers. Certain plastics are safe, while ceramics and glass are the best.“Never reheat or store food in plastic containers that were not intended for food. Containers meant for one-time use, such as margarine tubs, tend to warp or melt in the microwave, and this may allow harmful substances in certain plastics to leach into the food,” says Ms Toh. Avoid plastics and containers that are visibly damaged, stained or have a bad smell.\xa0Reheating food kills bacteria. It is important to use the right method of reheating to ensure all bacteria are destroyed. Whether oven-baking, sautéing or microwaving, Ms Toh recommends that leftovers be brought to a minimum temperature of 74°C — use a food thermometer to check — and soups, sauces and gravies should be brought to a rolling boil.When using a microwave oven, give your leftovers a good stir in the middle of heating and allow the hot food to stand for a few minutes afterwards, as the heat will continue to radiate through the food. Do not forget to use a microwave-safe covered container — leftovers heat more evenly and retain their moisture better when covered.\xa0Avoid cross-contaminating your food by storing cooked and ready-to-eat items separately from raw food, especially raw meats, advises Ms Toh. Use a separate, properly-covered container for each food item, and adopt a “first-in, first-out” principle when consuming leftovers.Adds Ms Toh, “Do not store perishable food in the refrigerator door, especially milk. The temperature of food stored in the door can increase when the refrigerator is opened, so store foods that can go bad quickly on the main shelves of the refrigerator.”Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

Although it is a popular item on the menu in Korea, we felt that it was rather underwhelming as the fried chicken patty could easily be likened to KFC’s Zinger Burger. However, the spicy sauce really stood out as it was a unique flavour, especially when paired together with the burger as a whole. Try out the a-la-carte Burger for S$6.00 nett or order it as a set meal at S$8.50.Mom’s Fried Chicken (Spicy or Non-Spicy)Known for it’s crispy, juicy and tender fried chicken – Mom’s Touch has this dish available in both spicy and non-spicy versions. Their chicken is first marinated with Mom’s Touch’s very own special seasoning blend before being deep-fried, giving it a flavourful and crunchy texture. We personally really enjoyed the Spicy Fried Chicken, served hot and with generous portions. It is also very reasonably priced at S$3.60 nett if you order it a-la-carte for a quick bite. Otherwise, make it a full meal for S$8.70, which includes a side/drink of your choice.Mom’s Spicy Sauce Chicken\xa0The chain also features Mom’ Spicy Sauce Chicken, another crowd favourite in Korea. The deep-fried chicken is covered in the rich and mildly spicy signature sauce.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/ah-heng-duck-rice/:['A stall which started at Hong Lim Food Centre some seven, eight years ago, Ah Heng does a traditional Teochew-style duck rice that is virtually the same as the famous Heng Gi Goose and Duck Rice at Tekka Centre.The couple running the stall learnt the recipe from Yang Qi Xing (76) who ran Heng Gi for some 60 years before handing it over.Back in 2012, you would have seen Yang overseeing operations at Ah Heng but in current times, it seems that he has fully retired.\xa0Mai Xue Qi (early 60s) who has been a hawker assistant since he was 12 now runs the stall with his wife.The beauty about this stall is that they have gotten the intense soy flavouring of the Teochew lor (gravy) down pat.It’s intense with a strong savouriness but at the same time not overly salty and there’s virtually no sugar added or if there is any, only just enough to round off the salty edges.All the ingredients are braised in this intense gravy and they are mostly blanched well.The tau kwa and duck liver come meltingly soft, as is the pig skin. The big-head intestines are well-cleaned with no offensive pig smell.The pork belly is cut thick and comes pretty tender, though the same can’t be said of the duck.The duck tenderness can be a hit or miss though we like the way they chop the duck to include all the bony bits.They have also gotten the Teochew chilli right — intensely sour with a moderate spiciness — though that’s not necessarily a good thing.It’s perhaps a little too sour as none of the braised ingredients are so rich that it needs so much sourness to cut through.\xa0It used to make sense when the stall sold braised goose and that meat has a very heavy richness but they had to stop due to AVA restrictions (the need for proper certification).Currently, no supplier imports fresh goose and the frozen variety from Hungary is prohibitively expensive.They also have kiam chye (salted vegetables) as an option which — when eaten with rice, is a little strange but makes sense with kway chap.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/lai-wah/:['What better time to talk about yu sheng than during the Chinese New Year season! But this is no ordinary yu sheng, this is the original yu sheng that was first introduced to Singapore at Chinese New Year in 1964. Up till then, Yu Sheng had been a dish eaten during Chinese New Year, but it wasn’t until the “Four Heavenly Kings”* came up with the idea of premixing the sauces and introducing “Lo Hei” or tossing of the salad as a group activity that gave birth to what we know today as yu sheng.Yu sheng is something Singaporeans should be proud of as it is a piece of culture we are exporting to the world. It ranks up there with the Singapore Sling and chilli crabs as something that is uniquely Singapore. Don’t you think it’s a pity we have to wait eight months just to eat it?I must admit that I was a little apprehensive before I tried the yu sheng at Lai Wah. If this is the birthplace of yu sheng, what would I write if the yu sheng was not up to par? Thankfully, Lai Wah’s yu sheng truly lived up to its reputation, in comparison to the standard of regular yu sheng. Lai Wah’s yu sheng had the perfect balance of sweet, savoury, tangy, crunchy, chewy and spicy flavours.The yam ring here was good too. The yam was nice and “sang” (powdery) and the ring crisp. However, I found that there was not enough sauce in the filling. I think it is still worth ordering but I didn’t find it as mouth-watering as their yu sheng.Yu Lan chicken is a classic poached chicken served with ham and kailan (Chinese vegetable), hence the name Yu Lan, (“Yu” means green jade and “Lan” refers to kailan). I haven’t eaten this dish in a long while, so it was a real blast from the past.Although Lai Wah prides itself on serving traditional Cantonese cuisine, they have dishes that are designed for the younger generation. One such dish is the fried crispy prawns which all the makan kakis around the table were unanimous in giving it a double “thumbs-up”. The prawns were coated with poh piah skin (springroll skin) and although the flavours were very basic, the prawn was an absolute delight!Now, when it comes to fish, the Teochews and the Cantonese have differing views on how it should be done. The red garoupa in “two styles” is a dish that has to be ordered in advance because one side of the fish is used to make a delicate wrap while the other is deep fried. As a Teochew Ah Hia (true blue Teochew), I would have preferred my red garoupa steamed with ginger and sour plums. But this dish was fast disappearing the moment it hit the table so I rest my case!The restaurant is still run by a delightful elderly couple. Their son turns up when the place is packed with customers. Their chef has been working at the restaurant since the time the yu sheng was created. Even though the place was renovated a year and a half ago, it still exudes that “homey” and nostalgic ambience which is very inviting.As a foodie, I think that Lai Wah deserves some recognition like an award from the Singapore Tourism Board for its contribution to our local cuisine. Such acknowledgement would help to preserve our local food for generations of Singaporeans to come.\xa0*The Four Heavenly Kings here refer to four Chefs namely: Sin Leong, Hooi Kok Wai, the late Tham Mui Kai, and Lau Yoke PuiAuthor© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/madras-new-woodlands/:['For me, when it comes to comfort food, Indian vegetarian food has never failed to hit the spot. And my favourite any time of the day (or night) is Madras New Woodlands.I usually go there in the evenings. While this air-conditioned restaurant serves both South and North Indian food, many of the diners there tend to order dishes from the South.By 6.45pm, the place will start to fill up. This restaurant is mainly frequented by locals but you’ll also find some expats, and maybe a tourist or two.Unlike its sister establishment Madras Woodlands Ganga Restaurant, which offers fine dining, this eatery has a more casual air about it — one that I enjoy immensely.I often end up ordering the Madras thali (food platter) with briyani. At S$6.50, the dish is a real bargain.What sets the thali here apart is the large variety of dishes that make up the food tray. And yes, you also get two pieces of papadam.To accompany the lightly-flavoured briyani rice, your dish comes with nine other items, ranging from yoghurt to payasam (a soupy milk-based dessert that’s lightly flavoured with saffron and contains sago pearls as well as strips of vermicelli).This includes rasam (thin sour-and-hot gravy), dhal (a thick lentil gravy), sambar (a light vegetable dish chockfull of spices), as well as a variety of other vegetable dishes. The vegetable dishes change daily; on one occasion, I was served a delicious cauliflower stewed in a green puree, cabbage, and eggplant concoction.Unlike North Indian food, which is less spicy and contains much more milk, thali from the South is less milky and thus lighter on the palate. The usual spices such as turmeric, cumin, cardamom, fennel, cloves and cinnamon play a big part here.Of course, no Indian vegetarian meal would be complete without some paper thosai (S$2.70). Here, it is accompanied by a range of chutneys, one of which is the coconut chutney. Made from fermented rice paste, it is delicate yet fluffy and tart, which is likely a result of the fermentation process.At Madras New Woodlands, appam (S$3 for two pieces) is freshly made on the spot and is a must-try. A fermented rice pancake with a rich coconutty centre, this concave-shaped snack is crispy and great for munching on in between meals.I also love the eatery’s chaat offerings — popular tea time snacks among ladies in India. Sour, sweet and hot, chaat (S$3.20) are snacks made from pieces of onions and deep fried bits, and sometimes poured all over samosa. These delicious bits and pieces can also be poured over vada (savoury fried snacks), then mixed together into a delicious heap of crunchy goodness.The restaurant also offers a range of Indian sweets and beverages such as mango lassi, banana lassi, badam keer and rose milk along with Madras coffee, masala tea and Madras tea.14 Dickson Road\nNearest MRT station: Rochor\nOpen: Daily (7.30am to 10.30pm)14 Dickson Road\nNearest MRT station: Rochor\nOpen: Daily (7.30am to 10.30pm)Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/watch-live-matches-world-cup/:['The Fifa World Cup returns for its 22nd run and fans are understandably excited. Held in Qatar this year from Nov 20 to Dec 18, it’s the first time the World Cup has been held in an Arab country, which is the reason for the later schedule given that the country’s weather cools in the later part of the year.The football championship, which is held once every four years, will also be reduced to 29 days and will see the previous champions, France, attempt to defend their title.\xa0Nine key matches will be shown on free-to-air channels over national television, but if you want to follow all the matches and soak in the exuberant atmosphere, head to these bars to watch the games over good food and drinks.Kallang Wave Mall, 01-15, 1 Stadium Place\nNearest MRT station: Stadium\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (11am to 1am)With arguably the cheapest drinks promotions you can find at any sports bar, Al Capone’s is fast expanding with 11 outlets across the country.\xa0The Kallang outlet’s proximity to the Singapore Sports Hub means you’ll be in good company among other sports fans who’ve made their way there.Your deal-savvy friends will already have told you about its Mabuk Mondays, where 3L beer towers go for S$29 and a pint of Guinness for S$6.90.\xa0The extensive food menu ranges from typical bar grub such as fish & chips (S$17.90) to pizzas named after the Italian mobster’s associates who were made famous in the 1983 classic film Scarface. These include “The Kid” Sonny Capone (S$13.90 for 9”, S$18.90 for 12”), comprising turkey salami and mozzarella.\xa0The Quayside, 01-15, 60 Robertson Quay\nNearest MRT station: Fort Canning\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (6am to 3am)This Australian sports bar by the scenic Singapore River has been a fixture of the Robertson Quay area since 2008.\xa0Fitted with multiple large LED screens and a projector, the bar is packed to the brim come rugby, cricket and football season. It’s also one of the few bars that open early, which means you’ll get to catch the earlier screenings of the Fifa World Cup here, too.\xa0Although Boomarang is known for its peppered kangaroo loin (S$30), an Aussie specialty hard to find elsewhere in Singapore, the kitchen also whips up classic pub favourites, such as a mean chicken parmigiano (S$25) — fried breaded chicken covered in melted cheese and tomato sauce.\xa0The Arena, 48 Woodleigh Park\nNearest MRT station: Woodleigh\nOpen: Monday and Wednesday (11am to 11pm), Tuesday, Thursday and Friday (11am to 12am), Saturday and Sunday (9.30am to 12am)A football-themed restaurant with origins from the United Kingdom, Cafe Football Singapore is truly a place for soccer fans, especially those of team Manchester United. Former players Ryan Giggs and Gary Neville are co-owners of the franchise.The first outlet at Woodleigh continues to be a favourite with sports fans, thanks to the multiple large television screens. The World Cup will also be screened at the Genting Hotel Jurong outlet for those in the west.From the wall decor to the menu, everything here is inspired by the game. Memorabilia on the walls include framed signed jerseys of famous players and their shoes, while the menu is split into While You Decide (light bites), Defence (appetisers) and Attack (mains).The grub here ranges from local food such as Referee Kayu (S$13) — chicken satay — to more English offerings such as Good for Giggsy (S$19) — braised lamb shank with mashed potatoes.9 Emerald Hill\nNearest MRT station: Somerset\nOpen: Monday to Thursday (3pm to 2am), Friday (3pm to 3am), Saturday (2pm to 3am), and Sunday (2pm to 2am)Priding themselves on pouring the coldest pint of beer from the tap, the folks at Ice Cold Beer have been doing what they do best for more than 20 years.\xa0The last in the row of shophouses at Emerald Hill, the bar is bright and buzzy, illuminated by neon signage and big television screens. Beer, as its name suggests, is the choice of drink here with 60 different brews on tap and in bottles.\xa0Its food menu is shared with its sister establishments, cocktail bar No 5 Emerald Hill and wine bar Que Pasa, next door but with a more casual slant.\xa0Crowd favourites include its famous chicken wings marinated in shrimp paste and Chinese wine (S$15 for a half-portion, or S$22 for a full portion), Ice Cold Beer pizza (S$24) that’s topped with fresh prawns and pesto tomato sauce and spicy o shells (S$20) that are essentially top shell mixed in belachan, chillies, lime juice and raw shallots.\xa0Claymore Connect, 01-02/05, 442 Orchard Road\nNearest MRT station: Orchard\nOpen: Monday to Thursday (3pm to 12am), Friday (11.30am to 12am), Saturday and Sunday (12pm to 12am)A stalwart of Irish pubs in Singapore, Muddy Murphy’s is one of the oldest and most well-known among fans of freshly poured Guinness from the tap.\xa0The tavern-themed decor might come across as a little kitschy, but that’s all part of the charm. There are seven beers on tap and the expected bar bites of HJK chicken wings (S$16) — chicken wings marinated in shrimp paste — and bacon-wrapped sausages (S$13) to go with them.The bar opens at 3pm, so you can catch the Fifa World Cup matches a little earlier in the day and even stay for dinner. Mains are surprisingly well done, especially our favourite — a beef & Guinness pie (S$22).\xa0EDITOR’S NOTE: This article has been updated to reflect the latest opening hours and food prices at Ice Cold Beer.Al Capone’s Kallang, Boomarang Bistro & Bar, Cafe Football Singapore, and Muddy Murphy’s are on GrabFood.

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/cny-takeaway-goodies/:['Let’s be honest, one of the best parts of Chinese New Year (CNY) is the snacks. Who can get enough of the addictive bak kwa (sliced barbecued pork), love letters, pineapple tarts and more? We see you reaching for another portion — even after you’ve wolfed down an entire tin in one sitting.\xa0Well, new year’s resolutions can wait, because we’re ready to start the CNY feasting. So put on your stretchiest pants or comfiest dress, and let’s dive into our recommendations on where to get the most delectable CNY snacks.People’s Park Food Centre, 01-1010, 32 New Market Road\nOpen: Saturday to Monday (10am to 6pm)Bee Kim Heng is a family-run bak kwa stall located at People’s Park Food Centre. It was established in 1951 by Teo Ah Thin who, today, has more than 70 years of experience grilling bak kwa.\xa0It sells only three items: Original sliced pork bak kwa (S$64 per kilogram), spicy sliced pork bak kwa (S$68 per kilogram) and gold coin bak kwa (S$64 per kilogram). Each piece of bak kwa is barbecued over charcoal, imbuing it with delectable, smoky flavours.Prices are expected to increase in the lead-up to CNY, so remember to place orders early. Orders can be placed via 8852 9921 or by visiting its store.\xa0Do also note that from now until the lead-up to CNY, Bee Kim Heng will be operating every day from 10am to 6pm.\xa0What to order: Original sliced pork bak kwa (S$64 per kilogram)4 Jalan Pisang\xa0\nOpen: Monday and Tuesday, Thursday to Saturday (10am to 5pm)Best known for its old-school cakes, Uncle Lee Confectionery proves that newer isn’t necessarily better.\xa0Uncle Lee, the head baker behind all goodies, has been baking since the 1980s. He has acquired a strong following for his nostalgic local bakes, with many customers having grown up eating his confectionery when he was head baker at the now-defunct Hock Ann Confectionery.Uncle Lee Confectionery has only a handful of snacks available this new year: Butter cookies (S$20), love letters (S$22), kueh bangkit (S$20), peanut biscuit (S$18) and jau gok peanut puff dumpling (a type of sweet fried dumpling, S$25).The jau gok peanut puff dumplings are a traditional Chinese New Year treat. Each piece is shaped to resemble gold ingots, signifying good fortune. However, it isn’t as easily found as treats such as pineapple tarts or bak kwa – a perfect CNY gift to relatives and friends who enjoy something unique but still traditional.What to order: Jau gok peanut puff dumpling (a type of sweet fried dumplings, S$25), love letters (S$22), butter cookies (S$20)409 River Valley Road\xa0\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (8am to 9.15pm)Culture Spoon is a multi-concept kitchen that serves multiple menus by chefs, bakers and foodpreneurs under one roof.

A combination we’ve never heard of, its interesting silhouette and the addition of spice adds a touch of warmth to the sweet pastry.\xa0And while we’ve all heard of almond cookies and pineapple balls, what of almond pillows (S$33) and juicy pineapple pillows (S$33)? Rather than shaping these as round orbs with a slightly flattened bottom, Bread and Butter Bakehouse shapes these in an oblong form.

It’s one of the few bakeries that’s halal-certified, vegetarian and vegan-friendly, so its CNY goodies can be enjoyed by all.We’re fans of its green pea cookies (from S$8.50), a melt-in-your-mouth cookie that has a slightly crunchy exterior. Think of it as a peanut or almond cookie, but nut-free.Those willing to pull out all the stops for your CNY gifts can take a look at its Steps to Prosperity (S$148) bundle.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/chinese-regional-food-guide/:['We know the internet’s a vast and mysterious place — one that can be mean-spirited at times and surprisingly wholesome at others.\xa0For globetrotter Jani Patokallio, who found his travel plans grounded by the pandemic, it certainly pulled through in spades.An avid traveller and foodie, he embarked on a journey to discover Chinese dishes of all kinds here in Singapore and eat his way through them. It took him three years to complete it, harnessing the power of the internet through social media platform Reddit.His journey included street eats, obscure hole-in-the-wall finds and Michelin-starred restaurants, encompassing a whopping 112 restaurants from 2020 to late 2022.Speaking to HungryGoWhere in an email interview, Patokallio, who works in the tech sector, says: “I love food in all its forms, especially finding new tasty things.”Here’s how he did it.Those of us familiar with the scale and diversity of Chinese culture and cuisine will know that this was no easy feat.\xa0After all, there’s no uniform, ubiquitous dish that’s quintessentially Chinese. For many of us, neither chicken rice nor mala hotpot is more “Chinese”. They simply come from different traditions, histories and dialect groups.Using the Chinese government’s administrative divisions as a framework, Patokallio, who declined to reveal his age, divided the endeavour into more than 30 regions. These included provinces and special administrative regions, and he also made tweaks of his own.He acknowledges he’s oversimplified certain aspects of the cuisine and history, because it would otherwise be too complex to unpack meaningfully.As for what inspired him to start this project, Patokallio initially had plans to travel to China for business in 2020. The pandemic thwarted them.\xa0“(It was) a combination of frustration at not being able to travel and the realisation that there was a whole world of interesting new food sitting right here in Singapore that I knew criminally little about,” he says.He had a few guidelines for the process, prioritising street or “simple” food, instead of fine-dining eateries. He even included retail products, snacks and instant noodles.\xa0The list does include some high-end restaurants, such as the two-Michelin-starred Shisen Hanten, but these are in the minority.The internet was his primary source of information for this quest, but as he found out, not much was available.\xa0Says Patokallio: “Many of these places, especially the smaller hawker-type ones, are not even listed on Google Maps, (food-delivery platforms), etc. There’s a parallel universe of Chinese sites like 华新 (Huasing) and 小红书 (Xiaohongshu) and delivery services like 唐人街外卖 (Delivery Chinatown), but none of it shows up unless you search in Chinese.”He crowdsourced suggestions from Reddit, and even started a Telegram group for organising dinners with fellow foodies and translators.“Virtually all the people who actually knew what they were talking about were first- or second-generation migrants from mainland China, who had grown up eating the ‘real thing’,” he says.Relying on suggestions, translators and tour guides from the r/singapore Reddit community, Patokallio began his hunt in early 2020.He spent a few weeks on each region, visiting several eateries in each chapter — or episode, as he calls it — before documenting the experience on his travel blog Drifting Clouds.\xa0In all, Patokallio estimates he’s spent at least a few hundred hours on the project.He’d also roped in friends and family for the ride, with his wife and children weighing in on the project from time to time.\xa0“(My wife) was bemused by my level of obsession, but she’s a foodie, too, and was usually more than happy to tag along.“My Chinese friends were also more than happy to share what they knew, but unfortunately, Covid-19 (safe-distancing) restrictions made it really difficult to bring them along for much of the time.”It took him almost three years to document all the regional cuisines, before wrapping up the process in December 2022, a mere 10 days before he was due to leave Singapore for his current home in Australia.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Junction Westgate opening with promos; will house 23 tenants, including new halal teppanyaki\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50% off at picturesque date spots, including Wildseed Cafe at The Alkaff Mansion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMatching eateries to each cuisine took a good deal of effort, as certain regional dishes transcended geographical boundaries, while other regions defied easy classification.Some cuisines were easier finds than others.\xa0For example, the Fujian province — where many of Singapore’s Hokkien, Hakka, Fuzhou and other communities can trace their roots back to — is naturally home to a repertoire of cultural cuisines.\xa0There is, by extension, a mind-boggling array of eats from this region alone. Just think: Hokkien mee, bak kut teh (pork-rib soup), kong bak pau (braised pork buns), ban mian (egg noodle soup)… the list runs on.By contrast, it was a challenge to locate some less popular cuisines.For one thing, Covid-19 had forced a number of eateries to shut.\xa0In some instances, dishes that traditionally use ingredients such as blood products — which are banned for import into Singapore — were either replaced or not sold here.\xa0Other eateries served dishes only loosely inspired by the original.The resulting guide includes household names such as Putien, hole-in-the-wall eateries, and even some tucked away in industrial canteens.In some cases, Patokallio was unable to get “the real thing”, resorting to instant products or home-cooked meals.This was particularly the case for Guizhou cuisine. According to Patokallio, there were no specialty restaurants in Singapore that he could locate. That was until Samantha Ting, 29, a private dining chef specialising in the cuisine, read about the project and reached out to offer her help in the form of a privately cooked feast.Ting says: “There really isn’t much Guizhou food in Singapore — which is why I started cooking my own in the first place — and I wanted to offer what I could, even if it was a home-style, adapted-based-on-available-ingredients version of it.”Patokallio adds: “I was drawing a complete blank on Guizhou food, so Sam definitely saved my bacon there!”He, unfortunately, missed out on items such as river snail soup — although he did try the instant version.The process also saw a number of fusion dishes, such as Tsui Wah’s Swiss chicken wings (for Hong Kong) and various others influenced by neighbouring regions — from parts of Southeast Asia and Korea to Japan and even Russia.As a whole, though, the project became an exercise in codifying not just cultural Chinese food, but Singapore’s untold hawker histories and food trends.In his Hainanese-food chapter, Patokallio writes: “I started writing this blog to learn more about Chinese food, but with this episode more than any other, I think I’ve learnt about Singapore instead.”Will he write another guide in the future? “I’ve toyed with the idea — Indian (cuisine) being the obvious option in Singapore — but I think I’ll take a break first!” he says.\xa0Check out the latest on Haidilao and our review of Aisyah Restaurant.Book a ride to any of the eateries mentioned in this story.AuthorJia-En has worn several hats in her career — first writing TV scripts, then food and lifestyle stories at Wine & Dine.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/seng-kee-black-chicken-herbal-soup/:['Seng Kee may be known for its black herbal chicken and tze char items such as crab been hoon at the Changi Road branch, but it is the kidney mee sua that charmed its loyal fans at its Kaki Bukit stall.Truth is, I am no pork kidney lover. I find its part rubbery, part crunchy texture quite off putting. But I tried it anyway because most of the diners at the hawker centre were eating the kidney mee sua, which happens to be one of its signature dishes.The kidney mee sua ($5.00) arrived in a non-descript red bowl. It was covered with a dark, thick soup which emitted a herbal aroma. When scooped up, there were generous portions of neatly cut up pieces of pork kidney and lean pork slices.If you like your soup herbal and slightly peppery, this would be the perfect choice on a rainy day. The herbal taste was not so overpowering so you could still taste the pork kidney and pork slices in it. The best part of the dish was the mee sua. It was silky smooth but not soggy.If kidneys are not your cup of tea, you can try the pig organ soup or lean meat soup ($3.50/$4.50/$5.00) which is just as tasty and fragrant. This is especially if you do not like a ‘porky’ aftertaste in your broth.Many customers are also here for the other tonic soups such as ginseng black chicken, ginseng pig brain, and pig trotter vinegar—dishes so rare you may only find in grandma’s kitchen today.\nSeng Kee Black Chicken Herbal SoupBlk 511 Bedok North Street 3\n#01-31/32 Kaki Bukit 511 Market and Food Centre\nOpening hours: Daily: 5pm-4amAuthor© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/best-fish-and-chips/:['These days, fish and chips is very much a part of our local cuisine. From hawker centres to restaurants, this much-loved dish is available nearly everywhere.However, due to localisation, the preparation of fish and chips in Singapore may not stay true to the authentic British version. Traditionally, the fish is dipped in batter, not breadcrumbs. Some places here use American-style French fries or shoestring fries, but British chips are significantly thicker. Also, in England, they sprinkle salt and malt vinegar over fish and chips, something which we don’t normally do here.Here’s where you can find the most authentic and best-tasting Brit-style fish and chips in Singapore, tried and tested!\xa0Molly Malone’s\xa0famous fish & chipWhat we like: Mildly seasoned yet flavourful on its ownAddress: 56 Circular RoadOpening hours:\xa0mon-thurs: 11am-12am, fri:11am-3am, sat:12pm-3am, sun: closedRating: 4/5Molly Malone’s is the first Irish pub to open in Singapore. Though we usually associate Irish stew with Irish cuisine, Molly Malone’s best-selling dish is English fish and chips.Why is it such a crowd favourite? Probably because it consistently tastes awesome and offers good value! Each order comprises four reasonably large pieces of battered fish and a side of chips. The flaky, juicy fish is mildly seasoned and is rather flavourful on its own. Gorgeously golden, the batter could be a little thinner, but is sufficiently light and not oily.Their thick-cut fries are also superbly executed. Wide and flat, they are incredibly fluffy on the inside, and manage to stay crispy and grease-less on the outside.Tartare sauce and ketchup is served, but malt vinegar has to be requested for.\xa0Muddy Murphy’s\xa0Fish N Chips\xa0What we like: Light and crispy on the outside, moist and tender on the insideAddress:\xa0442 Orchard Road #01-02 to 05, Claymore Connect SingaporeOpening hours:\xa0Sun-thurs: 11am-1am , fri-sat: 11am-2amRating: 3.5/5Here’s another Irish pub that serves more-than-decent fish and chips!Although our battered fish was slightly over-browned, it had a lot of potential. The batter was thin, light, and crispy, while the fish was very moist and tender. However, the batter was a tad oily. This lack of temperature control is probably more of an occasional oversight than a regular occurrence.The chips were better executed, remaining crisp till the end of the meal. One bonus here is the serving of mushy peas, which is a traditional British accompaniment to fish and chips. Other condiments served are tartare sauce, ketchup, and malt vinegar.\xa0We finished off our meal with a tall glass of Coca-Cola.\xa0Smiths Authentic British Fish And ChipsWhat we like: Batter coating is thin and lightAddress: 271 Bukit Timah Road, #01-02 Balmoral Plaza SingaporeOpening hours: Daily:\xa011.30am-10.15pmRating: 3/5This fish and chips specialty shop claims to serve authentic British fish and chips. They have the widest choice of fish, including cod, haddock, and plaice – which are most commonly used in Britain for fish and chips.Although the batter coating is thin and light, it is also limp and very greasy. We were also not very impressed with their fish. Our haddock was dry and stringy. The singular piece of fish was rather smallish in size.As for the chips, they aren’t the usual variety that we’re used to. This version is more like hand-cut fried potatoes. The exterior is not dry and crisp; rather it’s quite oily and limp. Some of us didn’t like it at first, but the rich taste of the potato slowly grew on us. It tasted especially good doused in malt vinegar.Though they claim to be authentic British fish and chips, there’s no point being authentic if the food fails to impress our tastebuds. Considering that this is a self-serve joint — with plastic cutlery and food wrapped in paper – prices are on the steep side if you choose more expensive fish like cod and halibut.inSing.com made anonymous visits and paid its own meals at the eateries featured here.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/minced-mixed-noodle/:['Run by two ladies who have been operating at Old Airport Road Food Centre for the past decade, Minced Mixed Noodle has been attracting a healthy crowd for their version of bak chor mee soup, soupy minced pork noodles — a dish popular in the east-side of Singapore.This stall follows the original rendition of the dish which has minced pork dumplings (bak giao) and minced pork swimming in a bowl of noodles and stock. The dish is almost the same as made by another stall at Upper Changi Road — 58 Minced Meat Mee, but the two stalls are not related.The minced pork here is nicely executed with a soft texture and a healthy amount of chopped up pork fat which ends up swimming in the broth.The noodles come reasonably springy and the broth has a nice rounded savoury flavour with a moderate stock taste and lots of fried garlic and spring onions flavours which are thrown into the soup before it is served.The dumplings are decently done, filled with minced pork flavoured with tee po (dried sole fish). It’s freshly made every morning but the flavours are a little light on the pepper and the tee po.They do a dry noodle rendition which mixes sweet tomato ketchup and the savouriness and spiciness taking a bit of a backseat. A mix of fried onion, fried garlic and lard oils are thrown in for good measure.The flavours are decent but for some reason the soup on the side is a bit plain as a consequence. The broth for the soup version is better.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/roast-paradise/:['Though only established in 2015, Roast Paradise has quickly built up the reputation as having one of the best char siu offerings in Singapore.The business now has four outlets spread across Singapore — Old Airport Road, Lau Pa Sat, Tampines and Killiney Road — but the stall at Old Airport Road Food Centre was where they began.Started by Kai Koh and Randall Gan, 32 and 29 respectively, they left their jobs in the nightlife and events industry to apprentice under Kai’s uncle, Bill Khoon who owns the renowned Famous Seremban Favourites in Kuala Lumpur.Khoon is famous for his Kuala Lumpur-style char siu and Hakka noodles.Even though they had no culinary experience, Kai and Randall apprenticed under Khoon for a year before starting Roast Paradise.The results speak for itself. The char siu is the main highlight, with a nice mix of pork fat and juicy soft meat. The flavour is a nice balance between savoury and sweet, and not too intense. Sometimes, you’ll encounter meat which is a bit chewier but with a nice caramelised burnt roastiness on the outside.For additional flavour, they serve a “char siu sauce” on the side. Likely the marinating sauce for the char siu, the flavour is intensely salty and sweet so add it with restraint.A small note of interest, the stall sign has the words “since 1970” written on it. It doesn’t refer to when the business started but it is the approximate date when the char siu recipe was first conceptualised in Kuala Lumpur.The other highlight here are the Hakka Noodles — egg noodles dressed in a savoury stock sauce and topped off with minced meat. The taste is light but add in the sambal chilli, which is full of oil richness and dried prawn flavour and the overall flavour becomes wonderfully savoury. You can opt to have the noodles with just plain minced meat or add some roast pork or char siu on top.A minor plus point is that they offer free soup on the side and it has a decent rounded savouriness.There are some other elements which could use more tweaking, like the siu yok (roast pork). The meat is tender and moist but the crispness of the skin could be more compelling.The oil and stock-rich rice, commonly found in Hainanese chicken rice, is used at this stall but can be inconsistent — sometimes a little mushy, sometimes a little too firm.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/fatty-ox-kitchen/:['Located in a tucked away corner of Chinatown Complex is Fatty Ox Kitchen, an authentic Cantonese noodle shop which executes its dishes very authentically, thanks to it’s Hong Kong-born chef Cheung Sun Kwai.\xa0Now in his 60s, Cheung moved to Singapore in the 1980s and started selling Hong Kong roasts in a coffeeshop at Pagoda Street in 1986.\xa0Most veteran foodies will remember his restaurant, Fatty Ox Hong Kong Roast Duck, which opened in 1991 at Murray Terrace before closing shop in 2007. After a brief stint in a North Bridge coffeeshop for a year or two, he moved to Chinatown Complex in 2011 and has been there ever since.Unlike other roast meat stalls at the Complex, you won’t see a roasting furnace here as the roasting of the meats are done at a dedicated hawker stall a few doors away.\xa0Fatty Ox has received numerous rave reviews as many of its dish offerings are of an impressively high standard.Especially noteworthy are the Beef Brisket noodles (ngou lam; $4), arguably one of the best you can buy in Chinatown. Meat chunks and tendons are extremely well-marinated with a deep dark soy flavour that has penetrated right through and the textures are soft and tender. This is especially true of the tendons which have a seriously good melt-in-your-mouth stickiness.\xa0The accompanying thin egg noodles have a noticeable alkaline smell, typical of many Hong Kong noodles, but with a nice slight savoury dried scallop flavour and are nicely springy with bite.They are dressed with the brisket braising sauce which has surprisingly balanced flavours — slight herbal notes, a present dark soy flavour and a restrained saltiness , complementing the savoury noodle flavour.\xa0Their sui gao (dumplings) soup or in noodles ($3) are also another must order as the dumplings are big and filled to the brim with lots of juicy minced pork, chopped prawns, crunchy black fungus, water chestnuts and spring onions. They are also priced lowerOn every table, you’ll also see deep-fried ngoh hangs which are lightly battered and are impressively huge with lots of juicy minced pork, water chestnuts and no fillers.\xa0Chinatown Complex is very competitive when it comes to soya sauce chicken and Fatty Ox is easily one of the top stalls to go to for the dish, but whether you’ll prefer it over the other heavyweights like the Michelin-starred Liao Fan or Maria Virgin Chicken, depends on how you like your soya sauce chicken.The texture of the chicken is decently soft but we’ve had it softer in other stalls.\xa0The marinate is also rather light with a slight sweetness and a restrained saltiness. You’d expect the chicken skin to be full of flavour and soaked with the marinade but here it isn’t so.It only makes sense as it is eaten in conjunction with the ginger and scallion oil mixture which they pour on top and it provides enough savoury and oil-rich flavour in every bite.It’s a signature move for the stall and you’ll see plenty of orders for it on any given day.Other highlight are their sambal chilli sauce on the side made with large chopped dried chillies. It has an interesting slight sour savoury smoky spicy taste. The soup is also well done with no msg and a nice rounded flavour.\xa0Unfortunately, their other dishes can be a bit of a hit and miss.Their roast ducks used to be a big draw but they are inconsistently done. On a good day, it comes with nice crispy skin but the meat is a little too dry most of the time.It’s the same case for their char siu, which doesn’t come with a lot of red colouring. On some days, we’ve had it nicely caramelised and impressively juicy with enough fat thrown in but on other days, too dry for our likes.The also offer a very interesting Prosperity Basin Dish (poon choi) which can be had with whole abalone ($200) and sliced abalone ($120). It comes with a myriad of 12 ingredients that span the range from braised pork yam and roast duck to pig skin and cabbage.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/overseas-restaurant/:['It was with bated breath and rapt anticipation that we visited the recently opened outpost of Overseas Restaurant in Singapore. After 34 years in business, the Overseas Restaurant empire has close to 10 outlets in Malaysia and is clearly the country’s pre-eminent Cantonese restaurant. Over the years, this feisty Cantonese restaurant chain has also become a de rigour food stop for Singaporeans travelling across the causeway.Never mind that Overseas Restaurant Singapore (“Overseas”) is tucked away in a prosaic corner of the nondescript Shaw Tower. If we are willing to endure a 5-hour drive into Kuala Lumpur for dinner, we can certainly live with the minor inconvenience of trudging through an insipid mall.Inside, Overseas sits 230, relatively large by Singapore standard but dwarfs in comparison to her Malaysian stable mates; her Ipoh outlet, for instance, sits a staggering 1,200 people. Her cramped-up interior is contemporarily formulaic with crimson carpets, neutral-toned damask tablecloths and orchid-painted wall panels.The menu, which features more than 100 dishes, closely replicates the mother brand’s with classic signatures of their famed char siew, steamed bamboo fish in light soya sauce broth and braised pork belly with salted fish.During our visit on a busy Sunday dinner, we resisted the restaurant’s nudging towards the lacklustre – and overpriced – set meals and opted for the a la carte instead.Overseas’ char siew ($50 per large portion), apparently a ‘must have’, is a dish of pork rib eye roasted with a thick coat of malt sugar and honey, then grilled until slightly charred and utterly sticky, glossy and sweet. But truth be told, this char siew is only as good as our favourite hawker char siew haunt, and not so spectacular to justify a $50 price tag. Even then, the staff should have asked before upsizing our char siew order to the $50 portion when a medium sized serving ($30 per medium portion) would have sufficed for our group of six. Ditto to the roast pork belly ($10 per serving); yes, we like its subtly salty and crispy crackling but this is, at best, on par with a good hawker find. The staff, again, took liberty with our order and gave us 2 portions when we only needed one.By then, we’ve spent a whopping $70 on char siew and roast pork alone.Running neck-to-neck in popularity rating to the char siew is Overseas’ bamboo fish prepared to your liking – either steamed in soya sauce or deep-fried. Our 1.2kg bamboo fish ($132) was deep-fried and, like those at Crystal Jade restaurants, expectedly flavoursome and crunchy with heaps of shredded spring onions in a soya sauce bath. But while the fish did not totally knock our socks off, the price did.\xa0 At $110 per 1kg, Overseas’ bamboo fish is priced 30% above the $85 per 1kg price tag at the posh Crystal Jade Golden Palace. Based on cost alone, some will consider this a brazen rip-off.But price was not our only gripe. The coup de grâce landed towards the conclusion of our dinner when a staff quietly crept up to inform us that 2 of our orders – the steamed bean curd with fish paste and dessert of Shanghai pancakes – were out. Fortunately, we were nicely stuffed after clearing the ensuing plates of stir-fried venison ($35 for large serving) with loads of spring onions and sliced ginger as well as Overseas’ signature fried rice ($18 for large serving) with cubed yam bits and crisp rice cracklings.We admire Overseas’ ambition to penetrate the Singapore market. But is this a lofty attempt to zero in on the big moneymaking crowd from the close-by integrated resort? The food quality at Overseas pales in comparison to her Malaysian siblings, where a meal probably costs half as much. Now that we have quenched our thirst for the novelty of dining here, we’re content with returning to Crystal Jade.\xa0Ratings:Food: 3/5Service: 3/5Ambience: 3/5Value: 2/5\xa0Overseas Restaurant100 Beach Road#01-27 to #01-37 Shaw Leisure GalleryTel: 6294 2638Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/soon-heng-silver-stream-rojak/:['One of the most famous hawkers in Toa Payoh, this stall is very popular for its well executed value-for-money rojak but that said it is a rojak that won’t appeal to everyone.Founded by Chow Kam Seng, now in his 50s, Kam Seng became a pushcart rojak seller in 1988 right after his National Service and is currently located at Gourmet Paradise, a food court situated at HDB Hub, Toa Payoh.At Soon Heng Silver Stream Rojak (it’s proper full-form name), there is always a consistent queue at this stall no matter the time of the day and it is because this stall gets most aspects of a rojak right plus they give you huge portions for the price ($3.50/4.50/5.50/6.50).All the essential ingredients you’d expect from a rojak are present — youtiao (dough fritters), mang kwang (radish), kang kong, jellyfish, cucumber, bean sprouts, pineapple and tau pok (tofu puffs).\nThe important prawn paste is imported from Penang and they use a liberal amount so that gives the rojak a very dominant earthy taste.There is a slight tangy taste and the flavour of ginger flower here is noticeable, which is unusual for a lot of rojak sellers but unfortunately the sugar over-dominates the flavour, so if you’re averse to overly sweet rojak sauces, ask for the sugar to be held back.\nThe other plus point is that they put raw jellyfish no matter the price and they always have a nice soft freshness to it.\nTurnip and cucumber pieces are always fresh and crunchy and while they unfortunately use factory-supplied peanuts, they give you so much of it that it covers the whole plate.\nTheir youtiao (dough fritter) pieces come nice and crispy but they give you so much of it that it turns the rojak into a fried fritter dish instead of what it is supposed to be — an Asian salad.Youtiao fanatics will love it but for those who aren’t, request for it to be held back.If you’re eating alone, the base $3.50 is more than sufficient and if you’re a large eater, you can upp the order to $4.50 but it’s such a huge portion that it really stretches the limits of most appetites.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

Alternatively, you could sip some tea together with the foam, like we did, for a more toned down flavour.Next, we got to try the Green Tea with Strawberry Milk Foam which introduces a fun twist that\xa0adds a fresh fruitiness to their usual range of brewed teas.Our take is that the foam itself tastes like strawberry ice cream, with a touch of salt at the end. When mixed with the green tea, the bittersweet taste was refreshing for our taste buds.Overall, we felt that the strawberry milk foam was a more exciting and well-balanced choice without being too sweet either. It is a must-try.The Brown Sugar Milk Foam and Strawberry Milk Foam atop the fresh-brewed tea drinks (AlisanTea, Oolong Tea, Green Tea and Black Tea) are available at all the Gong Cha outlets in two sizes – regular (500ml) and large (700ml).The Brown Sugar Milk Foam tea drinks cost $4.00 for a regular cup and $5.00 for a large cup. You can get the Strawberry Milk Foam tea drinks at $3.40 for a regular cup and $4.40 for a large cup.From Oct 15\xa0onwards, you can get the drinks via islandwide delivery on GrabFood, Foodpanda and Deliveroo.\xa0While enjoying your freshly brewed bubble tea choices, choose to go for a no plastic straw option by bringing your own reusable straw.For more information, visit\xa0https://www.gong-cha-sg.com/Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/lotus-kitchen/:['Nestled in the corner of Chinatown Point, just two restaurants down from Michelin restaurant, Song Fa Bak Kut Teh, is Lotus Kitchen which is quietly attracting a loyal crowd.Lotus Kitchen is a new conceptual restaurant from Lotus Vegetarian Restaurant, which\xa0is at Quality Hotel Marlow. They boast premium ingredients and herbs such as lion’s mane mushrooms, which apparently only the emperor could eat back in the day.However, what is most interesting about Lotus Kitchen are the unique takes on and impressions of classic dishes. With inspirations from Peking Duck, Laksa and even Satay, Lotus Kitchen looks to provide a different dining experience.When we first heard Vegetarian Peking Duck, we did a double take. Vegetarian Peking… what? Lo and behold, the dish was good and reminiscent of Peking Duck.Named the Signature Summer Wrap with Passionfruit ($35.80), Lotus Kitchen uses crisp soya slices which are coated in batter to mimic the flavour and texture of Peking duck.We wrapped up the soya slices along with carrots, cucumbers and passion fruit strips and dipped it with their homemade sweet bean paste sauce. And boy was it bursting with layers of flavours.The passion fruit strips gave it a nice tangy touch, but the star of the dish was certainly the soya slices. The batter gave it a slight crunchiness, and surprisingly the taste and texture were similar to that of Peking duck.The wrap along with the strips made it a cohesive dish with all the elements similar to that of the Peking duck, but just give us those soya slices with that sauce and we’re good to go.\xa0The next meat rendition is Lotus Kitchen’s Spicy Grilled Oat Slices in Hotplate ($18.80).If you love for your dishes to have that spicy kick, definitely look out for this “fish” when you’re there.The oat slices were very smooth, and Lotus Kitchen’s blended chilli certainly had a kick to it.\xa0Without an iota of doubt in my mind, Lotus Kitchen’s Braised Mushroom in Hot Stone Pot ($18.80) has to be the best dish we tried that day. Just hearing the sizzling of the stone pot when it was being served whetted our appetites.Lion’s mane and shiitake mushroom, along with bamboo shoots were stir-fried with chilli and ginger before added to the stone pot lined with basil leaves.The mushrooms were juicy and bursting with natural umami, the chilli gave it a little spice, which is always good.After having this dish, we understood why only the emperor could have it centuries ago.\xa0Their Signature Double-boiled Herbal Tian Ma Soup ($8.80) was surprisingly very flavourful despite the broth base not being from chicken, pork or fish.The herbal flavour was indeed pronounced as the soup is steamed and brewed with over ten herbs.Lotus Kitchen is also doing their version of local favourites – laksa and satay.\xa0Lotus Kitchen’s Signature Stir Fried Laksa ($9.80) is definitely a rare dish in Singapore.Usually enjoyed with soup, Lotus Kitchen has decided to stir fry their laksa with their in-house gravy, and it tasted like the real deal.The addition of seaweed to the dish gave it a little crunch and saltiness.\xa0The Signature Homemade Satay ($15.80) was really the only downer of the menu that we tried.The satay was made with soya slices with more than ten fragrant spices, but it tasted sweet more than anything. When tacked on with pineapples on the side, there was just an overpowering of sweetness.The gravy is usually what makes or breaks any satay dish, and unfortunately, their homemade satay sauce wasn’t any good.Compared to the other dishes, this was a letdown.\xa0If you’re looking for dim sum, the Taro Mee Sua Cake ($6.80) and Lion’s Mane Mushroom Pan-fried Dumpling ($8.80 for six pieces) are two that are worth trying.Overall, Lotus Kitchen doles out delicious vegetarian food, albeit at slightly higher prices.If it’s your pay day and you’ve decided to go green, give the new Lotus Kitchen a look.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/terra-tokyo-italian/:['Italian food has a reputation of being all about excesses — mention Italian and hefty pizzas, cream-laden pastas, and hearty Bolognese immediately come to mind. At Terra Tokyo Italian, the lusty cuisine of the boot-shaped country is transformed under the deft hands of a Japanese chef. The food here is neither fusion nor is it grandmother-authentic, but lies in the category of somewhere in between. Sauces are not so rich that you need to gulp wine convulsively to cleanse your palate; portions are dainty so you don’t walk away feeling like you’re in a food coma; the food is not salted with a heavy hand; even the butter that accompanies the focaccia bread basket is light and dreamy.Chef Seita Nakahara was last seen at Enoteca L’Operetta\xa0Clarke Quay, rolling out VPN pizzas and contemporary Italian dishes. After a year of travelling in Japan, he’s resurfaced with the opening of Terra, a low-key restaurant offering Tokyo-Italian cuisine. No pizzas here but omakase menus showcasing the providence of Japan’s lush lands. Think Hokkaido ezo-bafun sea urchin, Salfutu scallops, Kagoshima Wagyu Beef, Hokkaido Mussels and Botan Ebi prawn. The markers of Italian cuisine are all there with classic dishes like bucatini with homemade pancetta ($24), steaks grilled in Florentine style, and acqua pazza (poached fish in herbed broth).With three omakase set menus ($128, $168, $208) to choose from, mine ($168)\xa0started with a raw Botan prawn with a dot of fresh tomato sauce, homemade capsicum pickle, and a nest of tiny green Botan prawn eggs; a little more sauce would have helped to mitigate the brininess of the prawn. Next: the mackerel done in a carpaccio style was quite fishy and even the smoky eggplant and dill it was served with couldn’t save the dish. Suffice to say, I was not crazy about the carpaccio appetisers. Unless you’re a sashimi lover, skip the omakase set menus and raw appetisers and head straight for the a la carte mains to make the most out of your experience here.[EDITOR’S PICK ] One dish to try is the pasta with sea urchin from Hokkaido ($38). Each forkful gives you firm strands of al dente spaghetti coated with a seafood bisque-like sauce powered by the rich flavour of prawn, crab, and lobster. Creamy, melt-in-your-mouth Ezobafun uni (sea urchin) provided hits of umami while homemade bottarga is cured with the roe from the milt fish instead of\xa0silver mullet roe, so it’s lighter and less fishy. There’s also just the slightest hint of yuzu to keep the creaminess from getting out of hand.Like a bouillabaisse stew but done in the Italian way, the Acqua Pazza (market price) shows off the bounty of the Japanese sea with a medley of vongole clams, plump Salfutu scallops, an expertly prepared Kimeidai fish, and a marinated olive that packs a punchy flavour. A whisper of herbs, fresh olive oil, and hints of saffron make up the “soup” of this dish.When the steak looks smaller than the sides (in this case half the size of a king oyster mushroom), you wonder if you’re getting your money’s worth. But the Kagoshima grade A4 beef is so rich and perfectly cooked, you don’t need more than a few mouthfuls of it. With a texture similar to tenderloin, the ibochi cut comes from the front thigh of the cow. The smooth tender bites of mushroom came topped with creamy Taleggio cheese sauce.For the finale, a flourless hazelnut cake served with yuzu yogurt, berry coulis, and chocolate was by no means elaborate but perfectly adequate to satisfy the sweet-toothed.Rustic la nonna cooking? That’s not what they’re peddling here. Instead, Italian food here is sophisticated, gently refined, and emphasises seasonality and simplicity.Chef Seita’s Omakase is available for lunch from 12 noon to 3 pm (last order at 2 pm); and\xa0dinner from 6.30 pm to 11 pm (10 pm last order).Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/la-barra/:['Must eats: Ajiaco (potato and chicken soup),\xa0domino with black beans and feta cheese, chicken empandas\xa0Restaurant setting: \xa0We walked around in circles looking for La Barra; it’s perched on a verandah of sorts on level two and accessible only via an open air walkway (if it’s raining, weave your way through the tables at Brotzeit and Senor Taco). Once you find your way in, the brightly coloured furniture and a view of the mall courtyard welcome you. The vibe here is casual and comfortable\xa0– their vibrant red, yellow and blue chairs managed to brighten up even a dull, rainy day. Amidst the array of dining options at Star Vista, La Barra stands out for unique Latin American cuisine meets Colombian street fare, a very first for Singapore.\xa0What to eat: Dive straight in, Colombian fare is new territory but the pictures on the menu do help. We started our meal with a pleasantly robust cappuccino ($4.50) made with organic beans by Colombian brand Juan Valdez. Also great is their selection of Colombian bottled beers, try the Club Colombiana ($12), Aguila ($12) or the lime-flavored Redd’s ($12); which is apparently a hit with the ladies. Food-wise, La Barra has many hits and only a few misses, the arepas (grilled corn flour flat bread) come with several classic toppings and we tried (and liked) the domino with black beans and feta cheese ($9) and the reina with chicken and creamy avocado ($11). The empanadas ($10) are curry puff like corn flour fritters and come with fillings like beef, chicken and cheese. The cheese version was very cloying but the chicken has the right balance of filling and mealy crust. If nibbles to go with your drinks are what you are after, you cannot go wrong with the papas criollas (bite-sized fried potatoes) ($8) but do be adventurous and try the patacones ($6). Green plantains are flattened and deep fried into crisp, yet chewy in the middle, fritters and served with a very complementary hogao (tomato and onion) sauce. All the items we tried are available on their regular menu, however if you are there on a weekend do ask for their specials – a recurring winner on the specials menu is the hearty ajiaco ($26), a potato and chicken soup with a whole corn on the cob immersed in it.\xa0\xa0La Barra | #02-21 The Star Vista, 1 Vista Exchange Green | Tel: 66942495 | Opening hours: Mon-Sun 12noon-11pmAuthor© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/geylang-serai-market/:['With Hari Raya Puasa just around the corner, the re-opening of the Geylang Serai Market could not have come at a better time. Closed in 2006 for upgrading works under the National Environment Agency’s (NEA) Hawker Centres Upgrading Programme, the iconic landmark in the Malay community has once again opened its doors to the public, sporting a brand new look which subtly blends rustic Malay charm with the comforts of modern day dining.\xa0Old world charm in a modern society\nDespite its $18.2 million makeover, Geylang Serai Market still retains much of its Malay heritage, evident in the building’s overall design and layout. Great care was taken when remodeling the Geylang Serai Market to simulate the rustic quality of the old Malay kampong houses and infuse the well-loved “kampong spirit” of yesteryear.The upgraded two-storey market integrates key design elements reminiscent of traditional Malay homes such as sloping roofs, intricate batik motifs as well as decorative details like louvers and timbre panels. There is even an entrance lobby for visitors, designed just like a Malay verandah.\xa0Moving with the times\nStanding tall along Jalan Turi, the new Geylang Serai Market not only captures the essence of the area’s ethnic and cultural heritage, but also boasts a more spacious design, improved ventilation and better hygiene standards. As the old market had been around for over four decades, improving it physical infrastructure as well as its cleanliness and hygiene standards was a main priority for NEA. This, according to an NEA spokesperson, would ensure that stallholders remain competitive against the urbanised retail landscape, while allowing them to provide a variety of food at affordable prices in a clean and hygienic environment.With that in mind, several changes were implemented, ranging from the provision of a mechanical exhaust system for all cooked food stalls to the latest plumbing and sanitary systems to a central freezer and wash area.\xa0New and improved\nUnlike the old market where all stalls were located on one level, the new layout sees a distinct segregation between wet and dry ones. Market stalls are now situated on the ground floor, while the second floor consists of a colourful mix of retail stalls selling household items and clothes as well as cooked food stall.Along with bigger food stalls and wider passage ways, the market also boasts higher ceilings which greatly improve ventilation, a boon on hot days when the place gets packed during lunch time. Fans are installed on most pillars, giving the whole second floor a cooler atmosphere.Pak Hamid, 58, owner of Geylang Briyani Stall (#02-146) gave the new place two thumbs up.\xa0 “I think the new place is better so I am happy. My stall is bigger and I have more space. There is also a good breeze so it’s more cooling during the afternoon,” said the cheerful 58 year-old.\xa0 \xa0\xa0Various access points such as an overhead bridge linking to Joo Chiat Complex, covered drop-off porch and a linkway to the market’s adjoining car park all make for an easier entrance to the new market. The new design is also handicap-friendly with features such as ramps, lifts and handicapped tables.\xa0Reunited and it feels so good\nMoving back in after a 40-month wait, stallholders who were previously housed at a temporary market are looking forward to a new beginning. Putting behind them the food poisoning incident earlier this year when contaminated food from an Indian rojak stall took the lives of two people and left 152 seriously ill, many of the hawkers were excited about the opening and busy getting ready for a surge in business.“We’re finally back to our own land after two years!” exclaimed Miss Wai, whose family owns the popular nasi briyani stall, Haji Mohd Yusof (#02-169). “It’s a new place and people will definitely want to come and see what it is all about. This is good as more people means more business for us,” said the 34 year-old.Another returning favourite is Cendol Geylang Serai (#02-107), which is one of the first stalls to greet customers upon arrival at the second level food corner. “We are much happier because the stalls are bigger and the toilets are cleaner too,” said Faizal, 29, whose family owns the stall. “The new stalls also have an open concept now which is new to us but we will get used to it soon.”With a more spacious dining area and double the seating capacity, it’s no wonder the new market has diners equally excited.\xa0Diners love it too\n“The new market is bigger and more spacious, and it also has better ventilation so its not so hot now compared to last time,” said Hazrie, 16, a student. “I’ll definitely be back!” she said. \xa0A week into the official opening of Geylang Serai Market and most stalls are back in action. The atmosphere is reminiscent of the good old “kampong days” with stallholders and patrons chatting happily. With such a strong display of community spirit, it is clear that the new and improved market scores top marks with hawkers and visitors alike.Summing it up best was Mdm Jaminah, who said “It’s much better now, very clean and not so dirty,” she said. “Last time I was scared to eat here because you can see cockroaches running around but now it is so clean.\xa0 I give it an A star!” said the 47 year-old housewife.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/damon-baehrel/:["Chef Damon Baehrel owns what could quite possibly be the most exclusive restaurant in the world, with a wait list that stretches ten years.Up until recently, Baehrel’s home in the sleepy town of Earlton, New York, about three hours north of Manhattan, was the most sought-after restaurant you’d never heard of.But the power of the internet and social media, combined with old-fashioned word of mouth have transformed the\xa0eponymously named restaurant\xa0and a humble chef into a viral phenomenon, turning the 16-cover basement bistro into perhaps the most exclusive reservation on the planet.Why all the fuss? It’s a combination of factors.Baehrel is not your typical chef. He says he is self-taught. Not from cookbooks penned by Michelin-starred chefs, or globetrotting travels around the world.The ‘Luddite’ –\xa0he doesn’t own a cell phone and shuns the internet –\xa0doesn’t look up YouTube videos or spend marathon weekends watching food TV to come up with pine needle-brined pork cooked in hickory sap, a kind of cookery he calls “native harvest cuisine.”Instead, he watches nature.\xa0INSPIRED BY NATURE“I watch the way nature reveals itself,” he said in an interview.It’s an answer that fails to satisfy the typically quizzical nature of a news reporter.“What do you mean you ‘watch nature?'”His reply speaks volumes, not only about his culinary philosophy, but also about a slew of haute gastronomy trends and issues –\xa0without necessarily meaning to.After watching how pine needles turned his soil acidic, for instance, Baehrel came up with the idea of using the same principle to cure, tenderize and aromatize meats.When he threw a few edible violets into a bowl of steaming broth as a colorful garnish, he also noticed how the leaves and stems lent a thickening effect to the liquid without imparting flavor.“Nature has an answer for everything,” he said.Which is why the chef bristles when his cuisine is mistakenly referred to as molecular gastronomy. Nothing in his food is synthetic and all the ingredients organic.\xa0FLOUR AND OIL FROM SCRATCH\xa0Everything –\xa0from pantry staples like pine flour, acorn oil and vinegars –\xa0is harvested directly from the 12-acre property except salt and seafood, and meats are sourced from a neighboring organic livestock farm.He was a forager of weeds and herbs before Nordic chef René Redzepi turned the word ‘foraging’ into one of the trendiest culinary terms of contemporary gastronomy.Redzepi was credited with launching a worldwide foraging trend for wild and edible weeds when he opened his Copenhagen restaurant Noma, which snagged the title of world’s best restaurant two years running.But Baehrel, who’s been hosting dinner parties out of his licensed basement restaurant for the past 25 years, chuckles and says, “I’ve been doing this probably since before he was born.”What also makes the restaurant so remarkable is that Baehrel is a one-man show. He cooks, serves and hosts the entire meal from start to finish by himself.When guests sit down to their five-hour, 14- to 19-course dinner, they know that every component has been made on-site, from scratch and, in the case of cured meats and homemade flour, often the product of years of work.To make his acorn flour, for example, Baehrel will harvest acorns fallen from red oak trees in the fall and store them in the cellar until the nearby stream has iced over in the winter. After putting them in burlap sacks, he’ll soak them in the stream all winter, allowing the water to soften the acorn tannins and make them more palatable.In the spring, he’ll fish out the sacks, dry out the acorns, and proceed to grind them for flour, or press them for oil.\xa0RISE TO FAMERecognition has been slow in coming for Damon Baehrel over the past 25 years, mostly because the man behind the restaurant never looked for it. He’s never advertised and there is no Facebook page or Twitter account for the restaurant.He preferred to toil quietly on his property and work in tandem with nature. Between curing his own meats, aging his own cheeses, and taking care of his wife and two sons, one of whom lives with autism and cerebral palsy, travel and self-aggrandizement were never a priority.But somewhere along the way, guests began to tell their friends about their unique dining experience.About eight years ago, the restaurant waiting list stretched ahead two years.About three years ago, when guests began posting photos of their meals and sharing their experience online, the wait list expanded to four years.Last year, Baehrel was nominated for a James Beard award in the category of Best Chef: Northeast.Today, Baehrel estimates the wait list is ten years deep for his 16-cover restaurant, with requests from 60 countries and notably high interest from Singapore, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, London, Japan, Australia and Tasmania.In the last seven weeks alone, the restaurant has received 40,000 new reservation requests.For comparison, at its peak, Michelin-starred restaurant elBulli in Spain received two million reservation requests for 8,000 available seats. Ferran Adrià’s restaurant was named the best in the world five times by critics at Restaurant magazine and attracted food pilgrims from around the world before it shuttered in 2011.Damon Baehrel seats 16 covers a night and is open five days a week. Dinner costs US$265 (S$335).Despite the worldwide attention, Baehrel says he’s going to stick to the same recipe. He’ll continue to prepare all the meals and serve them himself, and will likely continue to turn down incoming offers to open new restaurants.The only other big project he has is a cookbook that will include recipes as well as gardening and foraging sections.Baehrel is remarkably exuberant and enthusiastic after 25 years of being a chef, an occupation that has felled many a great man and woman from stress and burnout.Not so for Baehrel.“I feel like I’m just starting.”Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com"]
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/insidegreen/:['We normally wouldn’t associate good dim sum with food courts, so when had a pleasant surprise when our meal at InsideGreen turned out to be a great one.Opened last December, InsideGreen is located within the Botanic Gardens. This cafeteria style outlet dishes out a variety of local food from its central kitchen, including chicken rice, roti prata, kaya toast, western food, cze char and dim sum.Owners Sally and Madam Wong say they hoped the more recently opened dim sum stall would be the key draw here. And the duo spared no effort in making sure of that, including hiring their chef from Ipoh’s famous dim sum eatery Foh San.Naturally, the dim sum here is Ipoh-style, characterised by its no frills, rustic and hearty qualities. Outstanding items here include the salted egg custard bun, which while small, packs a lethal mix of molten sweet and savoury filling which oozes out when bitten into; har mai (prawn dumplings), which is essentially siew mai stuffed not with pork but with just fresh, springy prawns instead, and a sprinkling of salted egg yolk; and herbal chicken—a light steamed dish of chicken pieces infused with Chinese herbs.\xa0Of course, no dim sum meal is complete without char siew bao (roast pork bun) and here, you get the steamed and baked (shao bao) variety. We liked that the char siew was relatively lean, not overly sweet and looked a dull shade of brown, which meant it wasn’t doused with food colourings.Too bad, we were not blown away by the dessert we tried, chrysanthemum jelly; It was cloyingly sweet. We were told that the chef was a little heavy handed with the dessert that day. But despite that, we were truly impressed with the rest of the dim sum dishes, $3.80 per dish—what good value for money for that quality!

This stall prides itself in selling wanton mee that is spicy, sour, sweet and salty at the same time and they also want the world to know that they are still using the same SinSin brand of tomato ketchup since their father started the shop some 30 to 40 years ago.The wanton mee here is very old school.

The noodles are of good quality and I was told by the lady boss that they spend a bit more to procure better quality egg noodle. Undoubtedly, the star of the show for me was the wanton.

It’s hard to imagine the days when we had to queue for movie tickets, or depend on a travel agent to issue a plane ticket.Yet diners in Singapore are a patient lot. We dutifully wait till operation hours – from noon to 3pm and 6pm to 10pm generally – to dial the number, hope for someone to pick up the phone, ensure correct contact details are taken down, and wait yet again to find out if the preferred dining slot and table is available. Imagine if there was a real-time instant system that could lock in a table, at the time you want, with your contacts already in the database, and add in a few free perks while you’re at it – well, that reality is already here.Instant table lock-inOnline restaurant booking systems have been around for at least ten years, but had been long overdue in coming to Singapore, according to Tan Yung Yih, Director at Group Digital L!fe at SingTel. Some global restaurant table booking services that have made waves in other countries include OpenTable.com and TopTable.co.uk. “Looking at the trend, online reservations are just more convenient, and consumers will naturally move into this space,” predicts Tan. “Diners can book anytime they like, whether it’s after hours like midnight or in-between service periods, and confirm their table instantly.”\xa0It’s good for the restaurateurs, tooThe benefits extend to restaurateurs too, as Tan notes. “It helps from a productivity standpoint, as manpower in F&B is usually very stretched. Online reservations help restaurants be more efficient in planning and maximising their operations.”Audrey Cherish Yeong, Marketing Manager of the Da Paolo Group, agrees whole-heartedly. She summarises it as an evolution in service for the restaurant, explaining, “It expedites the process in getting reservations in, reduces the time spent on picking up phone calls and taking down the wrong number, etc [sic]. The email confirmations that get sent out automatically to the diners and to the restaurants give a huge sense of security on the booking. What’s more, it minimises the number of customers that we lose to unanswered calls. The aid to operations is extensive.”\xa0The consumer is KingThe biggest winner is naturally the consumer. Following the precision of table bookings are the precision of real-time promotions that could result in attractive offers for flexible diners – for instance, deep discounts when dining at non-peak hours, or credit card bundles that come with tie-ups with partners. Yeong also points to the informative booking system sites that come with reviews, photos and recommendations from fellow diners. In conclusion, says Tan, “Anyone with a smartphone will be able to search and book restaurants at anytime they want – this is the next step in evolution.”Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

Only see hum (cockles), lashings of see hum water, pork lard, bean sprouts and eggs are used. The final result ($4 a plate) has a taste which is truly out of this world.The dish has a slightly wet consistency and each strand of noodle is coated with the soft egg mixture. There is an underlying seafood flavour which is made richer with dark soy sauce and pork lard. The strands of bean sprouts are still crunchy and you get a generous amount of just-cooked cockles (eight to 10) in each $4 plate.A little known fact: if you arrive at the stall early enough, every plate of char kway teow is fried individually and you can request for beehoon instead of kway teow.

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/tonkatsu/:['It seems easy enough. Just dredge a piece of pork successively in flour, egg and breadcrumbs, then deep-fry it, and voila! You’ve got tonkatsu.Inspired by Western-style fried cutlets, tonkatsu—Japanese for pork cutlet—has become a classic Japanese comfort food. The ingredients are simple, but making the perfect tonkatsu is a honed art. The quality of the pork, flake size of the panko (breadcrumb), type and temperature of oil, and cooking time—every single detail counts. It looks deceptively easy, but the art of tonkatsu requires much skill and experience.With the recent imports of tonkatsu speciality brands from Japan, tonkatsu lovers in Singapore are now spoilt for choice. inSing.com goes on a quest to find the best tonkatsu in Singapore!\xa0Saboten  EDITOR’S PICK!\n9 Raffles Boulevard, #03-02 Parco Marina Bay, Millenia Walk SingaporeOpening hours: Mon-Fri: 11.30am-3pm (lunch), 5.30pm-10.30pm (dinner); Sat, Sun eve of/and PH: 11.30am-10.30pmPrice: Loin katsu (small) set, $19.00++Rating: 4.5/5We’ve found the near-perfect tonkatsu in Singapore! Hailing from Shinjuku, Tokyo, this tonkatsu specialty chain is the latest player on the scene. Their rosu tonkatsu set satisfied almost all our stringent criteria.Coated in golden breadcrumbs that flared most bewitchingly, the breaded pork loin impressed us with a crispy crust that was feathery light and melt-in-the-mouth. Amazingly, it didn’t feel greasy at all. We could taste the natural sweetness of the succulent pork loin. It was fresh and had the right amount of marbling.Much attention was also given to other components of the meal. We loved their home-made tonkatsu sauce, which brought the breaded pork to another level with its lively sweet-tangy flavours. Cooked using a superior grade of rice, the pearly grains had great texture and beautiful luster.Special praise also goes to the shredded cabbage. It stood out from its competitors for being exceedingly refreshing, sweet, and juicy. Drizzled with citrusy yuzu-based vinegar or creamy sesame sauce, we couldn’t help but ask for multiple helpings of the free-flow cabbage.If not for a slightly soggy under-crust for the tonkatsu, we’d have given full marks to this outstanding tonkatsu specialist. Save for this tiny flaw, Saboten is our top recommendation for the complete tonkatsu experience.\xa0\xa0Tonkichi (Orchard Central)181 Orchard Road, #07-06 Orchard CentralOpening hours: Daily: 11am-11pmPrice: Rosu katsu set, $21.90++Rating: 4/5Synonymous with tonkatsu, Tonkichi has been the place to go to when one craved for quality tonkatsu. They’ve remained faithfully consistent over the years.For this taste test, we tried out their newest branch at Orchard Central. The crunchy crumb was blissfully melt-in-the-mouth and had a lovely fragrance. The pork was tender and lightly salted, so we could still taste the natural sweetness of the meat. Their roasted sesame seed for the tonkatsu sauce was robustly aromatic.Compared to Saboten, the other components were less impressive. The free-flow cabbage was finely shredded, but it wasn’t served properly chilled and was rather dry. The tonkatsu sauce, while sufficiently piquant, was not particularly memorable. However, these were minor nitpicks. Overall, Tonkichi remains a dependable choice for tonkatsu.\xa0\xa0Tonkatsu Ginza Bairin BEST VALUE!\n2 Orchard Turn, B4-39/40/41/42 ION OrchardOpening hours: 11am-10.30pm dailyPrice: Pork katsu set, $15.20nettRating: 3.5/5Another newcomer, Ginza Bairin is also an imported Japanese tonkatsu chain. They are not a full-service restaurant, hence their relatively affordable pricing.We think they offer great value with their free-flow of cabbage and rice like the tonkatsu specialty restaurants and the portions were generous. The cabbage was cut very fine, and paired with a delectable vinegary, sesame dressing. Instead of the usual tofu miso soup, they served a delicious tonjiru—miso soup with sliced pork belly, daikon and carrot.While the pork cutlet could have been thicker and juicier, it was nicely fried, with a thin and non-greasy crust. The tonkatsu was paired with a well-rounded sauce, which boasted good balance of sweet and sour. They also served a fine-grade rice which had great mouth-feel.Although Ginza Bairin’s tonkatsu was not as elegant as its fine-dining counterparts, our tasting panel thought it offered great value and more-than-decent quality for a casual concept.\xa0\xa0Tampopo Restaurant (Takashimaya)391 Orchard Road, #B2-33 Takashimaya Shopping CentreOpening hours: Daily: 11am-10pmPrice: Pork loin set, $19.00++Rating: 3/5Strictly speaking, Tampopo is more of a Japanese family restaurant rather than tonkatsu specialist. However, they do make a more-than-decent tonkatsu, with the option of premium black pig tonkatsu.For the regular tonkatsu, the pork loin was gorgeously tender without being too fatty. It had a good thickness, and was rather juicy.The only thing we didn’t like was the slightly greasy and salty crust. Thankfully, the zesty tonkatsu sauce complemented the pork and managed to distract us from the saltiness.We also enjoyed the delicious tonjiru, which had generous amounts of pork belly, konnyaku, carrot, daikon, and leek slices. The other components—like the dry cabbage—were forgettable.\xa0\xa0Tetsu Japanese Restaurant163 Tanglin Road, #03-18 Tanglin MallOpening hours: Daily: 11.30am-3pm, 6pm-10pmPrice: $24.50++\xa0Rating: 2.5/5For the premium price that they charge, we were expecting premium quality tonkatsu. Unfortunately, Tetsu failed to live up to our expectations.While the pork loin looked magnificently thick, the meat felt rather lean. Thankfully, it was sufficiently juicy. But the cutlet was over-salted, and the crust beneath was horribly soggy.The accompanying sauce was too sour; its sharp tang clashed with the salty pork cutlet. The roasted sesame seeds for the sauce lacked fragrance.There were unique touches like a curry salt dip for the tonkatsu. Instead of shredded cabbage, they served a mesclun salad with a pleasant sesame dressing. We only wished that they’d pay more attention to the main star of the dish.\xa0\xa0Romankan Yokohama391 Orchard Road, #B2-04 Takashimaya Department StoreOpening hours: Daily: 10.30am-9pmPrice: Rosu katsu set, $13.00nett\xa0Rating: 1/5This little casual eatery has been a fixture at Takashimaya’s food hall for some time now. Perhaps the reason why they’ve been around thus far is they had no worthy competitor in the same price bracket.To be brutally blunt, we enjoyed the accompanying potato wedges much more than the tonkatsu. The breaded loin tasted suspiciously like it was made using frozen pork. It was tasteless, dry, and coated with a thick, heavy crust.The tonkatsu sauce had an overwhelming sour tang. Even worse was the odd-tasting vinaigrette for the cabbage. The dry, shredded cabbage tasted like it’d been pre-cut way in advance. The clumpy rice was just as disappointing.We wished we could say something nice, but there was just no redeeming factor we could find. The final score was awarded for presentation effort.\xa0\xa0inSing.com made anonymous visits and paid its own meals at the eateries featured here.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/lptetsu/:['Michelin Star chef Laurent Peugeot, hailing from Japanese restaurant SushiKai and La Charlemagne in his native Burgundy, finally arrives on our shores with French-Japanese fine dining establishment LP+Tetsu!The collaboration between the Michelin Star chef and food court operator Food Junction is a first! LP+Tetsu takes over the spot in Tanglin Mall previously occupied by the humble Japanese restaurant Tetsu, which also belonged to Food Junction.The décor is modern, but comes across as slightly over the top, with colour-changing light features and rather unnecessary wall and ceiling recesses that reminded me of a popular high-end Chinese restaurant chain. Big embossed logos on the service staff’s ill-fitting uniforms and the restaurant’s serviettes reinforce this unfortunate perception. The table ware is bold in design, with lots of rocks and slate.We arrived for lunch three days after the official opening with high hopes. We were even prepared for service lapses, almost expected of any new opening in Singapore. And true to form, their wine list was not ready, with two of the three wines we ordered unavailable (we would told the cellar would take another week to be fully stocked) and table service was inconsistent to say the least.Even then, I told myself not to judge too harshly. After all, it’s all about the food. So let’s cut to the chase. We decided to indulge in the $98 Simply LP +Tetsu set, featuring six promising and delightful-sounding courses (excluding coffee and tea). The meal kicked off with an amuse bouche featuring three liquid-infused spheres, sitting precariously on a delicate crust. Each was individually flavoured and burst gently in the mouth, releasing their liquid glory. Be warned that delicate fingers are needed to handle them without spillage. There was certainly a very “gastronomic” feel to the experience, but taste wise, they didn’t deliver the expected harmony; the biscuit base overpowered the very delicate flavours of the spheres.\xa0The first course of blue fin tuna and veal tartar with takuan (Japanese pickle) and grapefruit sake cocktail, sounded enticing, and being a tartar fan, I was looking forward to it. The texture of the combined veal and tuna was surprisingly harmonious, but the Japanese pickle overpowered the freshness of the produce. The saving grace was the grapefruit sake cocktail foam; Delightful and innovative, it lent a much needed lift to the otherwise underwhelming dish.The second dish, udon wrapped deep fried scampi in a mango and scampi consume, was flavorsome and perfectly cooked – a near masterpiece. The taste was clean and the freshness\xa0 came through wonderfully.A trio of sushi – grilled wagyu, scampi and foie gras – were up next. All were good and fresh. Unfortunately the beef was chewy. My dining partner and I agreed we have had better sushi in Singapore, but wondered if we were being too picky.The main of wagyu beef with soy and mirin served with truffle cream did not deliver what it promised. We had mixed views on the beef, I found it to be tender but rather chewy, while my dining mate thought it was lovely. Both of us however, felt that the truffle cream was too dominant (and I do have an affinity for truffles) – another disappointing delivery. By then, we were hoping the cheese and dessert would impress us.To our amusement, the cheese was served in what appeared to be an unbranded toothpaste tube. It turned out the cheese was a concoction of Brillat Savarin and Burgundy Epoisses cheeses. It was served with a side salad of rocket leaves. As I don’t take to strong cheeses very well, I am inclined to reserve my comment on this dish.\xa0We were offered a ‘pre-dessert’. But instead of getting a cleansing sorbet or a simple praline, which we were expecting, we were served a rich creamy chocolate pod with cream and almond praline! Simple indulgence at its best! We could not wait for dessert!The finale arrived in the form of a chocolate mousse pyramid, with a serving of coconut ice-cream. Though delish and competently executed, it lacked imagination.I wish I could have given a better review. I had high hopes and perhaps that was a mistake. Don’t get me wrong, I would happily go back to give LP+Tetsu another try. But with all the hype around the Michelin-star chef, I was expecting much more.It shouldn’t have just been an ok meal, it should have been an excellent one.\xa0\xa0LP+Tetsu#03-18, 163 Tanglin Road, Tanglin MallTel: 6836 3112Opening hours: 11:30am – 2:30pm; 6:00pm – 11:30pm (Daily)Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/italian-osteria/:['If you know a thing or two about Italian food in Singapore, you’ll know that IO Italian Osteria — which opened at the end of 2014 — has been garnering quite a bit of attention for its gutsy dishes that centre around unusual Italian street food classics.It is also one of the few — if the only — Italian restaurants in Singapore that bake their own Italian bread in-house on a daily basis. Which is why whenever you dine at their restaurant or buy takeaway bread from their counter, there is always a certain level of freshness to their bread which can’t be found in the bread at other Italian restaurants in Singapore.HungryGoWhere spent a morning with Anna Borassi — executive chef of Sicilia Mia group (which manages IO Italian Osteria and also Etna Italian Restaurant) — who showed us how to make basic pane bianco (white bread), a staple bread in many Italian meals.\xa0She also shared her recipe for the well-loved bread:Pane Blanco (Italian white bread)20 per cent mother dough (typically half water, half wheat flour and yeast)\n80 per cent flour\nwater with ice (slightly more than half the volume of the dough plus flour)\nsalt (10-15% of total volume)\nMalt syrup or honey (two percent of total volume)\xa0Method\n\n1. Mix mother dough, flour and water together until it forms a smooth and soft dough like a baby’s bottom.\n2. Add salt, malt syrup and mix well.\n3.

Bake at 230 degrees for 50 minutes to an hour or until nicely brown\xa0The hallmark of a good, well-done\xa0pane bianco? The crust has to have a light crispness when you press into it, says Borassi and the crumb (interior of a bread) a healthy level of moisture and elasticity to it.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/the-noodee-box/:['Must Tries: Original Dry Ramen, That Green Drink\xa0We always talk about a good bowl of noodles. Now, how about a good BOX of noodles? Take-out noodle or “mien” boxes are actually quite popular in other countries, so why not here?The Noodee Box, newly opened at Marina Square, offers ramen noodles in cute and convenient American-style take-out boxes, making it easy for diners who want to eat it on-the-go. However, if you prefer to dine in, there are ample seats in the eatery for you to enjoy your food in comfort.This new noodle concept is started by Vincent Yap, whose father Ah Lam established the famous “Lam’s Abalone Noodle” sold at various coffee shops. You may not know this, but Ah Lam was also the man who introduced mini-wok noodles way back in 1995. It seems like innovation in noodles runs in the family.Some of the interesting noodles at The Noodlee Box include savoury Japanese char siew ($6.80), hickory smoked duck ($6.80) and abalone seafood grand ($11.80). I had the original dry ramen ($5.00), which was filled with a variety of ingredients such as char siew, minced pork, fishcake and Taiwanese sauce. Instead of the usual “mee kia” (fine noodles), which Ah Lam is famous for, the stall uses Japanese style ramen, which is more springy and keeps longer. Although the best part of the noodle is the seasoning and the sauce, I had difficulty getting to it because the sauces had settled at the bottom of the box. So you don’t actually get to savour most of it until you’ve worked through most of the noodles and ingredients.If you’re after a healthy thirst quencher to wash down all that savoury goodness, try “That Green Drink” ($3.80). Specially concocted by Ah Lam, the dark green juice is blended from fruit and vegetables and is surprisingly refreshing and delightfully sweet even though no artificial sweetener has been added.A brand with over 40 years of history, The Noodee Box combines both traditional recipes from the father and new innovations from the son to give diners the best of both worlds. We just wished the noodle sets here were cheaper to cater to a wider base of customers.\xa0The Noodee Box6 Raffles Boulevard, #04-102C The Gallerie, Marina Square, Tel: +65 6336 0848Opening Hours: 11am – 9pm DailyAuthor© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/passion-to-profession/:['They are young, energetic and brimming with creativity and ideas.Meet today’s new entrepreneurs, the next generation of business owners who are well-travelled, market savvy and passionate about pursuing their hopes and dreams.Fuelled by the love for food and the desire of owning something uniquely theirs, a growing number of young entrepreneurs have taken the plunge and started their own businesses in the F&B industry.It comes as no surprise then that a growing number of cafes, restaurants and eateries have been popping up around the island.\xa0 But unlike your usual chain establishments or store-bought franchises, these new start-ups ooze individuality, character and that extra personal touch which make each visit a warm and pleasurable experience.Sinful dreamsFor brother and sister team Kevin and Celine Yeo, a shared love for travel, music and good food sparked off their foray into the F&B industry. An avid baker, Celine’s passion for pastries and desserts led her to the famed culinary institute Le Cordon Blue, where she received top honours in her patisserie course.Returning home, she soon set up an online business showcasing her confectionary creations while still maintaining her full-time job. It was only during a late night drink session with Kevin however, that the idea of starting up her own dessert bar came up.“We were up talking about food when the discussion turned to our favourite dessert, molten chocolate cake, and how these cakes could be made more interesting,” said Celine.Thus began their journey towards owning their own little piece of heaven–3INCHSIN. Located at Cluny Court, the dessert café specialises in molten chocolate cakes infused with a variety of irresistibly tempting fillings.“I’ve always dreamt about running my own little café,” says the 31 year-old Arts graduate, who used to work in various arts institutions including The Substation, National Arts Council and the Cultural Arts Centre at Republic Polytechnic.“I had in my head how the space would be run, what I would serve and even what music I’d play but it was Kevin who gave me the courage to do it,” she says, adding that Kevin runs the business aspect of the café, giving her free reign over her creations.As with most start-ups, the initial stages are always the most difficult and this was especially so for Kevin and Celine, who had no prior experience in the food industry.“We faced a lot of challenges in the beginning, ranging from purchasing equipment, to the administrative process to the branding and concept for this café,” says Celine, who recounted how the siblings resorted to using a ruler to take measurements of the floor space in order to submit their plans to URA.“During the renovation, I told my contractor of my intention to paint the walls white and he asked me which shade of white I wanted,” laughs Celine. “I was stunned as I thought that white was just, well, white. In the end, I had to choose from over 30 shades of white before settling on the perfect hue.”These challenges might be daunting for one without any experience in the industry but Celine takes it all in her stride.“Most of the time, we just bull-dozed our way through, asking people along the way. I guess in essence, we were very persistent about things. We kept asking until we got the answers we needed.”Since its opening two months ago, business has been brisk but there is always room for improvement, said Celine, who hopes to expand this cosy café within the next two years. Right now though, her energy is focused on adding more flavours for her cakes and new creations introduce to customers.As for her advice to would-be entrepreneurs, Celine has this to share. “Be bold! Starting a new business always feels scary but keep charging forth and don’t look back.”\xa0What’s ‘Cookyn’, good looking?Although he does not profess to be a professional, self-taught chef Mervyn Phan’s cooking parties are a big hit among the young executive crowd. Set in a cosy cooking studio at Novena Gardens, a session with Mervyn feels more like a get together with old friend—and therein lies the alluring charm of this young start-up.Launched in July last year, Cookyn with Mervyn was the brainchild of owner Mervyn Phan, whose interest in cooking was inspired by watching his mother work her magic in the kitchen as a young boy.“The idea behind Cookyn with Mervyn is simple,” he said. “We host cooking parties where people can get together, learn how to prepare great dishes in a simple yet creative way, and have a nice meal together at the end of it.”“This concept generally evolved from us hosting regular dinner parties. More and more people wanted to find out how the food was prepared and we grew from there. It is really quite a joy to share the knowledge about ingredients and different cooking methods to bring out of the best from them.”While his previous job as a purchaser in a fine food and wine distribution company opened his eyes to a whole new world of produce and ingredients, Mervyn constantly refreshes his repertoire of dishes by reading various cookbooks, learning from other chefs and experimenting with his own creations.Taking the plunge and opening his own cooking studio was no easy feat, he acknowledges.“As with all business start-ups, there are monetary risks involved. But we managed them properly by thinking them through, weighing them out and testing them,” said Mervyn. “We knew we had something interesting so it was a matter of bringing it up step-by-step.”And judging by the studio’s growing popularity, the 31 year-old has indeed hit on a winning formula.“More and more people are hearing about us and saying good things. That’s a good start considering how small we are,” says the affable food explorer.With things moving smoothly, Mervyn has great plans for the future of his cooking studio.“I hope to train a good pool of people and let them run the upcoming arms of my business,” he said. “This way I can still bring fun and interesting things to introduce to my clientele and let them enjoy what we do best.”But despite his popularity, Mervyn remains very much a down to earth person, and that is perhaps the reason why he attracts such a loyal base.“Staying humble and honest goes a long way,” said Mervyn.\xa0 Sharing his experience, the father of one has this say. “Have a good concept and build yourself up from there. You don’t always have to spend huge amounts of money at the start to make it work. And always stay true to what you believe in, people appreciate that.”\xa0Verve its weight in goldFor first time restaurateur Karen Yeo, starting Verve Bar & Bistro was an opportunity to get more out of life.“Whilst I enjoyed the security that my corporate job provided, when working for someone else, you’re never really in control,” said Karen, who spent a large part of her career in marketing and advertising.And it was that desire to be the captain of her own ship that motivated Karen to leave a high-flying career in the financial sector and start up her own establishment in the sleepy estate of Gillman Village.When Karen and partner Rob Coldman decided to open Verve, neither had any prior experience in the F&B industry. Karen was a regional marketing director based in Hong Kong while Rob was a regional vice president in a leading financial institution. Though the pair did not let their lack of knowledge get them down, they did face a number of obstacles in the beginning.“One of the greatest challenges we faced was getting suppliers to support us. We struggled to secure credit terms so it was tough managing cash flow at the start,” said Karen.“We worked really hard to gain the trust of a few key suppliers, some took a leap of faith and believed in us. Till today, we remain good friends and enjoy a mutually beneficial partnership.”However, managing suppliers was the least of her worries when Singapore felt the full impact of the financial crisis.“Shortly after we started Verve, the financial crisis hit,” recalls Karen. “It was a very tough time as we were still new and didn’t have the strong customer base to rely on, and people were not going out and spending money!”But thanks to a strong background in marketing and customers who believed they had a good product, Verve managed to weather through the crisis.“My background in marketing has been a great help. In addition to stretching a very limited advertising budget through various PR opportunities, we’ve also managed to target some major blue chip companies for informal corporate events, which really helped the business.”Fast-forward two years and Karen, who is in her early thirties, is now reaping the fruit of her labour.“I’m very happy with how the business is tracking so far,” she says. “Of course there are ups and downs but after 18 months, we are making a steady profit and have successfully opened another smaller outlet in Clarke Quay (Verve Pizzeria).”With negotiations underway for a third outlet slated to open later in the year, Verve has indeed come a long way.“The recession was a real challenge but we have learned a lot and we’re probably in a lot better shape as a result,” shares the vivacious entrepreneur.“Looking back through, I would have negotiated for a longer lease as Verve is set in such a unique venue,” said Karen. “With the government looking to redevelop this place, a longer lease would have been great!”With all this experience under her belt, the bubbly businesswoman has these words of wisdom to impart to those keen on starting their own business.“Believe in yourself and believe in what you’re doing. You live only once so you owe it to yourself to give it your best shot!”\xa0\xa03INCHSIN Cluny Court \xa002-27, 501 Bukit Timah RoadTel: 6314 1217Opening hours: Mon to Fri (12pm – 9pm) Sat, Sun and PH (11am – 10pm) Closed on Tuesdays\xa0Cookyn with Mervyn #04-01 Novena Gardens (Lift Lobby B) 273 Thomson RoadCooking parties by appointment only \xa0www.cookyn-with-mervyn.com\xa0Verve Bar & Bistro7 Lock Road Gillman VillageTel: 6473 3655Opening hours: Mon to Thu (12pm – 11pm) Fri to Sat (12pm – 12am) Sun and PH (12pm – 10pm)Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

This week, we bring you to four more outstanding stalls in the area.\xa0Sungei Road LaksaBlk 27 Jalan Berseh, #01-100 Jin Shui KopitiamOpening hours: 9am-6pm, closed: First Wed of every month.Rating: 4.25/5If you still want to eat laksa cooked with charcoal fire, you’d better hurry down to this Sungei Road Laksa! This is probably one of the last few places where you can still see the traditional aluminium pot resting atop a charcoal fire.Rumour has it that this is the first stall to introduce the concept of eating laksa with a spoon. Apparently, it was this uncle who first had the idea of cutting up the laksa bee hoon so that you could scoop it up with only a spoon. How true this is, I don’t really know.The stall was very generous with the amount of haam (cockles), I’m sure that’s a big draw to cockle lovers. The distinct characteristic of this laksa had to be the gravy, which was much lighter than what I had been used to. It was well flavoured without being too rich. Personally, I felt that the bowl I had that day did not meet the expectations befitting its legendary status. But that was me against the 10 or 20 other customers who had turned up to eat the laksa at 3pm in the afternoon. I felt the gravy could have had more ooomph but I am sure fans of this laksa would beg to differ.\xa0Beach Road Scissor Cut Curry Rice229 Jalan BesarOpening hours: Daily: 11am-3.30pm\xa0Rating: 4.5/5I bet that if you brought an ang moh (Caucasian) friend to try this Hainanese curry rice, he would think you were pulling a fast one on him.It’s a plate of rice topped with an unthinkable mixture of gooey chicken curry, braised pork and slimy soft cabbage gravy. If you have never eaten this before, you’d probably be wondering how something that looks like pig’s swill could even taste good. I myself cannot imagine how you can mix curry with lor (braising sauce), but the concoction sure tasted good! And that was not all, the texture of the gravy was like that of tau suan—full of corn starch—so it felt like I was slurping glue.The stall used a pair of scissors to cut up all the ingredients for you and pile it all on top. The meat was in little pieces and the rice was doused with lots of gravy. Everything was mushy and mixed together. Just use your spoon, scoop it up and put it in your mouth. No other effort needed! This would be one of the most effortlessly tasty but superbly tasty dishes you can find.\xa0Ah Guan Mee Pok69 Syed Alwi RoadTel: 62960069Opening hours: Daily: 8am-10pmRating: 4/5It is good to know that some of our enterprising hawkers have taken on the Japanese ramen concept and brought our own mee pok tar to the next level. And that hawker is the owner of Ah Guan Mee Pok.Each stage of the mee pok preparation here is carefully measured to ensure consistency. While outsourced, the mee pok is made to Ah Guan’s exacting recipe. Here at Ah Guan, you can only order mee pok and not mee kia (fine egg noodle) because the owner, Eric feels that his recipe will not work very well with it. Another thing that cannot be served is tomato sauce.Instead, the noodles are flavoured with a special sauce and vinegar, and one can choose to have it with or without chilli. What I like about Ah Guan is that you have the option of adding really good stuff like scallops, crayfish and fish slices to your mee pok.Besides the mee pok, the stall also serves Teochew style porridge. You normally get sliced fish in this porridge, but here, you can choose from scallops and crayfish. The ingredients were quite generous. We managed to fish out two to three pieces of dried scallops from our $6 claypot porridge which was excellent value!It was good to see our own mee pok taken to the next level! Indeed, Ah Guan Mee Pok dished out a great mee pok experience that went beyond just that bowl of noodles by creating a modern yet traditional environment to dine in. This is the way to go for our famous hawker!\xa0Beancurd City133 Jalan Besar (after Desker Road)Opening hours: 11.30am-12amRating: 4.5/5I was pleasantly surprised by the beancurd here. It was excellent. The texture was soft and silky that one could slurp it down in a big gulp but I chose to savour every mouthful of it as it was too good. The taste of the beans was very evident. It was a very refreshing and enjoyable bowl of beancurd indeed. Probably as good as one could get for beancurd here in Singapore. A must try!Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

Following the successful launch of its first boutique coffee stand at Raffles City Shopping Centre, the brand has expanded its menu to include savoury brunch delights.\xa0The new 30-seat outlet serves Japanese fusion fare, complemented by a gorgeous botanical-themed concept. The design inspiration stems from Tag Espresso’s vision to offer diners a serene oasis to indulge in quality brews and mouthwatering light bites, amid the hustle and bustle of the city.\xa0Set foot in the store, and you’ll be greeted with a minimalistic interior and friendly staff. The coffee house is furnished with elements of wood, stainless steel and pebble wash, accented by luscious plants to infuse the space with colour and tranquillity.We love how the espresso machine is the centrepiece of the cafe. Here’s where you’ll witness first-hand the baristas at work, expertly pulling shots and churning up aromatic concoctions. We tried its outlet-exclusive dirty yuan yang (S$15). A creamy Kahlua-based cocktail, it features a harmonious combination of Tag Espresso’s signature midnight blue dark roast coffee and red tea.\xa0The beverage is full-bodied, boasting just the right balance of bitterness from the espresso and sweetness from the red tea leaves. The subtle floral, nutty notes also lend a heavenly fragrance to the drink.\xa0Other signature drinks on offer include the Americano (from S$5) and kaya pandan latte (S$9).Its food menu offers a selection of brunch staples and rice bowls.If you’re a fan of prawn-paste dishes, then you’ll love the shrimp paste pork belly (S$14.90). It’s a unique rendition of har cheong gai (also known as prawn-paste chicken) and features thin pork belly slices coated in a rich batter made from fermented and dried silver shrimp.\xa0It’s then deep-fried to crisp perfection and topped with crunchy tobiko roe. The latter bursts with umami goodness and pairs well with the savouriness of the pork belly.\xa0The highlight is undoubtedly the prawn-paste marinade, for it isn’t overpowering and infuses fragrant flavours into the meat for it to truly shine.You can’t miss out on the tako kaarage (S$13.90) when you’re at the cafe. This is Tag Espresso’s spin on the beloved Japanese bar snack: Fried calamari. Instead of using squid, the dish stars juicy morsels of octopus marinated with shoyu, dashi and ginger. It’s then deep-fried to sinful crispiness and sprinkled with sesame seeds and furikake.\xa0The octopus is succulent and fresh, while the batter is light and airy. Drizzle some lemon and dip the octopus in the tartar sauce for that extra punch of savouriness. What’s brunch without a heaping slice of avocado toast? Tag Espresso’s avocado toast (S$17.90) finds fluffy scrambled eggs and creamy avocado slices atop crunchy rye bread. It’s slathered in a homemade Dukkah spice and pesto and served with mesclun salad and smoked salmon.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHawker Hustlers: Hipster hawker Ray Yeo of Bei-Ing Dimsum Club on reinventing dim sum and his love for all things Japan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can’t go wrong with fish and chips (S$24.90).

The result is an indulgent buttery dip that’s tangy, sweet and slightly bitter. If you’re keen on a heavier meal, the smoky fried rice (S$16.80) won’t disappoint. The dish comprises Japanese short-grain rice that’s topped with mouthwatering ingredients such as smoked bacon, prawn, egg and chilli.\xa0Each spoonful was an explosion of flavours in our mouths and had us reaching for more.

If you’re craving something sweet, then the irresistible French toast (S$16.90) is the one to go for. It’s the perfect Instagrammable dessert, for it’s crowned with a scoop of vanilla gelato, and garnished with edible flowers and fruit. There’s also chocolate syrup on the side, and you can drizzle it all over the toast for that viral-worthy shot.\xa0Next to the entrance, Tag Espresso’s coffee capsules are on proud display, and with good reason. The product catapulted the brand to fame, thanks to its hassle-free convenience of being brewed without the use of a coffee machine.\xa0An extensive catalogue of dark and medium roast flavours is up for grabs, featuring 100% Arabica beans from leading coffee regions such as Ethiopia, Columbia, Guatemala and more.\xa0As part of its exclusive store opening, the brand is hosting a limited-time promotion.

Some even jokingly asked on Instagram if it’s an “early April Fools’ joke”.\xa0But there’s a silver lining in the announcement, specifically a line that read: “PBD Singapore is closed, but it’s not over yet.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/superfood-kitchen/:['Healthy food doesn’t have to be expensive, says Ernie Voon, 45, and Ca-ryn Lim, 43, founders of Superfood Kitchen x The Green Bar.The youthful-looking married couple and parents of two have been in the F&B industry for almost 15 years combined.Now, they’re hoping to make healthy eating more accessible to the masses, with meals starting from S$6.90.Voon says: “I always tell customers… ‘I’m glad you enjoyed my wife’s cooking!’ Because (the dishes are based off) what we eat at home — it’s really like our home kitchen.”It’s been an intensely personal journey for the married duo, who found themselves running the business together only recently.The menu reads a little like a personal travelogue, too.\xa0Says Lim: “Every time we visit a country, I will take down notes (of) what will pair well with each other… so that our customers can enjoy the different flavours of the world.”The business started as The Green Bar in 2010, with Lim at the helm and Voon offering advice from time to time.“When we started, we didn’t even know where to put the kitchen equipment, because going from feeding eight people (at home) to 200 people was a completely different ball game,” Voon recalls.Referring to the salad-bar industry in 2010, Voon says The Green Bar was among the “early pioneers”.\xa0Lim, a self-taught chef who’d been cooking since she was nine, had previously worked in the marketing sector. She led The Green Bar full-time. At that time, Voon consulted occasionally on the business while working in the corporate space full-time with brands such as Nike and L’Oreal.\xa0The Green Bar was one of only two salad bars in the CBD then, but competition soon heated up.\xa0“By the time we left, there were so many competitors. There were 60 to 70 sellers in Raffles Place,” says Voon.Then the Covid-19 pandemic hit hard, especially in key areas such as the CBD and town, forcing the couple to close stores in the last few years.Even with the uptick in public health consciousness after the coronavirus, the couple found that not many people were applying that conviction to healthy eating.\xa0The price point was a key issue. “They say: ‘We love the food, but it’s just too expensive’,” Voon recalls.\xa0There was also a notable lack of information about how food in general was prepared and how much nutrition one gets from it. “(That’s) unless you go on those fitness apps and slowly count (the calories and macronutrients),” Voon says.\xa0Even then, it’s a painstaking and frustrating process.Enter The Green Bar’s sister brand, Superfood Kitchen.Born in late 2022, its aim is to make healthy food accessible and affordable, and empower customers to hold themselves accountable to their diets.This is also when Voon, who was working in Shanghai, joined the fray full-time, managing operations while Lim continued overseeing the culinary aspects.“We had this mission to make nutrition democratic,” adds Voon.\xa0He says healthy food is certainly available in the CBD areas, in the price range of S$16 to $17, but not necessarily so in the heartlands.“We spent a lot of time thinking: ‘OK, we really want to feed people starting from S$6 to S$7’.”Voon says it’s been quite the effort to make the operation as efficient as possible.From its e-ordering system to the layout of the food preparation area, the couple spent time cutting costs wherever they could.“All our shops are this size or smaller, so that whatever (rent) we save, it goes back to the customer and we can bring the prices down,” Voon notes.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Junction Westgate opening with promos; will house 23 tenants, including new halal teppanyaki\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHawker Hustlers: Hipster hawker Ray Yeo of Bei-Ing Dimsum Club on reinventing dim sum and his love for all things Japan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt present, the eatery has stores at Jurong Point, Changi Airport and Raffles City. It has been encouraging more heartlanders to try its food, but some were wary initially.Voon says he generally fields a lot more curious looks and questions when he’s at the Jurong Point store.“They ask me: ‘What is this?’“I just need to say ‘this is healthy cai fan’ and they get it immediately.”While the couple hold steadfast to their mission of expanding into the heartlands, they have definitely seen food costs climbing over the past few months, especially for chicken and grain, which are staples at their stores.\xa0“It’s starting to stabilise, so we do see some light at the end of the tunnel,” they add. F&B is certainly not the easiest of industries to work in.But what about working together, as a couple?“In the beginning, it’s learning each other’s working style and annoying each other regularly,” Lim jokes.“Doing a business like this involves a lot of — literally — blood, sweat and tears. After a while, you learn how to adapt and things become a lot smoother.”Voon interjects: “She’s putting it very diplomatically.”\xa0Previously, Voon was less hands-on with the nitty-gritty of the business.\xa0But now that he’s working full-time on Superfood with Lim, “it’s a completely different ball game”.“Now, it’s almost like she’s having too much of me, because she’s seeing me every day.”\xa0It’s hard to draw the line between home and business, and they’re still adjusting to it, he says. Every conversation they have seems to include some part of work in it.“We literally have to agree on everything before it goes live — the visuals, the brand, the logo.”For now, they try as much as they can to separate the streams of work: Voon oversees operations and strategy, and Lim helms branding and the food.The couple’s two daughters, aged eight and 11, are happy to see more of their parents, though they disapprove of the inevitable quarrels.\xa0“They’re just happy we are doing something together,” says Lim.\xa0When it comes to what’s on the menu, the couple have their kids to thank for one of their bestselling items.“We tried to eat more broccoli at home, because we think it’s healthy. But they got so tired of eating broccoli (cooked) in the usual Chinese stir-fry style,” says Voon.\xa0“(That’s) until we started roasting them. It became a snack — they just kept chucking it (into their mouths).”Superfood counts roasted broccoli and pumpkin among its top sellers, and these are freshly roasted on-site daily. By contrast, most salad bars serve these boiled, Voon adds.Lim says that the eatery tries to give certain ingredients “a little more tender loving care”. For example, if you were to ask for parmesan cheese to go with your order, the staff would grate it fresh off the block, instead of using a prepared version.Diners can choose to add all these and more into their customisable bowls or burritos starting from S$6.90, with top-ups for extra or more premium ingredients. There’s a melange to choose from: Six types of grain, 10 proteins, 25 sides and 10 sauces.Those who’re not in the mood to customise their bowls or burritos may choose one of Lim’s curated recipes.\xa0There’s Le Cajun (S$7.90), with roasted cajun chicken, tomato salsa, olived chickpeas and guacamole. Or Mr Italian (S$7.90), a smoky beef ragu with fusilli and roasted broccoli — a favourite among children, we understand — among several others.Each recipe also has its macronutrients listed on the e-ordering kiosk, so that diners can moderate their intake of calories, carbohydrates, proteins or fat, depending on their diet.Superfood Kitchen is also in the process of applying for its halal certification.Ultimately, what keeps the couple going? “A love for feeding people,” Voon says.\xa0For more ideas on healthy eats, read our articles on Vietnamese eatery Qwang and plant-based food.\xa0Superfood Kitchen x The Green Bar is on the GrabFood delivery service and offers free delivery (up to S$3 off) with GrabUnlimited.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/chinese-new-year/:['Holidays over Chinese New Year are known as siam ang pow or “avoid hongbao” getaways. So where are you going, away, this Chinese New Year?Staying home? Are you booked for a restaurant’s first or second sitting for your reunion dinner? Yes, this is a relatively new tradition that Chinese families are now familiar with.\xa0Reunion dinners of the pastThere was a time when most reunion dinners were home-cooked meals. Steamboats and curries and a “prosperity platter” made this big, fortuitous dinner. On the prosperity plate would be foods that symbolised longevity, wealth, health and fortune. Obviously\xa0that delectation worked.As fortunes increased and families decreased (fewer children, and seemly more overseas) eating out became the norm. An expat –\xa0now termed “foreign talent”\xa0–\xa0observed that in Singapore his colleagues don’t invite him to their homes (unlike in Europe).I explained that is partly because the majority of us dwell in HDB boxes. And it is also because we do enjoy taking people out to eat, especially newbies to our shores.Eating out is practical and fuss-free, and so more and more started choosing to have their Chinese New Year reunion dinners in a restaurant.(My grandparents would have been apoplectic at going ‘out’ for reunion dinner, but this is how we now roll in pragmatic Southeast Asia.)This has been a fast-growing trend since the ’90s. And in the last decade or so, restaurants introduced two sittings to accommodate more eager reunion dinner patrons.It makes sense, it just does.\xa0Reunion dinners of todayThe first seating — usually from 6pm to 8pm — suits families with young kids, and leaves them time to visit red and gold Chinatown before heading home for some kuachi (melon seeds – a typical Chinese New Year snack),\xa0like a second splitting at home.The second seating— from 8pm — is best for those who have to work through lunch and then dash around for last minute items before the shops shut for the New Year. There’s a breather before dinner. And it’s over by 10pm.You can’t begrudge restaurants capitalising on this lucrative season. They make their annual killings here (a modest Chinese New Year menu for four could set you back $500 or more).One year a joint I rung said they had three sittings and asked if I would take the one before 5pm. I told him to toss it, of course. But three sittings are rare.Having said all this, popular restaurants have two sittings all year round.And given changes in society, having two reunion dinner sittings does help: the son of remarried parents, for instance, is filial to both so has two reunion dinners on the same night.Reunion dinners have also taken a turn for the casual, in dressing and in added guests:\xa0some of us have standing invitations to join friends’ families (because our siblings are spread far and wide).You’ll see, at reunion dinners in restaurants and at famous tze char establishments (who also have first, second, and third or supper sittings), families help their overseas visitors with the chap chye dish.“You must eat this so you can huat (Hokkien for “prosper”),” I’ve said to chef Joel Robuchon (of Joel Robuchon Restaurant\xa0and L’Atelier de Joel Robuchon) at the now-closed Por Kee.Of course the newest tradition is to post Facebook updates of your reunion dishes. Please, don’t.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/thye-hong-handmade-fishball-noodle/:['This fishball noodle stall with an unassuming frontage was started by the two eldest brothers of five and the business has been in existence for more than 40 years (1975 or earlier).They started out as street hawkers at Alexandra Road before shifting into Ghim Moh Food Centre in 1977 which is where they have been ever since.The eldest brother has since retired and the stall is now run by the second brother.The name — Thye Hong — was taken from the Thye Hong biscuit factory that also existed at Alexandra Road at that time.As hawker stalls go, they have one of the shortest opening times — only four hours a day and perhaps even earlier if food is sold out (6am to 10am on average).Fishballs and fishcakes are the star of the show here.They are salted, handmade daily and have an irregular shape as compared to factory supplied ones.They have a lovely middle ground soft but firm texture and special note goes to the fish cakes which are generously cut and are not fried — a rather unusual practise for fishball noodle stalls these days.If you concentrate on the flavour of the fishcake alone, you’ll notice a hint of sweetness as compared to the fishballs.The dressing in their noodles is sometimes inconsistent but when it is spot on, it is wonderfully robust with a hint of sour vinegar, lots of savoury dried prawn chilli sambal flavour and a generous amount of lard oil and large crunchy lard pieces.The noodle texture is on the softer side but there is still some bite to them ($3/4/5).Also remarkable is that — as they’ve been doing this for many decades —they’ve managed to carefully balance the flavour such that the dressed noodles, fish cakes and fishballs taste good on their own and even better when eaten together.The saltiness of the fishball boosts the overall flavour of the dish but never gets overly salty.There are also several fishball noodle stalls in Singapore that are run by the extended family: another Thye Hong fishball noodle stall at Bukit Batok, Fishii Tales at Amoy Street Food Centre and the Ru Ji Kitchen\xa0chain of fishball noodle stalls.Aside from the very similar handmade fishballs, each stall has their own individual style for fishball noodles and the sauce used to dress them are all different.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/daven-wu/:['We dig into the psyche and workings of one of Singapore’s key food critics to find out how, why and when he reviews eateries. From anonymous reviewing to paid-for meals, we find out how he does it and find out if he’d put in a good word if they were paid [more], or if that goes against every wishbone in his ethical reviewer’s body.\xa0Food Critic\nDaven Wu\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 \nThe perennially youthful food critic and former lawyer is also an author, editor and writer. He has been critiquing restaurants (the food, mainly) for 13 years, though informally, it’s been a lifetime of eating in and out. He’s known in the industry for his honest, direct and accurate assessments—you can count on him to tell you the truth and back it up with irrefutable notes. Wu has been published in Time Out Singapore, DestinAsian, SilverKris, Wallpaper* and inSing.com. His most recent work includes an op-ed story titled, ‘What is wrong with service in Singapore?’\xa0How did you start reviewing restaurants?\nI got my first assignment reviewing restaurants at Her World. They sent me off to three new cafes and restaurants which have since all closed. After that, I reviewed for 8Days before moving over to the newly launched Time Out Singapore.\xa0Describe your style of reviewing\nIt’s probably more emotive than factual. I write with my head when describing the setting, the service and the general ambience. When it comes to the food, the emotions kick in.How do you pick which restaurants to critique?\nThere’s no rhyme or reason to the places I review. Sometimes, they’re picked by the magazine, and sometimes, I just toss a coin. I’ve reviewed everything from three-Michelin-star restaurants to dimly lit tze char dumps with questionable hygiene standards.\xa0How do you usually rate restaurants?\nI don’t care about the interior decor—unless you’re charging me a lot of money, in which case I want real wood and real silver, not Formica and Ikea cutlery. My principal guide is always the food. I would squat by a longkang (drain) if the food was any good, and I care about the price. Nothing aggravates me more than spending a lot of money on average food. Service is related to the price. I will put up with the worst service at a hawker centre, but not when I’m paying $400 a head. Value is rarely a consideration. It’s an unrealistic factor when dining out because a restaurant meal is always marked up by several hundred percent of the ingredients’ cost price. If you want value, eat at home.\xa0What is the most and least important to you?\nThe kitchen must be at the top of its game. Everything—the price, the ambience, the experience—flows from that.\xa0Do you conduct your reviews anonymously, or via media tastings or do you contact the restaurants directly?\nThe trouble with most Singaporean publications is that there is never a penny for dining expenses, which means that most reviews are hosted by the restaurant. This creates all kinds of conflicts of interests, not least of which the reviews are invariably positive. As I became more experienced in the job, I often ended up paying my own way and booking under an anonymous name.\xa0To reveal or not to reveal?\nI never reveal myself—not anymore. I don’t want to be compromised or pressured by the restaurant to say nice things about it. Giles Coran, the highly opinionated British food critic and regular columnist for The Times, has a great bit in his new book where he says he always had the best intentions of writing honest and brutal reviews, but then he’d be recognised and get dragged off to meet the owner and the PR people would say things like, “This is the owner. She is a refugee from war-torn Somalia where she lost her husband and children and she was put into war camps, but after much hardship, she eventually escaped to London where she scraped together her earnings as a night cleaner to open this restaurant where she cooks from recipes from her late mother who also died in the war. She says she hopes you enjoyed your meal.” And he’d hated the meal…\xa0No photos of yourself either then?\nI’m all in favour of staying anonymous, which is why I never reviewe restaurants of places run by friends or people I knew well. But anonymity really only works if the magazine foots the bill for the food. When I was working full-time in Singapore (Wu now splits his time between London and Singapore), I was very conscientious about not having my photo published. When I started out, my reviewees were all hosted which I think compromised my reporting, but I eventually paid for meals out of my own pocket.\xa0How many times do you visit each restaurant?\nI usually go at least three times, twice on the magazine’s tab, and once by myself. Going once is risky because you never know if you’re catching the kitchen on a good or bad day. And, as any dater will tell you, first impressions can be misleading. I wish I worked at the New York Times where I understand the reviewers visit a restaurant about eight times over a six month period, so that by the time the review is written, you know that it’s a thorough one.\xa0What do you do when the food is particularly bad? \nI tell it like it is. I used to gingerly side-step negative points (especially when my meal was hosted), but over the years, I’ve realised that there’s no point sugar-coating a bad meal because the reader is not going to thank you for it. I just approach it on the same basis as if I was telling a friend about a restaurant I went to the night before. I guess the point is that no restaurant owner goes to all that expense and trouble to serve you a bad meal, but equally, if the food is not up to scratch, it’s only fair to say it’s bad. It’s not as if you got the meal for free. You had to pay for it, and payment, I think, entitles you to an opinion.\xa0How about food hygiene issues— how do you deal with that?\nI would tell the restaurant and I would say so in my review. I’ve never seen a rat, but I’ve witnessed questionable hygiene in restaurants.\xa0Do you get paid for doing the reviews? What’s the going rate?\nYes, I get paid. Of course I get paid! It’s always by the magazine or newspaper I’m writing for. And I can’t tell you how much I am paid. It’s pitiful.\xa0Finally, do you think photos are important to the story?\nI always feel that if you’ve done your job properly, your review doesn’t need photos. And invariably, it’s just one shot of a dish or the interior—which doesn’t really tell you much about how good the restaurant is. I leave the photo-calling to the magazine to arrange. I only take photos of food that I’ve cooked myself.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/pamplemousse-bar-bistro/:['While I like classic European fare, I also like it when I find unexpected touches in well-loved dishes.When the chef is a young Singaporean, it is likely that the unexpected will include Asian ingredients such as miso, nori, lychees and laksa leaf. And if he is well-travelled as chef Adrian Ling and his wife Cleo Chiang-Ling are, chances are, there will also be some modern deconstructions of the classic recipes.The young couple, newcomers to the Dempsey food scene, now run a small but very interesting European bistro and bar called Pamplemousse.All these characteristics can be spotted, even on their set lunch menu, which is offered at a very competitive $38 for three courses.The French onion soup “breakfast”, for example, was a bowl of soup and bread, but what an offering it turned out to be. Aside from the soup, there were also crisp brioche slices, melting cheese squares and a round of truffled nori butter to add even more richness to the bite!Likewise, dessert was a deconstructed cannoli. By right, this should be a crisp Italian pastry filled with ricotta cheese, but this one came with the cannoli shells, soft ricotta filling, dessert sauce and a trail of chopped pistachios and chocolate, all separated. An unfortunately too-sweet berry soup moistens the palate.\xa0Indeed, there are so many elements to every dish that the menu reads like an ingredient list. It is only when you put them into your mouth, do you realise what great combinations many of them are.I mean how could anyone go wrong with this combo: crisp confit of duck leg with braised red cabbage and a wonderful whole lychee sauce? Some roasted potato slices helped fill the gaps if there were any left!This dish totally overshadowed the Spanish ham-wrapped threadfin, which however had interesting accompaniments of oyster mushrooms and a tasty if rather skimpy laksa leaf emulsion.While the set lunch comes with a dessert of the day, the above-mentioned cannoli, I was attracted by the ala carte offering of “toast & Milo” ($15). This was again a delicious brioche, served with all the well-loved flavours of childhood: Milo ice cream and Nutella soil.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/the-spiffy-dapper/:['Owner and head bartender of Boat Quay cocktail bar The Spiffy Dapper, Abhishek Cherian George, doesn’t mince his words.“We don’t give a flying f*&^ about classic recipes,” he said matter-of-factly.The leader of the nine-month-old (set up on March 2013) cocktail bar is adamant in pressing the point that his establishment is different from the rest of the speakeasy-type cocktail bars that are popping up all over the city.“What makes the bar stand out is that we don’t take ourselves too seriously. The other thing will be that we are very disrespectful to tradition,” George added.But make no mistake, beneath that defiant stance, the cocktails created by George who cut his teeth in places like Daybed Bar and The Cufflink Club are still steeped in tradition.\nTake, for example, the Mrs Grundy ($18) – Spiffy Dapper’s twist to the Bloody Mary. Made with its house-infused cherry tomato vodka, tomato juice, lemon juice, Colombian habanero mustard sauce and finished off with sea salt, black pepper and Nocellara olives, the drink makes the perfect antidote for a hangover.Or the Drugstore Cowboy ($18), a take on the Straits Sling but with cinnamon-infused gin as well as other surprises. The Bellbottom Bimbo ($18) is a sailor-inspired boozy punch based on the Zombie cocktail.“Although our drinks are based on the classics, we don’t usually follow the recipes to a T. We take what we need and discard the rest. I guess that’s why Spiffy is a different kind of bar,” George explained.Indeed, from the way the cocktails are made at the Spiffy Dapper, to the way George and his bartenders are dressed, the bar is the antithesis of what a cocktail bar should be and look like.Only its name harks back to the Prohibition-era speakeasy; while George’s peers are usually togged up in the time-honoured uniforms of bartenders (shirts, vests, suspenders, etc), George and his staff give the proverbial middle finger to the establishment and got comfortable in their “kopitiam swag”\xa0– t-shirts, bermudas and flip-flops; or anything “comfy” for that matter.If there is one definitive spirit that everyone should have in the home bar, George says it would have to be a good bottle of bourbon.“If your wallet allows it, get a Maker’s Mark,” George recommended, “as it is one of the most versatile bourbons out there. With smooth mellow taste as well as it sweet oak and raisin aroma, you can use it for pretty much anything; either a whiskey sour, an Old Fashioned or even straight up.”For an easy cocktail to make at home, George shares his Rum Sour recipe:\xa0Ingredients:\n45ml of white rum\n25ml lemon juice\n20ml sugar syrup\xa0\xa0Method:\n1. In a shaker, shake all ingredients with ice.\n2. Strain liquid into ice-filled cocktail glass.\n3. Spritz with lemon peel by squeezing the peel immediatle above the cocktail.\n4.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/big-mama/:['The name might suggest a raucous karaoke pub or a seedy bar, but Big Mama is just a no-frills Korean eatery on the fringe of the rapidly gentrifying Tiong Bahru estate.Named after the bespectacled and matronly Korean lady boss, Ji-young Nam Gung, Big Mama is all about homey and MSG-free Korean fare cooked with gusto\xa0— exactly the stuff a Korean mother would cook.“I came to Singapore years back to learn English and to supervise\xa0— and cook for\xa0— a group of Korean students,” says Nam Gung, a former Mathematics tutor who hails from the Korean metropolitan city of Busan. She soon mastered the English language and her Korean restaurant leverages on her years of experience cooking for the students. It’s is clearly paying off: barely a month after opening, the minimally embellished eatery with garish, dull-grey interior\xa0— the equivalent of an air-conditioned tze char in Singapore\xa0— is luring an equal mix of Korean expats and locals in droves.It seems the diners frequent Big Mama for two signatures dishes: dak galbi ($15 per person, minimum order for two)\xa0— diced chicken stir-fried with sweet potato chips, onions, rice cake and bits of cabbage on a hotplate with home-made chili pepper paste; and samgyupsal suyuk (small $25, large $40), a dish of steamed sliced pork belly served with sliced fresh cucumber and celery with two dips of garlic-lemon and black bean sauce.We adored the former for the novelty of tableside cooking (by Big Mama herself nonetheless), but the shine wore off after a few mouthfuls: subsequent bites delivered diminishing returns when every chunk in the plate was enrobed in a quickly-monotonous sweet and spicy sauce that drowned the mixture.On the other hand, the tiles of still-fatty suyuk dipped in the sauces with accompanying vegetables were refreshingly savoury, as were the petite servings of six different types of panchan (Korean side dishes), which included a miserly but pungently delicious serving of kimchi.Big Mama is no one trick pony\xa0— her menu teems with heaps of Korean signatures. The dwaeji moksal yangnyum gui (grilled pork collar with a Korean fermented soy sauce made, $18) beamed with a mildly sweet and addictive flavour, and was a perfect companion with rice; as was the haemul kimchi jeon, a generous disc of doughy fried pancake peppered with a riot of chives, prawns and squid ($15).The kimchi soup ($14) left us underwhelmed with a fishy stench that the accompanying onions failed to hide.Not that it will steer us away \xad— prices at this mid-tiered Korean joint are attractive enough to lure us back for another try; we will be back for Big Mama’s kimchi fried rice.\xa0Ratings\nFood: 3.5/5\nService: 3/5\nAmbience: 3/5\nValue: 3.5/5\xa0Must eats: stir-fried chicken with sweet potato, steamed pork belly, grilled pork collar, seafood and chive pancakes\xa0\xa0Big Mama | Address: 2 Kim Tian Road | Tel: 6270 7704 | Opening hours: Daily 11:30am–2:30pm, 5:30–11pm; closed two Mondays a monthAuthor© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/bordeaux-wines/:['My first experience with a glass of Bordeaux wine wasn’t pleasant.My face and tongue protested on the first sip: it felt like I had taken a mouthful of very strong Chinese tea – the Bordeaux was tannic and very dry with a bit of blackberry flavour. I promptly declared that I didn’t like Bordeaux wines (who cared if it was expensive?) \xa0– a premature\xa0 conjecture, as I soon found out.There nothing I love more than a good glass of Bordeaux wine with my steak these days. Bordeaux wines, as with most Old World wines, are made to be enjoyed with food. A good Bordeaux wine comes alive with food. Of course, the big Bordeaux ‘brands’ are not cheap, but affordable and delicious Bordeaux wines can be found, too. This appellation covers a large area and there are many different wines on the market; it’s not just about the Chateau Margauxs or Lafites.Where should you start? At the recent World Gourmet Summit 2013, I tasted twenty-six different Bordeaux wines, and settled on my top five.\xa0Here are the picks, each suitable for an occasion. To add, some are relatively affordable:\xa0Chateau Camensac, 2006, $71\nBest for picnics\nTastes like: A happy surprise – lively red berries so it’s fruity yet creamy, slightly tannic and dry with a spicy finish.\nWhat to drink with: Hard cheeses, dried fruits and big steak sandwiches laden with butter and Dijon mustard. Sounds like a good picnic basket to us. \xa0\xa0 \nHow to drink: Best open or decant for at least one hour before drinking.\nFun drinking notes: Chateau De Camensac from Haut-Medoc is one of the best introductions to Bordeaux wines at an affordable price. It has the same owners as Chateau Chasse-Spleen.\nWhere to buy: Cold Storage | Address: 1 Kim Seng Promenade, #B1-18/19, Great World City | Tel: 68335802 | Opening hours: Daily 9am-10pm\xa0CRITIC’S PICK Chateau Chasse-Spleen, 2010, $88\nBest for a lazy day\nTastes like: Red berries, dry, with just a hint oak. You know, the easy drinking feeling you get when you are enjoying a carefree day.\nWhat to drink with: A light meal of salty, crisp-skinned roast chicken. Preferably on a \xa0lazy weekend afternoon with good friends.\nHow to drink: Best open or decant for up to three hours before drinking.\nFun facts: This is my sentimental favourite. It is from the smallest commune, Moulis, in the famous Haut-Medoc area of Bordeaux. The name of the chateau is literally translated to mean “chase away the blues or melancholy”, which, coincidentally, is probably one of the best reasons to have a glass of wine. It is also one of the wines featured in the popular Japanese manga Kami no Shizuku (Drops of God).\nWhere to buy: Top Wines | Address: 33 Tembeling Road | Tel:\xa064683866 | Opening hours: Mon-Fri 10.30am-7.30pm; Sat 1-6pm (Minimum order $800)\xa0Chateau Clerc Milon, 2010, $165\nBest for date night\nTastes like: Rich, full of black fruit, strawberries, and dry with a lingering savoury taste. It’s like the glow after reading a long, well-written novel.\nWhat to drink with: Chunky, juicy, medium-rare beef steaks, and a long engaging conversation with your date.\nHow to drink: Best open or decant for at least an hour before drinking.\nFun facts: This chateau in Pauillac, Bordeaux has two very two famous neighbours: Chateau Lafite-Rothschild and Chateau Mouton Rothschild. To wine lovers – especially the French who believe in the concept of terroir or a ‘sense of place’ – this chateau shares the latter two’s climate, soil and levels of exposure to the sun, leading to quality and unique wines.\nWhere to buy: Top Wines | Address: 33 Tembeling Road | Tel:\xa064683866 | Opening hours: Mon-Fri 10.30am-7.30pm; Sat 1-6pm (Minimum order $800)\xa0Chateau Brane-Cantenac, 2010, $187\nBest for a rich dinner\nTastes like: Perfumed, dark berries, velvety smooth and off-dry. An easy drinker this one is, like an early morning walk in a garden full of blooming flowers.\nWhat to drink with: A six-course dinner featuring meat stews and fish cooked in rich sauces.\nHow to drink: Best open or decant for at least one hour before drinking.\nFun drinking notes: Chateau Brane-Cantenac is one of the more forward-looking chateaus in Margaux.

It is also arguably one of the prettiest towns in Bordeaux, where this wine is from. The Cuvelier family has owned the chateau since 2001 and no expense has been spared to improve the vineyard and wine quality since their takeover.\nWhere to buy: Top Wines | Address: 33 Tembeling Road | Tel:\xa064683866 | Opening hours: Mon-Fri 10.30am-7.30pm; Sat 1-6pm (Minimum order $800)\xa0Wine glossaryBordeaux = Actually the name of an important port in the French west coast. It gives its name to a large wine region that produces some of the world’s most expensive and sought after wines. But also some really lame ones. There, it had to be said.Dry = Wine speak for “not sweet”.Off-dry = Often used to describe a wine that has a hint of sweetness in it.Appellation = The French system of using geography or geographical delimitation to designate its better quality wines. Some famous examples in Bordeaux are Margaux, Haut-Medoc, Saint-Emilion, Pauillac, Moulis.Old World = ‘Traditional’ wine producing countries like France, Italy, Spain, Portugal.New World = USA, Chile, New Zealand, Australia, South Africa are some of the well-known New World wine producing countries.Tannins = A chemical compound found in the fruit and bark of trees. It adds astringency (or “siap” in Hokkien) to wines.\xa0\xa0TIP: Typically, a good bottle of Bordeaux wine will need at least 5 to 10 years upon its release to be ready for drinking. If you want to drink a bottle after it is bought, open or decant a bottle for 1 to 3 hours before you drink it. The changes to the tastes and flavours as you drink the wine can happen by the minute.”Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/tequilas-and-mezcals/:['Cinco de Mayo (fifth of May) is an annual Mexican and Mexican-American celebration that commemorates the Battle of Puebla in 1862. Outnumbered almost two to one, the Mexican army defeated the invading French army during the battle, and the day grew to become a focal point of Mexican pride and heritage.Its celebration today in terms of booze can only mean one thing – tequila! But before you reach for the salt and lemon, we’re here to tell you that not all tequila consumption is about shot glasses and shame. This story covers tequilas that match up to the loftiest of sipping spirits, as recommended by the people in town who know them best. And no, none of the bottles have worms in them.\xa0Some\xa0tequila essentials:\xa0\xa0Tres Generaciones\xa0\xa0Reposado\nSmooth, strong, tropical tequila\nThis versatile and affordable tequila functions perfectly as an introduction to the good stuff, and it’s the house pour of Señor Taco. “We use it in all our drinks,” executive chef Luis Rodriguez tells us. “It’s smooth enough to have as a shot and it has a strong flavour without the burn; smooth, but with presence.” It’s peppery and spicy with a bit of tropical fruit flavour from its brief stay in American oak.Señor Taco | Address: #01-19/20 Chijmes, 30 Victoria Street | Tel: 63371377 |\xa0Opening hours: Sun-Thu 6pm-midnight, Fri & Sat 6pm-2am |\xa0Price:\xa0$12 per shot, $180 per bottle\xa0\xa0Don Julio 70 Añejo Claro\nLimited edition floral and vegetal tequila\xa0\nTequileros love mixing things up with a limited edition bottle like Don Julio 70 Añejo Claro, produced to mark Don Julio’s 70th anniversary in 2012. According to Chef Rodriguez, who hails from Mexico City, Don Julio is one of Mexico’s most famous tequila producers. The 70 shows exactly why. Aged in American white oak barrels for 18 months and then filtered carefully to give it its crystal clear colour (most añejo tequilas have a gold to brown colour from the aging process), the result is an incredibly smooth mix of blanco tequila characteristics – floral and vegetal – and the whisky-like complexity of an añejo.Señor Taco\xa0| Address: #01-19/20 Chijmes, 30 Victoria Street | Tel: 63371377 |\xa0Opening hours: Sun-Thu 6pm-midnight, Fri & Sat 6pm-2am |\xa0Price:\xa0On request\xa0\xa0IXÁ Organic Tequila\nOrganic, eco-friendly tequila – like cut grass\nProduced in Mexico by the Los Angeles-based Greenbar Craft Distillery, IXÁ is a 100% organic, carbon negative tequila (if that’s not eco-friendly enough for you, they also plant a tree for every bottle sold). It’s made with traditional techniques like slow, clay oven steaming and fermentation and distillation with agave fibers. “It has a full-on hit of agave – not smoky and not too sweet,” The Secret Mermaid’s bar manager Kevin Petrie shares. “Just herbaceous, cut grass and planty agave flavours.” Petrie, who spent two years working at a mezcal bar in Guatemala (more on that later), compares it to the roasted agave that’s a popular street food in Mexico.The Secret Mermaid |\xa0Address: #B1-08/09, Ocean Financial Centre, 10 Collyer Quay |\xa0Opening hours: Mon-Fri 5-11pm | Price:\xa0$18 per shot, $104 per bottle (retail), $187 per bottle (in-house)\xa0\xa0Sparkle Donkey Reposado\nSweet, earthy and smoky tequila – like caramel corn\nThe fabulously-named Sparkle Donkey, imported from Mexico by Seattle’s Black Rock Spirits, pokes fun at other distilleries who try to emphasise connections to tequila’s history and heritage no matter how tenuous the links. Behind the joke is a truly awesome beverage. Sparkle Donkey is made with a blend of agave from the highlands and lowlands which offer sweet and earthy flavours respectively. Half of the agave is steamed while the other half is kiln-cooked to give it some smokiness. The finished blend is aged in wet American whiskey barrels and the end product has a unique flavour mix dominated by caramel corn. “It makes a killer Old Fashioned,” Petrie says.The Secret Mermaid\xa0|\xa0Address: #B1-08/09, Ocean Financial Centre, 10 Collyer Quay |\xa0Opening hours: Mon-Fri 5-11pm |\xa0Price:\xa0$17 per shot, $98 per bottle (retail), $177 per bottle (in-house)\xa0\xa0Tequila Ocho Single Estate El Carrizal 2008 Extra Añejo\nButterscotch, coffee and candied fruit tequila\xa0\n“Inviting you to change your perception” is the motto of Tequila Ocho, the first tequila producers to label their bottles with the year of vintage and the estate of origin of the agave plants that went into making it, much like a fine wine. “The agave plant takes eight years to grow,” says Diego Araud, sales representative at Fine Spirits by La Maison du Whisky. “Depending on the type of soil and whether it is grown in a valley or on a mountain, it’s going to express itself; it’s a product that is very much linked to terroir.” Indeed, the tasting notes for this exceptional, rich-textured tequila are as lengthy as any top-class wine – olive brine, molasses, candied fruit, butterscotch, coffee and more.Fine Spirits by La Maison du Whisky\xa0|\xa0Address: #01-10 The Pier, 80 Mohamed Sultan Road | Tel: 67330059 |\xa0Opening hours: Daily Store noon-midnight, Bar 6pm-midnight | Price:\xa0$22 per shot, $173 per bottle (retail)\xa0\xa0MEZCALIlegal Mezcal Reposado\nNow-legal mezcal\nProduced by the people behind the famed Café No Sé bar in Antigua Guatemala (the same one that The Secret Mermaid’s Kevin Petrie worked at), Ilegal Mezcal gets its name from the bar’s illegal import of mezcal from across the Guatemala-Mexico border back in the day. Ilegal Mezcal Reposado is an ideal starting point for someone who hasn’t tried mezcal before, with its balance of vegetal agave notes, wood characteristics and mellow smoke flavour.Fine Spirits by La Maison du Whisky\xa0|\xa0Address: #01-10 The Pier, 80 Mohamed Sultan Road | Tel: 67330059 |\xa0Opening hours: Daily Store noon-midnight, Bar 6pm-midnight | Price:\xa0$13 per shot, $89 per bottle (retail)\xa0\xa0Mezcales Esenciales Mezcal del Gnomo\nSweet liquid smoke mezcal\nMezcales Esenciales bottles mezcals produced on a small scale by different mezcaleros using a variety of techniques and an array of different agaves.

When it was first shipped to Spain in 1585, this product was considered a substance of power and a source of vitality.Chocolate is derived from Theobroma Cacao, literally meaning ‘food of the gods’. Chocolaholics will undoubtedly agree. It has scientifically been proven to be a mood booster thanks to the organic chemical substances it contains.Today, there are innumerable chocolate products for every taste and budget. It is a feel good treat – creamy, velvety, rich, and luscious – what’s not to like?\xa0Canele\xa0Canele is offering two types of chocolate gifts this year.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/shi-hui-yuan-hor-fun-specialty/:['Rating: 4.5/5\xa0In Singapore, food courts are fast replacing many hawker centres, making it increasingly difficult to find those traditional stalls that have been around for decades and are run by Mom and Pop. Those feeling the nostalgia, read on as Dr Leslie Tay finds a stall that has been around for more than 40 years and is still going strong.Mention Mei Ling Food Centre and the one stall that comes to mind is the hor fun. You probably would not know the name of the hor fun stall as most people simply refer to it as “that hor fun from Mei Ling St Food Centre!” To me, the interesting thing about this stall is the fact that it is run by a husband and wife team for the past 40 years! In modern Singapore where Hawker Centres are fast being replaced by Food Courts, this is undoubtedly becoming a rarity.One of my makan kaki had been telling me about the hor fun stall for a while but we just did not find the time to go and try it. True to his claims, the Hor Fun was excellent and made unique by the taste of the gravy. Another very telling thing about the hor fun was the fact that it was evidently made with a lot of passion – from the preparation to the cooking of the gravy. I also suspect that the sauce does not get prepared from scratch every day. Instead there are leftovers to which they add new ingredients to make the gravy for the next day. That means that theoretically there might be molecules of stuff in there since 1969! Well, so far the stall has not made headline news for serving unhygienic food and no one has had major food poisoning so it should be safe.It was evident from speaking to the owners of the stall that they were proud of their many years of existence and history. Unfortunately the mom suffered a stroke and has not been unable to cook recently. However, she is still at the stall supporting her husband and daughter. The daughter has returned from Hong Kong to help take over the running of the stall! So that means we are at least going to enjoy their recipe for at least another generation! Phew!If you are a fan of Hor Fun, this is one place you must make a point of visiting. I highly recommend the pork ribs, mushroom and chicken feet hor fun.\xa0\xa0Shi Hui Yuan Hor Fun Specialty\xa0Blk 159 Mei Chin Road, #02-33, Mei Ling Food CentreOpening hours: Daily 7.30am to 2pm; Closed on Mondays and TuesdaysAuthor© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/fredo-galaxy/:['Rating: 4/5\xa0MUST TRIES: Sandwiches, chicken & potato pies and dark chocolate truffle cake\xa0Almost everything about bakery and patisserie Fredo Galaxy is unusual. Its name aside, the tiny half-shop (there’s barely enough room for five people) also seems out of place in the sleepy Tanglin Halt neighbourhood. The bakery just seems to be too funky for the area’s older demographics.But it’s true what they say about not judging a book by its cover, as Fredo is truly a hidden gem. In fact, the bakery is owned by Alfred Chan, former pastry chef of Shangri-La and Intercontinental hotels.The emphasis of this gourmet bakery is on homemade goodness, healthy and natural ingredients.\xa0The bakery’s lunch sandwiches ($5.50) are a must try. They are made with wholesome ingredients like homemade bread that’s chock-full of nutritional nuts and seeds, quality meat like low-fat chicken breast or smoked salmon and fresh, crisp greens. Laced with a fabulously light but delicious and moreish mustard-mayo combination dressing, the sandwich was one of the tastiest we’ve had in a long time.Grab these sandwiches quick though as they tend to get sold out fast. “Come before 12pm,” Chef Alfred advised. Otherwise, you can try a loaf of their freshly made bread–we recommend the multi-grain bread with flaxseeds and cranberries ($7). Slice up the bread into 1cm-thick portions and eat it lightly toasted with a generous slather of good quality butter. Yummy!\xa0The chicken and potato pies ($3.80) were also quite good. Fat and generously filled with an addictive and fragrant filling, they are best eaten warm.\xa0Among the sweet pastries, we thoroughly enjoyed the fig tart ($3.60 per piece). This was a special item as dark Turkish figs were in season when we visited the bakery. The shell of the tart was firm and crisp, but yielded into a crumbly biscuit-like texture when we bit into it. It complemented the soft, slightly caramelised fig pieces well. Chef Alfred said he didn’t add too much sugar to the tart as he wanted the subtle flavours and textures of the figs to come through. He definitely achieved that.The dark chocolate truffle cake ($4 per slice) was also very well made. Made with 55% Cacao Barry chocolate, it was rich, dense and had just the right touch of sweetness. A thin base of crispy, slightly flaky layer offered a contrasting but still pleasing texture.\xa0Two items we tried, however, didn’t meet our expectations.While relatively well made, the cinnamon apple tart ($2.80 per piece) and the egg tart ($1.30) fell short. The apple tart was a little too soggy and lacked x-factor. The egg tart, on the other hand, was too firm and lacked the creamy, smooth and slightly wobbly texture we’ve come to expect from a traditional egg custard.\xa0Overall though, these were just tiny blimps in the large range of excellent offerings at Fredo Galaxy. We’ll be back for our favourite sandwiches and to taste other items like the cookies and quiches. We suggest you head there the next chance you get too, because a bakery this good won’t be a hidden treasure for long.\xa0\xa0Fredo Galaxy\xa0Blk 46-3 Commonwealth Drive, #01-388Tel: 91852932Opening hours: Mon-Sat: 8.30am-8pm; Sun: 8.30am-6pm; closed on Tues (but call to enquire)\xa0* inSing.com pays for the meals at the places we review.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

Customers give him their orders and pay upfront before they sit down to eat. It is fast and efficient, if slightly reminiscent of an assembly line. But when I wanted to add to my order, there was Mr Lau on hand, instead of me having to wave frantically at a waiter!The dishes came in quick succession, Singapore hawker style, without too much ceremony, everything being plonked down in front of you.\xa0Still the food brought me back to my childhood when such an array of Cantonese favourites were all the rage at street stalls in Chinatown, where live snakehead fish (toman) were being battered before our eyes, before being thrown into the pot!While I had asked for a sliced fish beehoon soup, the version made with fish head is better because the bones add sweetness to the broth, which is creamy without the smell of dairy. The best fish soup, it is said, is white from long boiling of the fish bones.And if you’re worried about fishiness, the XO brandy covers a multitude of sins and you can detect it both on the nose and tongue. The price of a bowl ranges from $7 for one, to $25, for five.While the old stalls offered mainly the fish soup and perhaps sweet and sour pork (Mr Lau’s kitchen does a mean version, by the way), today’s purveyor of the dish has an array of crowd favourites.\xa0At Mr Lau’s shop, these include a nicely crisp and fragrant har cheong kai ($7), butter prawns ($15 for five pieces), a tasty tofu with a mushroom sauce ($10) and a crisp tender ngor hiang (five-spiced sausage, $8 for10 pieces.)My favourite, however, was the san lou hor (fish fried with flat rice noodles and bean sprouts, $6 for one), which, come to think of it, is a logical progression from the fish-head noodles. It is a wonderful combination of fish, soft noodles and crunchy bean sprouts.Why no one thought of it all those years ago, I do not know.

I would, however, souse my rice with the pork gravy, rich with soya bean and spicy with chilli, yet unlike any Chinese version of that combination. Even the oil floating on top of the dish was delicious over rice and would make the food stretch, important in poorer Southeast Asian countries.I love the bamboo shoots best, for the rosella leaves deliver a natural tartness and red chilli gives it the essential heat to a piquant dish that goes well with rice.\xa0I would eat at this stall again.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/toa-payoh-rojak/:['Ever since he sold his first plate of rojak, Mr Cheng Kong Sang has never looked back.Today, Toa Payoh Rojak is a mecca for fans of the traditional dish. Topped generously with its signature dark sauce and peanuts, it often has loyal customers lining up for a taste. HungryGoWhere talks to Mr Cheng about his love for rojak and the secret behind his mouthwatering offerings.How did Toa Payoh Rojak come about? I started Toa Payoh Rojak in 1971 and have been doing this for close to 40 years now. I decided to open a rojak stall because I knew I would be doing this for a long time, so I thought it’s best to do something that would not be too taxing when I grew older.I first opened at Toa Payoh but after more than 30 years there, the government needed the space for development and offered me a stall at Old Airport Road. I moved in 1999 and have been here ever since.What makes your rojak different from others?Quality is important and I believe in using good quality ingredients for my rojak. This makes a difference as the ingredients are fresher and taste better.What do you like most about rojak?I like to eat rojak and I like the different tastes that you get from this simple dish. I remember going to a rojak stall next to Capitol Cinema some 50 years ago and enjoying a plate of rojak with prawn paste, chilli and peanuts. Today, I’m dishing out this delightful snack myself!There are many different ingredients that go into rojak. What, in your opinion, is the most important ingredient that makes a good rojak great?The rojak sauce is the most important because it alone determines whether the rojak is good or not.Indeed. Your dark sauce has drawn rave reviews. What is your secret?It’s the balance of ingredients, which I’ve managed to perfect over the years. From the prawn paste, to the peanuts, tamarind, chilli and sugar, I’ve adjusted their proportions so that they are in perfect harmony.You’re also known to be very generous with the sauce with each rojak order. Just how much sauce do you go through in a day?We go through about 52kg of sauce in three days, so that’s about 17kg a day.With the rise of fusion food and customers having more adventurous palates, have you ever considered adding new ingredients to your rojak? People like my rojak because it is traditional. So, I plan to keep using traditional ingredients and not introduce anything new to the mix.You have an LED display with a counter for customers to take their number before ordering. Why did you decide to implement this system?I wanted customers to be able to take a number so that they wouldn’t need to stand in queue. I wanted them to be able to either sit and wait for their turn or do other things and come back. It also does not block the way of the other customers.Who are your regular customers? My customers come from all walks of life. I also have Malay and Indian customers, as well as expatriates, foreign workers and even Japanese tourists.Have you had any memorable encounters with customers?I had a British customer who came by to buy a plate of rojak. He had to wait very long because there were a lot of customers that day but after finishing his food, he came back and told me that my rojak was very delicious and that it was well worth the wait. That made my day!51 Old Airport Road, 01-10851 Old Airport Road, 01-108Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

And although it leaves no sickly sweet after-taste, it sadly lacks a distinctive flavour.Rating: 3.5/5\xa0Waitrose Organic Soft SetPrice: $6.90\nWeight: 340g\nMade in: Belgium\nAvailable at: Cold Storage supermarkets and Market Place stores\nFor those who want to eat organic, Waitrose Organic’s raspberry conserve is made using organically grown raspberries and organic sugar (however, the added citric acid and pectin are not). This is a soft set jam, so it’s quite runny. While it has a fruity flavour, it is not tangy enough. Also, there are quite a lot of big, rough seeds, which can get pretty annoying.Rating: 3/5\xa0TiptreePrice: $7.45\nWeight: 340g\nMade in: England\nAvailable at: Cold Storage supermarkets and Market Place stores\nLove raspberry jam, but hate the pesky seeds? Then Tiptree’s seedless raspberry conserve is the one for all you spoilt babies out there. Unfortunately, there’s not much to like about this jam. It’s way too sweet, and the jelly-like texture is too firm. Possibly good only in a pb&j (peanut butter and jelly sandwich).Rating: 2.5/5Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/cosmopolitan-cuisines/:['This article is brought to you in partnership with Coca-Cola®.Singapore is a melting pot of cuisines. So while Singaporeans love local food, indulging in international nosh is just as much a part of their lifestyles, too. \xa0What are the top foreign cuisines here?We share some favourites:\xa0American – Favourite dishes: Beef patty burger, thick-cut friesAlways a classic cuisine readily available across the island, burgers and fries make for a satisfying meal at any time of the day. The hearty combination of juicy beef patty with toppings such as sauteed mushrooms, crispy bacon or pickles between toasted buns are sure to satisfy your appetite. Have some freshly fried thick-cut fries and an icy-cold can of Coca-Cola for a fulfilling authentic American nosh experience.Where to eat: Restaurants such as Omakase Burger offer classic combinations of beef burgers, topped off with its signature Beef Tallow Fries on the side. Do not fret if it is late at night and you are craving for more. Fatboy’s The Burger Bar has that covered, serving a wide variety of burgers up till midnight.\n\xa0Italian – Favourite dishes: Tiramisu, margherita pizzaItalian cuisine just seems to be the comfort food of the world. Maybe it’s the rainy weather, maybe you’re feeling sluggish, or maybe you want to celebrate – regardless, pizza and pasta will be there for you because any time is a good time for some cheesy margherita\xa0and bolognese sauce. Moreover, the best Italian food always has a touch of rustic home-feel (think woodfired thin crust pizza) that makes you feel all warm and fuzzy. Sipping some Coca-Cola with the meal really adds to this cosy dining experience. Lastly, Italian food is awesome because of the dessert, tiramisu.\n\xa0Indian – Favourite dishes: Butter chicken, tandoori\xa0The aromatic spices used in Indian food makes its taste so complex and rich, and it is an excellent choice for vegetarians and non-vegetarians when they have to dine together. While some may automatically associate Indian food with red hot curry that burns the tongue, there are really a wide selection of dishes that are mild on the spices but equally appetising. Butter chicken and tandoori are the hot favourites in that category, no pun intended.\xa0Korean – Favourite dishes: Korean fried chicken, kimchi jiggae, bulgogiConsidering the K-wave seems here to stay in Singapore, it is inevitable that Korean food is well-loved by the population here, too. You may be familiar with Korean barbecue or the spicy-sour kimchi dishes, but most recently, Korean fried chicken has taken centrestage with the appearance of fried chicken chain stores. Who can resist the crunchy goodness of fried chicken drizzled in savoury garlic sauce, complemented with the freshening fizz of Coca-Cola?Where to eat: 4 Fingers, Nene Chicken all serve delectable fried chicken pieces, served in handy easy-to-eat bites.\xa0Mexican – Favourite dishes: Salsa and guacamole on chipsHola, chicos! You may not see Mexican food around as much as other international cuisines, but it certainly does not mean that it pales in comparison when it comes to taste. If anything, Mexican food should suit the Singaporean palette really well with its mix of salty, sweet, and spicy flavours. The unofficial staples of Mexican food are the salsas and guacamole (an avocado dip). The fresh salsa has a fiery kick, while the tangy guacamole gives a good balance to the flavoursome dishes. Mexican food with Coca-Cola is truly an adventurous pairing.\xa0Szechuan – Favourite dish: Mala hotpotBeing made up largely of different Chinese dialect groups, the Chinese population in Singapore is spoilt for choice when it comes to Chinese cuisine. And for those who like spicy food, the mala\xa0hotpot is the star of Szechuan cuisine straight from the Szechuan province of China. You get your pick of ingredients such as lotus roots, pork, chicken and mushrooms, and toss them in a special mala sauce of peppers and spices. A refreshing can of Coca-Cola clears the palate every now and then, leaving you ready to savour more of the tasty food.Where to eat: Most foodcourts and hawker centres in Singapore sell this dish, but nothing beats the authentic flavour and ambience in restaurants located in Chinatown, such as Ri Ri Hong Ma La Hotpot.\xa0Thai– Favourite dishes: Phad thai, tom yum goongThai cuisine, with its flavourful mix of sour, sweet, salty and bitter dishes, is the go-to option for when your tastebuds crave for a little bit of everything. You cannot go wrong with tom yum goong (spicy prawn soup) or green curry or phad thai (fried noodles). Be sure to have a cold can of Coca-Cola in hand to counter the spicy mix.Where to eat: Jai Thai offers a wide range of dishes and affordable set meals. Ah Loy Thai is also a popular option with its convenient locations around the island.\xa0Turkish – Favourish dish: KebabTurkish cuisine truly embraces the meaning of “cosmopolitan”. First of all, because of Turkey’s unique geographical location, the birth of Turkish food was the result of a fusion between Central Asian, Caucasian, Middle-Eastern, and Mediterranean cuisines. Next, its popularity has been growing around the world, and Singapore is no exception. Order the lavash (“balloon” bread) with various dips, and a kebab meat platter, to share over some Coca-Cola. Delicious food and drinks for a good night out with friends or loved ones.Where to eat: One needs only to step onto Arab Street to experience the liveliness of Turkish culture, which is similarly embodied in their food.\xa0\xa0Did we get you craving for some international food?

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/shang-pin-hot-pot/:['Shang Pin Hot Pot opened the doors of its second branch at Marina Square earlier this year and not a moment too soon.When the hotpot eatery opened its doors on the second floor of Rendezvous Hotel in 2014, it was hugely popular resulting in long queues for its hotpot offerings. Queues started at 6pm and people queue on average for over two hours.There are a number of reasons why Shang Pin is so popular.One of which is because it is very similar to “that other famous hot pot brand” but with more of a focus on value for money.The other fact is that they get the Szechuan chilli right, something which not many hot pot places in Singapore can boast.\xa0 They use the correct Shi Zhu Hong chilli, with its characteristic rich flesh and fewer seeds, resulting in a potent numbing spiciness.\xa0Their signature and unique tomato soup base is also well-loved as they use organic tomatoes which are cooked over a slow flame for hours. The result is a thick velvety texture with just the right amount of sweetness and sourness to it. The soup is not sieved, so you’ll bite into a few pieces while you tuck into the soup.In line with the opening of their new outlet, they’ve introduced a pig stomach/chicken soup base which is hard to find in Singapore hot pot eateries and they’ve also upped the game for their other soup bases.\xa0Their calcium-rich big bone soup — made from stewed pork bones — takes eight hours of slow cooking and their mushroom soup base is made from five different mushroom/fungi varieties.The restaurant has also gone on a healthier slant — doing away with the traditional beef fat for vegetable oil — as it contains higher levels of good monounsaturated fats.\xa0Besides the very popular\xa0USA beef options, Australian beef tongues and premium lamb shoulder meat,\xa0Shang Pin’s meatballs are also the other big highlight as they are all handmade and they have unique creations like Chicken Corn meatballs and chicken mushroom meatballs.Of course, the Kung fu noodles are always a big highlight as is the Bian Lian Face-changing opera performance which happens daily at 8pm.\xa0The new space at Marina Square is very much welcome as it is twice the size with 38 tables, private rooms and there is a special waiting area, air-conditioned with free snacks and drinks, so you can relax while waiting in line.Great news for parents is that there is a playground area with Lego blocks for your children. A nice touch: kids will get to take away his or her Lego creation as a memento.The other nice touch is their brand new “Quwei” area with odour removal machines which will eliminate all the heavy smells that linger after a hot pot meal.They’ve also pulled out all the stops with a brand new upscale look, so think two-metre tall copper-plated decorative claddings, rosewood panels, custom pendant lighting and marble table tops.\xa0Reserve a table now at Shang Pin Hot Pot for your hot pot fix!Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

Here, the deep-fried pork cutlet is enveloped in a cream-cracker crust before it’s topped with a salted vegetable slaw then placed in a brioche burger bun.A big highlight is the gluttonous BCM Grilled Cheese ($18), made with sourdough bread stuffed with cheese, pork mince and mushroom and is sure to be hot favourite.Loof’s cocktail program is also given the reboot, with Asian-forward creations up for slurps.We loved the Stylo Milo ($19), the ubiquitous Milo spiked with spiced rum, roselle, hazelnut oil, orange and vanilla.The cheekily named PAP — Pineapple Action Party ($36), with cucumber-infused tequila, coconut milk and pineapple, is ideal for sharing.For a quick perk-me-up, order the Kopi Cat (salted caramel-infused vodka, coffee, hazelnut, condensed milk, orgeat and a dash of black salt, $19).\xa0\xa0Loof’s new menu rolls out 1 October 2016Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/hiang-ji-roasted-meat-noodle-house/:['The recommended offerings here include a range of roast meat, such as roast duck, crispy roast pork (siew yuk) and barbequed pork (char siew).While the roast duck and char siew certainly lived up to expectations, the star dish was definitely the prawn dumplings (sui jiao). A single dumpling easily covered the entire base of the Chinese-style soup spoon typically found in such eateries. The filling of this relatively big dumpling was chock-ful of good stuff: a whole prawn, which was fresh and crunchy; marinated meat that was infused with shreds of black fungus and grounded dried cuttlefish, which imparted a distinct umami flavour.We had six pieces of these dumplings that came with the dumpling noodle soup. The noodles were cooked perfectly. It was springy. At $3 for this dish, it’s certainly value-for-money.\xa0Now, back to the meat–the char siew was so good that we concluded it was worth every sinful calorie. It was cut in large bite-sized chunks and not the usual paper-thin slices. The barbeque flavour was obvious, with enough “wok hei” (heat of the wok) to create that smoldering, burnt taste. We appreciated that the meat wasn’t bright red in colour—proof that very little or no colouring was used in the cooking process.\xa0The siew yuk, however, disappointed us. While it passed the taste test, it failed the one for texture. The skin of the pork wasn’t crispy at all and the meat felt like it had been braised instead.The platter of siew yuk and char siew set us back $6.Meanwhile, duck lovers should consider ordering the roast duck noodle ($4). Again, the noodle was done perfectly al-dente. Paired with the special sauce, the dish shined. We could’ve eaten just the saucy noodles alone. We had the breast meat and it was firm without being overly dry. It also didn’t have that “ducky” aroma, thank goodness! The noodles were served with a full-bodied soup that was slurpingly delicious.This dish scored also for good value, coming in at $4 per serving.Overall, Hiang Ji is a simple, non-fussy eatery where the service is polite and efficient.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/wolfgang-lapper-esmirada-group/:['Wolfgang Lapper, chef and co-owner of the Esmirada Group owns eight restaurants including a variety of island-renowned favourites such as Brasserie Wolf and L’Entrepot Bistrot.His chosen career is perhaps unsurprising given that his father was an internationally acclaimed chef and winner of numerous gold medals at the 1965 Cooking Olympics. Earnest and down-to-earth, he talks about his successful career modestly. “I wouldn’t call co-owning eight restaurants a success just yet,” he says.Having recently been introduced to his native-grown wines through Michael Thurner, Wine MBA and CEO of Austria’s Fine Brands, Wolfgang is triumphant about the wine’s quality. Having always been under-represented, the finest Austrian wines are for the first time being brought to Singapore by this latest collaboration between Esmirada Group and Austria’s Fine Brands. One can imagine how excited the Austrian duo must be, when their wine have been compared to – and in some instances surpassed – the finest from France.\xa0\xa0Tell us a little about yourself – where were you born and how did you come to co-own Esmirada Group\nI was born in Innsbruck, Austria, and became an apprentice in 1976 with Peter Leingartner, one of Austria’s leading chefs. In 1984, I travelled out of Europe because I needed a change, and I cooked in various cities over some years, eventually ending up here in Singapore. That is the thing about Austrian chefs – they can go anywhere. Unlike French or Italian chefs, Austrian chefs learn everything—Italian, Spanish, French, and so we are versatile cooks.\xa0Esmirada Group has come a long way from the opening of the first Esmirada restaurant in 1994, to today, owning eight separate venues in Singapore. What’s the secret ingredient to your success?\nI opened Esmirada in 1994 with two partners and it was a big hit back then—it was a real icon for Singapore. We served Mediterranean food, done in a simple and hearty style, and it was the first time Singapore had ever been exposed to its first real concept restaurant, where everything from the tablecloths to the presentation of the food mattered. It was a small and intimate place with 65 seats, but it was full house everyday. With very little competition back then, we grew quickly.But I would say success is relative. My eight restaurants would be successful if they were full everyday, but they are not as it’s unrealistic to expect that in these times. I would say one thing I have learned is that people matter. Whoever you meet, treat them equally and with respect. Everyone, from my serving staff to my investors, has been helpful to the growth of our group. I’m proud to say that our success, if it can be called that, is founded on the loyalty of our patrons and staff.\xa0Have you always been a lover of fine wine? What are some of your favourites and why?\nI always loved wine, even as a poor apprentice who could not afford fine wine. I never understood why people would subject themselves to cheap table wine. I’m a lover of red wine, but I have to say that the discovery of the Austrian whites really amazed me. They’ve come into their own so well that I am really convinced of their quality and proud that such fine wine have come from my country.\xa0Name your favourite Austrian wine and how best to enjoy it.\nMy personal favourite is the Arachon Evolution 2006. As for how best to enjoy it—well, in the Brasserie Wolf of course!\xa0That leads on to the next question: do you tend to pair wines with dishes or the other way around?\nAustrian wines are versatile, and can be paired with many dishes. The grape goes with so many foods. The common rule that red goes with red meat and white with white meat is a fallacy. One should drink based on his personal preference.\xa0You’ve cooked in several top restaurants across the world. Could you describe your signature cooking style, or a signature dish?\nThey used to call me the only ‘ang moh’ who could cook a suckling pig (laughs). But that aside, I don’t really have a signature dish. I retain a love for Italian and Spanish cuisines and ingredients in my cooking — I just love the taste of tomatoes, herbs and garlic!\xa0Esmirada Group boasts quite a range of cuisines under its belt. Any particular reason for choosing to specialise in Spanish and Lebanese cuisines?Like I said, Austrian chefs are highly versatile and trained in a variety of cuisines. I’ve always aimed to create restaurants that have a lifespan—not something trendy or in the moment. I enjoy creating everyday cuisine that people enjoy. I didn’t see Austrian food as something that would be really popular in Singapore, but perhaps that might change.\xa0Why did you choose Singapore as a base and how has it worked out for you?\nI believe we can get anything we want here in Singapore. As long as the customer is willing to pay for it, we can bring it in. But I don’t believe in charging $300 a dish so someone can enjoy shaved truffles on their pasta—it’s just not commercially viable to me.\xa0What’s the most memorable experience you’ve encountered with patrons, staff or media in your years of co-owning Esmirada Group?\nWhen our first restaurant was closed down in Peranakan Place, I was bankrupt and left high and dry. Our patrons invested in us to reopen in Orchard Hotel. Till today, they still have small shares in the group. For me, the most important thing is to make my customers my friends happy.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

The rice cakes have just the right amount of moisture and are firm.Two varieties of tu tu kueh fillings are available, peanut and coconut. Of the two, we preferred the coconut one. The shredded coconut was coated with delicious gula melaka and put in between two layers of rice flour in a flower-shaped metal mould. The filling had just the right amount of sweetness and paired well with the fluffy rice flour cake.The other peanut version had a coarse peanut filling that also had just the right amount of sweetness, but it was a tad dry for our liking. Perhaps this could be fixed by grinding the peanut a little finer.Overall, however, Tan’s version of the tu tu kueh is a great interpretation of this fast-disappearing traditional snack.\xa0\xa0Tan’s Tu Tu Coconut CakeBlk 22B Havelock Road, #01-25 Havelock Cooked Food CentreOpening hours: Mon-Fri: 10am-2.30pm* inSing.com pays for the meals at the places we review.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

The spicy noodle soup stall at Hong Lim Complex serves the popular Singaporean hawker dish with two halves of crayfish, and there is more to this first impression.Their Asian Delight laksa ($3, $4 or $5.50 with crayfish) is a bowl of thinned-out (with coconut milk), light soup, topped with generous servings of chicken strips, prawns, fish cake and tau pok (tofu puffs). Having the shelled crustacean in the bowl does, however, make eating rather messyHawker and stall owner Daniel Soo (he is in his 60s, although really, he looks a decade younger), is health-conscious and believes that the food he sells should be nutritious on top of being delicious, something he’s achieved with his dish of choice.According to Mr Soo, the laksa gravy is cooked using quality ingredients such as scallops, fried oysters, dried prawns and fresh coconut. Refreshing and tasty, the flavour was a cross between the usual laksa and seafood soup. If you like your laksa thick and cholesterol-laden though, this may not be your bowl of curry.Another of Soo’s best-seller is a fruit juice mee siam ($3-$4), where the usual assam is replaced with a “secret formula fruit juice”. He revealed he included mainly “natural ingredients” as it is healthier. We tasted pineapple juice.The gravy is not done with pre-mixes, nor does Soo take any short-cuts\xa0– the laksa is cooked every morning.Famous Sungei Road Trishaw Laksa’s dish is very different from the other versions, the gravy is light on the palate, with a somewhat sweet and tangy aftertaste.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/jacks-place/:['We previously reported that Jack’s Place would be transforming its oldest surviving oldest outlet into 1980s retro for only a week (29 August to 4 September) as part of their 50th anniversary celebrations, complete with a recreation of some of the old forgotten classic dishes of yesteryear, we had to pop down to experience it for ourselves and the experience definitely didn’t disappoint.If you grew up eating at Jack’s Place, visiting their Bras Basah Complex outlet this week will definitely invoke feelings of deep nostalgia with a slew of retro dishes and all the familiar trappings.Step in and be greeted by waitresses clad in traditional Malay sarong kebayas (Malay ethnic garments), something which all Jack’s Place waitresses all wore from the time the steakhouse chain started operations in 1966 until the 1990s when they were phased out for the current uniforms.Over at one corner are a collection of vintage memorabilia from various promotions the restaurant held over the years. Aside from the numerous achievements the restaurant have garnered over the many years like the awards for Singapore Promising Brands three years in a row, also displayed are a collection of old photographs and old newspaper clippings on Jack’s Place.Look out for the collection of festive mugs which they issued every year since 1988 until the early 2000s and the customised silver cutlery with their own customised engravings which read “J.P. STEAKHOUSE”.What really made us feel like we have time travelled back 30 years ago is the old leather-bound menu from the late 1980s that was standard at every Jack’s Place restaurant — it revealed what the prices dishes used to be. Not only were steak items more localised like the Fire Steak (flamed with brandy) and Sambal Steak (topped with spicy sambal sauce), they cost a mere $20 back then. A steak at Jack’s Place now costs $29.50 and upwards.Savour the look of their table setting — where napkins are folded, cutlery laid out and the tables are covered with checkered\xa0green and white cloths. This format is available at some of their 17 outlets across Singapore but will be phased out for something more modern in 2017.Thankfully, not everything will be modernised. Their signature steak dishes which come with a whole baked potato and on a sizzling hotplate with bull motifs will remain unchanged. Good news for longtime fans of Jack’s Place.The highlight of the visits were of course the bringing back of the old retro dishes like the Classic Carpetbag Steak ($30.50), a traditional American steak dish of the 1950s where oysters are stuffed in-between a grilled beef tenderloin.Essentially just an oyster and sliced mushrooms stuffed inside a tenderloin steak — 100 per cent grass-fed chilled beef from New Zealand — the beefy flavour of steak and the seafood flavour of oyster makes for a more complex and robust flavour.Of course, the brown steak sauce is always a signature favourite at Jack’s Place and if you’re a regular, you’ll always know to ask for an extra bowl of the sauce because one bowl is never enough. The other highlight is their baked potato with sour cream, spring onions and bacon bits that are not just plain ole bacon bits. They have been ground up, fried to a crisp and mixed with bacon fat and makes the baked potato wonderfully rich and moreish.The other throwback dish is the east-meets-west\xa0Grilled Ikan Kurau with watercress sauce ($20.80). The lightly savoury watercress savoury does well in enhancing the lovely sweet flesh of local ikan kurau (Indian threafdfin).The restaurant has also brought back retro starters which you can’t find in most steakhouses anymore like the classic prawn cocktail. Called the Jack’s Prawn & Mango Cocktail ($9.80), cabbage with Thousand Island sauce sit in a half-shell mango skin with boiled prawns and topped with intricately sliced mangos. A spritz of lemon on the side is great as it balances out the taste which is predominantly savoury and fruity.The Oyster Mornay ($13.80 for four) is also another starter they have brought back. They bake oysters in their shell with a mountain of melted mozzarella cheese and seasoned tomato sauce for a rich, cheesy and seafood-stock flavour that can’t be beat.Don’t dishearten if you miss the week-long promotion as the special menu will be made available to all of their 17 outlets from 1 September to 31 October 2016.Oh and happy 50th, Jack’s Place.\xa0Here’s to the next 50 years.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/kazo/:['Part pillowy croissant, part crumbly polo (pineapple) bun, full-on salted egg yolk yumminess —say hi to the Golden Lava Polo.The pastry is offered at Kazo, a bakery located in Chinatown Point that opened in January 2018.Kazo is launched in partnership with Taiwanese brand\xa0Nichifu, which also offers the same pastry in Taiwan.\n\nIngredients here are imported from Taiwan to ensure quality is as close to that of the original version.Judging by the\xa0salted egg craze\xa0that has swept over Singapore, it seems like a smart business move on the part of Kazo to capitalise on this trend, which still shows no signs of waning in popularity.Kazo’s Golden Polo Bun ($3 per piece) is very similar to a\xa0salted egg yolk croissant, except that the outermost layer of its shell is crumbly, just like a polo bun.Underneath the polo bun-esque layer is the characteristically flaky layers of a croissant.And at the core of the pastry is a pool of oozy salted egg yolk custard, whose subtle sweetness melds well with its savoury notes.It didn’t disappoint us.Besides the Golden Polo Buns, Kazo also offers Japanese-inspired Hokkaido Cream Polo bun ($3) — think Hokkaido cream puffs with a crumbly polo bun exterior.In keeping with the Japanese tradition, the Hokkaido Cream Polo contains cream that is not too sweet or cloying; its lightness makes downing a few at a go perfectly okay.You can have the polo bun as a cool treat too – Kazo offers the Premium Ice Cream Polo ($5.50), which comes with two scoops of ice cream.For something more bite-sized, turn to the Crispy Puff ($1.80), which is basically a crispy choux pastry.Besides the fact that it sports a harder shell instead of the usual puffy, fluffy one, the Crispy Puff is also similarly airy and light inside.You can have it in three flavours: original (cream), matcha, or milk.The matcha flavour here is also pretty light, neither too sweet or bitter.\xa0Similar to the Crispy Puff is the Kazu Kazu ($3.50 per piece), which comes in a churro-shaped body instead of a globe-shaped one.Its exterior is embedded with almond bits for extra crunch and flavour.According to Kyenne Lee, one of the founders of Kazo, the cream found in the Kazu Kazu is also more premium than the one in the Crispy Puff, thanks to the more laborious whipping method used.\xa0You can also find cheese tarts ($3.20) here, which are simple but decently executed.The cheese tarts come in original, matcha, and chocolate flavours.The original and chocolate flavours are decent, if ordinary, though their matcha cheese tart took us by surprise.It toes the balance between sweet and sour, and is far more cheesy than matcha-y — if you’re a green tea purist, this one’s definitely not for you.But Kazo’s matcha cheese tart is also a refreshing departure from the usual ones you can find at most Japanese bakeries.\xa0Aside from snacks, Kazo will also offer the Kazo Man ($2.80 each).This is basically Matcha Latte or Organic Soya Bean drink served in a more-funny-than-sexy collectible bottle.The bottle is fashioned into the likeness of a human body (complete with abs and without the genitals… so definitely family-friendly).The matcha latte is definitely the sweetest item we’ve had at Kazo, but it’s still not too sugary.Still, if you want your abs, you might want to stick to the organic soya bean drink, which they make daily in-house. Both taste good.\xa0**When we visited Kazo two weeks after it opened, there was already a steady stream of customers there.We’re not surprised. Kazo is not all style and no substance — while it does peddle many faddish items, the quality of its snacks is good.Munching on their snacks is going to give you anything but a six-pack, but at least the calories are well spent.\xa0Address: 133 New Bridge Road, #01-30, Chinatown Point, Singapore 059413\nOpening hours: Mon-Sun — 10am to 9:30pmAuthor© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/garang-grill/:['Eastside diners may remember way back in 2017 when New Ubin Seafood opened Garang Grill at Swan Lake Avenue in 2017.Initially a three-month popup, it was done in collaboration with Slake’s head chef Jeremy Cheok and it had quite an eclectic menu encompassing all sorts of cuisines from Asian to western but with grilled food as the unifying theme.Garang Grill proved so popular that the three month period was extended to almost three years until December 2019 when it finally ended. For good so we thought.Eleven months later, the grill concept is now resurrected and incorporated into New Ubin’s new eastside location called New Ubin Village — a 5,700 square feet canteen in an industrial estate in Tampines.Now all three New Ubin concepts — New Ubin Seafood, UbinEast and Garang Grill — are in the same location and when you dine here, you can pick your favourites from both Garang Grill and New Ubin Seafood menus.Helming the kitchen is now New Ubin Seafood’s head chef, Cole Soo who started working alongside Cheok at Garang Grill back in 2017.Soo has also condensed the Garang menu and now it is almost a “best of” what was popular at Garang Grill.Along with the move, they have also invested in a $16,000 charcoal grill oven by Spanish brand Mibrasa which boasts the ability to deliver an intense heat of charcoal flame in an enclosed oven.And the effect of the oven really shows in many of the dishes throughout the menu — especially in the starters that Garang Grill has to offer.\nThe Crispy Pork Jowl (S$12) is sous vide-d for half a day before it’s coated in a special flour mix, deep-fried then finished off in the Mibrasa oven and the very smoky, charcoal flavour along with the juiciness and tenderness of the meat is pretty impressive.There is a miso and gula melaka dipping sauce on the side and that nicely complements each slice with additional savoury and deep sweet flavours — its kind of a char siu from an alternate universe and it works very well.\nThe effect of the oven also can be seen in the treatment of their all-time favourite Togarashi Corn (S$9) — it is intensely-roasted sweet pearl corn to a smoky char then it is finished with a sprinkling of house-smoked sea salt and a dash of Japanese togarashi powder.The corn comes almost raw, but has a very potent vegetable sweetness. With that additional deep smoky flavour and spicy chilli, it makes for a nicely moreish bite that is pretty unusual.\nThe grilled meats in the main dish section are also nicely executed — BBQ Pork Belly ($21) and grass-fed Argentina Striploin ($38) both with a lovely char on top and with decently tender, moist textures.The sweet potato mash and Garang slaw — coleslaw with very delicate sweet and sour flavours — on the side was something a little refreshing from the standard mashed potato and coleslaw.\nIf you prefer something a little more familiar, they have the the La Galbi Beef (S$18) — Korean-style beef short ribs marinated in a sweet and savoury garang sauce, barbecued and served with iceberg lettuce as a do-it-yourself lettuce wrap with some additional sliced green chilli for a kick of spice.\nNot much seafood is featured on Garang’s menu (for that you order from New Ubin Seafood) but the one dish that they do have — the Garang Prawn ($15) is very nicely done.It features crispy fried prawns served with an interesting sambal mayonnaise.\nThere is also one dish that is of note — the Chilli Crab Rillette (S$12) takes New Ubin Seafood’s chilli crab sauce and tweaks the balance of tomato paste, sambal and crab with alot of butter and served with deep-fried mantou.It sounds overly rich but the crab flavours are lovely and they’ve kept the sweetness down and the slightly sour tomato flavour keeps the oil-richness in check.\xa0\xa0Garang Grill is available for dine-in, takeaway and island wide delivery.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/singapore-foodie/:['Think Singapore is the best city for food? So do the rest of its food-savvy population, and a growing number of the food-obsessed who are also unabashedly opinionated about it.\xa0Get with the program – we show you how you can blend in with the restless makan-centric (‘eat-centric’) denizens and where you can give your two cents’ worth in less than ten steps:\xa01. Do not leave home without a packet of tissues\nThis – and two cameras – make up the arsenal of a Singapore foodie. By that we mean at least one packet of tissue papers (see point number 2), a pocket-sized digital camera (or phone camera) and an SLR camera. Do not panic if you’ve left your wipes at home – hunt down the tissue auntie, or uncle, at the hawker centre and beat the rest of the chope-ers.\nTip: The going rate for tissue papers is three packets for $1; bargain only if they’re peddling three for $2 – any price lower and you’re cheap and uncouth.\xa02. ‘Chope’\n‘Chope’. For the uninitiated, it’s a Singlish term for ‘hold a seat’ and has to be pronounced and done with some aggression; wishy-washiness will leave you hungry, literally. Start by getting to the hawker centre or food court, hone in on an empty seat, and swiftly leave your tissue packet on the table. You have now chope-d your seat and can roam the stalls to your stomach’s content. Hawker centre and food court diners know to abide by this code and you’ll be able to come back to your unclaimed seat with your tray of hot piping food\nTip: Chope-ing is most efficiently done solo, never try to chope a chope-d seat, and don’t do this at restaurants.\xa03. Wear comfortable shoes\nSee next point.\nTip: Floors do get slippery so for once Crocs may actually apply.\xa04. Always join the long queues\nLong queues equals good food – that’s a formula that almost never fails. You might doubt your ability to gauge the quality of a stall, but the dozens of hungry and eager Singaporeans can’t be wrong. If the food is bad, at least you have fodder for points numbers 5 and 8.\nTip:  Get a conversation going with a fellow queue-mate so you suss out the secret special by the time it is your turn.5. Social media before eating\n“Singaporeans are so passionate about food you can’t shut them up”\nContrary to what mother says, do let your food get cold. There are a few social media points Singapore foodies need to hit before tucking in: at the most basic level, you have to tweet, update your Facebook status and post one, or more, mouth-watering photo(s) of the dish on Instagram (these can be linked so one post will update all three outlets simultaneously). We like the ‘Hefe’ filter on Instagram, but hey, whatever looks most enticing. At the intermediate level, whip out the digital SLR –\xa0à la Dr Leslie Tay – and take close-up high-res shots for further documentation to be posted as Facebook notes, on the personal food blog or website.\nTip: Instagram’s black and white filter tends to kill hungry desires – do not use.\xa06. It’s okay to talk with your mouth full\nSingaporeans are so passionate about food you can’t shut them up, even when they’re supposed to be enjoying the food. So don’t try to beat them, join them, and learn to use the right words: ‘delicious’ is passé – ‘shiok’ (Singlish expression for happiness and pleasure), ‘sedap’ (Malay for ‘delicious) and ‘jelak’ (Malay for ‘bored’, also a Singlish expression for the feeling of monotony and heaviness a dish brings about) are good starting points. It also helps that you know the ingredients in the native language. For example, fermented prawn paste is ‘belacan’ in the Malay language. Another important term to know is ‘dabao’ (Mandarin for ‘takeaway’) – for busy mealtimes during which you can’t find a seat and need to eat at the desk. Don’t forget to post on your social media accounts before you tuck in, and try not to project(ile) your chews.\nTip: If all the above foodie vocab isn’t impressive enough, just let out a loud burp – it’s considered polite to do so in India, China, Canada and Germany.\xa07. Be generous, show off\nSingapore foodies are competitive, but they’re also a generous bunch and fortunately these qualities do meet in various outlets: aside from talking about makan achievements over the dining table, stunning, saliva-inducing pictures, reviews and comments of restaurants and dining establishments can be posted on community websites.\nTip:\xa0HungryGoWhere.com is our choice (for obvious reasons), and it’s not simply for sharing reviews – our sister site and app give us accurate, on-the-ground recommendations on where to eat.\xa08. Do stare\nAt the food on the next table – this is a sure-fire way to find out what you should order. But please, if you have questions, ask the diner – they won’t bite (you); most locals are friendly and will give you more ordering tips than you ask for.\nTip:\xa0Be friendly enough and you might even end up sitting with them, making point number 2 obsolete.\xa09. It’s never too early to eat\nBeing full is never an excuse; a conscientious Singapore foodie knows it’s never too early to plan your next meal, and thus not premature to start staring down new leads. How to succeed in good Singapore eating without really trying: keep talking to friends, competitors and strangers – you never know where your next meal will come from.\nTip:\xa0And read inSing.com for all the best recommendations on what to eat and drink in Singapore.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

American Express Cardmembers enjoy dining privileges at these restaurants.\xa0House\n‘Kong bak pau’ at the barracks\nThis former British military barracks has been transformed into the huge 35,000 square feet House, with a touch of quirkiness and a sense of old-English comfort. You can choose to sit at the outdoor café, which overlooks a large space of soothing greenery. House is operated by the Spa Esprit Group, and it makes good sense to have a spa or nail treatment upstairs before heading for wine and drinks.Although the ambience in House exudes a largely English feel, the Asian delicacies dish up a local touch. We recommend the Asian Sliders ($23), more commonly known as ‘kong bak pau’ – pork belly cuts braised with dark soya sauce and stuffed into steaming hot white buns. The lip-smacking pork belly melts in your mouth while the soft and fluffy buns will leave you equally light on your feet. The crispy taro fries sides are wickedly addictive too.American Express Cardmembers enjoy 10 per cent savings on their total bill with a minimum spend of $100. Terms and conditions apply.House | Address: 8D Dempsey Road, Levels 1 & 2 | Tel: 64757787 | Opening hours: Mon-Fri noon-10.30pm, Sat-Sun 9am-10.30am \xa0\xa0Loco Modern Tapas and Wine Bar\nAngus beef by the river\nWe love the idea of having tapas al fresco style while slurping sangria along the river front area of Boat Quay, overlooking the museums and the Singapore Flyer. While Boat Quay is usually a buzzing place, especially during weekday nights, Loco Modern Tapas has found itself a quieter spot in the middle for nibbles, ice cold beers and wines at an affordable price from $45 per bottle.Loco Modern Tapas and Wine Bar (which used to be known as Loco Spanish Tapas Bar) has moved away from traditional Spanish tapas, featuring miniature versions of contemporary dishes instead, such as mini beef sliders, baked escargots, and sautéed tiger prawns. The Angus beef tenderloin cubes ($15) are worth a try. Offered up in bite-sized morsels, the servings remain surprisingly tender and juicy. They are good to ‘pop’ down with wine, and suitable for those who prefer cutesy portions compared to beefy cuts.American Express Cardmembers enjoy 15 per cent savings on their total bill. This offer is valid until 31 July 2013 and extends to regular priced items only. \xa0Terms and conditions apply.Loco Modern Tapas Bar\xa0| 48 Boat Quay | Tel: 65352841 | Opening hours: Mon-Sat 11:30am-midnight\xa0\xa0The Merry Men\nMini-burgers in a warehouse\nParked alongside the Singapore River, a restaurant whose name reflects the personae of the people who started it – The Merry Men – serves up simple yet quality tapas and drinks at affordable prices. The premise used to be a warehouse, but is now a relaxing bar with a rustic feel at Robertson Quay.Down a glass of their signature black forest mojito ($15)\xa0– a hand-muddled drink complete with a ‘forest’ of fresh berries\xa0– and sink your teeth into the beef and blue cheese mini burgers ($14). The delectable butter roll buns will not fail to delight your palate while the allure of the truffle-scented fries will have you reaching for mouthfuls.American Express Cardmembers enjoy 10 per cent savings on food and beverages.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/killiney-curry-puff/:['Rating: 4/5\xa0Although most of my makan sessions come through recommendations, every now and again, I stumble on a ‘bloggable’ stall simply by chance. This stall is one example, but there is another interesting story behind this stall.It happened one Sunday afternoon as I was making my way to the area to meet up with the camera crew to shoot an episode for Discovery Travel and Living. My attention was turned to the tray of curry puffs that had just been fried and they looked irresistible. So I succumbed to the craving and bought a few. They turned out to be really good.The Malays usually call curry puffs epok epok. Epok is the Malay word for “fold over”. The Malays sometimes called the triangle ones “karipap” while the Chinese call the thick skinned ones “Kali-pok”. Personally I like the Malay version because the crust is thin and crispy, so you can afford to eat a few and not feel too full.The secret of a good epok epok is to eat it fresh out of the fryer. That means that you either need to get them at the stall early in the morning or find a stall that has a high turnover throughout the day, like this one. The filling was made with the local “Holland” potatoes which are ideal to produce a creamy and spicy sweet filling that goes so well with the thin and crispy crust. The final icing on the cake or in this case, puff, was a sweet and fragrant sambal tumis, with a hot cup of teh tarik! Although the makchik here told me that epok epok is not meant to be taken with sambal tumis, many people, including myself like it that way.\xa0\xa0You might find it incredulous to find vadai (pronounced Waday). at a Malay stall, but they do sell vadai here! Why? Because the Malay lady married a Baba and somewhere up the family tree, there was an Indian. For a stall that calls itself Killiney Curry Puffs, you would be surprised that it is the vadai which is the real star. The dough was light and airy and the crust thin and crispy. The flavour was just right and it had that extra oomph! They also sell other staple Malay fare like lontong, mee rebus and mee siam.\xa0\xa0Killiney Curry Puff\n93 Killiney Road\nOpening hours: 7am-7:30pmAuthor© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/mei-zhen-hakka-delicacies/:['Overall rating: 3.3 out of 5\xa0Ask a Chinese person what suan pan zi is and she will probably tell you it’s an abacus, an old, manual calculator. Like with most characters in the Mandarin, suan pan zi (a gnocchi-like dumpling dish made from yam) is also a dish. This is so-named because of the dumplings’ resemblance to the beads on an abacus. Usually eaten during Chinese New Year, suan pan zi is one of few hawker foods that is of Hakka origin.However, it has not received the mainstream acceptance of other starchy hawker foods like carrot cake or the heavily-franchised chwee kueh (steamed rice flour cakes with pickled turnip). It could be that this dish is not easily found outside home kitchens\xa0— there are probably no more than five places that sell suan pan zi in the city, not all located in hawker centres.A good example of ‘abacus beads’ can be found at Shunfu Mart Food Centre. Mei Zhen Hakka Delicacies’ suan pan zi ($3.50/$5/$6) are resilient enough they yield to the teeth without sticking and are satisfyingly chewy. Crunchy black fungus strips provide contrasting textures and dried mushroom slices and dried shrimps supply an umami kick to complete the experience.It’s the texture of the abacus beads that separates the wheat from the chaff: these individual dumplings need to be slightly bouncy, not sticky and definitely not overly chewy. Good dumplings require special handmade dough made of steamed mashed yam that is kneaded painstakingly with rice flour and water to form enough gluten to give the dough its trademark bite. Precise portions of each ingredient are integral to attaining this pleasing texture. If that sounds like a lot of work just for one dish, it is. And Mei Zhen uses this dough for more than just abacus dumplings.The Lakeview area stall also serves a mean soon kueh (steamed half-moon shaped dumplings generally filled with turnips, carrots and black fungus) that utilises this dough. Although soon kueh isn’t Hakka in origin, the thinly-rolled yam dough makes excellent skin. The snack is stuffed with the same clean bites of savoury turnip and black fungus that you find in other good soon kuehs but the skin is chewier. The end product is a soon kueh unlike any other I’ve ever eaten. I highly recommend you to try it at least once.These small eats represent an oft-ignored portion of our Singaporean culinary heritage, and it’s hard to fathom why; these dishes can more than hold their own against other starchy breakfast favourites with their clean simple flavours that hearken back to cleaner simpler times. If you’re in the area one morning and you’re keen to try something different, try this.\xa0Other ratings:\nFood: 4/5\nValue: 3/5\nService: Average\xa0\xa0Mei Zhen Hakka Delicacies | Address: #02-26 Shunfu Mart Food Centre, Blk 320 Shunfu Road | Tel: 97932189 | Opening hours: Wed–Sun 7.30am–2pmAuthor© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/robins-eurasian-recipes-quentins/:['Curry feng, devil’s curry and sugee cake–these are all well-loved Eurasian dishes. Now, you can cook these dishes, which are the result of a fusion of European and Asian cultures, at home.Recently, 38-year-old chef Quentin Pereira and his father, Robin, launched their compilation of authentic, traditional, Eurasian recipes. Robin’s Eurasian Recipes contains Robin’s personal collection of recipes handed down from his mother and other relatives.Chef Quentin–who owns Quentin’s, the only full Eurasian restaurant in Singapore–speaks to us about his passion in promoting Eurasian food and culture.\xa0What made you decide to compile a book of traditional Eurasian recipes?Eurasian recipes are family heirlooms that will always be passed down to the children. As they are very heavily guarded, it is up to the individual whether he wants to share the recipes or not. When I was approached by Epigram and the National Heritage Board to do this project, I asked my father whether he was willing to part with his recipes. He said okay, so I compiled the book, which will be archived and serves as a reference for future generations.\xa0Did you make any changes to the recipes to make it more accessible to home cooks?Yes, I simplified the recipes.Many of the recipes would refer you to another recipe but minus one ingredient. Some recipes would say to follow the same process, but remove one ingredient and add another. So, I had to go back to my Dad to figure out how these recipes should actually be followed.I also put in measurements. Some recipes called for things like “five cents tumeric”. That’s quite difficult thing to gauge, but since I’m running a restaurant, I know the rough amount in today’s terms, so I added it in.But actually, the recipes are just guides. Home cooks should modify it to their tastes.\xa0What are your future plans for the book and will there be another edition? Quentin’s [restaurant] has now teamed-up with the Eurasian Association to form a cooking school to teach recipes from the book. You will be able to see exactly how we make the food featured in the book.Yes, I intend to write a second book, but it will be on my personal take on Eurasian food. It will also feature a bit of history about the food. But that project is still in its infancy.\xa0You said you learnt how to cook from your father. Tell us how you cooked your way up to owning what is said to be Singapore’s best and only Eurasian restaurant?As a child, I used to watch my father when he cooked. I experimented in the kitchen too. But it was when we opened a stall selling Eurasian food at Changi Business Park in 2000 that I really learned from my Dad.At first, he did everything! I just watched.Then after that, I cut the onions. Even cutting the onions took some time because he is so particular. You cannot cut them too fat, neither can you cut them too thin. And if he wants them a certain way, and you cut them another way, he won’t use the onions!But I had no choice. I wanted to learn, so I had to follow exactly what he did.Slowly, I started cooking. It took us about six to eight months before my Dad stopped coming to the stall every day. That’s how I became independent.\xa0Did your father’s insistence on quality and standards influence the way you run Quentin’s?Yes, definitely. When I first started at Changi Business Park, I was losing money every day, but he still insisted on never cutting corners. We always had the best ingredients and the quality must always be there.That’s what I’ve learnt and practiced, up until today. At the restaurant, we may see how we can save time and innovate on certain processes but we still maintain a high standard.\xa0What were the challenges facing Quentin’s in the early days and how did you overcome it?I first started the business with two friends. But after six months, they bailed out.The only thing that kept me going was that the restaurant was under my name. I said to myself that as much as I can, I will push on and struggle until I succeed.A lot of people don’t know about Eurasian food. But I believe I can educate people, and when they know and like Eurasian food, I will succeed. If I don’t persevere and promote Eurasian cuisine, nobody else is going to do it. The Eurasian community is growing smaller so in a way, I am doing it partly for Eurasians as well.\xa0What is so special about Eurasian cuisine, in your opinion?Eurasian food is European food with Asian influence. Long ago, the Europeans like the Portuguese, travel to Asia to look for spices so these dishes we enjoy now are their recipes originally.Take for example, curry devil. It has the European influence of smokiness in the form of bacon bones and ham hock. The Asian influence comes from the ginger onions, chillis and mustard seeds. It is a real Eurasian dish.\xa0What is a typical day like for you?I’m here at the restaurant from 7am or 9am every day. In the morning, I usually reply to my emails. These days, I don’t cook as often anymore, but I still make the rempah and some pastes myself. I have a team of four in the kitchen and they have got the recipes and the cooking down to a science.I’m here till 10.30pm or 11pm and I will entertain my guests. I still cook for big events. Some guests will also insist I cook for them, and surprisingly, they know it when it wasn’t me who prepared their food!\xa0What are your future plans for Quentin’s?We are in the process of finalising our expansion plans. We will be opening at least one more Quentin’s restaurant by the end of the year.Personally, I am also starting filming for my own show on TV. It will be aired on Okto in July and it will be called “The Skinny Chef”.\xa0Father (Robin Pereira) shares…\xa0Why did you decide to share your recipe collection?Eurasian recipes are traditions passed down from generation to generation. They are like a guide, you don’t have to live by every word in the recipe, do play around with them.If we don’t compile this recipe book, our Eurasian recipes may all disappear. And there are already many recipes that families have lost.\xa0All these years of being a well-known cook in the Eurasian community, why didn’t you open your own restaurant?I only cook at home. I also do catering for my friends’ parties and the church. I was also the pioneer chef at my friend’s restaurant in Joo Chiat called Casa Bom Vento. I helped them for three months. I instructed the crew, gave them the recipes but my children said to me, “Daddy, we need you to cook at home! We are eating rubbish at home!”So until today, I still cook at home. My wife and I also cook for the church.I love cooking, that’s all.\xa0What would be a good introduction to Eurasian food for newbies?I would cook you a stew with beef, called Smore. This is a good introduction because it is not very spicy. A lot of Eurasian food is very spicy. So, I make sure you enjoy the food.Another one is ambilla kacang. This is a dish made with pork bones and long beans. It can also be made with beef.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

Calling it “grandma’s recipe” lends a traditional homecooked flavour that just makes it sound more mouth-watering.In the case of Zhao An Granny Grass Jelly, “granny” isn’t inserted as part of the stall’s name just for the sake of making it sound enticingly homemade. “Granny” is actually the owner’s late grandmother, who started peddling chin chow back in 1946 when street hawkers plied Beach Road. Madam Sim Sai Geok retired when she was 68 and today, her grandson, Yeo Hwee Seng, 48, runs the stalls with relatives. As a tribute to Madam Sim, a photo of “beloved granny” is displayed at the stall.The grass jelly is handmade daily at the stall and its recipe harks back to the days when Grandma Sim first sold her chin chow. While it’s smooth and slippery as you would expect chin chow to be, Zhao An’s version is more concentrated in flavour with a delightful springy texture. It’s also not too sweet with a soft hint of pandan leaf fragrance.A chilled cup of grass jelly ($1) is heaven on a hot, sweltering day.

The trend seems to be getting more pronounced in recent years, as we see more and more popular homegrown eateries or heritage brands calling it a day, citing reasons such as the need to take a break or rising costs.\xa0That said, fans of the legendary Foong Kee Traditional Charcoal Roaster at Keong Saik Road have something to cheer about!After the beloved roast meat specialist shuttered in 2021, many weren’t sure if it would return. Its chef-owner Derrick Wong did say in news reports that he “just needed rest” after more than 20 years in the business, and did not rule out the possibility of starting again.Good news: Foong Kee is back, this time as a hawker stall at Commonwealth Crescent Market and Food Centre! Coincidentally, this was its old location before it moved to Keong Saik Road in the 2000s.Located on the second storey of the food centre, the new stall is right beside affordable burger darlings Hammee’s Burgers.Foong Kee has been an icon in the industry and is known for its decadent Cantonese-style charcoal-roasted meats.Even though Keong Saik regulars may fondly remember the stall’s signature noodles and dumplings, the new stall does not seem to offer the option of noodles — at least, not at the moment.But you’d still be able to indulge in its roast meats, with prices starting from S$4 for a plate of char siew rice or roast pork rice. You can also opt for the best of both worlds with a plate of char siew and roast pork rice (S$5.50).\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Junction Westgate opening with promos; will house 23 tenants, including new halal teppanyaki\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHawker Hustlers: Hipster hawker Ray Yeo of Bei-Ing Dimsum Club on reinventing dim sum and his love for all things Japan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFoong Kee’s char siew, in particular, is adored by many roast meat lovers.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/ten-plus/:['A visit to Ten+ starts with a semantical dilemma: Is it “Tent” or “Ten Plus”? It was a question I asked the cashier at the end of my dinner, curious to unearth the mystery of its moniker.\xa0“Ten Plus,” he says.\xa0“But actually, it was supposed to be ‘Tent’ because the concept of this restaurant is about glamping,” he adds, pointing me to the outdoor area that’s been jazzed up with fairy lights and canopy.\xa0It was a pity it rained on the evening of my visit, or else this would’ve been a much different experience.\xa0The naming confusion is understandable. Less astute diners would assume “Ten Plus”, as the bistro’s Instagram account is named. But stop for a minute and ask yourself: What does Ten Plus even mean?Opened in January, Ten+ is an outdoorsy bistro at 65 Sungei Tengah Road, within the compound of the newly built World Farm & Hua Hng Trading, a 10-minute drive from the bustling Lot One Shoppers’ Mall in Choa Chu Kang.\xa0On Instagram, Ten+ prides itself on being a safari-themed bistro set in nature, offering a camp-like dining experience with an East-meets-West menu. In reality, the bistro is a more bar-leaning, beer-on-tap outfit where the beverage informs the food on offer.\xa0Take, for instance, the crispy pork knuckle (S$32) served with a side of kimchi (Ten+ calls it Asian slaw) and a smoky-sweet mustard jus. It’s deep-fried and larger than life, and I cannot think of anything better to go with a tall pint of craft beer.\xa0Still, while large, I’m surprised that this shows up at the table a mere five minutes upon ordering — proof that it isn’t prepared a la minute. Not that I minded because this came suitably seasoned, fragrant and well-marinated, with an earth-shatteringly crispy skin.\xa0I also liked the baked snapper with sambal aioli (S$23), though it looked somewhat out of place on a menu of easy-to-digest items.\xa0A snapper loin is baked and served on a bed of sweet pumpkin mash with a generous smear of sambal aioli on top. It’s a plate of bright colours and equally bright flavours that would fit perfectly in a formal restaurant, I reckon.But while I admire the courage to serve something so delicate in a casual and convivial setting, I would have preferred it if the snapper was cooked a minute less. It tastes a tad overcooked with flesh that has too much bite.The crispy kawa ebi (S$15) is the perfect example of a bar snack. (Though addictive, it was strangely the last to arrive — after a pork knuckle, baked snapper and chicken karaage.) This has a hint of truffle and smokiness to it that made it so crazy-good to munch on.What would make this even better is a dollop of mayonnaise — a request I had to make three times to three different members of the crew.\xa0Given that the bistro wasn’t crowded, it’s hard to imagine what could’ve led to this oversight, apart from forgetfulness and less-than-stellar communication.\xa0The two green-tea-based mocktails I ordered made refreshing drinks for a balmy night. I had the Watermelon Quench (S$9), a delightful burst of bright citrus flavours from the watermelon, sundried orange and lemon juice.\xa0Still, I much preferred the Firecracker (S$9), which had osmanthus tea and red grapefruit for a slightly bitter edge, which I enjoyed thoroughly.\xa0I ordered the Szechuan “mala” karaage (S$13, any two sides for S$20), because I haven’t yet found a mala chicken I didn’t enjoy.\xa0That this was made with thick chunks of karaage made the choice that much easier. Unfortunately, this was perfunctory.\xa0The dish is what you get when you do a careless and casual stir-fry of already-cooked chicken karaage with Szechuan spices. It results in two separate things put together in a bowl without both elements cohering.\xa0On its own, the chicken is flavourful. Yet it desperately needed a fiercer and more intentional mala toss, so that the spices coat every surface area of the chicken. You get only a hint of the mala scent, which is hardly enough to call this a mala dish.\xa0It’s such a shame, given this had so much potential.Is it conducive to conversation? Yes. The seats were adequately far apart. It helps, too, that the bistro is located far away from major roads and buildings.\xa0Is a reservation necessary? No reservations are needed.\xa0How to get there? Unfortunately, there’s really no other way to get here unless you drive or take a Grab ride.\xa0\xa0HungryGoWhere paid for its meal at this bistro for this review. Still hungry?

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/wong-fu-fu-singapore/:['We know Singaporeans love their bubble tea, but how much BBT can you drink in one sitting?\xa0A lot, according to new Taiwanese restaurant Wong Fu Fu. It is offering an all-you-can-drink bubble tea option — the dream of many a sweet-toothed Singaporean.The new 45-seat restaurant is slated to open on Feb 23, and its main selling point? Sizzling, aromatic Taiwanese-inspired hot plate dishes, accompanied by free-flow beverages including the beloved bubble milk tea.Simply pick a main dish (prices starting from S$24.90) at Wong Fu Fu, and you’d get access to a mini buffet bar, along with bottomless drink options.The menu is kept streamlined with a selection of eight different mains served on a blisteringly hot plate, each customisable according to diners’ preferred carbs and sauces.Protein choices range from Taiwanese classics such as Taiwan fried chicken (S$25.90) and three cup chicken (S$24.90), to more luxe options such as grilled salmon (S$28.90) and striploin steak (S$27.90).\xa0There’s even an Impossible plant-based hamburg (S$25.90) for vegetarians and vegans. The restaurant strives to be as inclusive as possible — it is Muslim-friendly and in the process of obtaining its halal certification.After choosing the protein, diners are given their pick of carbs:\xa0Taiwan pearl rice, Taiwan egg fried rice, pasta, and udon.There’s also an option to choose up to two sauces that include signature brown sauce, black pepper sauce, mushroom sauce and vegetarian-friendly tomato sauce.After the mains are settled, you can then move on to the highlight — Wong Fu Fu’s bottomless DIY bubble milk tea station.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/catbake/:['With a name like Catbake, you’d expect the cafe to be decked out in feline motifs, from the wallpaper to the furniture used in-store.\xa0This cafe, however, is far from gaudy with its voguish interior. The inside is decorated with dark walls, wooden accents and dramatic lights, giving it a sophisticated appearance.Catbake is helmed by patissier-cum-chef Shinya Tajima who has almost 20 years of experience under his belt. Chef Tajima had owned more than 200 F&B outlets in Japan at the peak of his career.\xa0Despite his lustrous achievements, what he is most known for is being the creator of the neko shokupan, a cat-shaped Japanese milk bread loaf. This beloved item saw phenomenal success, becoming a trend throughout the country, even reaching global audiences.\xa0Feline enthusiasts who’ve always wanted to get their paws on a loaf will be glad to hear that this popular item will now be readily available at Catbake.\xa0The loaves are baked fresh in store throughout the day and come in three flavours: A classic white (S$8.80), chocolate chip (S$10.80) or raisin and walnut (S$11.80).\xa0The famous neko shokupan is used in other items on the menu, such as the croque monsieur (S$4.50), a combination of bechamel cheese and ham, and the cat pizza sausage (S$4.90), which features bell peppers, sausage and cheese.\xa0While there are no waffles and ice cream at this cafe, Catbake offers a cat French toast (S$3.60) with a single-scoop gelato (S$5.50) as an additional topping.\xa0A post shared by HungryGoWhere (@hungrygowhere)You can pick from classic flavours such as dark chocolate and pistachio (extra S$1), or try flavours such as black sesame and lemon pie tart.\xa0Given that chef Tajima has acquired Cacaocat and Chocolate Origin, we recommend going for the dark chocolate gelato for its rich flavour.\xa0For that reason, you may also want to give the cat chocolate cake (S$28) a shot while you’re there. The adorable cake also comes as a delectable cat cheesecake (S$28) with a cloud-like texture.\xa0\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Junction Westgate opening with promos; will house 23 tenants, including new halal teppanyaki\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Feuds: Saizeriya vs Milan Shokudo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatisserie Cle brings its well-crafted pastries to new River Valley flagship for fifth anniversary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf pastries are more your cup of tea, the challah (S$3.50) bread is one of the more unique items available.\xa0It is a Jewish-inspired bread presented in three braided strands with a caramelised exterior and a spongy interior.\xa0If you’re a cat aficionado seeking a new dining experience, Catbake may be worth a visit. While some of the desserts were underwhelming, it’s an enjoyable experience if you appreciate it for what it is — a feline-themed bakery and chocolate manufacturer.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/au-balcon/:['Singaporeans have always been enamoured of French fare, and it’s no wonder why — French cuisine has long been deemed the pinnacle of fine dining.\xa0Many establishments have mushroomed here, from fancy high-end restaurants to more wallet-friendly options, offering Singaporeans a myriad of options to have authentic French fare without getting on a plane.Enter Au Balcon, a revamped concept by The Summerhouse.Au Balcon, which translates to “on the balcony”, takes over what was previously known as the French Dining Room on the second floor of The Summerhouse. It features a brand-new menu and a redecorated space.Located above the popular Wildseed Cafe, its nondescript stairway leading up to the second floor can be easy to miss if you aren’t paying attention. But those who are sharp-eyed enough will be rewarded with a whimsical dining experience.\xa0Decked out in white wooden furniture and surrounded by lush greenery, Au Balcon has a rustic charm to it. Each table is accompanied by colourful flowers, a promising companion to your Instagram flat lays.\xa0Overall, the space has good potential as a date-night spot or for a quiet weekend brunch gathering. Unlike its downstairs cafe neighbour, Au Balcon’s space is air-conditioned — a big bonus for some. The food here focuses on nature-inspired dishes with classic French flavours. While some of the French Dining Room’s popular dishes, such as its house smoked salmon (S$22), are still available, the menu has seen an overhaul with a greater number of seafood dishes.For a refreshing start to the meal, we enjoyed the octopus and prawn nicoise salad (S$28) for its light dressing and generous servings of octopus legs and kelong tiger prawns.\xa0Most entrees here have seafood as the star ingredient, with the exception of the florentine 65-degree organic egg (S$18) featuring cauliflower puree, baby spinach and truffle, and the assorted heirloom tomato (S$22), which comes with goat cheese, shallots and a balsamic drizzle.Alternatively, you could treat yourself to a charcuterie board featuring Au Balcon’s artisanal cold cuts (S$35) that are served with bread and homemade pickles.\xa0\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50% off at picturesque date spots, including Wildseed Cafe at The Alkaff Mansion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMartin’s Kitchen: New restaurant serves unique Hakka-inspired dishes with Mexican and European influences\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you’re a fan of robust, earthy flavours, you’d find yourself enjoying the plats principaux (the main course) on Au Balcon’s menu.\xa0The pluma Iberico (S$48) was a crowd-pleaser with a pleasant bitterness from the char. While imbued with strong smokey flavours, the Iberico pork maintained its tenderness, and was easy to cut and chew. When paired with the sweet apple celeriac puree, you’re presented with a complex and unique flavour.\xa0Grilled flavours appeared to be a running theme for the menu as the wagyu striploin (S$98) we tried was charcoal-grilled and served with a smoked potato puree.\xa0The thick slices of wagyu were satisfying, but we were mostly taken by the aromatic and deep caramelised flavours of the potato puree.For something lighter, try the kuhlbarra barramundi (S$36), which features a tender pan-seared barramundi bursting with juice and flavour. Or go for the vegetarian options of a cauliflower ‘steak’ (S$26) or squash risotto (S$28).We were told that many of the seafood ingredients and vegetables were locally sourced, with herbs and garnishes used in the dishes harvested from The Summerhouse’s in-house edible garden. Conclude your meal with a citrus creme brulee (S$16), which is served with homemade vanilla ice cream. While creme brulee can often be too sweet and heavy, this had a nice citrusy zest that cut through the sweetness, making it a pleasant dessert.\xa0Au Balcon will also be serving a brunch menu on the weekends, with staples such as the classic weekend breakfast set (S$24) that comes with a variety of pastries, ham and egg omelette, and coffee or tea. You could also go for its three-course set menu (S$55 per person) that comes with an appetiser, main and dessert.While Au Balcon is not the most affordable dining option, it’s a pleasant place to celebrate special events and to feel like you’re dining in Paris, if only for a while.\xa0After your meal, make sure you take a stroll through The Summerhouse’s ground-floor gardens, which has recently undergone a S$300,000 refresh.A post shared by HungryGoWhere (@hungrygowhere)You can book a ride to Au Balcon, located on the second floor of The Summerhouse.\xa0For more content on what to eat, read our stories on artisanal pizzas or affordable burgers in Singapore.The Summerhouse, 3 Park Lane, Level 2\xa0\nOpen: Wednesday to Monday (6pm to 10pm) for dinner, Saturday and Sunday (11.30am to 3pm) for brunch The Summerhouse, 3 Park Lane, Level 2\xa0\nOpen: Wednesday to Monday (6pm to 10pm) for dinner, Saturday and Sunday (11.30am to 3pm) for brunch Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/tipo-strada-keong-saik/:['Affordable handmade pasta is hard to find in Singapore, as Italian restaurants here are, more often than not, swanky date spots.For pasta aficionados craving some handmade authentic pasta without breaking the bank, there’s always Tipo, one of Singapore’s most beloved casual dining brands.Tipo is part of The Black Hole Group, which is also behind other popular concepts including Working Title and The Great Mischief. The first outlet opened in 2018 along North Bridge Road, with the name Tipo Pasta Bar.It quickly grew into a popular dining spot in the Kampong Glam vicinity, beset with long waiting times and hard-to-acquire reservation slots.\xa0Since then, the brand has gone on to open other outlets with varying specialty concepts, such as gnocchi (Tipo Gnocchi), artisanal pizza (Tipo Pizzeria e Trattoria), and handmade pasta and street snacks (Tipo Strada).The new Keong Saik outlet will be Tipo Strada’s second location. Like its first Novena outlet, it will focus on wallet-friendly specialty pasta offerings. The new venue will also have the same menu as the Novena outlet.\xa0Unlike Tipo Pasta Bar, which allows diners the freedom to create their own pasta from scratch (down to the type of ingredients), Tipo Strada’s menu is a tad more fixed. It has a range of pasta options categorised according to different sauces — red, white and pink, which is a hybrid of the two.Both Tipo Strada and Pasta Bar allow you to choose a pasta type as the base, all of which are handmade in-house. The seasonal rotating selection features a myriad of pasta types, but you can be sure they are hardly conventional.\xa0Some options have even been jazzed up, such as the chilli and lime fusilli or the coconut and dill creste di gallo.Those who prefer more depth will enjoy the pasta selection under the “red” section, such as the classic no-frills napolitana (S$10.90), or the rich and cheesy beef bolognese (S$15.90).On the other hand, pasta dishes with white sauces such as the duck carbonara (S$17.90) and truffle mushroom (S$17.50) will provide a creamier, richer profile. If you prefer the best of both worlds, get the popular pink salmon (S$18.50) or the rose duck (S$15.50).Tipo Strada’s menu also includes some favourites that don’t fit into any of the classifications, such as the herbaceous chicken pesto (S$16.60) and the black prawn (S$19.90) that’s mixed in with squid ink sauce.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Feuds: Saizeriya vs Milan Shokudo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can then finish assembling your dream pasta with a smattering of add-ons, available at extra cost. Consider a sprinkling of chilli flakes (50 cents) for some heat, a silky sous vide egg (S$3) to elevate the texture, and some luscious smoked salmon (S$4) to cap it all off.There are also some snacks if you need non-pasta sharing plates, including the toasty bruschetta (S$9.90) and a refreshing pear salad (S$12.90).Tipo’s various concepts are on the GrabFood delivery service and offering free delivery (up to S$3 off) with GrabUnlimited.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/surrey-hills-deli/:['For us Singaporeans, a sandwich may be something we eat in the mornings — perhaps with peanut butter and jelly, egg mayo, or maybe a slice of cheese.\xa0But, in Australia, the sanger — a term that emerged in the 60s — is pretty much a staple of Australian cuisine, coming in all shapes and sizes. There are chicken schnitzel sangers, veggie sangers, and even double banger sangers for the heartiest eaters.I adore my bread and meat, so it’s a good thing that the folks at Surrey Hills Grocer — a somewhat new cafe and Australian specialty grocer with stores in Orchard and Jurong — decided to open a sanger joint in the middle of Raffles Place.The Surrey Hills brand, founded by ex-banker Pang Gek Teng, is all about bringing a touch of the Australian countryside to Singapore. Pang opened the first Jurong outlet in January 2022 and the Orchard store in November 2022.While its grocer concept focuses on brunch fare and imported products from Down Under, this new concept is more about providing CBD hustlers with a respite, with eight fully loaded sandwiches featured in the lineup.\xa0It’s worth noting that the recipes are created by chef-consultant Pang Kok Keong, who started Supercurry several months back.It’s clear that Surrey Hills Deli is set up to be a hotspot for those eyeing a quick and convenient lunch in Raffles Place — be they office workers, yogis and fitness buffs, or anyone looking for fantastic sandwiches and pastas.\xa0The prices here aren’t exactly budget-friendly. Paying upwards of 17 dollarydoos for a sandwich seems a bit much, but the level of cooking, quality ingredients used and the generous portions make up for that. And, okay, we’re in the CBD after all. There are eight made-to-order sangers (from S$16 to S$24, and mostly cheekily named) here.\xa0Some are more common: Tuna salad with aged cheese, and another with avocado, brie and cranberry jam — y’know, healthy-ish stuff that’s good for gym rats.\xa0But I can guess what those taste like, so I go for the specials.There’s a robust ciabatta (what’s interesting is that different flavours come with different types of bread) called Let’s Pull Through (S$20). This probably refers to the pulled pork shoulder that’s been cooked for 36 hours, elevated with green mango slaw and mustard mayo.\xa0The brilliantly seasoned pork is tender and juicy, and expertly shredded, with a fine amount of tang and bite from the gherkins and unripe mangoes. It’s utterly delicious.You know how they say the best burgers are messy as heck? Spam the Positivity (S$19) is like that, thanks to the spicy gochujang glaze and tangy kimchi that put a Korean spin on the classic spam-and-crispy-fried-egg combo.\xa0Caramelised onions, some aged cheddar, seaweed flakes, and the crisp yet soft texture of a good sourdough help bring it all together. Maybe don’t eat this at your office desk?Truffle lover or not, you’ll love the decadent Truffle Up (S$22) that stacks black truffle mayo and a heap of smoky black forest ham on sourdough.\xa0The bread is also smeared with grainy and mildly spicy Pommery mustard, triple cheese bechamel sauce, and caramelised onions. All these lend an earthy savouriness to the already-rich dry-cured ham. Yummy.Surrey Hills is known for a chilli crab spaghetti. But here, it’s done up with al dente fusilli and prawns, which I feel better hold the sauce — a tasty housemade rempah that’s impressively spicy. The Chilli Prawn (S$24) ups the seafood factor with tobiko, and a bunch of mizuna adds a sweet and peppery kick.Even the coffee is from Down Under, sort of — the beans are roasted by specialty Aussie roasters Ona Coffee.\xa0A long black starts from S$5, while white coffee starts from S$5.50. If you haven’t tried a Magic (a Melburnian creation of a double ristretto with steamed milk), I highly recommend you do so here.I’m one for more experimental drinks, so I try the special creations.\xa0The espresso sparkling (S$7) is an iced long black infused with sparkling water. There’s a gentle coffee profile (primarily fruit and toffee) that’s balanced out with mild fizz — light, refreshing and sensible for our weather.\xa0There’s a reason Australia is known for having some of the best-tasting brews.There’s a creamy cocoa drink made with chocolate from Margaret River (S$7, +S$1 for ice), a region in Western Australia known for wines and artisanal produce.\xa0It’s what I imagined a swig from Willy Wonka’s chocolate river would taste like — rich, nutty and immensely chocolatey. Should I be proud to say that I finished this in minutes?There’s nothing to complain about when it comes to the food and drinks here, which are top notch.\xa0The presentation is good — as pretty as sandwiches can get — and even the service and speed were flawless during my afternoon visit.\xa0I can imagine longer-than-average waits during lunch hour, where there’s a higher chance of things going wrong. For one thing, there’s no number system, and instead, the staff call out names one by one at the top of their lungs. What if there are eight Bens waiting for their food?\xa0That said, it’s really a non-problem, so all that’s left to do is make your way down for some banging sangers.Is it conducive to conversation? Only if you head there during non-peak hours. Otherwise, expect a bustling crowd inside the deli.Is a reservation necessary? No reservations needed.How to get there?

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/sembarang-nasi-lemak-padang/:['As a food critic, I avoid reviewing food that I’m intimately familiar with. The list is not exhaustive, but right at the top is anything my mum made for me growing up, whether it’s during festivities or something to fill me up after school.It makes reviewing a place like Sembarang Nasi Lemak & Padang daunting. Not for me, mind you, but for the eatery. The standards I’ve set are high and unachievable.\xa0It comes as a pleasant surprise that Sembarang meets my exacting standards. “This tastes so close to how my mum would cook it,” I admit as my dining partner and I sampled each dish.\xa0“This one also. It’s so strange that this sambal goreng is made how my mum would.”Sembarang Nasi Lemak & Padang opened in October 2022 in the neighbourhood of Bukit Merah off Leng Kee Road, at the void deck of 63B Lengkok Bahru.\xa0The nasi lemak-nasi padang joint is the brainchild of the folks from the LS&Co Group. Other dining concepts under the group include Ashes Burnnit in Singapore and New York City as well as the recently shuttered Maison Sucree.\xa0In an interview with HungryGoWhere, owner Lee Syafiq said that he studied new trends in the market, especially among the younger generation and millennials. This led him to conclude that “a good majority of them love a good plate of nasi lemak at any time of the day, be it breakfast, lunch or dinner”.Sembarang Nasi Lemak & Padang was thus born. The star of the establishment is, without doubt, the Nasi Lemak Sembarang Combo Set (S$7.50), which comes with fried chicken wing, an omelette, fish fillet, begedil, cucumbers, sambal tumis, and a smattering of ikan bilis.\xa0Swap the omelette for a sunny side up, and this becomes the Nasi Lemak Royale set at Crave. One glaring thing sets the Sembarang iteration apart, though. Here, the usual fried ikan bilis is given a glow-up with the inclusion of finely sliced garlic slices, dried chilli and curry leaves — it was specially crafted by a family member from Indonesia, Lee had told us.Also of note is the basmati rice, which has a tinge of aromatic spice beyond the usual santan. The addition of ghee to the santan emulsion elevates the flavour even further.The accompanying sambal is just like how my mum would make it — equal parts sweet and spicy with a hint of heat that results in a great mouthfeel with every bite.\xa0I also loved the chicken wing, which reminded me of how my mum made hers on lazy Sunday afternoons.\xa0Inside, the meat is incredibly juicy and flavourful. Outside, it’s earth-shatteringly crispy, and packed with spices, herbs and ground turmeric. I could inhale five in one sitting, I’m sure.\xa0Aside from nasi lemak, Sembarang also serves a classic repertoire of Malay breakfast dishes, available until 11am.The lontong (S$4.50) doesn’t shy away from being bold and flavour-forward with the inclusion of aromatics. Coconut milk is used liberally here to a great, creamy effect, especially since most healthy iterations — and there are plenty — tend to water down the gravy until it becomes almost soup-like in texture.\xa0The rice cakes within are also tender and give way easily to the bite — less stellar versions tend to be brittle.I also got a la carte servings of the sambal goreng (S$2.50) and beef rendang (S$3.50) just to get a taste of what the Padang side offers. Both are close to how my mum would prepare hers.Unlike other sambal goreng versions I’ve had before, this one is sweeter and less spicy, with a slight saltiness that I found pretty enticing. They say a little salt makes everything better, and I suppose this applies to traditional food, too.\xa0It’s also not cloyingly oily like some are wont to be — a testament to how thorough the cook has been over the stove ensuring the “pecah minyak” (literally translated to “oil splitting”) is well and truly homogenised. The beef rendang is fork-tender, evidenced by how my dining partner tore the whole chunk apart with just a spoon in hand. It’s also chock-full of nutty sweetness.Lunch ended with a classic kueh lopes (S$2), which I’m surprised anyone still made. The breakfast favourite is made by tightly wrapping glutinous rice in banana leaves, steaming it, and then serving it in a generous pool of gula melaka sauce.Less stellar versions tend to be tougher and dried out. Yet, as you can imagine, the one at Sembarang passes with flying colours. She’s an overachiever, this one, and I’m not complaining. Food-wise, nothing. Fittings-wise, the ceiling fans should be replaced. The one we sat under emitted a shrill shriek throughout lunch.Is it conducive to conversation? At lunchtime, office workers from nearby descend on the premises, bringing with them convivial conversations. Post-lunch is more conducive to a tete-a-tete.Is a reservation necessary? No.\xa0How to get there? It’s a five-minute walk from Redhill MRT station.HungryGoWhere paid for its meal at this eatery for this review. Still hungry?

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/fun-date-spots-singapore/:['Dating is fast becoming one of the more challenging things to embark on in the 21st century. The rise of dating apps has presented a problem — with a larger pool of potential matches, people are faced with a lot more options, which result in lower attention spans and higher expectations.What this means is that it’s now much harder to choose a date spot that will unquestionably impress in a short span of time.Feeling stressed already? Don’t fret. Fortunately, we are now seeing many new spots in Singapore that have incorporated unusual and interactive activities alongside a meal.\xa0If you don’t want to take a promising new prospect to another boring ol’ cafe, we’ve got you covered. These are some unconventional date spots in Singapore that provide nourishment, and a fun and whimsical experience at the side!Mandarin Gallery, 04-14/15, 333A Orchard Road\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (11am to 10pm)Why visit? When it comes to dates, art jamming is an activity that has gained in popularity in recent years. For those unfamiliar with the idea, it’s a form of therapeutic self-expression that allows people to go wild with creativity on blank canvases.One of the most popular places for art jamming is Arteastiq, which also doubles as a picturesque tea lounge. It provides every art jam (S$48 per pax) session with a 50cm x 50cm canvas, unlimited acrylic paint, as well as a free beverage, excluding alcoholic options. It’s the perfect date spot for creative souls longing for an artistic release.Price range: $$$Crowd favourites: Many couples flock down to this date spot for art jamming, but the cafe is also a common stop for brunch dates. Other than all-day brunch options such as the wholesome farmers breakfast (S$24), you can also choose to go for the elegantly plated pastas, including the Hokkaido scallop squid ink spaghetti (S$22) and shells alla Australia beef bolognese (S$18).Blk 2 Jalan Bukit Merah, 01-5148\nOpen: Sunday to Thursday (11.30am to 9.30pm), Friday to Saturday (11.30am to 10pm)Blk 206 Toa Payoh North, 01-1225\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (11.30am to 9.30pm)Why visit? This is the opportunity to make your childhood dreams come true. While you didn’t grow up to inherit a candy factory after finding a golden ticket, Carrara cafe gives you, and your date, the chance to make the ice cream of your (childhood) dreams with its ice cream-making workshop.You don’t just get to create sweet memories together — you actually get to bring home two flavours of ice cream that you’ll be making at the workshop, under the guidance of Jackson Lee, the founder and head chef of Carrara.Price range: $$$$Crowd favourites: If you’re going for the ice cream-making workshop, the S$70 per pax price is inclusive of an all-you-can-eat gelato and waffles buffet! If you want to maintain your decorum in front of your partner though, you can settle for the usual brunch staples, such as the golden-crispy smoked salmon Swiss rosti (S$14.90).80 Haji Lane\nOpening hours: Tuesday to Sunday (12pm to 8pm)Why visit? Who can resist warm snuggles from adorable short-snouted pups who are enthusiastically pouncing on you from all directions? What The Pug is as perfect a date spot as you’ll find in Singapore, offering\xa0companionship from cute cuddly animals (and yourself), as well as a polaroid photo and a canned drink during your 45-minute petting session.What The Pug doesn’t have an extensive menu like that of a full-fledged cafe, but its location in Haji Lane also opens up a world of options for a convenient after-cuddle bite or drink.Price range: $$Crowd favourites: The stars are obviously the adorable pooches, and the complimentary drinks are just bonuses to make your stay even more enjoyable. But you can choose when to head down for different price points — S$20 for weekdays and S$25 for weekends.705A East Coast Road\nOpen: By appointment only; make your bookings here!Why visit? Calling itself a “nature experience centre”, The Sundowner is an establishment that offers a myriad of workshops that are engaging and fun. Crash courses involve everything from pasta-making (S$110 with lunch) and pizza-making (S$125 with dinner), to roasting your own coffee (S$95 with brunch) and mixing up your own cocktails (S$95).If you’re the kind of person who is obsessed with picking up new skills, The Sundowner is the perfect spot to bring a date, where you can both pick up new quirky hobbies that, hopefully, you can maintain together. Bee encounters are an option, too, if you’re brave enough to take that up.Price range: $$$$Crowd favourites: You’ll need to make an appointment if you want to join in the fun. For the pasta by hand workshop, there are open drop-in sessions available at 10am on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. You’ll start the day kneading and rolling out dough, before your handiwork is served up to you as lunch, accompanied by a glass of wine.Block A, 02-04, 3A River Valley Road\nOpen: Sunday to Thursday (5pm to 1am), Friday and Saturday (5pm to 3am)Why visit? It’s hard to define Level Up, which houses plenty of entertainment options under one roof. It’s a rowdy party spot, a gastrobar, an arcade, a vibey photo-op hotspot — simply put, it’s a great date spot that will fit people from different walks of life.If your date is into quirky retro themes, this Clarke Quay hideout will certainly capture their heart. Everything from the eye-catching neon signs to the arcade machines are bound to make your night out that much more amazing.Price range: $$Crowd favourites: Start off the night simple and easy with a couple of classic cocktails (S$18, S$25 for two during happy hour), such as refreshing pina coladas and boozy long island ice teas. While not known for the food, many like to indulge in its fuss-free, sinful bites with favourites such as the massive wings, wings & more wings (S$50) platter.40 Alexandra Terrace\nOpen: Tuesday to Friday (5pm to 11.30pm), Saturday (2pm to 11.30pm), Sunday (1pm to 7pm)Why visit? If having a freshly prepared glass of gin and tonic alone isn’t exciting enough for you, Brass Lion Distillery has the solution. Not only can you treat your date to a whole array of gins, but you can make your own on the spot, too!The local artisan distillery has opened up a gin school (S$220 with one welcome cocktail and a bottle to bring home) within its compound that will guide you to make your own personalised gin. If you’re not a hands-on kind of person, there are also distillery tours (S$45 with one cocktail and a flight of three gins) and guided tastings (S$65 with one gin and tonic and a flight of six gins).Price range: $$$Crowd favourites: Gin aficionados and alcoholics-in-training would surely want to try as many different expressions of Brass Lion’s artisan gin as possible, so the guided tasting is the perfect way to get yourself in a happy state of mind. Those who are more serious about their tipples, though, shouldn’t pass up on the chance to bring home a one-of-a-kind bottle tailormade to match your gin and tonic preferences.Riverside Point, 01-05/06, 30 Merchant Road\nOpen: Monday (4pm to 12am), Tuesday (2pm to 12am), Wednesday (2pm to 1am), Thursday to Saturday (12pm to 1am), Sunday (12pm to 12am)Why visit? Unlike the usual seedy image people typically associate with darts bars, this global franchise has a sophisticated vibe and offers a luxe and elevated experience. Darts lovers will feel right at home here — not only are there high-tech dart boards and sleek fixtures, the food served here is curated by a global head chef who boasts of Michelin-starred prestige.Unlike many of the usual darts bars in Singapore, Oche uses bona fide steel-tipped darts and cork boards. The bar also uses technology to help automate between switching players and tabulating scores, making everything smooth and fuss-free.Price range: $$Crowd favourites: Prices start from S$15 per player during happy hour and you are given the choice between different game modes. You can start off with the Classic 501 mode or challenge each other in High Striker, an elimination bout where you have to fight for the highest score. Maybe a bit of healthy competition and banter will help the sparks fly.\xa0If you’re hungry, there are also sumptuous food options ranging from the crusty today’s pizza (S$24) to spicy salmon cones (S$18) — posh-looking snacks that look like the amuse bouche typically served at high-end restaurants.The Star Vista, 01-04/05, 1 Vista Exchange Green\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (10am to 9pm)Why visit? If the gluttonous child in you prefers chocolate over ice cream, then Lemuel’s plethora of workshops might be more up your alley. These range from a simple factory tour (S$35) where you get to design your own chocolate bar —no oompa loompas here, sadly— to a comprehensive chocolate experience (S$105) workshop.The latter has staff showing you the ins and outs of all things chocolate. It comprises an introduction to craft chocolate and bean-to-bar process, nama chocolate-making, bon bon painting, and chocolate bar-painting and decorating. Best of all, you get to bring all of your creations home, which mayhaps you can savour together at a future picnic date?\xa0Price range: $$$Crowd favourites: Maybe you’re not willing to commit to the extensive chocolate experience workshop, but the chocolate bar made during the factory tour isn’t enough to satiate your chocolate-loving soul. In that case, you could always get one of its intricately crafted chocolate bonbons (from S$22 for a box of six) to go. Expect the wackiest flavours combinations — think pistachio-rich pistache, decadent milo dinosaur, and even a zesty key lime pie.Kinex Shopping Mall, 02-16, 11 Tanjong Katong Road\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (11am to 10pm)Why visit? As far as cafes are concerned, Soul Coffee is probably one of the most unique and off-beat concepts you’ll find in Singapore. The interior itself is lit up by vibrant swathes of floor-to-ceiling projections and you can even watch a robot arm barista makes drinks for you — quite the whimsical experience.But besides being an immersive and flamboyant date spot, Soul Coffee has another card up its sleeve. More specifically, a tarot card, since it offers fascinating services such as tarot reading and crystal aura reading, if any believers seek guidance from the universe. The readings are available by booking only.Price range: $Crowd favourites: Curious what your horoscope would taste like in beverage form? Keeping in line with its theme of spirituality, you order signature horoscope mocktails (S$8.50) and signature horoscope coffee (S$9.90) here. You can also get the AI barista, named George Hilary, to brew a pour-over cuppa for S$10.90 if you want to have a taste of the future.For more ideas on what to eat, read our stories on Yishun food gems and artisanal pizzas.Arteastiq, Carrara, Level Up, Lemuel Chocolate, and Soul Coffee on the GrabFood delivery service.

According to Goodwood Park Hotel’s Instagram page, 40 flash deals will be gradually rolled out for the Durian Fiesta until July.The year’s lineup will feature six new handcrafted creations that will whet the appetite of many dessert lovers.These include dainty pastries such as the D24 Paris brest (S$22), which riffs on the classic choux pastry by layering D24 mousse with custard cream and hazelnut paste, and the mini D24 chocolate ganache almond delight (S$39 for six) that comprises D24 mousse, housemade chocolate lady fingers and crunchy feuilletine bits. There’s also an assortment of luxurious cakes and entremets available, such as the rich and aromatic D24 pandan coconut gula melaka cake (S$20/slice, S$120/1.2kg).But if you’re keen on something with a more fruity contrast, choose the sumptuous D24 honeyed pear mousse bliss (S$22), tangy white chocolate raspberry enchantment (S$128/1.2kg), or refreshing D24 pineapple-lime zest dome (S$22) instead.Of course, it isn’t a Durian Fiesta without Goodwood Park Hotel’s signature creations, such as the iconic D24 mousse cake that started it all back in 1983.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Feuds: Saizeriya vs Milan Shokudo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFret not, as the familiar D24 puff (S$36 for six, S$56 for 10), D24 mousse cake (S$19/slice, from S$99 for whole cakes) and D24 crepe (S$19/piece, S$98 for eight) will all be returning to this year’s lineup, ready to dazzle your taste buds.In case you want something that can last a bit longer, you can also get its signature D24 ice cream (S$26 for 16oz tub) and ‘Mao Shan Wang’ ice cream (S$42 for 16oz tub) and enjoy these by the scoop.On the other hand, hardcore durian connoisseurs will probably want to wait for the more luxe ‘Mao Shan Wang’ mousse cake (S$90 for 500g, S$180 for 1kg) and ‘Mao Shan Wang’ power puff (S$33), which will be available for takeaway from May 1 to Aug 6.Walk-in orders can be made at The Deli, but pre-orders are recommended since items are subject to availability.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/fatty-cheong-2/:['Rating: 4/5\xa0MUST TRIES: \xa0Bu jian tian char siew & Roasted duck with chap\xa0The char siew here is heavenly even if the meat had not caught a glimpse of heaven!This is no nonsensical statement for there is such a cut of pork available at this roasted meat stall.Called bu jian tian, it refers to, well, the pig’s armpit. Or rather the part of the pig that is between the pork neck, which most char siew is made from, and the pork belly or sam chien.And since this cut is from the underside of the pig, it has not caught a glimpse of heaven, hence the charming name!More importantly, afficianados will tell you that this cut will give you the most flavourful meat as it is marbled and tender. You have to ask for it, or else you will get the usual char siew, made from pork neck.\xa0We tried out both cuts of char siew at Fatty Cheong roasted meat stall, which is housed in a most pleasant and airy food centre, ABC Brickworks. The difference was startling!\xa0Incidentally, there is a slew of interesting stalls at this centre. I spotted two rare finds: a Penang laksa and a Hainanese pork satay stall, which I will try out on another visit.But I am already delighted with my current find. The bu jian tian char siew was flavourful and moist, even if there was little charring of the meat, which I like. The grilled meat came hot from the charcoals so perhaps that had something to do with it.It is firmly Singapore char siew for the marinade has red food colouring in it, unlike the dark soya sauce marinade that is used for Kuala Lumpur char siew, which I infinitely prefer. But this char siew is truly good, despite the food colouring; neither was it overly sweet from the caramelised sugar.\xa0Thinking back, we truly had a pig feast that day. Not only did we have the pork neck and the armpit, we also had the pork belly, which is what siew yoke or roasted pork with crackling is made from. It was nicely crisp and tasty enough though it did not steal the thunder from the char siew.\xa0For a respite from all that pork, order the roasted duck, which is satisfyingly tender and moist, though a little old-fashioned chap or gravy which this stall still serves with every order, would overcome any shortcomings. And yes, a plate of blanched greens (yau choy), is always an example of perfect timing.The Chinese stalls have perfected the art turning out brilliantly green and crisp vegetables. And this last order is necessary as Fatty Cheong does not give sliced cucumbers with his roasted meats, and I always feel that some greens at least obviate the guilt when pigging out!\xa0\xa0Fatty CheongABC Brickworks Food Centre, 6 Jln Bukit Merah #01-120Opening hours: 11am-8.30pm; Closed on ThursTel: 98824849, 94281983Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/kacang-pool-special/:['In existence for almost 50 years and now in the hands of the second generation, Kacang Pool Special doesn’t get the same level of media attention as the other kacang pool stalls at Geylang Serai Market, but many hardcore fans of the dish will point to this stall as being their absolute favourite.\xa0But what is kacang pool, you might wonder? Here’s a short history lesson, if you’ve never heard of this dish.The dish is inspired by the Middle Eastern dish called Ful Medames — where mashed fava beans are mixed with olive oil, chopped parsley, onion, garlic, and lemon juice.The local rendition cooks the beans separately and is served a flash fried egg, raw chopped green chilli, onions and a sprinkling of lime and served with toasted french baguette.\xa0Located at Eunos Crescent Market and Food Centre, the kacang pool from this stall ($3) doesn’t look impressive: it has a noticeable layer of oil, no ground cumin on the side and has a watery consistency, but once you tuck into the dish, you’ll understand why all the fuss is about.With a moderate savouriness, a slight tanginess and a reasonable amount of spices, there is no lack of flavour here.The layer of oil is a wonderful addition as the dish can sometimes be a little lacking in richness, especially when eaten with bread.The oil is roughly akin to adding butter before adding a spread (chocolate, jam, marmite or in this case mashed beans) onto bread.\nThe effect is that you get three different kinds of richness as you tuck into the dish: mashed beans, flavoured oil and egg yolk.It is also nice that it has a slightly watery consistency — it means that the bread can easily sop up all the gravy-ish goodness.The toppings of chopped onions, green chilli, a bullseye egg and half a lime are pretty standard and on another plate, two thick French baguette slices that come reasonably springy and a small heaped amount of salt if you’d like the dish a little more savoury.The only downside is that you can’t add additional ground cumin if you want more of it. That said, the dish isn’t lacking in spices, except if you’re a spice freak.Note: you can request for the baguette slices to be toasted a little more. Tell them when you place your order.\xa0The other must-order dish is the roti John ($3). It’s similar to a normal roti John but the dish is double fried for extra crispness.A mix of minced meat, eggs, chopped onions and spices are slathered on top of French baguette then fried, then left to one side. When an order is placed, it is re-fried in oil again.The result is a roti John that has a nice rich crispiness with a decent moist middle. There is enough savoury flavour and the spices are nicely prominent. A must order.\xa0The stall is also popular for its epok epok ($0.60; Malay-style curry puffs) which are only available from 11.30am to 2pm. Three flavours are available — sardine, curry potato with towgay being the most interesting as its not often found.The stall also sells gado gado which is decently done but the gravy comes a little watery.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/claypot-rice/:['Claypot rice is a classic Cantonese one-pot meal that’s no mean feat to master. It’s a slow process involving precision and patience so as to evenly cook the rice grains and create a charred crust at the bottom to infuse the entire pot with that characteristic smoky flavour.Before the grains are fully cooked, a mixture of marinated chicken pieces, lup cheong (Chinese sausages) and salted fish are placed on top of the rice. As steam in the pot cooks these ingredients, the rice absorbs all the luscious juices and aromas that are released.Little wonder then, that there are numerous fans who won’t hesitate to travel from Jurong to Geylang for a delicious pot of claypot rice. Here at inSing.com, we taste-test five established claypot joints. Are they truly worth the 30-minute wait?\xa0Geylang Clay Pot Rice639 Geylang Road (Lorong 33)Tel: 6744 4574 (call for advance orders)Opening hours: Tue-Sun: 11.30am-4pm, 5pm-12amPrice: from $8.00 (serves two)Rating: 4.5/5The rice here is first cooked on gas, then finished on charcoal fire. While we didn’t detect any additional “charcoal-fire” fragrance, the rice was still top-notch. It was firm to the bite and evenly cooked. Separate and airy, the texture was excellent, although we’d have preferred a stronger smoky flavour.Like the rice, the pork and liver lup cheong, and salted fish were of premium quality. We also loved the succulent chicken pieces which were the perfect size. They were well-marinated, with pleasant notes of wine and sweet-savoury seasoning.Even without the requisite dark soy sauce and oil, the rice was sufficiently tasty with the robust flavours of the toppings. It’s definitely worth the wait for this near-flawless pot of rice!\xa0Old Mother Hen Traditional Herbal Soup136 Sims Ave (off Lorong 17)Tel: 6841 8789Opening hours: Daily: 11am-2.30pm, 5pm-1.30amPrice: from $6.00 (serves one)Rating: 4/5This was another excellent claypot discovery. Like Geylang Clay Pot Rice, the rice grains were evenly cooked, plump and firm. But the smoky aroma was more apparent here.Indeed, the flavours here were bigger and bolder, but controlled. The rice was served pre-drizzled with a very tasty dark soy sauce. This was balanced out with lightly seasoned chicken that was tender and succulent.They used a relatively good grade of lup cheong and salted fish, with an unusual addition of salted egg yolk. A great choice if you prefer your claypot rice with bolder flavours.\xa0Zhao Ji Claypot Rice#02-253 Chinatown Complex Food CentreOpening hours: Thu-Tue: 12pm-2pm, 4pm-8pmPrice: from $8.00Rating: 3.5/5From the chunky chicken pieces to the over-scorched crust, everything here screams old-school. For those who like their rice extra smoky with lots of burnt crust, you’ll like it here. Indeed, the charred aroma of the firm rice here was intoxicating.Besides the usual lup cheong, there were bits of smoked pork belly. The chicken pieces were chopped thickly. They were too heavy-handed with the starch to smoothen the chicken, but the result was very tender meat.Eating here felt like eating at grandma’s. They were very generous with the toppings. When everything was mixed together, the dish was light and not oily, but still flavourful.\xa0New Lucky Claypot Chicken Rice328 Clementi Ave 2, #01-220 Rong Li Eating HouseTel: 6778 7808 (call for advance orders)Opening hours: Thu-Tue: 12pm-1.30pm, 5pm-8.30pmPrice: from $10.00Rating: 3/5Waiting time here can stretch as long as 45 minutes during peak hours, but this place is always packed.The main draw here has got to be the rice! Once the lid was lifted, an irresistible waft of smokiness hit our senses and triggered our salivating tastebuds.Round and moist, the rice here was rather more-ish, especially when enhanced with dark soy sauce and lard. The usual toppings of chicken, sausages and salted fish were skimpy in portion. Taste-wise, they were decent but didn’t stand out.Overall, the rice here was superb, but the toppings were too mild to elevate this claypot from good to great.\xa0Golden Mile Claypot Rice#01-65 Golden Mile Food CentreTel: 6295 8234Opening hours: Thu-Tue: 5pm-10pmPrice: from $5.00Rating: 2.5/5If you prefer your grains more moist, then you’ll like the rice here. But for claypot rice, we prefer the characteristically firm and separate grains. Also, we felt it wasn’t smoky enough. In short, the rice here lacked character.As for the toppings, the chicken was chopped into small pieces. This made eating more convenient. However, the meat was a tad too salty. The lup cheong was rather pedestrian, which reduced the overall flavour-o-meter of the dish.Overall, it was a decent but unmemorable pot of rice.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

In the past two years, several designer cupcake boutiques have opened across our tiny island to satisfy our growing demand for cupcakes. We sample five popular cupcake specialists and find out which one takes the cake for best cupcake!\xa0The Marmalade Pantry\xa0 EDITOR’S PICK!2 Orchard Turn, #03-22 ION Orchard\nOpening hours: Daily: 10am – 10pmPrice: $4.50 eachRating: 4.5/5\xa0Long before the recent cupcake craze, Marmalade Pantry has been the place to go to for great cupcakes. Even now, they are still the benchmark for awesome cupcakes.Their fine cake texture strikes the perfect balance between being fluffy and having depth. It’s wonderfully airy and stays moist till the next day without refrigeration.We’re impressed with how their cake flavours are pronounced without being over the top. Both the cake and frosting compliment each other beautifully. Unless you prefer to have more frosting, we find that the cake-to-frosting ratio is just right.There are ten flavours to choose from, and all are very easy to like. But the ones that stand out most are Cloud Nine (vanilla and coconut cake with cream cheese frosting), Elvis (chocolate cake with peanut butter frosting), and Red Velvet (red velvet cake with\xa0 coconut cream cheese frosting).Marmalade Pantry’s minimalist-chic cupcakes may look simple, but taste-wise, they pack a punch!\xa0\xa0Twelve Cupcakes\xa0 BEST VALUE & BEST PACKAGING9 Raffles Boulevard, #01-52 Millenia Walk\nOpening hours: Daily: 10:30am – 9pmPrice: $3.00 each for everyday flavors; $3.50 each for special flavors\xa0Rating: 4.5/5Fluffy, moist, and melt-in-the-mouth – the texture of the cake at Twelve Cupcakes is fantastic! It’s so light that it makes you want to eat more. Same goes for the frosting – it’s neither too sweet nor too heavy. Together, the cake and frosting are well-balanced in taste and proportion.The clear crowd favorite is their bestselling Red Velvet cupcake. We especially enjoyed the sweet-tangy cream cheese frosting. The Cookies & Cream has yummy frosting that goes well with its rich chocolate cake.We also tried a couple of the special flavours that aren’t always available. The Salted Caramel is quite pleasant, but the Lychee Martini tastes a little artificial and is just too sweet.Twelve Cupcakes also deserves special praise for their chic designer-looking boxes and sturdy packaging.\xa0\xa0Cupcakes & Bakes\xa0 GREAT FIND!8 Wilkie Terrace, #01-02 Niven Suites\nOpening hours: Wed-Fri: 11am – 8pm, Sat-Sun: 11am – 4pm. Closed Mon, Tue & PHPrice: $3.80 each\xa0Rating: 4/5This is one seriously underrated cupcake boutique. Cupcakes & Bakes’ creations are both a feast for the eyes as well as the palate!One of our favorites is the Nutty Choco – a fluffy and chocolatey moist cake topped with lightly whipped peanut butter frosting that’s rich without being overwhelming. We also enjoyed the Salted Caramel with its fragrant vanilla cake and subtle salted caramel frosting. The Red Velvet is another crowd-pleaser.On the whole, the cakes here look gorgeous and taste great! The frosting is very pretty and doesn’t taste overly sweet. The cakes have good texture and balance of flavours, though we preferred the chocolate-based ones for their fluffier texture.\xa0\xa0Oni Cupcakes\xa0 MOST INTRICATE DESIGNS26 China Street, #01-02 Far East Square\nOpening hours: Mon-Fri: 11am – 7pm, Sat-Sun: 11am – 5pm, closed SunPrice: from $4.50 for small cupcake\xa0Rating: 3.5/5This tiny little shop churns out a staggering range of flavors. There are nearly 20 flavours on the menu (some require pre-orders).Oni Cupcakes’ inspired creations may sound whimsical, but they taste delicious. One that’s especially unforgettable is the Oriental Twist – rich chocolate cake with citrusy mandarin orange buttercream. Another winner is the Raspberry Rush – raspberry marmalade chocolate cake with raspberry buttercream.Altogether, we sampled about six different flavours, and they were all impressive. On the whole, the cakes are a little on the dry side, but the fluffy and flavourful frosting manages to balance things out. The cupcakes here are on the pricey side. But these colorful and intricate creations will be excellent choices for special occasions.\xa0\xa0Whips Cupcakes\n12 Gopeng Street, #01-85 Icon Village\nOpening hours: Mon-Fri: 11am – 7pmPrice: $3.50 for regular size, $1 for mini size\xa0Rating: 2/5We tested four of their recommended bestsellers. Our favorite was the Nutella – vanilla cake with a Nutella centre and Nutella buttercream frosting. All three components work well together, but the frosting can get cloying. Another bestseller – Red Velvet – is fairly decent, but lacks the finesse of its peers in this roundup.The gritty Earl Grey did not go down well, not even with our die-hard Earl Grey fans. The Chocolate has moist and dense cake, but its thick-looking ganache lacks true chocolate richness.In terms of both taste and looks, the cupcakes here are rather amateurish. They also need to improve on their flimsy and cheap-looking packaging.\xa0\xa0inSing.com made anonymous visits and paid its own purchases at the places\xa0 featured here.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

The killer is the addictive sweet savoury noodle dressing which has lots and lots of fried lard and fried onion oil.

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/hair-loss/:['It wouldn’t be any stretch of the truth to say that everyone in Singapore loves hawker food. Cheap, good and tasty, quite a few people eat it every single meal of every single day.But what if your hawker habits start to affect your body in a negative way?When you’re starting to notice hair strands falling onto the plate of oyster omelette every time you patronise your favourite hawker stall that is when you had better start thinking about your diet.“If you’re noticing a lot of loose hair strands when you’re shampooing, brushing your hair or even hair strands on your bed in the morning, those are sure signs of hair loss,” said Pooja Chhabra, who’s been a trichologist – specialist in hair & scalp at TK TrichoKare for numerous years.If a person is losing more than 100 hair strands a day, that is definitely a cause for concern.Visual signs of hair loss are different for men and women.For men, male pattern hair loss is easy to notice, starting with a receding hairline around the temples and a thinning of the crown area. For women, usually the thinning of hair occurs at the parting of hair and outwards.According to Pooja, the causes of hair loss are varied, with stress being singled out as the primary factor in Singapore followed by diet.\xa0Foods which are processed, have a lot of preservatives, high in MSG, salt, sugar and oil, generally should be avoided.“If a food has little nutritional value and a high calorie value, your body has to work harder to break down the food. That means less energy going towards body functions like healthy hair growth and providing better nutrition and oxygen to your hair,” she said.\xa0\xa0LIST OF HAWKER FOOD TO LOOK OUT FORHere at HungryGoWhere, we’ve put our heads together to compile a list of dishes which you should or should not eat at a hawker centre or food court if you want a healthier head of hair:\xa0Dishes to avoid: Char kway teow, roti prata, laksa, oyster omelette, nasi biryani, carrot cake, satay\xa0Dishes to go for: Fish/pork/liver porridge, mee siam, beef/fish noodle soup, ban mian, chicken rice, bak chor mee soup\xa0Borderline cases (dishes which are okay depending on the portion and salt/sugar content) : Mee soto, braised duck rice, bak chor mee dry, BBQ chicken wings, Cantonese roasted meats\xa0For nasi padang and chinese economic rice, there are too many dishes to list but the same rules of avoiding fried foods and foods high in salt, sugar and MSG apply here.Fried chicken, sweet and sour pork and rendang dishes are absolute no no’s. Dishes to go for include ikan assam pedas, steamed egg, urap, stir-fried vegetables and sup bunt (oxtail soup).“Overall, if you stick to a healthy diet with wholesome foods with lots of fruits and vegetables, it will help with hair loss immensely,” she said.\xa0\xa0DIET IS ONE OF THE ESSENTIAL FACTOR IN HAIR LOSSHowever, diet is but one factor in the overall equation that is hair loss. There are other factors which can contribute to hair loss like stress, possible skin or medical conditions like hyperthyroidism, food allergies and pertaining specifically to men, male pattern baldness.Which is why people have been approaching hair experts like TrichoKare for a complete, holistic solution for their hair loss problems.\xa0When you sit down to consult a trichologist at TrichoKare, you are drilled on your lifestyle habits before your hair and scalp is carefully analysed using a specialised lens that magnifies up to 200 per cent.Then your hair treatment — which uses cutting edge European herbal hair remedies — is individually customised based on your hair and scalp conditions.The first step of the hair treatment is the Customised Premium European Herbal Scalp Masque which helps to detox the scalp and remove impurities and excess sebum (the secretions which contribute to oily hair).\xa0Followed by a revitalising hair bath which helps the scalp achieve optimum sebum balance and to keep it feeling refreshed and stress-free. The hot pad relaxation after helps to reduce stress and promote relaxation even further.TrichoKare has also developed a unique three-step process in their treatment called TriOxy.Named Oxy Peel, OxyJet and OxyNutrient, these steps are administered during the treatment and help to prevent follicle ducts from being congested, accelerate the scalp’s cell metabolism and improve blood circulation, as well as providing nutrients and boost hydration to the scalp.\xa0The final stage of Photodynamic Therapy uses laser light technology to aid hair regeneration and help accelerate healing.But what matters are the final results and if you’ve never been through a TrichoKare treatment before, it almost feels that a blanket of grime has been lifted off and your hair and scalp will immediately feel squeaky clean!\xa0Exclusively for HungryGoWhere readers, experience Trichokare award-winning Hair & Scalp treatment @ only $40 NETT, plus receive FREEE Hair Care Kit + FREE HairGro Serum (U.P. $758).Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/yuet-loy/:['The only reason why this family-owned tze char stall isn’t as famous as it should be is because they haven’t built up a strong customer base, having changed locations five times ever since their humble beginnings at Tras Street more than 50 years ago.\xa0Ardent fans who have stuck with them (and their numerous locatons) will swear by their homestyle Cantonese food which is less heavy-handed compared to other places.One dish in particular — Golden Coin Dou Fu ($5 for 5 pieces) is a must-order. Also called\xa0kam chin\xa0(golden coin) tofu, each piece is made in-house, something which is extremely rare to find these days. It’s a painstaking process involving mashed up firm tofu and raw egg mixed together, deep-fried then boiled in stock. The result is a soft-textured tofu ball which is unbelievably rich and made even richer when drenched in a seafood sauce with crunchy bean sprouts like how they do it here.\xa0Their Black Bean Fish Head ($12/15/18) comes in pieces instead of a whole fish head, but the meat — which has lots of lovely fish fat — is perfectly steamed. The black bean sauce which it comes with is also done without the use of any corn starch but still comes thick, rich and with very well balanced flavours — not too sweet, not too salty and it has a nice spiciness.Other dishes like their Salted Fish Chicken ($12/15/18) where the chicken pieces are wonderfully soft and tender, and swim in a complex sauce where you can distinctly taste salted fish, wine and ginger flavours.\xa0If you’re here alone, order their Sliced Fish Hor Fun ($7/14/20) as they give you generous pieces of the more expensive\xa0sang yu\xa0(snakehead) fish that’s never overcooked.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/blu-kouzina/:['After operating out of a small shophouse along Bukit Timah Road for five years, Greek restaurant Blu Kouzina decided to move to Dempsey Road three months ago and they’re now occupying a restaurant space that’s five times bigger than their previous digs.You can tell that the owners have taken great pains to make their new space as homely as possible because when you walk in, you feel like you’ve been instantly transported to a taverna (small restaurant) on a small Greek Island.Look up and you might see images of the Vergina Sun (ancient Greek symbol), there are handmade urns from Crete by the tables and in the corner, old wooden cypress sticks in the corner. These are used by Greek shepherds to hit olive trees so that the olives would fall to the ground.To reinforce the idea of home away from home, Greek owner Dennis Tsakiris has brought into the restaurant ancient artefacts from his family estate like a 300-year-old wooden trough that was used by his grandmother to knead bread. It’s now a display item in front of the kitchen but is also used to hold lemons to be used for the day.\xa0The most impressive setting of the restaurant is ironically not in the main dining room but at the al fresco dining space at the back. Overlooking a field and with rays of sunshine streaming in, it is the perfect setting for a late lunch on a lazy Sunday afternoon.\xa0\xa0HUMMUS IS (NOT) WHERE THE HEART ISHowever, if you’re expecting a new, bigger and revamped menu, don’t. Nothing has changed food-wise and when it comes to Blu Kouzina, and that is a very good thing.The restaurant has been for the past few years striving to keep the food as authentically Greek as possible with no compromises and that includes turning down the many requests for hummus (mashed chickpeas, tahini, olive oil, lemon juice, garlic) from customers.“Greeks don’t have hummus. It’s Middle Eastern,” explained Dennis who started Blu Kouzina with his wife Effie in 2010.\xa0\xa0NO COMPROMISE GREEK FOODWhat they do have which is somewhat similar is the Fava ($13.80), the most famous dish of the Greek Island of Santorini which mixes yellow lentil puree with chopped raw onions, oregano and extra virgin olive oil. It’s a predominantly savoury taste which puts the taste of lentil beans front and centre. Enhancing the taste and texture of the beans are crisp raw onions and the incredibly good extra virgin olive oil which is the other attraction here.The restaurant uses only 100 per cent cold-pressed extra virgin olive oil which is sourced from the Tsarkiris family’s 500-year-old olive estate in Messinea, Greece. Every dish is cooked with it and when you sample some with bread, you can taste the difference as there is a distinct herby, grassy character and a peppery taste that “burns” the back of the throat — considered a good thing by many olive oil experts.\xa0This no-compromise approach is everywhere on the menu be it the common Horiatiki ($21.80; Greek salad) which has feta cheese still soft and moist, or the Psari Stin Shara ($45.80 for sea bream; Greek grilled fish) where the fish comes plainly grilled and is incredibly fresh. Ask for a small portion of flavoured olive oil which is available on the side. Composed of extra virgin olive oil, lemon, salt and oregano, it enhances the taste of the fish beautifully.This stringent approach is particularly evident when it comes to the mezedes (small appetisers) like the ever-famous Greek dip, taramosalata ($15.80; fish roe dip) which is made in-house with proper grade tarama (cod roe). It comes white in colour and not with a pink hue common in mass-produced taramosalata and is due to food colouring. The result is a fish roe dip that is more uniform in flavour and with none of that salty sharp flavour.\xa0The Tzatziki ($14.80; yogurt dip) is also interesting as they use Greek yogurt which has been fermented for five years and the result is a supremely smooth creamy texture that isn’t high in fat and isn’t overly rich.\xa0\xa0BEYOND THE ORDINARYThey also have some unusual Greek dishes of note like the Saganaki with Figs ($18.80) which is fried kefalotyri (hard, salty cheese made from sheep or goat’s milk) dressed with a fig sauce with lots of marinated figs and fried oregano leaves. It’s a sweet, rich dish that is best eaten quickly before the melted cheese cools.\xa0The Xtapodi Shara ($29.80) — grilled octopus leg simply grilled with olive oil, lemon and herbs— is not only a rather uncommon dish, it is grilled to perfection with a light crispness and a soft texture that has to be tasted to be believed.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/hattendo-cafe-singapore/:['There are five flavours of cream buns to choose from: Whipped Cream,\xa0Custard, Azuki beans, Matcha and Chocolate, the most popular being ones being custard and whipped cream.\xa0Customers can witness the pastry chefs preparing and kneading the dough via a transparent glass panel.\xa0And we’re glad to report that their buns are excellent — fluffy and pillowy soft, with a smooth cream filling that’s light enough such that you can down a few in one go.Our favourite bun flavour is the whipped cream one — the light milky sweetness of the whipped cream is a great fit for the soft fluffy buns.According to Hattendo’s staff, the buns can be kept for up to two days, and they have a different texture after you’ve kept them for a day or two. The buns absorb the cream, and so they become a little denser. They recommend doing this for the buns.We kept them overnight to test them out and can confirm that the buns do become denser and heavier, as well as a little sweeter. Fortunately, they don’t feel soggy. We still prefer the buns fresh and light.And while the cream filling might remind you of\xa0choux puffs, the texture of the bun is quite different.The buns cost a reasonable $2.50 each, and you can go for the $5 set that comes with a beverage.Another unique offering is the Sweetness Amaou French Toast, which is a hybrid between the traditional French pastry and their cream buns. The dough for cream buns are soaked in eggs (as with French toast) then dusted with sugar and blow-torched (crème brûlée-style) to give it a crispy caramelised crust.This one is naturally a little sweeter than Hattendo’s regular cream buns, but it also has more variation in texture. It is served with fruits like strawberries, as well as vanilla ice cream.Besides the buns and French toast, Hattendo Cafe Singapore also offers mason jar salads and coffee. Their coffee is quite potent; our flat white was pretty full-bodied and high in acidity. Snacks — fries, onion rings, drumsticks — are also available.We like that Hattendo Cafe Singapore keeps their menu lean; instead of trying to offer everything under the sky, they stick mostly to their forte and do it well.A good spot for a quick, not-too-heavy teatime or after meal snack.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/allergies/:['I’m not really a food snob. I may be the pain-in-the-bum person who reminds the noodle seller not to douse my bee hoon goreng with monosodium glutamate (MSG), and yes, I have induced many an eye roll when I ask a waiter for gluten-free options, but I assure you I did not choose to be a food snob; I’m just severely intolerant and allergic to a lot of ingredients.The most serious of my intolerances are that to gluten and lactose, and I have a severe allergy to MSG. In the most minor of cases, I start itching and then it develops into a rash. Soon, my nose is running and in more extreme cases, my airway closes up, mimicking an asthma attack. My lactose intolerance just makes me severely bloated and uncomfortable.\xa0Between my partner – who is allergic to many things including peanuts, dairy and soy – and I, our future children will have to hang sandwich boards on their necks listing their food allergies.Intolerance vs. allergyNo, I didn’t go gluten-free just because Miley Cyrus did it.Allergies cause immune-system reactions, and are different than food intolerances, which cause digestive reactions. According to a pharmaceutical distribution company, a National University of Singapore study estimated that 95 per cent of Chinese Singaporeans suffer from lactose intolerance.Intolerance, also known as ‘non-allergic food hypersensitivity’, is the difficulty in digesting a food, a result of the absence of specific enzymes or chemicals needed to digest the food substance. Unlike an allergy, it can be dealt with supplements, re-establishing tolerance in the long run, or avoidance altogether.\n“Religious dietary restrictions are understood in Singapore, but for a country that consumes a startling amount of dairy and wheat every single day, food allergens aren’t taken very seriously.”\n\xa0The latter is more severe: an allergy is a hypersensitivity disorder of the immune system, in which the immune system misinterprets a usually harmless compound as a threat. When you’re faced with it, you pay the price with sneezing, itching, or in the most dire and extreme of cases, death.In other words, a lactose intolerant person can often handle a touch of butter in a sauce, whereas a person with a nut allergy might not risk a piece of sourdough resting on a slice of walnut bread.Why is it some immune systems react like this while others never do? Some of this bodily vulnerability is indeed genetic; some cite the importance of environment, right from time the womb – certain microbes seem to stimulate a mother’s immune system during pregnancy, preventing allergic disease in children.Plenty of foods in Singapore cause allergiesNothing will make you realise how many foods have gluten or dairy in the like being told you’re not allowed to eat any of them ever again; imagine not being able to eat a simple snack like Sunshine bread spread with Nutella. Or kaya toast.As far as foods are concerned, nearly all allergens are proteins. The most common are touted ‘The Big Eight’, which account for 90 per cent of all food allergies in the world. They are eggs, fish, milk, nuts from trees, peanuts, shellfish, soy and wheat.Religious dietary restrictions like not eating pork and beef are understood in Singapore, but for a country that consumes a startling amount of dairy and wheat like your favourite Sunshine bread, or egg noodles in your mee rebus every single day, food allergens aren’t taken very seriously.My partner found ourselves at Starbucks once where he ordered a non-dairy drink. His lactose intolerance is so severe that tiny traces of milk has resulted in him on the floor convulsing in abdominal pain. It was an honest mistake: the barista topped off his drink with a generous serving of creamy, full-fat whipped cream. When my partner explained that he didn’t want whipped cream because of his lactose intolerance, the barista took a spoon and removed the dollop of cream.Such “remedies” would, of course, be fine in circumstances where you’re avoiding cream because you’re watching your waistline, but not in the case of food allergy where a trace can set it off.Cross-contamination is a common problem for the allergic and intolerant in Singapore. This occurs when food is prepared on a surface or using a utensil that has touched an allergen. For example, someone allergic to nuts might have a reaction when eating a salad even though it doesn’t have any triggers but a spoon used to toss the salad may have touched a peanut sauce prior. There are many people in the Singapore food and service industry who can’t fathom food allergies, and the lack of understanding can lead to kitchen staff taking the preparation of food (a little too) lightly.The main ingredient in a dish may be tofu, but if you’re allergic to prawns and it’s been cooked with dried shrimp, you’re pretty much screwed (yes, it’s happened before). Some of this is common sense, others come with education – just as croutons in a salad means there’s now gluten in your salad.This is not to say that allergy requests won’t put restaurants who give a damn in a tough spot: if a customer says she’s allergic to something, the kitchen has to assume that the allergy is life-threatening and scrub every pot, remake every sauce and rethink the dish itself.This works both ways: while restaurants should make accommodations for people with allergies and train their staff to understand at the very least, The Big Eight, of food allergens, those making the request should also be genuinely allergic to something. Saying that you’re allergic to spinach when you simply don’t like its taste doesn’t count.I’m referring to primadonnas who give the rest of us allergy- and intolerance-ridden folk a bad name – I have a genuinely dire intolerance for them.Faz Abdul Gaffa is the editor of STYL+\xa0and spends her time in Singapore and Los Angeles where her partner resides.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/tea-bone-zen-mind-carrie-chen/:['Ask anyone to speak on the topic they’re passionate about and chances are, they’ll gush about it. So it came as a surprise that tea artist Carrie Chen maintains her Zen-like composure and calmness when asked about her love for tea. There’s none of that why-tea-is-good-for-you spiel. Instead, her reply was, “I don’t have a fixed idea about tea. I may have studied it for many years, but I’m still learning new things everyday.”The owner of teashop cum cafe, Tea Bone Zen Mind started the shop five years ago. Tea Bone Zen Mind is known for its great variety of gourmet tea including roasted barley brewed with black tea and green tea with sour plum.\xa0How did your love affair with tea start? Having afternoon English tea with my family was something I grew up with. I couldn’t drink coffee since young, so tea was the beverage I became familiar with. My grandmother also ran a canteen stall in the British camp and there was tea all the time. It’s also from her that I learnt about silver tea ware, which she had an impressive collection of.When I was 16, I met a top champion tea brewer in Taiwan and became more exposed to Chinese tea. It was then that I started learning and delving more into Oriental teas.\xa0What would you recommend to tea beginners who don’t know where to start? There’s no hard and fast rule. Just keep an open mind and try the different types of tea. You will eventually find the one you enjoy drinking. You know you’ve found the right one when you feel happy and a great sense of satisfaction drinking it.\xa0How do you tell good quality tea leaves from inferior ones?\xa0 Good tea leaves look and feel crisp, and when pressed, disintegrate easily into powder. Their fragrance is soft and subtle. Tea that hits you with its strong scents is likely to have been artificially scented.You taste and drink tea all the time. How do you sleep at night? I may love my tea, but I don’t drink it all day long (laughs)! I also take water and juices. But seriously, I think the reason why people have difficulty sleeping is because they have 101 things on their mind. We have difficulty calming our minds when we go to bed. Caffeine has been proven to relax the muscles, so drinking a light tea can actually help you unwind and relax.\xa0How has the tea-drinking trend evolved in Singapore? We’re seeing an increasing number of young people going for better quality tea and appreciating the art of drinking it. At our shop, we’re seeing many parents coming to our cafe with their teenaged children to enjoy tea.\xa0Besides tea, the menu at Tea Bone Zen Mind is an interesting mix of savoury dishes too. What are some of the must-tries? Our “cha ye dan” (tea egg) is very popular. It is brewed with three types of tea and the yolk remains golden and moist. We are also known for our cucumber sandwiches, which is very traditionally British. We adapted it and came up with our own version and use good quality white bread.\xa0Green tea is used in pretty much everything from cakes to ice-creams. Do you have any fancy green tea concoctions? The green tea we offer at Tea Bone Zen Mind is of the finest grade. It’s known as gyokuro and is different from the standard green tea, sencha. Gyokuro is traditionally served to the emperors of Japan. At the cafe, we pretty much don’t do anything with our green tea except to just brew and drink it.\xa0What is one thing people often find surprising about you? That I take canned iced tea drinks and have a cup of teh-o almost everyday. I don’t have a particular favourite stall–I just get it from whichever coffee shop I happened to pass by. I also drink teh tarik. I haven’t found the perfect one in Singapore. The best teh tarik is made from Indonesian tea dust.\xa0What’s your other passion? I love traditional European folk dances! I dance to relax. Recently, I was in Romania and Bulgaria for a month to take part in folk dancing events there.\xa0\xa0Tea Bone Zen Mind38A Seah StreetTel: 63344212Opening hours: Mon to Sat: 11am-7pm; closed on Sun and PHAuthor© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/wines-with-cantonese-food/:['We were once served a bottle of dry white wine with a side of sugar in a Chinese restaurant. When asked why, the waitress promptly announced that some customers prefer their white wines to be sweeter for pairing with their food.That was many years ago and since then the understanding of pairing wines with Chinese food has improved, even though it seems it is always going to be tricky.THE QUANDARY\nThere are so many different types of Chinese food. What wine goes with a feisty Szechuan hotpot? What do you drink with Shanghainese xiao long bao that’s just been dipped in vinegar? By comparison, Cantonese food is probably one of the easiest Chinese cuisines to pair with wines; it is famous for its clear and clean tastes, light seafood, steamed vegetables and soups. But even it can be tricky because of the different Chinese herbs or seasonings used in the sauces.Chinese food is also typically enjoyed communal-style with the seafood, white meat, red meat and vegetables served together. A large serving of noodles usually rounds off the meal. This mix of aromas and tastes is the worst nightmare for someone who is tasked with matching the food with wine, which generally states white wines before red. Do you bring back the white wine with the noodles, for example?CANTON MEETS CAPE MANTELLE\nMy mantra about pairing wine with food is simple — wines and food from the same country generally go well together. It is fairly straightforward with Old World wines because people in these countries have always enjoyed wines with their food and natural pairings have emerged. For example, Chiantis will go well with Italian tomato-based pastas, while a Pinot Noir from Burgundy, France will definitely rock with a duck confit.With wine becoming more accessible and fashionable in Singapore, there is a trend in the last three years to hold Chinese food and wine pairing parties and events. At Jiang-Nan Chun, for instance, we were able to test the compatibility of Australia’s Margaret River’s Cape Mentelle wines with Cantonese cuisine:The Cape Mentelle Sauvignon Blanc Semillon 2012\nBest with delicate seafood dishes \nDishes: A trio of crystal shrimp jelly with white wine, chicken simmered in hua diao wine and sliced beef with enoki mushrooms. Later, egg noodles cooked with fresh scallops and choi sum.\nVerdict: The wine is dry, fresh, fruity (lemon, lime and peach), floral and not too acidic. The citrus notes paired well with the delicate shrimp jelly. The Semillon rounded off the more acidic Sauvignon Blanc, and reminded us of feeling we get when meeting an old friend we didn’t really like and finding out we actually get along. Both the chicken and beef had strong aromas and tastes that clashed with the wine’s citrusy flavours. We also brought back the white wine with the noodles. The lightly acidic and fruity wine went well with the delicious scallops and noodles and added a touch of liveliness to a dish we often take for granted.\xa0Cape Mentelle Chardonnay 2011\nBest with dishes with strong flavours\nDish: Braised Boston lobster in superior broth\nVerdict: This wine was not a good match for the superior broth as the lingering oaky flavours of the wine overpowered the ‘sea’ flavours of the broth and lobster. The off-dry, fruity (lemons and pears) wine with hints of minerals also had flavours of vanilla that hung around a bit too long on the palate, outstaying their welcome. Premium broth, though.\xa0Cape Mentelle Cabernet Merlot 2010\nBest with sweet-savoury dishes\nDish: Baked sea perch with preserved vegetables\nVerdict: This was the best match: the sweet-savoury sauce and the substantial meat of the sea perch went brilliantly with the off-dry wine that has blackcurrant, red berries, plums, chocolate and a hint of tobacco. The wine is a classic easy-drinking ‘New World’ Bordeaux blend which is very agreeable, all the flavours blending together effortlessly. The wine brought out something ethereal in this fish dish, so the ‘rule’ about white meat or seafood going with white wine didn’t apply; consider the sauce used.\xa0Cape Mentelle Cabernet Sauvignon 2009\nBest with simple braised meats\nDish: Eight-hour slow-braised oxtail in red wine\nVerdict: Theoretically this pairing should have worked; however the heady mixture of aromas and flavours from the dish and wine overwhelmed our senses. The aromatic and rich dish flavoured with red wine and Chinese herbs came head to head with this strong and aromatic smooth, dry wine that had blackcurrant, plums, cherries, chocolate and vanilla. Too much.\xa0\xa0HOW TO PAIR WINE WITH CANTONESE FOOD\nOpen two bottles: A white and red wine. This is best suited to the communal style of eating Chinese food. You can pick and choose which one goes with your food best! It is more fun and takes away the stress for everyone.For whites: Light, aromatic, dry or off-dry Riesling and Gewurztraminer from Alsace, France or a Sauvignon Blanc Semillon blend from Margaret River, Australia. Take note that an ‘oaky’ New World Chardonnay might overwhelm the delicate tastes of Cantonese food.For reds Nothing too ‘big’ or heavy. Try a Burgundy wine from France, an Australian Cabernet-Merlot blend or a Pinot Noir from New Zealand.No vinegar Vinegar just does not go well with any wine. Regardless of what some people might say about aged balsamic vinegar. There, I’ve said it! CheeK is a creative professional with a serious wine habit. He is known for his works in film and television like Chicken Rice War and The Kitchen Musical.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/kuai-san-dian-xin/:['Dim sum restaurants are a dime a dozen in Singapore, but few are known to be pocket-friendly. If you want to enjoy dim sum at most Chinese restaurants, you’ll have to be prepared to fork out a significant amount.So when we heard about Kuai San Dian Xin and their super affordable dim sum, we were skeptical. Located in Primz BizHub on Woodlands Close, the 24-hour eatery offers every item on the menu at a flat rate of S$1.30 each. Sounds like a dream come true, right?But the dim sum, as we learned on our trip there, was nothing to shout about.We visited after lunch on a Wednesday afternoon, and the shared coffeeshop was empty, save for a few students and staff from the nearby Spectra Secondary School. To be fair, it’s probably more popular as a supper place, since few restaurants or cafes open late at night.\xa0We took our pick from the thirty-dish menu and started with the steamed pork ribs. The pork ribs were swimming in oil and tasted like the chef had simply emptied a shaker of salt into the broth used to cook the pork ribs. The same can be said for the fried prawn dumpling, which barely tasted of prawn and felt so greasy that we found ourselves having to order a drink.There were three types of glutinous rice rolls on offer, and since we could not make up our minds, we ordered all three. The char siew version tasted the best, although there was a slight gamey smell from the meat. The rice rolls had a uniform texture, although they required quite a lot of chewing since they were rolled so thickly together.We also tried the mini char siew buns and custard buns, which were rather inconsistent in terms of quality. The char-siew buns that we got were soft on the outside but overly doughy. The barely-there filling didn’t manage to do much to leave an impression. The custard buns are good as an after-meal dessert, but the dough used for the skin was overly dry in their case. \xa0The custard was viscous and sticky, with the consistency of plasticine, instead of the flowy smoothness that most of us would expect custard to be. We ended up scooping the sweet yellow filling out and leaving the buns aside.\xa0The chicken glutinous rice was the star of the meal, considering the price we paid for it. The rice wasn’t overly sticky or clumpy, and even without the chicken, it would have been good on its own.With Kuai San Dian Xin, what you pay is what you get. Considering the inconvenient location, it might not be worth the journey, unless you have business to do around the area. We had to take a cab there and back, and both times, the drivers had problems locating us. While the coffeeshop is open 24 hours daily, we don’t see anyone making a trip there, no matter how affordable it is, especially in the dead of the night. Not us, that’s for sure.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

At times, they have a tendency to break apart when picked up with chopsticks.\xa0They are dressed in a fairly robust savoury and slightly sweet soy sauce with fried onions on top and sambal chilli on the side.Staple fillings like minced char siu and chicken are nicely executed and a must try is the Pig’s Liver ($2.50). It comes chunky and nicely pink in the middle.\xa0They also give out a lot of filling when you order the Century Egg ($3.50) and the creamy alkaline taste works especially well.A surprising hit was the Otah ($3.50) because they use rich Muar-style otah with real fish chunks inside.\xa0However, not every filling works. The Prawn ($2.50) uses frozen crystal prawns but at that price point, you expect it.Note that you won’t find the Singapore or Malaysian style of chee cheong fun which is dressed in hoisin, chilli sauces and sesame seed oil.

He has been frying the dish since 1967 and like many hawkers, he used to fry with a charcoal fire on a pushcart, always running away from the ‘dae gu’ (health inspectors). He got caught so many times that he became friends with the inspector. I suspect that perhaps the dae gu might be a char kway teow fan too! Since settling at the former Margaret Drive Food Centre, this uncle has been getting a steady stream of fans and you can easily spot his stall from the long queue that starts to form from around 5pm when he starts frying.There is another reason for the long queue, apart from the fact that he has many fans. Most other char kway teow hawkers tend to fry a big batch at one go. But this man insists on frying each plate one at a time. He would pre-fry one large batch first and then leave it in a big steel bowl before dishing it out for the final fry when you place your order. This is the reason why he only whips up around 200 plates in the old days at Queenstown. Since moving to his new location, business has been slowly picking up again but it is a good time to visit him since his queue is nowhere as long as it was before.The char kway teow might lack the nostalgia of the old stall but it is still very, very good and he is still very generous with his cockles. This uncle is an expert in preparing the pork lard. He uses only fats found at the rib portion of the pig and prepares it so that the pork lard disintegrates with one crunch, releasing its alluring flavour. Combined with the slippery, savoury kway teow, every mouthful is well worth the calories!\xa0\xa0Hai Kee Char Kway TeowTelok Blangah Crescent Food Centre, #01-102Opening hours: Mon-Sat: 5pm-10pm, closed on SunAuthor© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

We felt that though the outside was slightly crispy, the contents of it were kept soft and fluffy.Between both starters, we seemed to enjoy the Grill Prawn Caesar Salad best.The first thing that we noticed was how juicy the prawns were.There were thinly sliced cheese pieces as well that gave each bite something different to enjoy.This in particular was a good start to our buffet.The first main that we had was a Thai speciality- Hor Mok Talay (Thai Seafood Otah).Crafted by putting together spices, seafood chunks and coconut cream, this seafood otah is slightly on the thicker side of otahs. It has chunks of squid and prawns too that makes it flavourful.This will be best enjoyed with The Line’s other Thai dish- Kao Chuk Kapi (Shrimp Paste Fried Rice).The rice portion is just nice to enjoy and not too much where you feel surfeited with it. The rice has a strong shrimp taste which we particularly liked as major seafood lovers.Next, we tried another Asian delight as well as an Indian dish- Singapore Chilli Crab and Kadai Prawn with Naan bread.The sweet notes of the Chilli Crab gravy, the crispiness and the fluffiness of the Mantous all went perfectly well together.We truly enjoyed this dish though feasting on the crab was not too pretty.Another dish that we particularly liked was the Kadai Prawn.But, this was a little too filling for us as the Naan bread was thick. Despite that, this dish is a must-try as it gives you the little spicy kick that the other dishes lack.We did try many other dishes in between like the Singapore Laksa with Lobster Claw, Seafood Platter and Sashimi set.Though they were all tasty, the next must-try that we had was actually their oldest crowd favourite- Durian Cake with Coconut flakes.As a durian fan, if you have yet to try this, you are missing out. The cake texture is soft and the moistness of the cake goes really well with the rich taste of the durian. Interestingly, the coconut flakes gave the cake a bite to it that we loved.For those non-durian lovers, another sweet yet delectable dessert you have to give a go would be their Salty Caramel Choux Puff. We noticed that this was flying off the dessert counter all night along with the Chocolate Cremeux with Cocoa Streusel.The salty caramel dessert only has a slight note of creaminess and sweetness to it as the saltiness and puff’s pastry cuts right through it.Overall, it had a good balance.We found the chocolate dessert a little too sweet but the kids seated at the tables near us seemed to love it.At the end of the night, we felt that for the price point of the buffet, $98++ per adult, it was truly worth it.Even if you are unable to enjoy every single item on the menu, the freshness of the ingredients and quality of the products made it worthwhile.Do take note that this menu is exclusively available during the Marine Harvest Night dinner buffets, which are only on Thursdays.If you are a meat lover, you could go for their Butcher’s table which is held every Wednesday night.Some of their highlights include Beef Kebab Ourfali Minced Beef (eggplant, tomatoes and sauce), Hainanese Pork Chop, Grilled Lamb leg.For those of you who may be bringing along children aged 6 to 11 years old,\xa0 enjoy 50% of the adult’s price.Children below 6 years old can even dine free when accompanied by one paying adult.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

It was in the middle of the country, and a lot of old ladies would come in to do their hair. My grandma used to make this lemon drizzle cake for them, and I learnt how to make it. That is the first thing I remember making — trying to perfect it and make it better.The first dish I learnt to cook is spaghetti bolognese.I used to experiment with it and added things like vanilla. Although it tasted awful, it was my first taste at cookery.I’m not here to wow people with things that you cannot get anywhere else.The idea is to do good food and treat each ingredient like how it should taste — to cook duck and make it really taste like duck, to do crab and make it taste like good crab.I’m going to wow diners here by going back to the basics.Rather than getting a plate that you don’t understand what’s going on, I want you to get food that you understand the ingredients, and it tastes better than you’d imagine. If I cook a duck, I wanted it to taste like the best duck you had.What’s fun about food is how…You can be inspired by your past — your childhood, growing up, things you learned — and produce something completely different. It doesn’t have to taste exactly like how you remembered it, but it can be influenced by your memory to get somewhere else.There are only two chefs that influenced me a lot.One of them is Alain Ducasse. Every time I dined at his restaurants, the experience has been amazing. It’s all about simplicity and having the food tasting the best it can. But the chef that really influenced my throughout my career is Mark Sargeant. He is doing a lot of casual dining instead of the fancy and intricate style of cooking. I really love his food, and I see it a lot on Instagram. Every time I go back to England, I try to dine at one of his restaurants. Although he is not cooking much anymore, I am inspired by his tasty and simple food. It’s really courageous to go from Michelin-starred restaurants to casual dining.My one favourite dish is my mum’s roast lamb… Even though she really overcooks it, it still tastes good because it reminds me of home.I love bak kut teh.I just love the complex taste of it. It doesn’t look complex at all but when you look at the ingredients — especially the many spices used — you’d think otherwise. I still wonder how they make something so simple taste so great. I tried to make a Western version, but I just can’t hit it. But yeah, I’m in love with it.\xa0I love garlic.You can use it so many different forms. Some chefs might say that their favourite ingredient to use are things like foie gras or turbot, but to me, it’s what that surrounds the dish that’s important. I tend to use a lot of garlic in my food. I love it because there are so many different uses — you can roast, pickle or boil it.People in Singapore and Malaysia are obsessed over food.Especially local food, and I’ve become addicted to it as well. I have this insane obsession to hunt down the best food. People here really embrace the local culture, particularly the food, and that’s something we don’t see much in England. Singaporeans really embrace what they had from their childhood, and they still embrace it now.Over here, sometimes food is judged whether there’s a queue.And not whether the food is good. People will travel to find the best food. I think this is an amazing culture. Sometimes in England, we’ll skip dinner for alcohol, and that is quite sad.If I’m not a chef, I’d either be a rock star or a rugby player.Like any kid growing up, I wanted to be a rock star as I used to play the guitar a lot. I also used to play rugby at a high level back in England. I didn’t get into it because it was either rugby or cooking, and I chose the latter.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/eating-light/:['One-third of Singaporeans eat out more than seven times a week, with 80% of Singaporeans eating out at hawker centres more than once a week. Preliminary analysis also showed that people who usually eat out at food centres consumed 200 kcal more or about 10% more than those who seldom eat out.While hawker centres are affordable and convenient, they often do not provide the healthiest meals. However, with HPB recruiting hawker centres around the island into the Healthier Hawker Programme, numerous well-loved haunts now feature healthier, low-calorie options too.Read on to find out which dishes make good lighter choices, so that you can easily make a healthier choice the next time you dine out at the hawker centre. Be sure to look out for the HPB\xa0Healthier Choice Symbol\xa0at stalls to identify stalls that are committed to healthier options and at least one dish containing less than 500 kcal.\xa0Light and satisfying, this healthy broth soup containing fresh and nutritious slices of fish is a clear winner.

But that’s exactly what 88 Hong Kong Roast Meat Specialist offers.Located at the kopitiam right opposite coffee bar Chye Seng Huat Hardware, a long queue can be seen in front of 88 Hong Kong Roast Specialist even before it opens. However, what exactly makes it so special? Well, there is no other reason to that than this: cheap yet delicious roast meat!Previously known as Cross Way Bay before they moved out of their location in Tampines, they may not be a household name yet, but they certainly have built a loyal following.As a Western-trained chef, stall-owner Martin first learnt the art of Cantonese Roasting when he decided to cook a rendition that was more affordable and appealing to the masses. With precious lessons learnt by observing masters of the trade, Chef Martin managed to create a whole new method of roasting meat.The stall’s roasted pork rice ($4) is definitely the star of the show. With a crisp yet crumbly skin on every piece of roast pork, it adds a layer of crunch to the buttery fat found underneath it. Coupled with the tender, succulent pork meat and sweet char siew sauce, every piece of roast pork begs to be savoured. Considering that roast pork from many other hawker stalls come with hard skin and tough meat, this is no minor feat.Right beside 88 Hong Kong Roast Meat Specialist is sister stall The Wanton Mee Co., which is opened by the same chef-owner. The standard wanton mee ($4.50) starts off with perfectly cooked noodles, then topped with pieces of luscious and mildly sweet char siew. Together with vegetables at the side, the dish is bathed in a sweet-savoury sauce that gives it its oomph. Accompanying it is a mildly salty wanton soup, which tastes decent enough. However, the wanton may be a tad bit too salty and soggy for some.Nevertheless, with its quality char siew and springy noodles, this wanton mee is certainly one of the more memorable versions I’ve tried.Just a stone’s throw away from Lavender MRT, 88 Hong Kong Roast Meat Specialist is easily accessible to the public.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/chan-chen-hei/:['As one of the most well-known local Chinese masterchefs, chef Chan Chen Hei, 55, is no stranger to playing host to many prominent personalities. His determination and passion to hold on to his traditional roots has truly sealed him as an expert in authentic Cantonese cuisine. Hailing from a humble background, Canton-born Chan arrived in Singapore in 1982 and rose through the ranks at various Chinese restaurants and three major five-star hotels including Hai Tien Lou at the Pan Pacific Singapore. The father of two now owns Chef Chan’s restaurant, an exclusive private dining eatery famous for Chan’s signature crispy-skinned chicken dish.\xa0People have likened your cooking to a form of art. Do you see cooking as an artistic experience?\nIn a way, my love for historical art-forms, especially ancient Chinese literature and art, is reflected in my cooking. Through my research, I have discovered many traditional recipes that have been lost over the years and I bring them back to life in my cooking. So in that sense, it’s not that my creations are artistic, it’s just that modern society is not familiar with the original cooking methods. Even in terms of presentation, you will find that my dishes differ from most modern styles because I make reference to the past.\xa0Why did you choose to house your restaurant at the National Museum?\nThe ambience at National Museum is definitely very unique and is very befitting because of my keen interest in ancient Chinese history. Especially since I’ve noticed that there is a lot of reference to food culture written in historical literature, I find the setting ideal.\xa0You have showcased an impressive collection of antiques in your restaurant and that they are part of your personal collection. \xa0Why did you choose to place them in the restaurant?\nI used to travel a lot to China when I was younger and during those days, I amassed quite a large collection-I even opened an antique shop in Prinsep Street which was more of a hobby than a real business. I found that many of these antiques had a culinary theme to them — be it in terms of utensils, bowls or even furniture, and you can see many of these in my restaurant.\xa0Why did you choose to specialise in the private dining concept, and can you describe the importance of the experience?\nI had the idea for this private dining restaurant eight years ago, but it took a while for this to come to fruition. Besides finding a good location, you need a certain level of skill and capital. People come rom far and wide to try my dishes, so I must put my heart and soul into each dish that I cook, and that takes a lot of time. That’s why I believe that each day, if I can serve about four to five dishes that are cooked to perfection, then that day is complete. The quality and attention you get from private dining is definitely very different than if you were to go to a restaurant that serves 200 to 300 guests a day. My greatest desire is to be able to maintain a consistent standard all the time.\xa0You specialise in Cantonese cuisine – can you tell us the key differences between Cantonese cooking and other types of Chinese cooking?\nCantonese cuisine involves various ways of cooking — such as frying or steaming, but it is usually very ‘bland’ compared to other Chinese cooking styles, for example Szechuan. In Cantonese cooking, we always try to retain and emphasise the natural taste of the food-such as the fish or meat, and we don’t mix in a lot of strong spices and flavours like chillies. So the ingredients need to be fresh.\xa0What is the most exotic ingredient you’ve used? Tell us about the experience.\nIn my early days in Singapore, we were actually the first ones to bring in exotic items like Kobe beef, Australian pumpkin and Canadian seafood. But no matter which countries these items came from, I always cooked them in traditional Chinese style. To me, I believe that a Chinese restaurant must always serve food cooked in the Chinese way, even if it is white truffles or fish roe. So it’s really not about how exotic the ingredient is, but how you cook it that matters.\xa0You have written at least two books and had a brief teaching stint giving cooking lessons. Did you enjoy doing them?\nI gave cooking classes nearly 20 years ago just to try out what it was like. I didn’t enjoy it because there wasn’t much of a challenge — maybe because I had to deal with the real basics (like holding the knife) — my students were mainly housewives! I enjoy more of a challenge which cooking gives.I am actually in the process of completing a new book about the ancient history of Chinese cooking, where I deal with the traditional ways of cooking — including the cooking of wild game — which was part of the culture and lifestyle thousands of years ago. This is targeted at professional cooks and it won’t have basic instructions like how many teaspoons of sesame oil to use etc. It’s coming out very soon, so look out for it.\xa0What is one important lesson you’ve learnt from your years of experience as a top Chinese chef in Singapore?\nOne thing I’ve observed about the local culinary circle is that many young chefs do not have a good enough foundation. In the past, there used to be an apprentice system, but in Singapore, there isn’t such a thing. I find this unhealthy because a lot of new chefs are quickly hailed master chefs after only working in about five different restaurants or hotels over maybe five years. Yet when they are put to the test, it is clear that they lack experience and depth. No matter how many glowing reports and reviews are written about them, if they do not have a proper foundation, they cannot withstand the test of time. So my advice to young chefs is not to rely on mere ‘packaging’, but truly work on the inner substance that involves working hard over time to hone their skills.\xa0Who or what has the greatest influence on your career?\nBesides my “shi fu” (teacher) back in Hong Kong, there are also many old chefs and restaurants in Hong Kong that have had a great influence on me. For example, the famous Fu Lin Men restaurant — considered the “rich man’s canteen” in Hong Kong — has been there for half-a-century, yet they have maintained the same excellent standard and quality till today. I value that because they have stuck to tradition and remained true to the original tastes; they are still brewing the same shark’s fin soup, bird’s nest and abalone after 50 years.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

The 31-year-old duty manager started out as a waiter in 1993 before he was converted to a full time employee in 2003. He has since worked his way up the Zouk ranks and is set to become one of the best known faces of Singapore’s iconic club.\xa0How did you end up with a career in the nightlife industry?\nI joined Zouk after my ‘O’ Levels at age 16 as a waiter while waiting for my school results. After that, I continued to work part-time in Zouk while pursing my Diploma. When the opportunity came knocking to join as a management trainee shortly after I graduated from university, I jumped at it.\xa0Bars and clubs have come and gone, but Zouk is going stronger than ever. You must be asked this very often, but what is the secret to Zouk’s continued success?\nZouk is always evolving. Being at the forefront of electronic music means adapting to the constant developments in technology, clubbers’ preferences, fashion and popular culture. Things literally change by the week in this business so you can’t just hold onto past successes. But of course, having a team of dedicated, loyal and hardworking staff is also one of the key success factors.\xa0What are some of the biggest challenges you have to deal with at work?\nDealing with intoxicated customers on a constant basis! Some of them can get abusive and violent at times. When dealing with such situations, it helps to stay cool and patient. Never take any negative comment from these customers personally, it’s usually the alcohol talking.\xa0Tell us about the most interesting experience you’ve encountered in your line of work.\nFor me, the privilege of being able to participate in the setup and running of the previous few hugely popular ZoukOut events top everything else. The sheer challenge of having to host an outdoor party involving more than 20,000 partygoers and juggling these events with the ongoing club activities gives me a great sense of satisfaction.\xa0You’re constantly surrounded by beautiful people. Have you ever had an indecent proposal? What does your other half think of that?\nThere are occasional proposals by tipsy patrons but they’re always meant tongue-in-cheek. I always laugh it off. \xa0My other half trusts me to do the right thing.\xa0Has the number of partygoers dropped significantly during this recession? What plans does Zouk have to encourage people to keep on partying in this economic crisis?\nWe have not noticed any significant changes just yet. Zouk has always focused more on delivering a quality product, offering world class entertainment and service over price-slashing methods to draw in clubbers.\xa0Zouk has recently been accredited with the Singapore Service Star for its exemplary service. How do you ensure that each customer attains the best\nexperience at Zouk? \nGood service starts from the top and my team of managers, supervisors and I have to be constantly on the ground to make sure that our staff do it right every time. Communication is also essential to make sure that all staff from top to bottom share the same goal.\xa0Your soon-to-be predecessor, Tracy Phillips, has often been associated as the face of Zouk. How do you think zoukettes will take to you as Zouk’s new official spokesperson? Are those big shoes to fill?\nTracy has been with Zouk for 10 years and has done a tremendous job. People have sort of grown used to her as the main spokesperson. However, in keeping with today’s demanding business environment, the company is designating more than one official spokesperson in future. I am just one of them, acting as the key contact person for handling queries relating to service-related and operation matters.\xa0In your opinion, what’s unique or different about the work culture at Zouk and the people the company hires?\nA love for music and people are definitely a must. What is most unique in Zouk is the family spirited teamwork culture that is reflected in the fact that more than half of our staff strength has continued to stay with Zouk for more than 10 years.\xa0What do you do to chill out when you need to take a break from all the partying? \nI enjoy a game of soccer, go jogging or get together with friends and family during my free time.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

The mix of fruits and vegetables makes this a fun salad to eat, you get a burst of flavours from the fruits in each bite, while tasting the freshness of the greens as well.If you’re not too hungry and want to eat clean, this dish is a good choice. For those who are dining with a friend, this is a good dish to order and share as well.Keto Chicken Roulade, $24.90People who like meat but want it served in a healthier fashion will love this dish. The baked chicken spinach roulade is done just right, so the chicken remains tender and juicy. The spinach, which is baked in the roulade, has also absorbed plenty of flavour from the chicken, and adds that extra bonus in each bite. Served with a grain mustard dressing, this dish comes across as surprisingly light, and really satisfying.\xa0\xa0Maple Soy Baked Salmon & Soba, $27.90This beautifully done salmon dish is our favourite.

It’s the perfect opportunity to let loose and indulge your steak-lovin’ carnivorous side.Held from 28 September to 22 October 2016 at The Carvery, the buffet will offer five premium cuts of beef from around the world, on a rotating basis, throughout its running period. The beef will be served a la minute at a live carving.Here are some reasons to check out this feast:There are six types of beef to look out for:Aomori rice beef — a 20-month old cattle from Northern Japan that is fed only whole rice plants and fresh water. This striploin cut is incredibly fat and marbled, and is only available on Fridays and Saturdays. There’s a huge range of salts and sauces to pair this with, but we like going with the sea salt.Mayura full-blood Wagyu — a 500-day chocolate and grain-fed cattle from Australia. Its diet gives this beef a distinct sweet and nutty character. This cut is from the cattle’s shoulder blade, and is very tender.Grass-fed cattle from Cape Grim in Tasmania — this tenderloin cut is a little bit drier, but it packs a cleaner flavour. Pair it with river salt.Zebu (Brazil) — a grass-fed cattle. The hump cut is slow-cooked in cellophane, this one has a robust flavour and firm, somewhat stringy texture.Black Angus from USA — steak lovers need little introduction to this. The grain-fed meat is famous for its finely and evenly marbled flesh, which is tender, juicy and intense on the palate.New Zealand Short Ribs — the regular offering here, this cut is fork-tender and melts in your mouth.\xa0\xa0Himalayan salt, sea salt and veal jus are just some of the seasonings and accompaniments available to bring out the meat’s flavours.\xa0\xa0Succulent rotisserie chicken, New Zealand roasted leg of lamb, crispy pork knuckle with crackling, caramelised sweet potatoes, buttery mashed potatoes, and pillowy Yorkshire pudding are some of the non-beef offerings available.\xa0\xa0Can’t decide which beef to go for? Not sure what seasoning you want for your meats? The Carvery’s friendly chefs are on hand to lend you their knowledge and recommendations.\xa0\xa0Super fancy labels such as Torbreck Woodcutters Shiraz 2014 from Australia and St Francis Cabernet Sauvignon 2013 from California. \xa0The wine lists contains more than 50 wines, and the chefs here actually work with wine suppliers to choose varieties that will best suit the feast.\xa0\xa0If you’re hankering for some cocktails after the meal, simply adjourn to Aqua Luna for some chill-out vibes and delicious cocktails. If you’re dining during the day, you can walk out to the pool and take in the sun or people watch in between rounds of meat.\xa0The Great Meat Feast is priced at $78 (Sunday – Thursday) and $88 (Friday and Saturday). It will run till 22 October.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/midas/:['Sax, the owner of Midas located at Jalan Kukoh is a self-confessed Jack of all trades: he has spent 25 years in the F&B business doing almost every job imaginable. He has been a waiter, a captain, a manager, a director in restaurants and hotels. This is in addition to opening clubs and being a bartender as well! After thinking about starting his own food business for the longest time, he finally decided to take the plunge 9 months ago by leaving a cushy job at a brand-name hotel to open his hawker stall at Jalan Kukoh.It is here where he reinvents the roti prata – a common staple on every Singaporeans’ list of guilty pleasures. On the menu are innovative dishes such as the Golden Pocket Murtabak Puff ($2.50 – $2.80), the Master Touch Chicken Curry ($4.50 – $5.80), Golden Touch Baked Roti Prata Served With Signature Curry ($1 for plain, $1.50 for spring onion, min order of 2 pieces), and Golden Yolky Baked Roti Prata ($5). Sax, who runs a one man show, says he reaches his stall at 6am everyday to start prepping his ingredients.Given that many of the regulars at Jalan Kukoh Food Centre are middle-aged or elderly folks, it’s not easy getting them to accept his reinvented roti prata, says Sax. He shares that one factor which contributed to his decision to sell reinvented roti prata was that there was no other prata stall in the food centre when he first started – although that has now changed.\xa0With the Golden Pocket Murtabak Puff (Sardine), Sax wanted to create a murtabak that could be eaten on the go. Other than a savoury, spicy sardine filling, this is also packed with plenty of corn and peas to make the overall taste less fishy, and give it more depth.The Golden Touch Baked Roti Prata can be ordered ala carte, or in a set with the Master Touch Chicken Curry or Golden Yolky Baked Roti Prata. Because these pratas are baked and not fried, they’re a lot less sinful and oily. Taste wise, we preferred the Spring Onion version, which is more fragrant and slightly more flaky – although both are a good base which you can use to mop up the curry or salted egg yolk.\xa0If you have to choose between the Golden Yolky Baked Roti Prata and the Master Touch Chicken Curry, we’d say go for the latter. Although the Golden Yolky Baked Roti Prata is rich in flavour and extremely palatable, we found the masala flavour a tad subtle. All in all, it’s a great dish in itself – but it’s nowhere as standout as the Master Touch Chicken Curry, which we have nothing but praises for.\xa0With the Master Touch Chicken Curry, Sax is light-handed on the coconut milk and oil, and uses mustard seeds to enhance its flavour. The result is a thick and potent curry which is non-oily, not too salty, but still extremely satisfying. We also love the slightly bitter aftertaste, which can be attributed to the mustard seeds.The texture of the chicken is also amazingly succulent – in fact, it’s one of the best we’ve ever had. According to Sax, many hawkers who serve curry chicken simply boil the chicken in the curry – but the trick is to blanch the chicken first, then steam it, before finally adding it into the curry. It’s a more tedious process, but it makes a world of difference.Whilst Sax readily admits that the location of his stall in Jalan Kukoh is not ideal, he says he hopes to be able to grow his business and move to a more central location in the future. If all goes well, the end goal is to open a cafe, where he can experiment with more dishes including fusion desserts. We’re pretty sure that’ll happen in the near future – as long as he keeps that showstopper curry chicken dish on the menu!Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/how-to-pick-durian/:['There’s a science to the way durian sellers categorise durians – big, small, round and oval; for thorns, very sharp and thorny, or blunt. You may think this method trivial, but these characteristics do affect the price you pay. Even more crucial to the cost of durian are the flavours and aromas. The latter ranges from mild to a full-on, almost intolerable pungency that promises nothing but the most bitter taste.Most durian sellers won’t reveal their trade secrets. From the little we’ve managed to gather, we know we should pick durians that are lighter in weight and pay attention to pungency levels for desired sweetness.\xa0What are the other tips?\xa01. Listen\n“If you shake the fruit and it sounds like soggy maracas, you’ve got a winner.”\nDiana Ho, 74, a lover of the fruit for over 50 years, swears by a technique that never fails to get the best of the lot: “The thorny, odd-shaped ones are the most bitter and flavourful,” she shares in Cantonese. “Tap the side of the fruit and listen carefully to tell if the tap is hollow or full sounding. Make sure it is only slightly hollow,” she adds. An unwilling-to-be-named durian seller at Ah Hung Company shared the same tips. “The sound that comes from tapping the durian shell should be crisp and clear,” he explains in Mandarin.According to Ho, a dull sound is a telling sign that the durian is full of water (bad). Loud and loose-sounding knocks are bad too because it either means the seeds are large or the fruit is unripe. If you shake the fruit and it sounds like soggy maracas (a percussion instrument), you’ve got a winner.\xa02. Eat fresh\nAvoid buying pre-packed durian. Unless you watch them pack the fruit, the quality of packed durian is inconsistent at best and a waste of money at worst.\xa03. Always eat on-site\nA helper at a fruit shop in Geylang advises: “Always eat on site, don’t take-away.” It is often easier to ask for a replacement when the durians are less than satisfactory when you’re dining in.\xa04. Don’t rush \nA little durian-sleuthing revealed that in May prices of whole durians range from $8-$18 per kg of durian, depending on variety.\xa0 Don’t be persuaded to pay anything more than that, said a durian seller we interviewed. He added that prices will drop significantly by mid-June, once the incoming supply of durians surges.\xa05. Don’t be afraid to ask\nAsk around, ask us. Through our ultimate durian taste test, we found the nicest, and the most unpleasant, durian stalls to patronise – there are a good number of places where you can get your fix at a reasonable price, some just round the corner from where you live.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/siu-mai/:['Steaming is a popular method of Chinese cooking but it’s also one of the most under-rated techniques. Much to the contrary, steaming doesn’t make food bland or uninteresting, think those small bites and steamed goodness at dim sum restaurants.When done right, steaming delivers healthy, ultra-light and scrumptious dishes, for example, steamed fish, siew mai (pork dumpling) and black bean spare ribs.Recipe: Steamed Siu MaiSiu Mai or steamed pork dumplings are possibly one of the most ordered dim sum items.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/pablo-cheese-tart/:['Cheese tart-obsessed Singaporeans now have reason to rejoice: after months of hype and anticipation, the famous Japanese cheese tart chain PABLO will open its Singapore outlet on 8 August 2017.PABLO Cheese Tart Singapore will be located at Wisma Atria, and will carry many cheese-based snacks and desserts, such as their 15cm-wide Signature PABLO Freshly Baked Cheese Tart, PABLO mini cheese tarts, PABLO smoothies, and PABLO soft-serve ice-cream.In Japan, PABLO is known to allow customers to choose the ‘doneness’ of the tarts — whether they want it medium or rare. PABLO Cheese Tart Singapore only offers them in medium doneness. So you know those oozy, gooey cheese cores that routinely launch a thousand Instagram posts? Not gonna find that here.\xa0Other than that, if you’ve been to PABLO Japan and like it there, you’re probably going to want to make a visit to the Singapore outlet. The local chefs have received training from the Japanese staff ahead of Tuesday’s opening to try to keep standards here comparable.That said, how do the tarts fare, taste-wise?We checked out some of PABLO’s offerings in advance to let you know our thoughts.PABLO Freshly Baked Cheese Tart ($15 for a whole tart)Like we said, the tarts all come in medium doneness; the cheese custard is firmer here, so don’t expect a oozy, gooey cheese core. That said, the tart sports a nicely browned, flaky crust, and is crowned with a delicate layer of apricot jam, which gives the pastry a little sweet-sourness. Overall, we thought the custard’s texture just fluffy enough, but where’s the cheese flavour? It’s a cheese tart that doesn’t really taste like a cheese tart.PABLO Mini Original\xa0($3.50 per piece)PABLO’s Mini Original is markedly cheesier than its larger counterpart. If you’re looking for a semi-molten cheese filling, this is the one you should be going for. It’s pretty reminiscent of the more “standard” cheese tarts already available on the market, and comparisons to BAKE’s cheese tarts will definitely arise. Its crust is crumbly instead of flaky, and we personally enjoyed the extra bite here, something missing in the Original Cheese tart. Overall, pretty good.PABLO Cheese Soft-Serve Ice-CreamOne lick and we were hooked. This soft-serve is the bomb. Silky smooth, subtly cheesy and not too sweet, this soft-serve ice-cream makes for a light but delicious snack/dessert.PABLO Premium Cheese Tart ($7.50 per slice, $28 whole)Basically cheese tart meets creme brulee. This cheese tart comes with a crispy, crackling crown of caramelised sugar. The saccharine burst from the sugar does provide a nice balance to the slightly sour cheese. We were mixed about the texture of the custard — it’s a lot firmer and denser than the aforementioned cheese tarts. It is also conspicuously lacking a crust. It’s not bad tasting, but this one felt more like a cheesecake than a cheese tart proper.PABLO Freshly Baked Chocolate Cheese Tart ($18) and\xa0PABLO Freshly Baked Matcha Cheese Tart With Shiratama & Azuki ($18)Think\xa0PABLO Freshly Baked Cheese Tart — but with chocolate and matcha/azuki beans mixed in with the cheese. While we enjoyed the original flavour, we can’t say our enthusiasm extended to these two tarts. They tasted and felt way too much like a mousse cake, and you could hardly discern the cheese, with the chocolate and matcha flavours just coming across as too overpowering. The Matcha Cheese Tart With Shiratama & Azuki does come with generous amounts of azuki beans and shiratama dango, but because of that the tart is starved of custard. Our least favourite items on the menu.PABLO Classic Cheese Tart Smoothie ($7.80)Huh? A cheese tart smoothie?\xa0Yes, we know it sounds kind of wacky, but this drink isn’t bad tasting. Like the tart, this smoothie is neither too cheesy nor too sweet, but still pretty tasty.We’ll be updating this space with more thoughts on soon-to-be-released items at PABLO, so keep your eyes peeled!\xa0\xa0PABLO Cheese Tart Singapore\nAddress: Wisma Atria Shopping Centre, 435 Orchard Road #01-02/38, Singapore 238877 |\xa0Tel: +65 6835 9269 |\xa0Opening Hours: 10:00am – 10:00pmAuthor© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

To up the scare factor, there is also an option to add an entire deep-fried piranha as a topping for the noodles. As the restaurant imported just 2,000 fish for the event, the piranha ramen will only be sold from September 20 to 23, and limited to 300 servings a day.Pictures shared by the restaurant on Yahoo! Japan, where it is selling tickets for the event, shows a bowl of ramen featuring a whole piranha, teeth and all. A video promoting the event\xa0presented to viewers the raw piranha before cooking, as well as the chef preparing the dish. According to the YouTuber who tried the ramen, it tasted pretty good.\xa0This unique meal, which the restaurant reckons is a world first, will cost diners quite a bit. The piranha ramen goes for 3,000 yen ($38), while the fried piranha topping is sold separately for 2,500 yen ($31). At 5,500 yen for the full set, this piranha ramen is about six times as expensive as your average ramen in Japan, which typically goes for about 800 yen a bowl.\xa0While red-bellied piranhas have gained a bad reputation as fearsome fish, they are primarily scavengers and foragers. This means that they do not actively hunt other animals for food.

A modern, minimalist 400-seater restaurant at Shangri-La, their buffet has 16 stations that offer worldly fare, from pesto spaghetti cooked on the spot to satay skewers aplenty, sashimi, Indian curry and a carvery. Get some creamery style ice-cream with the toppings mashed up, and finish with a freshly-brewed flavoured cappuccino at the barista bar. If you’re a diehard seafood fan, go for the marine harvest special on Tuesday and Thursday nights. All 16 kitchens will transform into seafood stations serving up a mix of traditional and new creations featuring fresh catches like Boston lobsters, king prawns and crabs. Desserts are also a dream with choices such as ice cream teppanyaki (iron-griddle cooked food) and piping-hot soufflés. The Line also does a great Sunday brunch, but if you’re brunching at the Shangri-la, give The Waterfall café a try.Prices: Dinner: Tue & Thu $102.64 with unlimited sparkling wine; Mon, Wed, Sun $84.24 with unlimited non-alcoholic drinks; Fri-Sat $91.26 with unlimited non-alcoholic drinks.\xa0Carousel\nHalal, international buffet that requires stamina\nThis one is for the serious ‘buffetarian’.

There is a small mezze selection and a large salad bar, a rotisserie and Middle-Eastern chicken kebabs. Have your pasta cooked à la minute and paired with their freshly baked bread and halal cheese. The European selection has a decent beef bourguignon and carrot au gratin. There is Asian and Indian fare and separate stations for noodles, dim sum and even one for Hainanese chicken rice with all the condiments.

Among the hot food counters, there’s a good rendition of Singapore chili crab, garlic steamed fish and local favorite – laksa. Wait, there’s more; dim sum, noodles, salad, Korean and Chinese food, so pile those plates high and make multiple rounds. We had little room for desserts but the tower of macarons could not be ignored.Prices: Lunch: Tue, Thu & Fri child $30.42, adult $53.82; Mon & Wed child $30.42, adult $67.86; Sat, Sun, eve of public holidays and public holidays child $30.42, adult $74.88 | Dinner: Tue, Thu & Fri child $30.42, adult $79.56; Mon & Wed child $30.42, adult $66.86; Sat, Sun, eve of public holidays and public holidays child $30.42, adult $79.88.\xa0Forlino\xa0\nA bay side brunch buffet\nForlino\xa0(Buffet hours: Sat-Sun noon-2.30pm) weekend à la carte buffet features three appetisers, three pasta dishes, two mains, three desserts and unlimited refills. Chef Kentaro Torii rotates the dishes regularly, but past menus have included a cream of mushroom soup, straccetti with beef ragout, white tuna with lemon butter sauce, homemade ice cream and sorbet. The buffet is available at a hard-to-beat one-for-one offer until June 2013. Bay views and fine Italian cuisine is how we want to spend our next weekend.Prices: $102.96 for two\xa0Cherry Garden\nElegant, all-you-can-eat dim sum\nCherry Garden (Buffet hours: Sat-Sun 11am-1pm, 1.30-3.30pm) with its dark wood decor and intimate Oriental courtyard ambience is the most desirable setting for a dim sum buffet. The main dining hall overlooks the Marina Bay and can accommodate only 70 people at a time, making this weekends-only lunch experience cosy and exclusive. What to eat? The gold dusted (yes – edible, powdered gold) steamed bamboo pith and prawn dumplings or the poached garlic pork and mushroom dumplings in spicy Thai sauce. Move on to the meats and try the flawlessly glazed Kurobuta char siew and silky-skinned braised soy chicken. For dessert, we recommend the cream of avocado with walnut ice cream and the exotic watermelon chutney with aloe vera, crystal pears and lemongrass jelly.Prices: adult $79.56, child $46.80\xa01 Market\nChef Wan’s big buffet\nHelmed by Malaysian (although, did you know, he was born in Singapore) celebrity chef, Chef Wan, 1 Market (Buffet hours: Daily 11.30am–2.30pm, 6–10pm) at Plaza Singapura almost needs no introduction with the hype around it since its opening in November 2012. On a daily basis, makcik (Malay aunty) fangirls of Chef Wan’s queue up for a dining spot in the 450-seater halal buffet restaurant. We ate our way through the big buffet and brought you our detailed verdict here..\xa0MELT – The World Café\nSweet ‘Marketplace’ hotel buffet\nThe experience MELT – The World Café (Buffet hours: Daily 6.30–10.30am, noon–2.30pm, 6.30–10pm; Sun noon–3pm) would like you to take away is that of a high-end market place. Of the live and prepared buffet stations, you can find Indian, Italian, Thai, Chinese and Mediterranean sections. Our strategy through this 300-seater is always to get in on the made-to-order handmade angel hair pasta (three types every day) swirled up in a light, not-so-tart tomato and basil sauce; then the neighbouring station for tandoor-cooked meats in their specially-built oven – the lamb is the best where the meat is cooked just right and not dried out. After which, head straight for the packed patisserie counter – from freshly-made Belgian waffles, a chocolate fountain and chocolate mousse in cups (when eaten with the mint ice cream this harkens to Andes mint chocolates), to a display case of sweet treats in shot glasses and tiers of indulgent full-sized cakes. Yes, you do get to determine the size of your slice, but why should it be less than generousPrices: Lunch: Mon-Sat $79.56, Sun $128.38 & $184.86 with unlimited Champagne; Dinner: Sun-Wed $91.26, Thu-Sat $102.96.\xa0Equinox Restaurant\nA semi-buffet lunch with a view\xa0\nThe view from the 70th floor of Swissotel The Stamford is one of the island’s best – so enjoy it while tucking into a semi-buffet lunch spread at Equinox Restaurant (Buffet hours: Mon-Sat noon-2.30pm). Gorge on unlimited servings of soup, salad, cold seafood and desserts but keep room for the main courses (you can order one from a selection of six). It’s hard to pick between the ballotine of Sakura chicken breast and the half-grilled Maine lobster (additional top-up of $15), but try. It would be unfair to enjoy this view and not have a drink at hand; thankfully the buffet includes a glass of Casa Lapostolle Sauvignon Blanc or Merlot. On Sundays, the restaurant offers a full international buffet ($173 with unlimited champagne, $149.76 with unlimited non-alcoholic drinks).Prices: Mon-Sat adult $69, child $34.50\xa0Cafebiz\nWholesome and healthy international selection\nCafebiz (Buffet hours: Mon-Fri noon-2.30pm; Sat & Sun noon-3pm) at Traders Hotel nods to spring in their popular lunchtime International buffet. The menu is actually inspired by flowers, fruit and tea (for the months of March and April) and the food is infused with their goodness. Savour creations such as scallops ceviche infused with jasmine tea and yuzu vinaigrette, poached seafood in spicy roselle broth and a glazed Lapsang Souchang chicken – all delightfully light on the palate. Other mainstays of the buffet are the roasted meat corner, laksa and fresh seafood on ice.Prices: Mon-Fri $52.65; Sat & Sun $65.52\xa0Alkaff Mansion Ristorante\nHilltop buffet, hijinks, with bubbles\nBreathe in the fresh air of Telok Blangah Green at Alkaff Mansion Ristorante (Buffet hours: Sun 11.30am-3pm) where towering decade-old trees add to the serene surroundings. Located in a gracious colonial house, Alkaff Mansion makes a dignified alternative to most crowded, overloaded hotel options. Its Sunday prosecco brunch allows you to help yourself to a cosy Italian spread of cold items such as wagyu beef carpaccio and fresh oysters, with hot pasta and roasts served and plated up to your table. More importantly, the free-flow tipple is NV Bisol Belstar prosecco, a refreshing aperitif made from late ripening grapes in Italy’s most famous prosecco region. Homemade pastries round out the feel-good buffet, and you can walk off the calories in the adjacent park.Prices: $88++ per person\xa0Au Jardin\nA Sunday buffet brunch amid lush greenery\nWhen it comes to an exclusive spot for Sunday brunch, few places can match up to Au Jardin’s (Buffet hours: Sun 11am-1pm & 1-3pm) picturesque setting at the Botanic Gardens. If you want to have the best seats in the house, snag the tables on the small balcony facing an expanse of greenery. A small but all-you-can-eat selection of starters await at the buffet table. Expect decadent bites such as foie gras terrine, duck rillettes (cured meat paste) and tempura of fish and prawn beignet (fritters). You’ll also receive a serving of soup, eggs Benedict and a choice of main course, dessert and coffee or tea. Chef Ng Wei Han changes up the main courses twice a month to include seasonal offerings, but past signature dishes include Boston lobster pasta with sweet basil and sea salt-baked ocean trout.Price: adult $84.24, child $43.12\xa0Annalakshmi Janatha Restaurant\nAll-you-can-eat, for whatever you can pay\nAnnalakshmi Janatha restaurant (Buffet hours: 11am-3pm; 6-9.30pm) is named after the goddess of plenty and runs by the ethos “atithidevo bhav” (Sanskrit for “the guest is God”). The atmosphere here is like dining at an Indian friend’s home. The menu changes on the chef’s whim (those who cook and serve at Annalakshmi are volunteers of the charitable organisation by the same name) but the food is consistently good. We have tried their appam (fermented rice pancake) and vegetable stew, potato palya (dry, spiced potatoes) and cauliflower curry among a slew of other North and South Indian home-cooked dishes. You can order off a menu or take your pick from the regularly rotated buffet counter. Annalakshmi invites customers to pay what they wish (or can). For the amount we ate, we sheepishly dropped a hefty dollar.Price: As you wish\xa0The Magic of Chongqing Hotpot\nSteamboat buffet with a rich, hearty stock\nThe Magic Of Chongqing Hotpot (Buffet hours: Daily noon-3pm; 6-10.30pm) is the undisputed mother of steamboat buffet restaurants and popular for their rich chicken stock soup base. Other unique soup bases on offer are the ma la (“Mandrin for “numb” and “spicy”) chilli, herbal chicken, herbal turtle broth and hotpot with preserved vegetable. There is an unlimited supply of fresh ingredients such as thinly-sliced beef, sliced pork, fish paste, carp fillet, green vegetables, varieties of mushrooms and four dipping sauces to choose from. Wash all this down with a cup of fragrant (and good for digestion) Eight Treasures tea.Price: Lunch: Mon-Fri $24.45, Sat & Sun $26.79; Dinner: Mon-Fri $39.60, Sat & Sun $42\xa0Brazil Churrasco\nBuffet of meat, meat and more meat\nAt 19-year-old institution Brazil Churrasco (Buffet hours: Daily 6-11pm) you are treated to an authentic Brazillian barbeque and can gorge on over 14 kinds of beef, chicken, pork, lamb and specialty sausages. Giant skewers heavy with various types of meat are brought to your table by passadors (meat-wielding waiters) who carve what you want onto your plate. The meat assault is intense, and you are warned (there are signs in the menu) to go easy if you aren’t used to consuming meat in such large quantities. Alternate your servings with helpings from their salad bar, and the recommended tipple to wash all this down with is a potent rum-based Caiprinha.Prices: adult $52.65 (for salad bar only $30.42), child $18.71\xa02D1N Soju Bang\nKorean fever hits this buffet\nThe phenomena that is ‘2D1N Sojubang’ – a Korean TV show – has spilled over into 2D1N Soju Bang (Buffet hours: Daily 5.30pm-3am) – the authentic Korean buffet restaurant. Expect snaking queues (no reservations allowed) and spiffily dressed youngsters alongside more staid Korean food lovers. Help yourself to the generous buffet spread of raw, marinated meats, seafood and vegetables, and grill them to personal perfection at your table. The addiction factor comes from the fabulous dipping sauces, as well as lettuce wraps for cutting through the glistening meats. Beware of smelling like a barbecue – but it’s all worth it.Prices: $23.40 per person\xa0Basilico\nBest Italian lunch buffet\nThe buffet spread at Basilico at The Regent hotel (Buffet hours: Mon-Sat noon-2.30pm, Sun noon-3pm), bears such a distinct Italian flavour you’d be forgiven for thinking the Don and his clan are coming to lunch. Help yourself to an exceptionally well-curated selection of breads, cheeses, and antipasti such as marinated tiger prawns and sea bass carpaccio, pizzas, a variety of pasta including lasagna, carvings (think Angus beef sirloin and roasted leg of lamb) as well as grilled fish. For desserts, zero in on the gelato which is made fresh daily. On weekends, say cheers to their prosecco lunch, which is an all-Italian affair with an extensive antipasti spread and classic mains like squid ink tonnarelli and seafood risotto. Sundays see the spread expand even further to include live cooking stations, a cheese room and a foie gras bar.Prices: Mon-Fri $56.16; Sat $63.18 with free flow non-alcoholic drinks, $126.36 with free flow prosecco; Sun $103 with free flow non-alcoholic drinks, $149.76 with free flow prosecco\xa0Brasserie Les Saveurs\nA tai tai style high tea buffet\nSpoil yourself at The Grand Astor Afternoon Tea, a legacy of St Regis’ founding matriarch, Caroline Astor.

The latest additions to this afternoon tea experience are the live stations serving up fluffy pancakes, waffles and crepes done a la minute. Go on, indulge. Drop by for the high tea on a Saturday and partake in a tea dance to a live band. Left feet? Not to worry, they have instructors on hand.Prices: Sun-Fri $53.82; Sat $65.52\xa0Oscar’s Cafe & Terrace\nA graze-worthy buffet\nThe buffet spread at Oscar’s Café & Terrace’s (Buffet hours: Mon-Sat noon-2.30pm, 6-10.30pm; Sun noon-3pm) is East-meets-West for both lunch and dinner and is one of the longest (and most exhaustive) in town. Begin at the noodle counter for a choice of laksa, sliced fish soup, prawn noodles, bak chor mee (minced meat noodles) and wanton noodles. Then move on to the Chinese-style wok dishes such as steamed sea bass with XO chilli sauce and tang gui slipper lobster. Curry lovers will be pleased with the authentic array of north Indian meat and vegetable dishes. Graze further at the salad section, with its amazing variety of greens, nuts, dressings and even homemade freeze-dried fruits. Oscar’s Caesar salad has many takers – what with the creamy dressing, crunchy croutons and fat slivers of anchovy. Swing by on a Sunday for an expanded selection that includes a proper Sunday roast. On offer are five types of ocean-fresh molluscs from France, Italy, Ireland and Scotland.Prices: Lunch: Mon-Sat $62, Sun $173.16 with unlimited Champagne, $91.26 with unlimited non-alcoholic drinks; Dinner Sun-Thu $59, Fri & Sat $78The Courtyard\nAn institutional buffet for chocolate lovers\nThe Courtyard at The Fullerton Hotel (Buffet hours: Fri & Sat 8-11pm) has a legendary chocolate buffet that has been around for 11 years, so it’s no one-hit wonder. Why is it worth the calories? Served with unlimited coffee and tea, the buffet menu includes both classic and experimental dishes. There is wasabi lime chocolate jelly, a salted chocolate caramel tart and gourmet chocolate creations such as cakes, tarts, brownies and pralines. The highlight is the hot chocolate connoisseurs’ bar, where chefs whip up bespoke cups of premium hot chocolate à la minute for guests, who choose from eight different percentages of cocoa.Prices: adult $44.46, $53.92 with a glass of dessert wine, child $22.23\xa0The Corner Place Korean BBQ\nA buffet of Korean home-cooked fare\nThe Corner Place Korean BBQ (Buffet hours: Mon-Thu 6-10pm, Fri-Sun 3-10pm), true to its name, is indeed a cosy, no frills family-style diner. Help yourself to beer and bottled drinks from the fridge at an extra charge, or stick to the included teas and drinks. Pick and grill your own beef bulgogi (marinated beef), marinated galbi (short ribs in Korean soy sauce), different parts of pork and squid, alongside fresh vegetables to make your own wrap. Kimchi fried rice and pancakes round out the hot food selection. Though other buffets offer more variety, the quality and cleanliness here makes for a more than satisfactory outing.Prices: Mon-Thu $25.74, Fri-Sun $27.95\xa0Crystal Cafe\nPorridge, just like grandma makes\nOrchard Grand Court’s Crystal Café (Buffet hours: noon-2.30pm, 6pm-10pm) Taiwan buffet porridge spread proves that you can find cheap eats in a hotel in the heart of town. Dig into standard braised items such as pork trotters, pork belly, chicken wings, chicken feet, tau pok (tofu cakes) and tau kee (beancurd skin). The dishes have a homemade flavour – tastes the way a doting grandma might make it. Lunchtime on weekdays sees an office crowd; on weekends, the place is incredibly popular with families.Prices: Lunch: Mon-Fri adult $16.14, child $13.80, Sat & Sun adult $18.99, child $16.14; Dinner: Daily adult $18.99, child $16.14\xa0Tiffin Room\nDine on Raffles tradition\nOperating since 1899, Raffles Hotel’s historic Tiffin Room (Buffet hours: Daily noon-2pm; 7-10pm) continues dishing up its famous curries to celebrities and politicians. The ‘tiffin’ in colonial times referred to a light meal, but today, the buffet spread offers refined North Indian specialties including piping hot, fluffy naans (baked flat bread) delivered to your table. Why splurge? Think silver service, colonial style decor and white-gloved waiters, alongside ten kinds of chutneys and pickles, ample curries for both vegetarians and non-vegetarians, and hot and cold desserts galore. This is for the serious curry-lover – casual diners may find the spread a bit of overkill after the first few curries.Prices: Lunch $70.20, Dinner $87.75\xa0The Dining Room\nAn old favourite with ‘Women Only’ specials\nThe Dining Room (Buffet hours: Lunch: Mon-Fri noon-2.30pm, Sat & Sun noon-3pm; Dinner Wed-Sun 7-10pm) is a firm favourite with at least three generations of foodies in Singapore. The breath-taking space features tall glass windows facing a scenic waterfall, while the classic buffet spread features seafood platters on ice, Japanese sashimi, prime rib roast, the famous Dining Room laksa and durian pengat (mousse). Look out for ‘Women Only Wednesdays’ when ladies enjoy 50 per cent off the Mediterranean dinner spread. Also, these guys seem to be the only ones whose (lunch) buffet prices go down on the weekends, the spread however, remains just as exhaustive.Prices: Lunch: Mon-Fri $48.90, Sat & Sun $45.66; Dinner: Wed-Sun $67.86\xa0Edge\nJust don’t call it a buffet\xa0\nPan Pacific Singapore’s Edge (Buffet hours: Daily noon-2.30pm, 6-10pm) features cuisine from the Pacific edge (get it?) – open concept kitchens serve Chinese, Malay, Indian, Singaporean, Thai, Japanese and Australian cuisines. Despite the all-you-can-eat price, the restaurant steers away from being called a buffet, instead asking diners to focus on the a la minute offerings, from fresh crab at the chilli crab station and satay at the charcoal grill, to pasta and noodle prepared on the spot. They call themselves a food theatre, and rightfully so. Be spoilt for choice at the elaborate dessert station, with two chocolate fondue fountains, ice cream counter and live crepe and waffle station. Edge ups their game on Sundays with a live foie gras station, a whole suckling pig and carving stations featuring home-cured Norwegian salmon and a whole Parma ham, and we’ve spotted a sugarcane juice machine in a corner – nice touch!Price: Lunch: Mon-Sat adult $56.16, child $28, Sun adult $114.66, child $57.33; Dinner: Sun-Thu adult $67.86, child $28, Fri & Sat adult $79.59, child $39.78\xa0En Japanese Dining Bar\nAll-you-can-drink and an Okinawan buffet\nThe ambience at En Japanese Dining Bar (Buffet hours: Mon-Thu 6-11pm; Fri-Sun noon-3pm, 6-11pm) is light, though the buffet is anything but: a menu of tako harumaki (deep-fried beef and cheese spring rolls), hot soupy udon (thick wheat noodles) and sushi, sashimi, and yakitori provide a full-on Japanese binge. You will need it to soak up the free-flowing Japanese beer ($35 surcharge for two hours). If you are still standing after, grab a scoop of matcha (green tea) ice cream to go.Prices: Lunch: Mon-Thu adult $56.76; Fri-Sun adult $60.84, child $21; Dinner: Fri-Sun adult $56.76, child $21; $35 for two hours of free-flow beer\xa0Mandarin Court\nDim sum buffet for special occasions\nOn the 35th storey of the Mandarin Orchard is the elegant Mandarin Court (Buffet hours: Sat & Sun 11am–12.30pm, 1–3pm), this restaurant has a stunning view and supposedly boasts great feng shui. Suitable for extended family gatherings and lunch with the ladies, chef Sunny Leong pairs time-tested cooking methods with the freshest ingredients. The result is a huge spread of 80 types of dim sum. We like the fish maw dumplings with century egg and XO sauce; and the braised goose web with shiitake mushrooms. The fluffy, steamed pork buns do live up to their reputation, and the siew mai with mushrooms don’t disappoint either. We like the desserts, with the lemon jelly and aloe vera in calamansi lime juice complementing the main dishes perfectly.Price: adult $56.16, child $28.08\xa0Himawari\nHigh quality Japanese buffet\nHimawari (Buffet hours: Daily 11.30am-2.15pm, 6-9.15pm) is as good as it gets when it comes to Japanese food done buffet style. The food won’t win any excellence awards but the standards are better than most, and with over 80 dishes to choose from, there is something for everyone. The sashimi is thick-cut and the hand rolls come chock full of ingredients. More unusual offerings include natto (fermented soybeans) with tuna or squid, grilled salmon head, Japanese salads and generous portions of grilled meat. The service however, leaves much to be desired. Opt for the premium buffet, and you get a one-time order of uni (sea urchin), otoro (tuna belly), oysters and other premium morsels. The oldest (and most reliable) outlet is the one at Alexandra Road.Price: Lunch: Mon-Fri $41.80, Sat & Sun $44; Dinner: Mon-Fri $43.90, Sat-Sun $48.90. Premium buffet $102.96\xa0Clifford\nWaterfront buffet, with award-winning cheese\nClifford (Buffet hours: Sat-Sun noon-3pm) at The Fullerton Bay with its chic, contemporary decor, 10-metre high floor to ceiling windows and waterfront views make it a desirable spot for a weekend brunch buffet. Luckily, the food does not disappoint either. Here’s a hearty spread – eggs Benedict, Belgian waffles, burgers and fries and a truffle omelette There is also the usual: mixed salads, cold seafood, a carving station and mini cakes, but do linger at the cheese bar. Clifford imports their cheese from the award-winning Philippe Olivier cheese shop in Northern France. The Champagne flows freely on Sundays, and Saturdays are devoted to hangover cures, so wash down those eggs and waffles with as many Bloody Marys as you can stomach.Price: Sat adult $102.96 with unlimited house wine, beer and Bloody Mary, child $51.48; Sun adult $149.76 with unlimited champagne, child $74.88Kiseki\nExhaustive Japanese spread that is one of the most affordable in town\nKiseki’s (Buffet hours: Daily 11.30am-3pm; 6-10.30pm) buffet spread spans 29 categories and 200 items. If you need variety, this is where you head to. Although they call themselves a Japanese buffet, they’ve included pasta, pizzas, and western grills (dinner only). What should you eat first? The sashimi, Sri Lankan blue swimmer crabs, ribeye steak, grilled salmon belly, teppanyaki (iron-griddle cooked food) and tempura. Not enough? Fill up on the zosui (Japanese porridge with chicken) and kimchi hotpot. Not Japanese, but still good are the freshly made waffles topped with gelato. This is one of the most affordable buffets in town.Prices: Lunch: Mon-Fri $23.16; Sat, Sun & public holidays $32.56; Dinner Mon-Fri $37.20; Sat, Sun & public holidays $40.70\xa0Greenhouse\nDecadent buffet that demands a dress code\nIf nothing will sate you but the choicest of spreads, in the most luxurious of settings, Greenhouse (Buffet hours: Daily 6am-10.30am, noon-2.30pm, 6-10.30pm) at the Ritz Carlton’s daily buffets and vintage Champagne Sunday brunch is for you. Over 50 (15 on weekdays) international cheeses are ready to melt on your tongue, complemented by slivers of salmon, ham and other meats. Sure, the arsenal of oysters, Boston lobsters and prawns are on display, but it’s okay to practice prudence and skip to desserts, especially when it’s a slew that includes six flavours of freshly-made ice-cream, chocolate mousse topped with caramel and chopped nuts, strawberries in chocolate fondue and an assortment of gummies, M&M’s and other candy. Here on a Sunday? After a couple of flutes move onto their Sunday bar to sample a few (or several) muddled cocktails like mojitos and caiprinhas. Friday and Saturday’s dinner spread has a kicker chilli crab with steamed man tou (Chinese soft wheat bun), charcuterie spread, seafood on ice and a live noodle station. The Greenhouse demands an ‘appropriate’ dress code, so swap those shorts and slippers for pants and closed shoes.Prices: Lunch: Mon-Sat $67.86, Sun $198.56 with free-flow champagne, wine and cocktails; Dinner: Mon-Thu $79.56, Fri & Sat $93.94\xa0Kuishin Bo\nJapanese buffet with roasts and grills\nKuishin Bo’s (Buffet hours: Daily 11.30am-3pm, 5-10pm) buffets are so popular the restaurant chain has spawned two other outlets (Jurong Point and Great World City) since it first opened at Suntec City in 2001. The buffet spread features fresh seafood, sushi and sashimi, salads, appetisers, tempura and desserts. Those in the know come here for the ultra-fresh and sweet Zuwaikani snow crabs, which are either served au naturel or marinated in sweet vinegar.

Savour dishes such as the signature Town laksa, freshly made prata, kueh pie tee, rojak, chicken curry and satay among other local faves.

This food is halal and you can watch the chefs toss your roti prata or grill you some satay through the theatre kitchens. All the local favorites make an appearance; Hainanese chicken rice, beef rendang, biryani and desserts like durian ice cream and almond cream. This is a good spot to bring out-of-town guests – they get to sample a smorgasbord of local fare, in a posh and sanitised environment.Prices: Lunch: $51.48, dinner: $63.18\xa0One-Ninety\nHealthy eaters’ buffet spread\nBreaking away from the usual ‘all you can eat till you burst’ hotel buffets is One-Ninety (Buffet hours: Mon-Fri noon-2.30pm, Sat noon-3pm) at The Four Seasons.

The food does match up to the opulent setting; the buffet is laid out but warm breads are served fresh and fluffy to the table. They do a well-seasoned and perfectly charred tandoori chicken and the vegetable curries and dal (lentils) do not disappoint either. There are two options for dessert and we tried a sweet and sinful carrot halwa (carrots cooked into a pudding with milk and cashews) and the kheer (rice pudding). For all that grandeur, the prices are surprisingly affordable.Prices: Mon-Sat $23.40, Sun $34.90\xa0Peony Jade\nWeekday a la carte dim sum buffet\nPeony Jade (Buffet hours: Daily 11am-2.15pm) makes the cut for being one of the few Chinese restaurants to serve an a la carte dim sum buffet on weekdays. Their weekend line-up adds in a buffet line of roast meats, seasonal greens, noodles and rice, plus desserts. Look for the adorable handcrafted animal-shaped dim sum, which look almost too cute to eat (but they’re too delicious). Order the steamed custard buns, the steamed meat dumplings in hot and sour sauce and the carrot cake.Prices: Mon-Fri $31.35, Sat & Sun $39.55\xa0Yantra\nNorth-Indian buffet in an elegant setting\nYantra (Buffet hours: Daily noon-3pm) at Tanglin Mall exudes a ‘fine dining meets date night’ vibe; the décor spells muted elegance and the a la carte prices are high. So the affordable buffet lunch is a pleasant (and welcome) surprise. Expect an array of North Indian style curries, kebabs (yoghurt-marinated and grilled meat and vegetables) and tandoori items. Mind you, there is more here than just a dal makhani (curried lentils) and chicken curry. We liked the Ab-e-Hayat, a vegetable soup cooked in coconut water and tandoori chaat (a melange of veggies and fresh fruit such as apples, guava, bell peppers and tomatoes marinated and roasted). Our favourite however was their aromatic dum biryani – think biryani, but steam cooked in an earthen pot.Prices: Mon-Thu $19, Fri & Sat $25, Sun $49 with unlimited non-alcoholic beveragesPete’s Place\nA soup, salad and pasta buffet\nKnown for their Italian comfort fare and wood-fired oven pizzas, Pete’s Place’s (Buffet hours: Mon-Sat noon-2.30pm) soup and salad, lunch buffet is just right for a working lunch or an in-between shopping break – their convenient location on Scotts Road certainly helps.

Opt for the pasta buffet, where you can fill up on two choices of pasta (past menus have included spaghetti aglio olio or hearty Bolognese) in addition to the soup and salad option.Prices: Pasta buffet $40.95, salad buffet $32.76\xa0Pin Wei Xuan\nLate-night hidden gem\nRelative newcomer Pin Wei Xuan (Buffet hours: Daily 5.30pm-3am) offers cooked Szechuan cuisine but is especially known for its value-for-money steamboat buffets. For night owls in the Zouk vicinity, it’s a godsend as the brightly-lit restaurant stays open till 3am. Tuck into a range of standard steamboat items such as thinly sliced meat, prawns and vegetables, alongside a choice of soup: pork bone, mushroom, tomato and spicy Szechuan mala. Hungry gourmands have the option to upgrade to higher end meats such as the US beef – just make sure someone is able to speak Mandarin to the staff.Prices: $29.13 per person\xa0Pool Grill\nA wine and beer buffet\nWe can’t all escape to Bali (or Sentosa) even on a whim – so do the next best thing and enjoy Pool Grill’s (Buffet hours: Sun-Thu 11am-10pm, Fri & Sat 11am-11pm) daily wine and beer buffet by the enticing Marriott hotel’s swimming pool. Even if you saunter in at 11am, you can tuck right into the selection of wines and Carlsberg beer, which is unlimited for two hours from the time you start imbibing. Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Cabernet Sauvignon and Shiraz are the merry vinos as you while away a breezy afternoon. If you get peckish, there is the famous Marriott burger ($22) and other gourmet bites on the regular and bar menu.Prices: $52.65 for two hours\xa0Yum Cha\nOld school dim sum buffet, with pushcarts\xa0\nEverything about this Chinatown eatery from the interior to the food, is unpretentious. Yum Cha’s (Buffet hours: Daily 3-6pm) old school marble-topped tables and wooden chairs are stuck in a time warp of sorts. This a high tea buffet and the à la carte dim sum menu includes over 60 items including desserts. The classics, such as har kau (prawn dumplings), siew mai and yam puffs, are done well, and the century egg and lean meat congee is done the way we like it – smooth yet not too thick. They also have some unique offerings such as the siew mai with spinach, deep-fried prawn and mango sesame fritters and pan-fried pork pancake. A must-try is the crispy red bean with banana pancake from the dessert tray.Prices: adult $25.70, child $19.80\xa0The Ramen Stall\nKushiyaki high tea buffet\nThe Ramen Stall (Buffet hours: Sat & Sun 2-5pm) is not really a stall, but it is a casual eatery off Selegie Road that serves (what else) ramen. What’s special? They do an all you can eat, high tea kushiyaki (skewer grilled) buffet. There are more than 35 kinds to choose from – take your pick of and gorge on stick after stick of beef, pork, chicken, salmon, pork neck and vegetables which are barbequed on the kushiyaki grill. All you need is a chilled mug of beer to accompany the stick snacks.Prices: adult $33.70, child $19.66\xa0The Rice Table\nA variation on nasi padang\nWhile trendy at one time, eat-all-you-can Dutch-style rijsttafel (rice meal) can now only be found at the single outlet of The Rice Table (Buffet hours: Daily noon-3pm; 6-9.15pm). The price is right for 14 dishes at lunch and 20 dishes at dinner, where unlimited small plates of each dish, such as tahu telor (fried tofu) and sambal kangkong are served to your table. We love the chicken dishes, especially the satay, soto, and fried chicken on the dinner menu. Quick service, halal-certified ingredients and a pleasant dining room add to the no-frills experience.Prices: Lunch $17.88; Dinner $28.49\xa0Senso Ristorante & Bar\nCheesy, Italian prosecco brunch buffet\nOn Sundays Senso Ristorante & Bar (Buffet hours: Sun 11.30am-3.30pm) puts its right wheel forward. From its cellar comes a big round of Parmesan cheese for its weekly unlimited Prosecco brunch buffet. This long-standing Italian brunch (since 2006) has a lot going for it. Apart from the pear- and apple-noted Torresella extra-dry Prosecco and soft and hard cheese selection (five, including the generous wheel), this mix of a la carte (order as many servings of the pasta, meat and fish dishes, but only one of the main) and buffet-line items serves sophisticated portions to ensure diners get the best variety. Start with oysters, Parma ham and melon, and beef carpaccio; fill up with the interesting primi piatti pastas (fusilli with duck ragout remains our favourite), meats (robust stewed oxtail with potato mousse is our choice) and tiramisu, among others.Prices: $114.66 with unlimited prosecco & rosé prosecco, $138 with unlimited Ca’del Bosco Franciacorta sparkling wine, Italian wines and beer\xa0Suanthai\nIn the mood for Siam\nPerennially popular Thai food is served a la carte style at Suanthai, at reasonable buffet prices. Though plain water is chargeable and many meat items are limited to a one-time order, the restaurant stands out for its variety of salads, soups and mains, ending with a small offering of sweets. Some special items include the deep-fried egg beancurd and pomelo salad. Their tom yum soup is fiery (just the way we like it). To douse the fire, top up $1.70 per person for unlimited helpings of pineapple rice.Prices: Lunch: Mon-Fri adult $21.10, child $15.20, Sat & Sun adult $22.11, child $16.40; Dinner: Mon-Thu adult $23.48, child $18.25, adult Fri-Sun $24.44, child $18.72\xa0The Coffee Lounge\nA traditional Taiwanese porridge buffet\nThe Coffee Lounge (Buffet hours: Daily noon-2.30pm; 6-10.30pm) at Goodwood Park Hotel has a stately décor, so sink right into those plush seats. Few things say ‘comfort food’ like a piping hot bowl of plain porridge accompanied with home-style dishes and condiments. This Taiwan porridge a la carte buffet is all that and more. You can find old favourites such as fried omelette with crunchy chye poh (preserved radish), braised pork belly done just the way grandma does, chilled beancurd in Japanese soya sauce and pork floss, and seafood dishes such as baby squid in sweet oyster sauce and sautéed prawns with dried chilli. The plain porridge, enhanced with sweet potato, is slurp-worthy. The price also includes a selection of desserts.Price: $44.75 per person\xa0Tripple Three\nA brimming local, Indian and western buffet\nMeritus Mandarin’s buffet restaurant, Triple Three (Buffet hours: Daily 6.30–10.30am, noon–2.30pm, 6.30–10pm; Sun noon–3pm) (named after its address at 333 Orchard Road) has eight stations dishing out Asian and International foods. There is no contest that the sashimi, seafood and salads are fresh, though this buffet is renowned for its premium roasts, teppanyaki, local tze char favourites and spicy Indian staples. Here is what typical plates will look like: blue cheese alongside grapes, dried fruit and papadums(roasted lentil crisp-bread); a bowl of, if you get lucky, lobster bisque and asparagus soup; sambal sting ray, la la (sambal-fried clams) and chilli crab with man tou (fried/steamed buns); biryani rice, oysters, pasta with white asparagus (made to order) and long beans stir-fried in garlic (by this time all rules have gone out the window); roast wagyu beef and teppanyaki bean sprouts, prawns and beef; and an assortment of Nyonya and Western desserts. We’re full just from repeating this mouthful.Price: Lunch: Mon-Sat $56.16, Sun $67.56; Dinner: Mon-Fri $102.96, Sat & Sun $114.66\xa0The Square\nA buffed up buffet\nThe Square (Buffet hours: Daily noon-2.30pm, 6pm-10pm) created a buzz when it first launched, and till today the crowds continue swarming, so much so a second outlet has opened at Novotel Clarke Quay. The value for money promotions and ample international selections help this restaurant stay popular with the family crowd. Sashimi, fresh seafood on ice and the crab dishes – including salted egg yolk crab – are the first on the list, followed by a la minute Asian noodles and plenty of mini cakes for desserts. Highlights of this spread are the mussels and chicken stewed in laksa lobster broth and served with a you tiao like dough fritter. On Sundays, they crank it up a notch by offering oysters, baby lobsters, crepes and unlimited Ruffino prosecco.Price: Lunch: Mon-Sat $44.46, Sun $79.50, $102.96 with unlimited prosecco ; Dinner: Sun-Thu $56.16, Fri-Sat $67.86\xa0Udders\nUdderly cool ice-cream buffet\nEat, make and learn all at the same time at Udders Ice Cream’s (Buffet hours: Next available on 20th April, 11am-1pm) monthly ice cream workshop-plus-buffet. The popular two-hour session comprises theory, hands-on ice cream making – using tools you have at home – and culminates in a 50-minute all-you-can-eat ice cream buffet at their Novena outlet. Tuck into ice cream, waffles and cold drinks – die-hard fans usually head straight for the premium Mao Shang Wang durian ice cream, considered the best in Singapore. Not for little ones, this ice-cream orgy is only for 9-year-olds and above – smart move.Price: $40 per personAuthor© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/jalan-besar/:['You have to be a hardcore foodie to eat in Jalan Besar.Not only is there no MRT station close enough for it to claim, it takes a good ten minutes from the station to the main jalan (Malay for “road”) besar (“big”). Drivers are made to go in loops on one-way streets and parking is horrendous to secure. Your best bet would be to hop on an Eastside bus.An official conservation area – with some 540 preserved buildings – Jalan Besar’s protected status has resulted in hawkers and restaurateurs being allowed to develop and hone their craft without disruption for many decades. Now boutique shops have started to spring in the nearby Little India area; coffee joint Chye Seng Huat Hardware set up shop along Tyrwhitt Road and modern diner Suprette in boutique hotel Kam Leng Hotel across the road to name a few.Before the Downtown Line’s Jalan Besar MRT station’s launch in 2017 – a move that will likely open the neighbourhood up to higher rental prices and more boutique and brand names in spanking new shopping malls – pull into Jalan Besar’s culinary gems. As it stands, there is such tremendous diversity of good food concentrated in such a small area that our top picks for the area cannot do the area justice. We’d be losers for not trying though.\xa0The Beef House\nFor Hakka delicacies\nHakka delicacies like beef ball bee hoon, yong tau foo, soon kueh (a big steamed dumpling typically filled with chopped turnips, carrots and black fungus) and suan pan zi (Hakka “abacus” seeds) can be found here, though the palm-sized soon kueh ($1 each) and abacus seeds ($2 a plate) regularly sell out by lunchtime.\xa0It is clear why when you manage to get orders: instead of a dominance of bang kuang (turnip), more expensive ingredients like bean curd, dried prawns, minced meat, mushrooms, black fungus and onions can be found in the soon kueh that has complex flavour and texture. The soon kueh’s semi-translucent skin, made with tapioca flour and yam, has perhaps gotten thicker over the years but the springy chewy texture still makes for addictive eating. The soft-textured abacus seeds ($2 a plate) meanwhile, are made with a little more yam but still has a springy feel and comes with a generous serving of bean curd, mushrooms and dried prawns.\nThe Beef House | Address: Gar Lok Eating House, 217 Syed Alwi Road | Opening hours: Mon-Thu, Sat & Sun 8am-5.30pm or until sold out\xa0Cambridge Deli\nFor classic Nyonya kuehs\nHere lies some of the best classic Nyonya kuehs in this part of town. Their ondeh-ondeh (gula Melaka-filled glutinous rice balls rolled in shredded coconut, five for $2) is our pick; though not perfectly shaped, the slightly firm texture of the glutinous rice dough is soft to the bite, the coconut is freshly grated and unseasoned, and a generous amount of gula Melaka liquid comes flowing out when bitten into. Tip: arrive early as not many are available for sale – a majority of Cambridge Deli’s kuehs are reserved for pre-orders.\nCambridge Deli | Address: Blk 216G, Syed Alwi Road #01-06 | Opening hours: Daily 7am to 5pm\xa0Coffee Hut\nFor kopi-o kosong\nIt is only when you drink Coffee Hut’s kopi o kosong (Malay for “coffee with no milk or sugar”) and compare it with other kaya toast and coffee sellers’ that you get why this stall is held in high regard: there is less of the bitter and sour overtones that is common in local coffee because Coffee Hut uses a higher grade of coffee. Where kopitiam coffees rank, this version can be a bit on the light side, so order the coffee “kao” (strong) for more of that coffee oomph. Also try their kaya baguette which comes light, fluffy and crisp.\nCoffee Hut | Address: 166 Jalan Besar #02-43, Berseh Food Centre | Opening hours: Mon-Fri 7am-3pm; Sat & Sun 7am-1pm; Public holidays closed\xa0Ye Zhi Mei Handmade Dim Sum\nFor Malaysia-style big buns\xa0\nThe “Amy Yip Pau” ($3) has been around for more than two decades and can be had at this corner coffeeshop off the main Jalan Besar. Named after the popular Hong Kong Category Three actress Amy Yip (Ye Zhi Mei) – popular in the 1990s and was known for her slim figure and large breasts – the 500g Malaysia-style is a complete meal in itself: it is filled with an assortment of ingredients like turnip, mushrooms, chicken, pork and a whole egg. Johor also adds Chinese sausage, which is unusual for big pau in Singapore. The slightly sweet marination is rich and dark and is not too oily, not when compared to the buns of other pau stalls.\nYe Zhi Mei Handmade Dim Sum | Address: 208 Jalan Besar (at the corner of Maude Road) | Tel: 62942210 | Opening hours: Tue-Sun 24 hours\xa0Lao Liang Cold Trotters & Shark’s Meat\nFor the whole shark, and other cold Teochew dishes\nWe’re not talking about the fin (that’s not the kind of boat we float on) – we prefer the whole shark, and we prefer them cold. Lao Liang Cold Trotters & Shark’s Meat is possibly the only stall left in Singapore selling boiled shark parts. For starters, $5 gets you a basic plate of boiled shark parts; ask also for the shark cartilage, skin and insides and the price bumps up to a whopping $20, but this plate is more impressive: fresh, lovely gelatinous bits and complex mix of textures, is served with homemade plum, chilli and peanut sauce. The plum sauce is made with preserved plums which take up to three years to make. Tip for the adventurous: if they have shark liver and shark head for sale, order them – these parts are available once in a very rare blue moon. And those, we know, are rare enough.\nLao Liang Cold Trotters & Shark’s Meat | Address: 166 Jln Besar #02-37 Berseh Food Centre | Opening hours: Tue-Sun 11am-3pm\xa0Mei Xiang Black & White Fish Soup\nFor robust, cloudy fish soup\nIf you like your fish soup clear and unadulterated, skip this place. This stall makes a gutsy stock ($5), with added fried shallots and pickled vegetables. The soup comes with thick slices of fried or boiled fresh Spanish mackerel (or a mixture of both) whose taste only comes through when you eat the fish without the soup. Take note however, this stall draws a long queue during lunchtimes, usually selling out shortly after 1pm; takeaway is not allowed; and extra servings of their spicy chilli will cost you extra.\nMei Xiang Black & White Fish Soup | Address: 166 Jalan Besar, #02-44, Berseh Food Centre | Opening hours: Mon-Fri, except public holidays 11am-2pm\xa0Sungei Road Laksa\nFor laksa with a lot of “hum”\nThis stall’s headlining dish is one of the last few – if not the only – places in Singapore that still keeps their laksa gravy gently heated in an aluminum pot over charcoal fire. Some say this results in a smokier aroma; we reckon that the spread of charcoal results in more even heat. The laksa isn’t visually impressive – it comes in a small bowl, with merely a few slices of fishcake, and isn’t rich and creamy as there isn’t much coconut milk. What it does have is a lovely fragrance and a generous amount of fresh hum (Chinese dialect for “blood cockles”). All of these for $2.\nSungei Road Laksa | Address: Blk 27 Jln Berseh #01-100 Jin Shui Kopitiam | Opening hours: Daily 9am-6pm, except first & third Wednesdays of the month\xa0Very Lucky Turtle Soup\nFor ginger turtle soup\nYes, we know the ethics on turtle rearing for soup is fuzzy in Singapore, but that does not alter the fact that Berseh Food Centre has three turtle soup stalls and is known as the “turtle soup” hawker centre. Of the three, the portions at Very Lucky Turtle Soup are the smallest, but it stands out because it offers a version which is not the usual tonic-like soup: instead of packing it with herbs and brandy, this business of over 50 years do a Teochew version which is simply stock flavoured with ginger. The meat is soft and comes with the usual gelatinous insides and soft shell at $10-12 a bowl.\xa0\nVery Lucky Turtle Soup | Address: 166 Jalan Besar, #02-38/49 Berseh Food Centre | Opening hours: Thu-Tue 11am-8.30pmAuthor© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/customisable-cake/:['When celebrating a birthday or any occasion really, one of our must-haves has always been cakes.Gone are the days where we chose store-bought vanilla cakes, though still equally tasty, over customised ones.Customising cakes have become the new norm.Why? Simply because having a personalised cake screams how unique the celebration is to the people involved and makes the occasion more memorable.In Singapore, bakers have taken their craft up a notch with interesting twists such as creating a cake where money could be pulled out of, making a cake out of jelly, baking a cake that looks like your favourite football club and much more.\xa0Though receiving a cake is always a joy, many seasoned and new bakers continue to find joy in this cake baking industry due to the creativity it enables.It is not just about baking anymore, but there is drawing out designs, researching on locations to get specific ingredients, experimenting with different sizes to make everything fit on the cake, sculpting whatever the customer requests and much more.With all this in mind, the head baker at Giebakes, who has been in the scene for just about three years, says that she still gets thrilled no matter what the order is.“Any cake orders means new challenges for us. One of our crowd favourites is the money-pulling cake. When we get the chance to see the recipient’s reactions, we are always happy as their reactions are always priceless,” she said.This Money Pulling cake is not just a favourite at Giebakes but also at other local cake stops such as Wonders Bakery.This halal bakery said that with the Money Pulling cake being in trend now, they have also hopped on the bandwagon to make it slightly more interesting.They have incorporated it into child-friendly designs like a Thomas the Train cake for a birthday party.As far as experimenting goes, these bakers usually take their orders 2 weeks in advance as they hold discussions with their clients on how the cake is going to be done and what to expect.Some of their cakes include intricate detailing such as painting a chocolate sail with edible gold. In other instances, they have to think of ways to make the cake feasible without the usual rounded base.For example, when Bake36, the Serangoon based Bakery received a request to make a cake to replicate Lion Dancing.“This was especially tough as we use cream cheese frosting for all our cakes, so there are certain limitations to what we can do (because they are softer and lose definition usually). But, we explained these details to the customer so that they understand that we won’t be doing a huge figurine or anything along those lines.”Similar to a few other bakeries, Bake 36 provides options for customers to go for a cream cheese frosting instead if they would like a healthier choice.\xa0Across all these special designs, one thing remains the same – paying attention to detail.This makes the cakes pricier than the usual store-bought ones as well.Many of these customisable bakes fall in the price range of $80 to $200.But is it worth the price?As far as the baking process goes, as we described above, we would have to say that it is value for money.Though the design is a crucial aspect as these bakeries have shown, they have also said that the taste can’t be neglected.While Giebakes makes only Buttercream cakes due to its popularity among the locals, Wonders Bakery has also said that Buttercream is their speciality.Wonders Bakery makes its cakes with Swiss Meringue Buttercream and does fondant decorations, figurines and characters that they utilise while designing their cakes.Wonders Bakery’s baker added, “We feel energised to do better when clients give their feedback to us after their parties and mention how beautiful the cakes look. They will tell us that their guests thought the cake looked great too. But, what we love most is when they compliment the taste of our cakes and how some of their family and friends who don’t usually eat cakes, really enjoyed ours.”As the taste is crucial, some decide to go for something more familiar yet unexpected, like Jelly Cakes.While the texture of these cakes are consistent with the usual jelly pieces you may have enjoyed as a child, the designs are surely different.What makes it a good selection, would be the fact that unlike the usual spongy centrepiece, you have this Jelly Cake that feels lighter on your palette.While creating Jelly Cakes is a niche business, many prefer them due to dietary concerns too.Nadiah, the artist behind Jelly Fleur (a local jelly cake business) explained that her jelly cakes are vegetarian and Halal-friendly, making it a choice for many.She uses various brands of jelly powder for her base to create flavouring. She then uses coconut milk with jelly powder to craft the flowers which add the X factor to her cakes.Nadiah then explained the process behind making her jelly cake pieces.“Making a Jelly Cake takes up to 3 hours. I will first create a clear jelly canvas which takes up to 2 hours because of the setting. I will then inject the flowers in. Injecting the flowers will take about 1 to 3 hours depending on the size of the jelly.”The longest Nadiah has taken to create a cake was 2 and a half hours for a 12” jelly cake which features a dancing couple.“I had to carve the dancing figure of the couple before injecting the flowers, making it more complicated than usual,” she said.Be it Jelly cakes or the well-loved buttercream cakes, the efforts behind the cakes remain unmeasurable.So, the next time you order a customised cake, do keep in mind that there is a whole process behind it that you are paying for and that it is worth appreciating.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/michel-lu/:['A well-known personality in the F&B and nightlife circles, Michel Lu, 38, was the former regional director of Elite Model Management and founder of PR and events management company Lumina Communications. He has also been prolific in conceptualising, setting up and operating F&B and lifestyle concepts in various parts of Asia since 1999. Among his many successful and award-winning outlets are Centro, Embargo, Centro Jakarta, La Dolce Vita\xa0Jakarta, The Hacienda, Privé and many more. His achievements landed him a spot in The Straits Times’ Power List of\xa0the Top 10 Food & Beverage Personalities in Singapore in December 2007.In 2009, Michel opened Café Hacienda in July and subsequently Stereolab and Stereolounge in August. \xa0Stereolab was chosen to be the first Official Formula 1 Lounge in the world and saw the attendance of luminaries such as Bernie Ecclestone, Tamara Ecclestone, Richard Branson as well as many other drivers and international celebrities.\xa0Which dishes\xa0and drinks\xa0on your various menus do you think deserve special mention? Why? \nOver the years, we have built up a reputation for serving great burgers and I highly recommend our burgers, be it the mini wagyu burgers at Stereolab or the Mexican burger at Cafe Hacienda or the New York burger at Privé’s Bakery Cafe. As for drinks, you should definitely check out ‘the habibi’ (the beloved), a vodka-based martini with apple and rose flavours topped off with a few strands of saffron threads.\xa0What would you say is the unique experience customers get from a night out in a Michel Lu establishment?\nOur venues range widely so this is certainly a difficult question to answer, as every one of our establishment has its own character and personality. We have casual intimate cafes like the Bakery Cafe at Privé and Cafe Hacienda, stylish restaurants like Privé and al fresco garden bars like Hacienda. So there’s a wide range of options to choose from depending on the occasion.\xa0How do you think the nightlife and F&B scene in Singapore has evolved over the years?\nIt has improved by leaps and bounds over the years. The arrival of cool and independent new venues like Butter Factory has given the nightlife scene new sophistication and options to jaded clubbers and party goers. New restaurants like Fifty Three, Oso, Absinthe etc. as well as casual eateries like Hatched and Burger Shack have also added new dimensions to the dining options we have. \xa0Besides, new dining areas like the Japanese enclave at Orchard Plaza or Cuppage Plaza as well as the cafes at Arab Street are also adding new textures and depth to the F&B scene.\xa0You\xa0have been in the\xa0F&B\xa0business\xa0since 1999. Which establishment is your proudest work thus far?\xa0 \nIt may seem cliché but answering this is like asking a parent which child is his or her favourite. They are really all different and I attach different sentimental values to each of them. \xa0I am proud of each one in its own way.\xa0Please also share\xa0some\xa0experiences of\xa0less successful ventures and what you learnt from them. \nI am glad to say that I have been very fortunate with my ventures so far. \xa0However, the biggest lesson learnt over the years is not to be caught up in the nitty-gritty of things and to just concentrate on the big picture.\xa0Are you a party animal or are you someone who prefers to curl up on a sofa at home with a good book?\nI have to say that I am a bit of both as it really depends on my mood. Thus, you might find me spending a casual night with friends, reading or playing cards at home or enjoying myself at Stereolab when a great DJ is playing there.\xa0What challenges did you face in keeping your\xa0current establishments profitable during the recession?\nBusiness has been very consistent throughout this past year and in fact, we are expanding as profitability has not been affected at all. Perhaps it is due to the good locations of our establishments, or the fact that we have kept our focus on quality while others have faltered, but things have been good and it has certainly been a very kind year for us.\xa0F&B and nightlife establishments come and go quickly in Singapore. What do you think it takes to be a successful nightlife and F&B entrepreneur?\nAs with any business, the ability to stay true to a concept and the perseverance to keep going when one meets with obstacles are the main paths to success.

Plant milk alternatives are also available for an additional ฿20.If you’re headed there for a lunch, try its garlic fried rice with grilled beef, marinate egg yolk and dipping sauce (฿180) lunch box.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/anjappar/:['Indian food is everywhere in Singapore but Indian food that’s authentic? Not so easy to find.The chances get higher when you dine in Little India, but really it depends on which restaurant where you go to.If you’re along Race Course Road, some of the Indian restaurants have the tendency to tone down their spices and flavours to appeal to the tourist dollar.So if you’re looking for that authentic Indian dining experience, the task of choosing the right Indian restaurant can be more than a little daunting.Which is why when Anjappar opened along Race Course Road back in 2005, they caused quite the stir as they were specialising in authentic Chettinad cuisine that was cooked as close as possible to what you got if you ate in Chennai.Established in Chennai in 1964, the restaurant now has 74 outlets around the world.In Singapore alone, Anjappar has expanded to three more outlets in 10 years and gained many loyal customers who have made it their go-to place for an Indian food fix.Thanks to an in-house spice grinder which freshly grinds spices everyday, the taste of the spices in every dish are wonderfully articulate and ever-present.The difference is immediately apparent with starters like the Chettinad Mutton Bone Soup ($5.50). The consistency of the soup is thin but don’t let that deceive you as the mild mutton stock flavour comes power packed with all sorts of spices.\xa0The bold spice levels are also apparent in their range of curries, the highlight being the Mutton Sukka Varuval ($13). Tender cuts of lamb are marinated with crushed peppercorns and fried with chopped onions and curry leaves.Similar to another dry-fried dish of mutton mysore but with moist tender meat. An addictive dish.The bold spice levels are also apparent in their range of curries, the highlight being the Mutton Sukka Varuval ($13). Tender cuts of lamb are marinated with crushed peppercorns and fried with chopped onions and curry leaves.Similar to another dry-fried dish of mutton mysore but with moist tender meat. An addictive dish.\xa0Their Golden Fried Prawns ($18) are also worth ordering. Prawns are coated with hand-pounded masala, fried to a golden yellow colour and has a wonderfully sticky chewy, crunchy texture. The warm slightly tangy, garlicky chilli sauce on the side is also not to be missed.\xa0Tandoori dishes come perfectly executed with moist meats and a slight charred exterior as are their biryanis with soft lamb meat and unbelievably rich and flavourful rice.\xa0Dishes like the classic Butter Chicken Masala ($15) comes wonderfully well-balanced with just the right amount of sweet, sour and rich creamy flavours.Lastly, it’s not common to go to an Indian restaurant to have pratas (or parottas as they call it) but do make an exception in this case. While the egg and plain parottas are similar to our local versions, their Ceylon Chicken and Mutton Parottas ($9-10) resembling our local murtabak, are not to be missed.\xa0The dough is wonderfully springy and crisp in the right parts, but the pure joy is in the filling as it is filled with highly flavoursome meat scraps, chopped onions that are meltingly soft and with chopped green peppers and egg.Of course, there’s nothing more impressive than a giant dosa that is all the rage these days. Great for sharing with families and groups of friends, the Anjappar Family Dosa ($11) takes a normal dosa and super-sizes it.Even though it’s longer than your arm, the taste is not compromised in any way. It comes with that appropriate melting crispness and the side dips — coconut, mint and tomato/chilli chutneys and sabar — come wonderfully robust and uncompromisingly full-flavoured.\xa0And if you’re one of those who has to have a fish head curry (after all, you are in Race Course Road, Singapore!), Anjappar has it covered. It serves a medium ang go li (sea bream) whole head drenched in a flavourful curry that has just a tinge of sourness in the taste.You’re pretty much guaranteed a great meal at Anjappar but ironically, you don’t have to go down all the way to Race Course Road to have it.They have outlets in the West (Jurong East) and in the East (Changi Business Park).Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/st-john-hotel/:['News that a Singaporean hotelier has taken over popular London chef Fergus Henderson’s latest venture, the St. John Hotel, has become the talk of the town in the British food world.The 15-room hotel is now under the ownership of Singaporean hotelier Loh Lik Peng. Loh is the owner of New Majestic Hotel (where Majestic Restaurant resides) and Wanderlust.While the restaurant’s head chef Tom Harris will remain at the helm, Caterer and Hotelkeeper report that Henderson will no longer be involved in the hotel he founded, stripping the establishment of much of its starpower and spurring at least one Twitterer to tweet, “Travesty.”Known as the ‘king of offal’ for pioneering the nose-to-tail concept of dining in London, Henderson opened the St. John Hotel in Leicester Square in April 2011 after the project suffered a series of setbacks that put the hotel in the red by millions of pounds, reports The London Evening Standard.\xa0Henderson’s St John Hotel restaurant earned its first Michelin star a year after opening and offers whole, roasted suckling pig and roast chickens dinners.Meanwhile, the change at the helm is getting added attention with word that a roster of celebrity investors such as visual artists Tracey Emin, Sarah Lucas, Peter Doig, gallery owner Sadie Coles, American painter Elizabeth Peyton and writer Guy Kennaway may be set to lose their investments.Other St. John outposts include locations near Smithfield Market, Spitalfields Market and a standalone bakery on Druid Street.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/hormone-free-chickens/:['Did I really want to find out where and how Bincho at Hua Bee’s tender, flavourful chickens were farmed? I did, though I wasn’t sure if a trip to its premises in Johor Bahru, Malaysia, would make me feel guilty about eating the yakitori-ya‘s (a small Japanese-style grilled chicken restaurant) headlining meat.\xa0What I discovered definitely made the trip worthwhile, and affected my perspective on chicken being the “dirtiest meat” on the market.\xa0It took Bincho of Hua Bee’s chef Asai Masashi three hours to\xa0interrogate the chicken farm about their practices, and I was just getting started.\xa0\xa0\xa0The journey to the farm in Simpang Renggam, Johor, took us an hour from the Causeway by car. It’s a fairly smooth journey, especially if taken, as we did, on a Monday morning, in between rush hour traffic.\xa0We took the highways, and switched vehicles later, to hardier, four-wheel drives to be able to maneuvre the uneven stone-littered paths that lead into the farm.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0The older the chicken, the more intense the flavour of the meat.\xa0However, it costs more to rear older chickens, which is why many farms stick to rearing fast-growing broilers. The cost of the feed and the use of space make it less feasible to rear the chickens for more days. If the turnaround is short, a farm can rear more chickens, hence making more profit.\xa0In between cycles, the pens also need a three week period before it is used for rearing again.\xa0At present, Toh Thye San is trying to rear 140-day-old chickens, half of a chicken’s general lifespan.\xa0Toh Thye San’s main aim is to replicate the chicken meat from at least 20 years ago, with as little antibiotics as possible. “We only feed the chickens antibiotics if they fall sick, which is not often,” reveals Toh. “When one does fall sick, however, the disease spreads quickly, and the entire pen might be affected, which is why we have to act fast.”\xa0\xa0Toh Thye San (Gesing) is merely two of over 130 chicken farms in West Malaysia exporting live chickens to Singapore, but once cooked, the hormone-free chickens clearly taste different from the general stock.\xa0According to Toh, the chickens differ because of the age they grow to, the peaceful and cageless environment they grow up in, and their food, 100 per cent natural feed and the lack of antibiotics.\xa0Even at 8,000 chickens per pen, the pens have have the flocking density of a commercial Broiler pen. The chickens are left to mature in one pen for their entire lives, as moving them around will stress them out.\xa0The feed (that is mixed by the farm in a different facility) is made up of corn, wheat, organic selenium, vitamins, orgacids, probiotics and some five spice flavouring known as ‘Indian herbs’. Two kilograms of corn makes 1kg of chicken meat. “Chickens are like humans when it comes to their diet,” Toh said lovingly. “They need a balance of nutrients, as well as flavour. We add five spice powder to their feed, and they are happier eating it.”\xa0In addition, the chickens are fed with distilled tap water. There is a distilling facility in each farm.\xa0The adage “you are what you eat” fits in perfectly here: Toh once experimented with garlic powder in the chickens’ feed. The result was garlic-flavoured chicken meat. “It was fun, but who would buy it?” he chuckled.\xa0Though the chickens were kept in pens, I saw no cages, and the chickens had space to fully stretch their wings. Some even flew in the pens.\xa0The beaks of the day-old Naked Necks were trimmed, but Toh claims that is general practice in the industry for aggressive chickens. “The white broiler chickens do not need de-beaking because they are not as aggressive as the red chickens. The white broilers are slaughtered at a much younger age of 25 to 33 days. In that period, the natural aggression of the chickens do not show.”\xa0Toh adds, “We treat the chickens with respect and care. We don’t throw them around, and every morning a herder will go in to herd them. The herder is the same person for their entire lifespan.”\xa0In addition, the chickens are given things to peck on, and there is plenty of natural light and breeze in the pens.\xa0It took Bincho of Hua Bee’s chef Asai Masashi three hours to\xa0interrogate the chicken farm about their practices.\xa0Toh has dreams of letting the chickens roam free on land in the future.\xa0I do too.\xa0Here’s a video of what we ate at Bincho @ Hua Bee.\xa0\xa0Toh Thye San Farm currently supplies chicken to restaurants, and to consumers via a few websites only. The websites are: The Barbie Girls,\xa0The Fish Wives\xa0and\xa0The Organic Grocer.\xa0Toh Thye San Farm | Office address: 684 Hougang Avenue 8 | Tel: 63869300Celine Asril is guilty of taking pictures of cute animals, and of all her meals.

But just five years into the business, Astons transformed into a restaurant business and \xa0expanded into a chain of 18 outlets, attracting long queues at most of its branches. We speak to owner Aston Soon, whose food chain is famous for offering quality Western food at affordable prices, to find out how he keeps costs down.\xa0When you first started out as a hawker, did you imagine that you would be so successful?\nIt has never crossed my mind. My main aim then was just to earn a stable income, support my family and for customers to enjoy the steaks I prepare. It was that simple.\xa0What do you think is the secret to your success?\nI have no secrets. And I do not believe in keeping trade secrets from my loyal staff. I teach all I know about cooking to my kitchen heads so they can keep up with the same consistent standard.\xa0Speaking about your steaks, they are very popular among your customers. Where did you learn your craft?\nI was a manager with Ponderosa, which used to be famous for its super salad bar. It gave me the opportunity to learn everything from scratch and to experiment with various western cuisines including steak of course.\xa0I just had the chicken chop at $6.90 nett, which included two side dishes. The prices of your meals are affordable, and you do not even include a service charge. How do you keep your prices low?\nOur business model works when there is a large customer volume. We are able to keep prices low because we order food in bulk and enjoy economies of scale. Also, our profit margin is not very high.\xa0One of your signature dishes is the ieat Super Burger. How did you come up with this interesting name?\nThis was a very challenging creation which has came a long way. We had a customer who was extremely critical of our Beefy Jack Burger. He gave lots of feedback on how the burger can be improved. We incorporated some of his ideas into the burger recipe, which today became known as the ‘ieat Super Burger’.\n\nLooks like you really valued this customer’s feedback?\nI could see the sincerity in the customer and I feel some kind of affinity towards him. It took us a long time for the burger to get to where it is today, especially the burger patty; We had to chop up the sirloin steak to get the texture we wanted.\xa0 Initially, I had no idea who that customer was. It was only after one or two months later when I realised he was the famous food blogger Dr Leslie Tay. He meant business, and even created a poster for this burger!\xa0Although you are a restaurant owner of a Western food chain, I know you are very much a hawker at heart and who loves Asian food. Share with us your favourite hawker food. \nIt has to be the Ang Moh Wanton Mee at Tembeling Road. The wantons are fresh, large and tasty, and the noodles do not have a ‘ghee’ (alkaline) taste. I can be very dedicated when I find a favourite food haunt and will not get bored with it easily. \xa0On average, I dine at this stall about 10 to 20 times a month.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/da-shi-jia-big-prawn-noodles/:['Here’s the truth when you’re talking about good food along Orchard Road. One, it exists but you’re going to have to pay an arm and a leg for it.Luckily, there are a few gems along Orchard Road which are relatively inexpensive and one of them is located along Killiney Road.Opened in early 2018, Da Shi Jia has been attracting big lunchtime crowds for their robust and flavourful prawn noodle dishes, which start at only $5.80.The price isn’t too bad considering its near Orchard Road. What will ease the wallet even more is that all prices are final as you don’t pay additional service charge or gst.\xa0Run by a young couple — Seth Sim and his wife, Yvonne — Seth learnt the art of cooking prawn noodles from a hawker in Boon Lay before deciding to set up Da Shi Jia.Seth’s father owns the Big Eater Restaurant\xa0 tze char chain which has many outlets across Singapore, so cooking and running a food business is in Seth’s blood.\xa0That being said, Da Shi Jia still had its niggles when it opened, as the quality of the food was inconsistent — the prawn stock didn’t always hit the spot and the dry prawn noodles needed working on.But a year later, all that has changed with the food improving by leaps and bounds.In the basic $5.80 bowl, you get a sizeable portion. It’d be a large portion at the hawker centre. Inside there are three small to medium half prawns, fairly thick fishcakes and tender sliced pork and kang kong, bean sprouts and your choice of noodles.\xa0You won’t be disappointed if you get the soup version, as the prawn stock is very good, so robust that it lingers in the mouth. The dry version has soup on the side and has a generous amount of lovely soft fried onions.The dry version, while not a winner in the past, is now much improved.\xa0Comprising of dried prawn savouriness, spicy chilli, dark soy and lots and lots of pork lard, the taste has a lovely complex savouriness and the noodles never get dry as there is lots of sauce to go round. Add a little prawn stock into the noodles for an even fuller experience.While the prawn noodles are at the heart of Da Shi Jia’s menu, there is also a lot of customisable options like bigger prawns at higher prices. More fishcakes, sliced pork or pork ribs are also available as add-ons\xa0 as well ($1-3 each).\xa0The other highlight is their very much talked about Da Shi Jia Wok-Fried Big Prawn White Bee Hoon ($16.80/$19.80). A variation of the classic seafood white beehoon, prawn stock is used instead of the more traditional seafood stock.Bee hoon is fried with prawn stock over high heat — coriander, garlic, onions, kang kong, pork slices and lard, is thrown in.\xa0Then the stock is allowed to reduce to a thick sauce, then the dish is topped off with wok-seared prawns, fried onions and crunchy lard.The result is an umami bomb, comprising of soft but resilient beehoon, full of prawns robust stock, rich lard, sweet onion flavour and smokiness. The wok hei is so strong in this dish that you can see the burnt effect on the onions and in some strands of beehoon.\xa0There are two sizes, the only difference being the size of the prawns, but they are nicely seasoned and very juicy.The chilli on the side is also interesting. Instead of straight ahead sliced red chillies dipped in soy sauce, they mix soy sauce with pickled green chilli for an interesting savoury, sour, spicy and slightly sweet taste.If there is one criticism, it is that the prawn stock flavour — whether on its own or fried with beehoon — can be a little on the salty side on occasion, but that doesn’t seem to deter the huge crowds at weekday lunchtimes.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/bbq-stingray/:['Barbequed seafood is one of Singapore’s favourite pig-outs. And one dish that nearly always gets ordered is stingray (skate).What makes stingray so popular? Mostly, its appeal lies in its unique texture. Stingray doesn’t have fine bones, which makes eating it a breeze. Also, its silky smooth and tender flesh seems to go especially well with a robust sambal belachan spread, loved by so many of us..Here are five highly popular BBQ seafood hawker stalls that are famed for their BBQ sambal stingray. How do they measure up against one another?B.B.Q. Seafood EDITOR’S PICK!Yung Sheng Road, #03-178 Taman Jurong Market & Food CentreOpening hours: 4pm-10pm, closed alternate ThursdaysPrice: from $8.00Rating: 4.5/5BBQ Seafood’s sambal stingray sizzles in every sense of the word! Presented on a hotplate, the fish is served sizzling hot and retains its heat throughout the meal. The exterior is beautifully browned, while the flesh remains gorgeously tender and succulent.Although the fish could do with a more distinct charred flavor, the intense sambal more than makes up for any blandness. The chilli is so spicy it’ll make you sniff! Our tastebuds were left tingly numb at the end of the meal. In addition to belachan, the sambal has a bold scent of fresh herbs.Thankfully, the topping of sliced fresh shallots helps to provide some relief. And the side dip of tangy pickled shallot and fresh lime provides another piquant zest that lifts the taste to a heavenly level. In short, B.B.Q. Seafood’s sambal stingray is simply shiok!\xa0Rong Guang B.B.Q. SeafoodBlk 127 Bukit Merah Lane 1, #01-230 KPT CoffeeshopOpening hours: Wed-Mon: 4pm-10.30pm, closed on TuesPrice: from $10.00Rating: 4/5For chilli wimps, Rong Guang’s BBQ stingray is your answer. For those who like it hot, the sambal here might be a tad too gentle, but it’s nothing that some sliced chilli can’t fix.Though it’s mild on heat, Rong Guang’s dried shrimp-spiked sambal is strong on flavor. While on the sweet side, the chilli boasts complex flavors and the aroma of fresh herbs. In fact it is very much like a ‘chilli jam’ that can be enjoyed by the spoonful. Each piece of moist and soft stingray is liberally slathered with this sweetish, creamy-textured sambal.Besides the sambal, the grilled fish is also well-executed. The edges are lightly singed, and the flesh remains superbly soft and juicy. Easy on the palate, Rong Guang’s sambal stingray is definitely worth a visit!\xa0Tokyo Blk 503 West Coast Drive, #01-07 Ayer Rajah Food CentreOpening hours: Daily: 5.30pm-12amPrice: from $8.00Rating: 4/5Even days after eating our plate of BBQ stingray at Tokyo, its intoxicating scent continued to haunt us. Expertly seared to a crisp, the charred skin infused the fish with a wonderfully smoky aroma.Amazingly, the flesh beneath remained silky smooth and moist. There was little doubt that the stingray was supremely fresh.While the grilling was impeccable, we wished the chilli had more complexity. It’s sufficiently spicy, and mildly scented with curry leaf and lemongrass. But it would be perfect if the chilli had more sweet and savoury flavors for balance.\xa0Banana Leaf BBQ SeafoodBlk 450 Clementi Ave 3, #01-271Opening hours: 11am-12amPrice: from $8.00Rating: 3/5Portions here are generous. Our slab of stingray was respectably thick and very juicy. But we wished it had been seared by stronger flames. The fish tasted more like it’d been steamed rather than grilled. As such, it lacked a sufficiently smoky fragrance.Veering towards the savoury side, the sambal has well-rounded flavors. Its mildness will suit those with sensitive palates, but those who like it hot will find that it lacks oomph.Also, it lacks the fragrance of fresh herbs. Thankfully, the accompanying pickled shallot and cincalok help to lift the sensation.\xa0Boon Tat Street BBQ Seafood8 Raffles Ave, #01-15J Makansutra Gluttons Bay, Esplanade MallOpening hours: Mon-Thu: 5pm-2am, Fri-Sat: 5pm-3am, Sun: 4pm-1amPrice: from $10.00Rating: 2.5/5The fall in standards here was most disappointing. Looking like it had been pre-cooked, our stingray was barely warm when served. The flesh was dry, stringy, and had a slight fishy smell.Their famous sambal still showed signs of greatness. Bold with herbs and spices, it was spicy and aromatic enough without being overwhelming. But, like the fish, the sambal was also too dry.We certainly hope this was a one-off incident. Given that this particular stall is located in a popular tourist destination, the same dish we had would be an embarrassing misrepresentation to our overseas guests.\xa0inSing.com visited these stalls anonymously and paid for its own meals.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

At Legendary, they are opting to keep the operations small and family-run with a strong focus on the quality. Only Sarawak peppercorns and fresh (not frozen) Indonesian pork is used for their combo ($9.50). You can tell when you bite into the prime rib: the texture has a soft and bouncy texture. The soup robust with a distinct peppery character.In addition to the usual sides like pork liver ($8), braised tau pok ($5/8/10) and kiam chye ($5/8/10), their signature braised pig’s trotter ($10/16/20) and ngoh hiang ($10/15) are must-tries.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/ah-sam-cold-drink-stall/:['With the plethora of bars in Singapore garnering widespread media buzz, and barkeepers threading the centre of its spotlight, an integral part of their popularity remains completely hidden in the shadows – the patrons.Entering\xa0Ah Sam Cold Drink Stall, award-winning music producer and photographer Andrew Lum decides to call out to owner and head bartender Sam Wong for his regular tipple.Wong acknowledges and greets Lum in the manner of an old friend: with a warm welcome and below-the-belt mockery for being at the bar for the third day in a row.With a hearty laugh, Lum takes his place at the bar. Lum’s starter cocktail wasn’t always a Negroni, he shares, because it tasted like cough syrup.It is now his favourite, as is Ah Sam Cold Drink Stall. He tells us why:\xa0\n“I knew Sam Wong even before he opened this bar. He and Anthony Zhong were the stars of Jigger & Pony where I used to visit. They really built that bar and opened my eyes to the world of classic cocktails. When Sam left, we kept in touch and here I am.What do I do? I have been a music producer for over two decades now and founded New Asia records. Back in the ’90s, I worked on a slew of Mandopop records and these days, my focus is mostly on Asian fusion music, incorporating traditional eastern instruments with western influences. I also picked up photography as a hobby and now turned it into a professional gig. Nothing beats working on something you love.\xa0All this talk is making me thirsty. You know, I wasn’t big on cocktails in the beginning. Don’t get me wrong, I first ventured into cocktails five years ago, but I wasn’t into the classics.At that time I was amazed with the likes of (the now defunct) Klee at Portsdown Road and Bar Stories for their fancy and creative cocktails.It’s funny how I used to think a classic like Negroni and found it tasted like cough syrup. It is now the first drink on the bar top every time I come back to Ah Sam.See, I like my drink to have good body, strength, complexity and long finishes. Yes, it takes a willingness to explore and an open mind to get into cocktails. But I think it has a lot to do with the person who makes them. The most important thing is a good bartender introducing and guiding you through it.Sam is that bartender. Not only is he a genuine guy, his attitude, passion and generosity truly represents bartending in every sense of the word.These are the few things that make me come back to a bar; the things that make me feel at home.There is, of course, a market for fashionable bars, but I prefer mine to be non-commercial and unpretentious. I visit Ah Sam once to three times a week depending on how busy I am. I always start with a Negroni, stay for new experiences and, on some days, make new friends.You know, I thought this interview was scheduled for three days ago. I came by and Sam told me that it’s today. I dropped by yesterday for a drink, too.I don’t need an excuse to come here, but I’ll take one if it presents itself.”Ah Sam Cold Drink Stall | Address: 60A Boat Quay | Tel: 65350838 | Opening hours: Mon-Thu 6pm-midnight, Fri-Sat 6pm-3amAuthor© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/xin-mei-xiang-zheng-zong-lor-mee/:['In existence for 46 years and counting, the constant long queues for the lor mee here never abates from when they open early in the morning until they close in the early afternoons.The stall is now run by a second-generation husband and wife team and because of the husband’s health problems, their daughters are helping to run the stall as well.The reasons why this lor mee stall gets the longest queue out of the three lor mee stalls at Old Airport Road Food Centre is a bit of a mystery.There isn’t much of a taste difference as compared to other lor mee stalls, especially if you taste the individual ingredients on its own.There are however two main areas which this stall excels in.Aside from a whole braised egg, braised pork belly, bean sprouts and coriander toppings, the main highlight is the generous amounts of deep-fried flaked snapper fish which comes nicely crispy in bits and always has a soft, moist fish meat texture, especially when you compare it with other lor mee stalls who also throw in flaked fish.The other area is the overall taste you get when the gravy, minced garlic, chilli and black vinegar are well mixed. You can taste all of the individual flavour notes at the same time — spiciness, a savoury stock roundness, slight sweet notes from the chilli, garlic notes and an earthy sour vinegar taste.Longtime customers will notice that they have stopped giving out ngoh hiang as a topping.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/prawn-noodles/:['What makes or breaks our beloved prawn noodle is the broth. To get the ultimate prawn noodle soup base, a copious amount of prawn heads and shells is fried, then boiled for hours to extract the essence of the crustacean.These days, pork is commonly included to give more body to the soup. It’s a lengthy and laborious cooking process, so it’s not surprisingly that some vendors cut corners.Thankfully, there’s a handful of worthy hawkers who continue to uphold the tradition of serving a bowl of fine prawn noodle. Here’s a side-by-side comparison of five outstanding prawn noodle stalls.\xa0Wah Kee Big Prawn NoodlesBlk 41A Cambridge Road, #01-15 Pek Kio Food CentreOpening hours: 8am-2pm; closed on MonPrice: $3 for regular prawn, $8/$10 for king prawnRating: 5/5 for king prawn, 3/5 for regular prawnOne-of-a-kind—that pretty much sums up Wah Kee’s fabulous big prawn noodles. Otherwise, why would price-conscious Singaporeans happily shell out 10 bucks for hawker fare?Despite being pricey by hawker standards, Wah Kee’s king prawn noodles sell out daily. Discerning foodies come here for premium grade banana prawn and Wah Kee’s unique prawn consommé. Coloured a deep reddish-orange hue, each spoonful of this saturated broth was a burst of sweet crustacean and briny ocean wholesomeness.The climax of the dish was three fat banana prawns—prized for their fine-textured, delicate flesh. Fresh? Check. Juicy, bouncy flesh? Check. Creamy orange roe? Check. For prawns of this thickness, it was testament to the chef’s skill that the flesh wasn’t overcooked.Accompanied by al dente noodles tossed in aromatic hae bee (dried shrimp) sambal and shallot oil, this was truly an unforgettable gastronomic ecstasy.There are four pricings available—$3, $5, $8, $10—which correspondingly reflects the size and grade of the prawn. $3 is the bare bones version–just noodles in prawn stock topped with smallish prawns sliced in half. Good enough to satisfy a prawn noodle craving, but we recommend paying $8 and upwards for that one-of-a-kind experience.\xa0River South (Hoe Nam) Prawn Noodles31 Tai Thong CrescentOpening hours: 6.30am-4.30am; closed once a month on MonPrice: $3 for regular prawn, $4 for large prawnRating: 4/5The first measure of a great prawn noodle is its broth, and River South Hoe Nam passed with flying colors. Brimming with complex umami-ness, it was a melodious harmony of sweet-savoury flavours. We liked how the rich broth was robust but refreshing at the same time.Here, they used tiger prawns, which were a wee bit overdone, but still fresh and succulent. If you enjoy pork ribs, order the prawn and pork rib version ($5.00). With meaty, lean but very tender ribs, it was very satisfying indeed.If you can’t decide between the soup or dry version, we say, “Go for the soup!” The sauce mix for the dry version was rather underwhelming. It had just a hint of spiciness and not much else. Perhaps the intention was not to interfere with the broth, but some added piquancy would have been nice.\xa0Noo Cheng Adam Road Prawn Mee86 Zion RoadStall 4, Zion Riverside Food CentreOpening hours: 11am-2.30pm, 5.30pm-11pm; closed alternate MonPrice: from $5.00Rating: 4/5Strictly speaking, Noo Cheng Adam Road’s version is more of a prawn and pork rib noodle. Comparatively, they used more pork, resulting in a smooth and milky broth. Combined with the ocean sweetness of prawn and ikan bilis, this was indeed a very hearty and luxurious–albeit rather unctuous–broth.Prices here start from $5.00. Sounds pricey, but they give you large-sized banana prawns. A pity they were split in half, which also cut the ‘shiok’ factor in half. But the prawns were still sweet, crunchy and very fresh.Meaty and fall-off-the-bone tender, the ribs were excellent, too. We also loved their dry noodles. Tossed in a drool-inducing mix of fragrant hae bee, crispy fried shallot, chilli and ketchup, it drove our taste buds into overdrive!\xa0Amoy St Boon Kee Prawn Noodle7 Keppel Road, PSA Tanjong Pagar Complex#01-01/02 H.L.Y. Eating HouseOpening hours: Mon-Fri: 7.30am-1.30pm, closed on PHPrice: from $3.00Rating: 3.5/5Amoy St. Boon Kee’s masterfully-executed prawn noodle is a well-known secret among those working in Tanjong Pagar. Perhaps they want it to remain under the radar, for this popular stall already sees long queues daily even without much media coverage.Flavours here were bold, from the rich broth to the dry-tossed noodles. The full-bodied broth had distinct sweet-salty flavours, veering towards the sweet side. If you ask for chilli in your noodles, the default level is tongue-numbingly hot. You have been warned!Of these five stalls, Boon Kee gets our vote for best value. For just $3, we got three plump tiger prawns that were extremely fresh, sweet, and succulent. There was also lean but tender sliced pork. Portions were very generous as well. We also tried the $4 version which had meaty pork ribs that were tasty but tended to be dry.\xa0Joo Chiat Prawn Mee15 Crane Road, Xin Hua Ji Food HouseOpening hours: 7.30am-3pm, closed on TuesPrice: from $3.50Rating: 3/5\nJoo Chiat Prawn Mee’s broth is light in style, without the depth that comes from pork. It was sufficiently flavourful, but a tad too sweet for our liking. Perhaps they were too heavy-handed with the rock sugar.We were impressed with how they meticulously peeled and deveined the prawns, leaving the heads intact for us to suck all the goodness out. With the exception of two small mushy crustaceans, the tiger prawns we got were respectably large and fresh.Both the soup and dry versions were equally good. Although on the soft side of al dente, the noodles didn’t leave any trace of alkaline. Overall, this was a decent find that’s memorable enough to drop by if you’re in the vicinity.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/old-school-bakeries/:['As Singapore continues to develop, the craving for a piece of the past heightens; perhaps we’re longing for a reminder of simpler times, of childhood days. To satiate our hunger for nostalgia, we go scouting for five old-fashioned confectioneries where the desserts of our memories are still being baked:\xa0CRITIC’S PICK Le Café Confectionery & Pastry \nBest for bean curd tarts\nThis chain-of-three started out in 1949 as a tze char stall. The Middle Road shop is the original, and has been plastered with newspaper reviews over the years. As documented in two photos, even celebrities come here: Andy Lau once ordered his birthday cake here. \xa0Le Café is not simply popular for its large-sized ‘golf ball’ pineapple tarts, it’s handmade speciality items such as coffee cookies, rum balls and bean curd tarts also have a following. What you probably can’t get anywhere else are the bean curd tarts ($9 for 8) – silky smooth tau huay (dialect for ‘bean curd’) fills a thin cup of buttery pastry. These smooth, light tarts can come with longan, peanuts, and grass jelly.\nLe Café Confectionery & Pastry | Address: 264 Middle Road Elias Building | Tel: 6337 2417 | Opening hours: Mon-Sat 10.30am-7pm, Sun 10.30am-3pm\xa0Ng Kim Lee Confectionery\nBest for zebra pandan cake\nNg Kim Lee stands out from the rest of the shophouses near Beauty World for its very old-looking shop front and signboard. The shop been in the business for close to 60 years, and is known for its Teochew-style pastries and Western cakes. Those looking to fulfill the menu for their traditional Chinese wedding can look no further: wedding cakes, gift items and even betrothal wedding baskets can be ordered and rented. Most of the items remain very cheap, with a mini muffin (comes in more than ten flavours) costing only $0.50. We are most intrigued by the zebra pandan cake ($0.70 each) – it is fluffy and maintains the familiar sweet pandan fragrance although it sports additional brown and beige strips.\nNg Kim Lee Confectionery | Address: 4 Chun Tin Road | Tel: 6466 3515 | Opening hours: Mon-Sat 9am-9pm, Sun 9am-1pm\xa0Rich & Good Cake Shop\nBest for Swiss rolls\nIndeed – the Swiss rolls are ‘rich and good’. This humble bakery lies amidst cafes and bars along the culturally rich Kandahar Street. Made to hold flavours like kaya (the most popular), mango, blueberry, coffee and durian ($7-$8 for a foot-long roll), these Swiss rolls are like no others in Singapore – thinner in diameter, longish and not pre-portioned so you can have as thick a slice as you’d like. They even come in retro long pink boxes. The sponge cake is soft, fluffy and pillow-like, with generous dense fillings – a perfect tea-time treat.\nRich & Good Cake Shop | Address: 24 Kandahar Street | Tel: 6294 3324 | Opening hours: Mon-Fri 8.30am-5pm, Sat 8.30am-4pm\xa0Sembawang Confectionery\nBest for traditional butter cakes\nOf these five bakeries, Sembawang Confectionery has the most evident 1980s feel – it’s partly due to its location near Beach Road’s ‘Army Market’; the entire area of old provision and barber shops feels like you’ve time-traveled to the past. Other than their traditional bread such as luncheon and egg ($1 each), we are most interested in their creamy butter cakes that come in traffic light colours. These come in two shapes – the usual longish ($1.20) and oval-shaped ($1.40) with sugared-peanut coating the sides. The surrounding shops may sell similar-looking cakes, but Sembawang’s are the most authentic and reminded us of childhood. We like the green kiwi flavour best – an anachronism to Singapore of the late ’70s and early ’80s.\nSembawang Confectionery | Address: 6 Beach Road #01-4869 | Tel: 6295 3965 | Opening hours: Daily 10.30am-7pm\xa0Tiong Bahru Galicier Pastry\nBest for Nyonya kuehs and butterfly cake\nThis unassuming pastry shop at Tiong Bahru sells a wide variety of old-fashioned cakes, tarts and cookies. It is most popular for traditional Nyonya delights such as ondeh-ondeh (glutinous rice flour balls with palm sugar filling, coated in shredded coconut) and kueh dadars (coconut-filled green crepes). Ask, and owner Jenny Soh will whip out an old photo of Orchard Road in 1975 and point out her original shop somewhere near Killiney Road. She reveals that her best item is the ‘butterfly’ ($2), a creamy, buttery cherry-topped cake made with moist sponge. Do try the mini huat kuehs (steamed rice flour cakes, $1.30) too – they are about a third of the size of the usual, with gula Melaka (palm sugar) oozing from the middle.\nTiong Bahru Galicier Pastry | Address: 55 Tiong Bahru Road, #01-39 | Tel: 6324 1686 | Opening hours: Tue-Sun 9am-9pmAuthor© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

That was the winning motto at Pizza Time’s eating challenge, held between 6pm to 8pm on Aug 3.The contest, held at Pizza Time’s outdoor seating area at Cuppage Terrace, saw a dozen contestants challenge each other in four initial rounds (three contestants per round) in the male and female categories (six male contestants, six female contestants).Male contestants who polished off the most slices out of three whole pizzas in each initial round would progress to the final round, while female contestants who ate the most amount of slices out of two whole pizzas in the initial rounds would enter the finals.Contestants resorted to a variety of tactics to aid them in their quest for ultimate pizza glory. Some folded or rolled their pizza slices into smaller pieces in a bid to increase efficiency.Others dunked their pizza slices in water, a fairly common competitive eating strategy that works on the idea that this would lubricate the food, thus making it easier to swallow.However, the winning strategy proved to be the ability to stay calm and enjoy eating. The winner of the male category was seen taking sips of wine in between bites, looking not the least bit flustered in a speed-eating contest.The winner of the female category arrived closed to a minute late into the initial round, and yet calmly wolfed her way to victory. When we asked what her secret to winning was, she said, “To enjoy eating and having fun with my family and friends around”.The winners of both categories each took home $300 in cash and $200 worth of dining vouchers from Pizza Time, while the runners-up received $200 worth of dining vouchers each.The crowd also got to enjoy free flow of pizzas, pasta and beers from 6pm to 8pm, while they cheered for the contestants.Pizza Time, which opened last December, offers affordable Napolitana style pizzas that don’t compromise on quality. The dishes are all made from scratch, such as the pizza dough being kneaded from flour imported from Italy.The pizzas are cooked in a custom made wood fire brick oven flown in from Napoli, Italy. Pizza Time’s Mentaiko pizza, a crowd-favourite, is a delight for seafood lovers who love spicy dishes.The pizza has cod roe, squids, prawns, mozzarella cheese, and topped with seaweed strips. But if spice is not your thing, try the Bismarck pizza.With a combination of ham, eggs, mushroom, and mozzarella cheese, this pizza gives a delightful twist to classic pizzas. But pizzas are not all you can enjoy here.Pizza Time also has a variety of pasta and side dishes to tickle your fancy. Their drinks menu boasts a range of wines, cocktails, mocktails, and other alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages.With select pizzas for $10 and select pasta for $8 during the daily happy hours (5pm to 8pm), diners can enjoy an affordable and tasty meal, which is a rarity in Orchard.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/chinese-eateries-in-geylang/:['New eateries have been springing up along Geylang. Get the lowdown on what’s happening, what to look out for, and what’s hot.These days, asking where Chinatown is will probably give you more than one answer.Born-and-bred Singaporeans will tell you to take a train to Chinatown station, whereas a Chinese immigrant in Singapore may point you to some place else.Take Wei, for instance. Ask the Permanent Resident whose been living in Singapore for 4 years, and she’ll tell you that Chinatown is in Geylang. “My friends and I call Geylang ‘little China’.”\xa0The changing fare of Geylang\nGeylang has always been known for good food. The rows of refurbished shophouses are home to some of the most authentic (and dare we say, Singaporean) food in our city-state.The last decade has seen food of a different kind flood the streets of Geylang. Sure, you can still find old favourites like seafood, tze char and nasi padang along the streets — but new eateries have quickly become the attraction today, adding vibrancy to the already exciting flavours in Geylang.As the nickname “little China” suggests, Geylang is now a veritable hub for authentic ethnic Chinese food. The unobservant might dismiss the lot of them as hotpot restaurants serving up suspicious looking meat, but a casual stroll and a keen eye will quickly prove otherwise – a surprising diversity of cuisines from Shandong, Hunan and even new delicacies from Hong Kong are now available, along with your favourite food street.“There’re many Chinese nationals living in Geylang and they miss the food from home,” said Song, who runs a small shop with his family selling ‘rou chuan’ (skewered meats, similar to Malay satay). “Rou chuan’ is a delicacy of Xinjiang and enjoyed all over China, and our customers appreciate that we make sure it tastes the same as back home.”Has any effort been made to ensure the food also suits the local Singaporean palate? Apparently not, if Jiang’s comments are anything to go by. The owner of Shandong Kitchen said, “Singaporeans love a lighter taste, and some restaurants elsewhere cater to that. We want to preserve the authenticity of our dishes, as more than 90% of our customers are Chinese Nationals.”She’s right. There were barely any Singaporeans sitting around the 30-odd tables there, each filled to the edges with Shandong specialties.“We’re here because they’re here,” said Jiang, referring to her Chinese National patrons.However, this is not the case with Mai Fan Restaurant. Owner Jessie said that the restaurant offers a range of healthier soup to cater to local Singaporeans. The restaurant is also installed with air-conditioning to ensure its guests are comfortable. “The efforts have paid off for us, as more Singaporeans are willing to pay extra for the premium hotpot meal,” Jessie said.\xa0Other new eateries\nNot all the new eateries at Geylang serve provincial Chinese food. New joints like Kong Kee Restaurant offer unique Hong Kong fare like deep sea giant grouper, which owners Jasmine and Joseph say is a first in Singapore.Perhaps more intriguing is Mongolian King, an eatery run by Hai Yi. Hai Yi, who is half Mongolian himself, prides in having a mixed clientele from all over the world.“I get Europeans, Koreans, Singaporeans and ethnic Chinese coming to try out the unique dishes I serve,” he says. “They love the mutton soup and the Mongolian milk tea.”Catch him at Geylang soon because Hai Yi is moving. When asked why, Hai Yi sheepishly reminded us of the more sordid realities of Geylang’s environs, which he admitted has turned away some customers. For that reason, Hai Yi is considering a move to the ‘real’ Chinatown.\xa0New eateries in Geylang\nIt’s hard to find a place in Singapore with a better variety of cuisines apart from Geylang. Nearly every major culture has food offerings here, and a walk down the streets of Geylang searching for new eats is at the very least an eye opener. Let’s take a look at some of the new eateries that have been added to the eclectic mix.\xa0Mongolian King\nAddress: Lorong 13 Geylang, just off Geylang Road\nTel: 93807300 (Hai Yi)\nWebsite: www.mongolian-king.com\nPrice: from $3\nOpening hours: 24 hrs, call beforehand\nSpeciality: Delicacies from Mongolia\nIn just over three months, Hai Yi’s stall quickly made a name for itself for dishing up authentic Mongolian fare in a coffee shop setting. Recommendations hang from the fixtures of the stall like victory flags, alongside the delectable photos of food. Signature dishes include the Mongolian meat pies, lamb chop and the Mongolian tea. Mongolian King will be moving to Chinatown in the later part of December, so keep his contact handy if you’d like to visit.\xa0Kong Kee Restaurant\nAddress: Lorong 31 Geylang, along Geylang Road\nTel: 96603868 (Jasmine and Joseph)\nPrice: $4-$40\nOpening hours: from 12pm\nSpecialty: Hong Kong and Local Cuisine\nJust less than two months old, this snug restaurant offers a mix of Hong Kong delicacies like deep sea giant grouper and desserts, as well as local favourites like Hokkien mee. Locals are quickly starting to discover this place, which offers good value for a hearty meal prepared by a team headed by Hong Kong chefs (for starters, there’s no GST or service charge). It’s not air-conditioned, but it’s sufficiently covered, so you won’t be disappointed on rainy days.\xa0Qi Li Xiang\nAddress: Lorong 31 Geylang, Ji Heng Coffee Shop\nPrice: individual skewers from $0.50 onwards\nOpening hours: from 12pm\nSpeciality: Rou chuan (skewered meats)\nQi Li Xiang is an unassuming stall tucked in a corner of Ji Heng Coffee Shop – the nondescript coffee shop has probably seen better years. Mr Song, a cheery young man from Shandong, is proud to mention the increasing numbers of Singaporeans patronising his stall over the two years he’s been there. Favourites at this stall are the beef, mutton and squid; all seasoned with generous helpings of spices. Do try the biscuits there as well.\xa0Mai Fan Stone Healthy Steamboat \nAddress: 17 Sims Way, behind Lorong 3 Geylang\nTel: 67476434 (Jessie)\nPrice: buffet prices start from $16 onwards per person, depending on choice of stock\nOpening hours: 11am-10pm\nSpeciality: Stone hotpot\nThis definitely isn’t a common hotpot restaurant. Mai Fan stands out from the rest with well-decorated interiors and intricately crafted stone pots. The eatery offers more than five types of soup stock, which will delight foodies looking for an exquisite hotpot experience. While the claim that buffets can be healthy is questionable, the one year-old restaurant may be on to something with its stone pots that add class and set it apart from any offering elsewhere.\xa0Shandong Kitchen\nAddress: 351 Geylang Road, Beside Lorong 24\nTel: 67481468 or 94484686 (Jiang Hong Bo)\nPrice: $4-$9\nOpening hours:11am-late\nSpeciality: Delicacies from Shandong\nShandong kitchen expects a daily crowd, as evidenced by its 30-odd tables spread over the five foot-walkways and neighbouring open spaces. It’s a well-kept place and is rather comfortable if you don’t mind a tight squeeze during the busier hours. Popular dishes are the braised fish, chilli fish head and pig’s ears – but look out also for the seasoned duck displayed at entrance of the restaurant. Just over two years old, the outlet has opened two other shops in Geylang and five more all over Singapore.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/woo-ji-cooked-food/:['Pop round the blue zone of Chinatown Complex in the early mornings and you’ll notice a long queue for laksa and prawn noodles at Woo Ji Cooked Food.It is one of a handful of long queues that happen in the mornings at the hawker centre and you’ll understand why once you look at the stall’s frontage: it’s $2 for a bowl of laksa or prawn noodles.It is incredibly rare to find hawker stalls that still sell reasonably sized dishes for $2. The minimum price is usually $3 these days.\xa0Woo Ji Cooked Food started business as a street side hawker along Smith Street in 1965. In 1986, they transferred up to Chinatown Complex and they have been there ever since. The stall is now run by the third generation.While they get roughly equal orders for both their dishes, their laksa is the more compelling one. It has an old-school laksa broth where the flavour is mainly stock based (propped up by dried shrimp). There is coconut milk added but only enough to add a little bit of creaminess and sweetness.It’s a big contrast to the Katong-style laksas you get today, where the flavour is big and the coconut milk is very creamy and bold.Woo Ji’s laksa here is similar to what you’d get in Johor, Malaysia where they hold back on the coconut milk.The spiciness is light but there is some sambal chilli on the side. It’s moderately spicy with some dried shrimp savouriness and oil richness and it does well in boosting the overall flavour and heat.In a $2 bowl, you’ll get two fried wantons, some tau pok (beancurd puff), one fishball, fish-paste-stuffed green chilli and cooked dried prawns as a topping.There is a $3 option which adds two extra tau pok pieces, one additional half of a stuffed green chilli and one more fishball.The fried wantons contain fish paste but it’s quite floury and there isn’t much in it, so keep your expectations in check.As for the prawn noodles ($2/3), it is decently done for the money, but it’s not something you would travel half across Singapore for.You get a decent amount of yellow noodles, some bean sprouts, sliced fishcake, sliced prawns, sliced pork belly and topped off with pepper and fried onions.\xa0The prawn broth has a reasonable stockiness with nice savoury and rounded flavours.Head to the stall early as the food gets sold out as early as 10am on some days.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/91-fried-kway-teow-mee/:['The healthiest char kway teow in Singapore? One look at this plate of char kway teow, and you’ll be thinking: “Am I eating vegetables or char kway teow?”The whole plate ($4/5) is literally covered in a bed of stir-fried vegetables (chye sim), and crispy ikan bilis (whitebait) is sprinkled on top for that extra savoury crunch.It is one of two char kway teow stalls at Golden Mile Food Centre, both of which are equally popular. The other stall is more traditional, while this one focuses on being healthy, yet tasty.No pork or lard is used, so you won’t get that enveloping lard richness or the pork sweetness from sliced Chinese lap cheong but beyond that, the taste is hardly compromised.Good stock is used as an alternative to boost the flavour, and you can tell a large part of that flavour is cockle juice.Even though it comes with a wet consistency, the noodles are well fried and don’t come soggy.The dish only comes with towgay (bean sprouts) and cockles which are nicely fresh and moist.Verdict? This is a char kway teow you won’t feel guilty eating everyday, though the annoying niggle is that they have a one spoon and chopsticks per plate rule and the portions are a bit on the small side.If you order takeaway, the ikan bilis is packed in small, plastic sachets to keep its crispness.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/yochanas-daily-delights/:['For those seeking inspiration in baking, look no further than homegrown baking blog, Yochana’s Cake Delight (www.auntyyochana.blogspot.com). The creator behind the drool-worthy baked goodies is Lucy Lim, 51. The homemaker and mother of a 23-year-old daughter has unselfishly shared her baking recipes online since 2006 in the hope that her passion for baking would be passed on to others.\xa0What inspired you to start the Yochana’s Cake Delight blog?\nIt started when I was looking for a recipe to make ngoh hiang (five spice rolls) for Chinese New Year. I searched on the internet and was surprised that there were so many food bloggers who shared their wonderful recipes unselfishly. I was inspired by them and was touched when a lady made the effort to look for a bread slicer for me even though we were strangers. I decided I could contribute as well. Thus, with the help of my daughter who created the blog for me, Yochana’s Cake Delight was born.What got you started on baking? Are you a professional baker or is baking just a hobby? Are your delicious baked goodies for sale?\xa0 \nI started baking at 12. Back then, I used to help my mum bake lots of lovely marble butter cakes. I was taught and inspired by my mom who even until today is helping me with all my bakes. I’m not a professional baker. Baking is just a passionate hobby of mine. I don’t bake for sale but I bake only for my siblings and close friends. I like to bake cakes that I love, not just for an order.How often do you bake?\nEveryday!\n\nIn your opinion, what are the greatest rewards you get from your blog? \nI guess it’s when someone exclaims in delight when they see my bakes on the blog, or when they try out my recipes and achieve fantastic results. But most importantly, this blog brings my daughter closer to home. She works overseas and seeing what I’ve baked each day makes the presence of mom stronger.The assortment of cakes on your blog look tantalising and delicious, but complicated to make! How would you encourage a first-time baker to start on his or her first cake?\nWell, as I always tell my blog fans, you have to learn how to crawl before you can walk. So they should always start with a simple butter cake or little cupcakes before progressing to the more complicated ones.Share a particular cake or dessert you made that you were really proud of. \nI’m usually very proud of all my bakes as I put in a lot of effort into making them. Nonetheless my proudest bake would definitely be my macarons. Many bakers took lessons on how to bake macarons, but for me, it was self-taught. Amazingly, the macarons turned out perfect, and their skirtings were beautiful. I also created the macaron fillings myself with fondant flowers and melted chocolate.Any baking disasters you can recall?\nBaking disasters in the kitchen are actually quite normal. Recently, I forgot to add sugar into my cake batter, causing it to crack and it came out hard as a rock.Do you think young Singaporeans are interested in baking? Or is the activity losing its appeal?\nBaking is definitely losing its appeal among the younger generation of Singaporeans. There are so many shops selling delectable cakes and desserts these days, there is no incentive to learn how to bake anymore, unlike our younger days when dessert stalls were not so common.If you were to throw a cakes-and-desserts party, what would you make to impress your guests?\nIt’ll be a spread! I will bake all my French cakes, my agar-agar will be shaped like a bouquet of flowers with many colourful layerings, there will also be macarons, tarts, swiss rolls and petite fours.Is there such a thing as a “healthy cake”?\nSome of my cake recipes are eggless and use only corn oil. There are also those that require only egg white and use less sugar. I guess they are considered to be healthier than the normal cakes which are high in fat and sugar.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/lucky-chicken-rice/:['Pop by Orchard Road’s Lucky Plaza and it’ll be hard to miss the long queues for Lucky Chicken Rice during weekday lunchtimes.Tucked away in the corner of the inside row of the second floor, the eatery was started in 1991 by now 72-year-old Hainanese Loo Liat Wang. He initially employed a cook to handle the orders before shortly taking over the reins to make the chicken rice himself.Loo retired from cooking a decade ago, delegating the cooking to his staff but he still pops by the restaurant —\xa0 which has always been located in the same spot in Lucky Plaza since its opening — everyday to check on the quality.Loo has three children but none of them are interested in taking over, so the business will be sold once Loo fully retires.\xa0The restaurant is hugely popular with tourists, office workers and locals alike for its chicken rice as it ticks almost all the checkboxes as to what a good chicken rice should be but it’s true strength is that every element of the chicken rice is very well thought out and balanced.Every individual component of Lucky’s chicken rice — the rice, the meat, the chilli, the ginger and so on — tastes good on its own.\xa0The chicken meat is done well — with a couple of issues — but you’ll overlook it as the rest of the chicken rice is so well done.It’s dressed in a basic soy/sesame oil sauce and it comes rather salty in flavour so you have to be careful how much you put on, especially if you eat the chicken on its own. The saltiness balances out nicely when you eat it with the rice.\xa0It is also good that there the flavour of the dressing is quite straight-ahead with zero sweetness in the taste. Quite a few people don’t like their chicken seasoned with that added sweetness but many chicken rice stalls do it anyway.The textures are similar to what you’d get any chicken rice stall — tender and juicy if you order meat close to the bone (ji wei) and a bit drier when you order breast meat (ji siong). If you order shao ji (roast chicken), the textures will be drier.Note that Lucky Chicken Rice gives ji siong by default. You have to request for ji wei when you place your order.\xa0The rice is a big highlight, so good that it’s incredibly nice to eat on its own. Soft and bouncy with a great chicken fat richness and a slight savouriness. There is a nice present fragrance as well.The dips are also excellent in their own right. The chilli comes spicy with a little soy savouriness, the ground ginger has a present saltiness and sesame oil richness and the dark soy sauce — thick caramel-flavoured, smoky and only with a little sweetness.\xa0And here’s the beauty of Lucky Chicken Rice: No matter what you add or mix or eat on its own, it still tastes good. Nothing tastes under or over flavoured.The chicken tastes good on its own or with rice or even with a little ginger added. The chilli and the rice also also tastes perfectly nice on its own.\xa0Also a big shoutout to the soup on the side which is has a nicely rounded stocky flavour and has added winter melon and spring onions.Lucky Chicken Rice sells some noodle and porridge dishes and some basic side dishes like gizzard, bean sprouts with cuttle fish and boiled eggs.The must-have among them is the chicken liver which comes incredibly soft and creamy and is dressed in the same basic soy and oil sauce that the meat is dressed in.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

The 300-seat restaurant has since been buzzing with hungry diners who troop in for their fried chicken fix. Key items on the menu include their famed chicken dish – Chickenjoy ($2.80 for one piece of chicken served with rice), the Yumburger ($4.40 as part of a value meal served with a drink and a side of fries) – beef patty with lettuce, tomatoes and cheese in a bun – and the Jollibee spaghetti ($3), pasta served with a sweet tomato sauce and sausages. Frequented by Phillipines natives looking for a taste of fast food like they do it at home, Jollibee is a 750-outlet-strong fast food chain with a presence in countries such as the USA, Vietnam, Brunei, Hong Kong and the Middle East.

At this newly opened and perpetually busy 100-seat branch on Cuppage Road, Gerry’s Grill finally has room to flex its muscles. Popular in Manila for inihaw, dishes grilled on charcoal and ordered as bar chow, here the meat is grilled on a gas grill.

Located at Harbourfront Plaza’s third level food court, rapsa is ‘shiok’ in Tagalog and the crispy pata (hind leg of pig, $25) here is exactly that. Each batch is boiled in water for four hours before getting dunked in a pool of hot oil; this elaborate cooking process is better suited to restaurants, so understandably the ones displayed here are already pre-cooked. Reheating takes around 10 minutes. Served with a dip made of finely chopped onions, soy sauce, vinegar, and red and green chilli, the skin crackles to the bite and the meat melts in your mouth. This dish is usually paired with kare-kare ($5.50)\xa0— an elaborate stew made from peanut sauce with beef chunks, oxtail, tripe, eggplants, long beans and Chinese cabbage\xa0— best served straight from the pot. \nRapsa | Address: Stall 7 Food Junction, 3/L Harbourfront Centre | Tel: 62705915 | Opening hours: Daily 10am–10pm\xa0\xa0Tapa King\nFor the die-hard Philippine fans\xa0\nOriginating from Manila like Gerry’s Grill, Tapa King prides itself in having just one specialty: tapa, tender beef strips served with fried garlic rice and egg.

There are four flavours to choose from\xa0— sweet sauce (‘Tapa Prince’), herbs and spices (‘Tapa Joe’), original (soy sauce and calamansi (‘Tapa King’) and sweet and spicy (‘Tapa Queen’)\xa0— and they all seem to look the same, though regulars swear they can tell one from the other by looking at the colour and texture. The queue can be long at noon and everything is cooked fresh, but it should take less than five minutes once you’ve placed your order. The garlic rice alone is worth the trip, but go for Tapa Queen ($6.50), marinated in a spicy sweet sauce, and eaten with a dip made of vinegar mixed with garlic.

The specialty here is that food is taken turo turo style (it means “to point with fingers”), that’s the Filipino version of the Malay nasi padang, where food dishes are displayed behind a glass counter, and diners point to the ones they wish to order. The menu consists of classic favourites such as kare-kare (a peanut-based beef curry), bicol express (pork with shrimp paste in coconut milk), and the working man’s breakfast combo, longsilog – garlic fried rice and traditional pork sausage, topped with a fried egg.\nKabayan Filipino Restaurant | Address: #03-25 Lucky Plaza, 304 Orchard Road | Opening hours: Daily 8am-9pm\xa0\xa0Mang Kiko’s Lechon\n(Temporarily closed until Lau Pa Sat reopens after renovations) \nThere’s no question what this food stall’s specialty is: lechon is marinated and spit-roasted pork or chicken with rice.

Although not quite as good as the original lechon from Cebu (celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain described Zubucon’s lechon as being “the best pig ever”), the smoky, juicy offerings here are still tasty enough to make the queueing worthwhile.\nMang Kiko’s Lechon | Address: Stall 71 Lau Pa Sat Festival Market, 18 Raffles Quay | Opening hours: Daily 9am-9pmAuthor© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/hangover/:['You know the feeling – your head hurts, your mouth feels dry and the room is spinning. It’s the morning after and the euphoric high you felt at last night’s party has mysteriously vanished, leaving behind a foul-breathed monster nursing a splitting headache.Explaining why alcohol has such an effect on us, Dr Rupert See, senior physician at Raffles Medical explains, “Consuming alcohol causes your body to lose fluids, leading to dehydration, which causes headaches and fatigue.” Throw into the mix the likelihood of low blood-sugar when one wakes up after a night of heavy drinking, and you have the perfect recipe for feeling sick, nauseous and light-headed.So if you plan to go hog wild at a party, these handy tips (for both pre-and post drinking) should help ensure you feel less miserable the next day.Pre-party preparationAccording to Sigrid Grobys, a naturopath at An Apple a Day, “Drinking on an empty stomach leads to a guaranteed hangover.” This is because the alcohol will enter the bloodstream very quickly. So with this in mind, have a hearty meal before heading out. Order some pasta or hearty bread bowl.“I usually drink a big glass of milk before going for drinks with my friends as the milk lines my stomach,” says Bob Cheong, 27, a marketing executive. “Having cheese and crackers before drinks also helps to slow down the absorption of alcohol for me,” adds the 27-year-old.Any seasoned party-goer will tell you that mixing drinks throughout the night will not only get you drunk in a shorter period of time, it will also almost guarantee a terrible hangover the next day. So refrain from chasing your flute of champagne with a glass of whisky and try to stick to the same spirit range. Another good idea is to spread out your drinks over the night or routinely switch between alcoholic drinks, water and juices.\xa0The morning afterIf you’ve partied like there was no tomorrow and are paying for it the next day, here are some suggestions to nurse your hangover.\xa01: Juice it upFruit juices help counter a hangover too. “Fruit juice contains antioxidants that help to strengthen the liver,” says Rupert. Correspondingly, research has also shown that the presence of fructose in fruit juice actually helps increase the speed at which the body metabolises alcohol. So load up of that cup of orange juice and replenish your lost Vitamin C.However, if you’ve run out of fruit juice, fresh vegetable juice is another option. “I find taking fresh vegetable juice in the morning, for example blended tomato and celery, helps to neutralise the effects of a hangover,” says Carol Anne Wah, head of marketing at well-known nightspots like Balaclava and KPO.\xa02: Drink up! Drink water, lots of it. Have as much fluid as you can before your party, during the night and before you go to bed to ensure your body doesn’t get dehydrated. “I always make it a point to do a water parade when I get home and the next morning,” says Bob. “Water counters the dehydrating effects of alcohol on my body and helps clear it out of my system,” he adds.\xa03: Herbal remedies Edward Yap, a TCM physician, recommends drinking honey water before and after party sessions. “Honey contains beneficial properties which can help alleviate some symptoms of hangovers and make you feel better,” Edward says.“For me, a good cup of boiled ginseng helps,” says Ang Wei Shun, a financial analyst. “However, it must be boiled with real ginseng roots, not those from a packet,” he adds.\xa04: The big fry up“Nothing cures a good hangover better than a big fry up,” says Valerie Toh, 32. The graphic designer’s remedy for a night of heavy drinking sees her cooking up a storm the day after, serving up scrambled eggs, French toast and hash browns on the menu. “These taste great and more importantly, help soak up any alcohol left in the system,” she adds.Valerie’s remedy might not be too far off the mark as protein is a big hangover helper, according to Rupert. “To detox properly, your body needs the amino acids found in protein and cysteine, which is found in high quantities in eggs,” he says.\xa05: Sports drinks help too While aspirins may help relieve some symptoms of hangovers, drinking more fluids especially fruit juice and electrolyte drinks like Gatorade and 100plus help too, notes Rupert. “I do take care to have a good meal before drinks and have something to eat after the party,” says Monica Lim, a sales manager. “But if I still get a hangover the next day, I always make sure I drink lots of orange juice and 100plus.”\xa06: Bartender, pour me another! To a select few, however, the best remedy to reverse a dreary hangover is to simply have another drink! “If you’ve been out for a night of drinking and partying with friends and have a hangover, just drink another beer,” says Mel, an expatriate. “That’s the best way to cure a hangover!”Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

Owner Steven Pipes had wanted to create the simple, back-to-basics burger he had craved for after trying more than 20 different burgers. Collaborating with the executive chef of Le Parker Meridien, he started serving what’s dubbed “the best burger in New York”.Clearly the concept has worked. There are other outlets in South Korea, United Arab Emirates and Brazil, with Singapore as the first Southeast Asia outlet.\xa0Walk along the back alley on Gemmill Lane and you will find the iconic bright neon burger sign. The entrance to the restaurant is to the left while the exit is on the right. Step in and you will see the red velvet curtains with another burger sign to the right. When you reach the end, you will be greeted by an all American setting with vintage posters plastered all over the rustic wooden walls, wooden tables and casual seating with diners encouraged to write and draw on the walls.\xa0The menu is kept simple with only four types of burgers (Hamburger, Cheese Burger, Bacon Burger and Bacon Cheeseburger) on offer in single (from $13.10) or double patty (from $23.50). To keep things authentic, the beef is flown in from Nebraska and freshly butchered (not frozen) and grinded everyday before they are grilled over unique cookers imported from the States. A chef from the main outlet has also flown in for the opening to train the Singapore staff and ensure quality is consistent and that the food is up to standard.\xa0We tried the single patty Cheese Burger ($13.80) with all the works (lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles with ketchup, mayo and mustard sauce) and it’s what you would expect out of a classic all American burger. Covered in melted Colby cheese from Wisconsin, the juicy patty is sandwiched between nicely soft buns with freshly cut vegetables and crunchy Kosher pickles. It’s as unpretentious as it gets and in this case, less is more.\xa0Whether you’re dining in or taking out, every food order is served in a paper bag with a side of fries ($5.50) available as a separate order. In the coming weeks, the burgers can be paired with a selection of up to 18 beers on tap (ranging from Omnipollo, Weird Beard, Victory and Hitachino) or a sweet Boozy Milkshake ($15.80 or $11.80 without alcohol). Serious burger fanatics won’t be disappointed.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/mexican-restaurants/:['Whether you like it in a casa (Spanish for “home”), hacienda (“estate”) or taqueria (“taco shop”) setting; spicy, piquant or mild; Singapore has a new, and established, crop of Mexican restaurants, takeaway or grocery store to suit every budget and taste. Since featuring 15 Mexican eateries (and a delivery service) a year ago, more have opened. We’ve added six new joints to this list, in time for you to go Cinco de Mayo loco.Often mistaken for Mexican Independence Day (16 September), Cinco de Mayo officially commemorates the anniversary of an early and seemingly unlikely victory by Mexican forces over invading French forces in the Battle of Puebla on 5 May 1862.Mexican food is a riot of colours and spices, sauces and cerveza (beer), and, for us, sometimes Spanglish. When laid out, it is often red, white and green (colours of the Mexican flag) – most reflected in the tri-federation of salsa, tortillas and guacamole.________________________________________________________________________________MEXICAN FOODS 101:Burrito = a tortilla with various fillings, shaped into a tightly enclosed roll\nCeviche = raw fish dish, marinated in lime or lemon juices\nChimichanga = deep-fried burrito\nCilantro = coriander or Chinese parsley\nEnchilada = tortilla wraps rolled around various fillings\nFajita = any kind of grilled meat wrapped in a soft taco or tortilla\nMole = a thick, savoury sauce made from many ingredients including chillies, chocolate and herbs\nTaco = tortilla folded in half to hold various fillings, and eaten by hand\nTortilla = thin Mexican flatbread made from finely ground flour or corn___________________________________________________________________________________\xa0“Singaporeans might be some of the best-travelled people in the world. Do they enjoy Mexican food? You bet they do!” enthuses Francisco Belmonte, who has seen the scene evolve from 2001, when he first arrived.Belmonte’s played a big hand too, setting up the first fresh tortilla facility in 2002, supplying both businesses and homes through his shop, Belmonte Latin Foods (see below). It’s to his benefit, really: “In 2002, one could only dream about having a chile relleno (stuffed poblano pepper) or a nopales (cactus) salad. Now, you are spoilt for choice,” grins the man who is happily married to a Singaporean who, by his admission, makes great tamales (steamed dough and meat parcels).\xa0El Patio \nFor enchiladas \nThe former El Felipe’s Cantina was set up in 1985, but morphed into El Patio in 1999, when it changed owners. Not much has been disturbed, however, from the menu to the iconic Holland Village location, although a spiffy renovation in 2010 rebranded the place with clever modern imagery (like a cactus with spikes that spell out “el patio”). We like the enchiladas, another form of taco where the tortilla wraps are rolled around various fillings (from $14) such as beef with guajillo chile adobo (vinegar, garlic and chile marinade) or mushrooms and spinach, then topped for baking with sauce, cheese, onions and cilantro (coriander). A good-sized wine cellar and a tequila list of over 20 completes this casual jaunt into Mexico.\n34 Lorong Mambong | Tel: 64681520 | Opening hours: Mon 1-11pm, Tue-Fri 12noon-11pm, Sat & Sun 11am-11pm\xa0\xa0Margarita’s \nFor stuffed poblano chiles \nChef Andy Yap fell in love with Mexico from the very first trip, leading him to open Margarita’s at Faber Drive in 1987 to satisfy his craving for authentic Mexican regional cuisine. Today, the Dempsey outlet, with its stucco walls, handmade Mexican chairs and tables and hacienda-style décor makes even the Mexican ambassador feel at home. With that seal of approval, you’d understand why we think it’s almost the next best thing to being in Mexico. It helps that they serve what could truly be the smoothest margarita in Singapore. The chile en nogada ($28) is outstanding: a roasted poblano chile stuffed with veal and pork, smothered with creamy almond and walnut sauce, to which Yap adds his own twist of black beans. For dessert, leche frite (‘fried milk’, $12) is a painstakingly reduced milk pudding, not overly sweet, that simply glides its way down.\nAddress: #01-19, Block 11 Dempsey Road, and 3 other outlets | Tel: 64713228 | Opening hours: Tue-Sun 11am-3pm, 3-6pm (appetisers and desserts only), 6-10pm \xa0Cha Cha Cha\xa0\nFor king prawns stuffed with cheese, wrapped with bacon\nAs iconic as El Patio’s is its immediate neighbour, Cha Cha Cha. Founded in 1990 by a former partner at El Felipe’s Cantina, director Helen Koh pitched in for the cooking in the early days, but this feisty lady is now content to oversee front of house issues, including renovations in early 2013. The bright, clean lines keep it family-friendly, as do Tom & Jerry cartoons, which have been a signature from the first day. The very popular “culaicán” ($26) is king prawns stuffed with cheese and wrapped with bacon, served with tangy tomato-based Mexican-style rice. It’s an easy introduction to Mexican cuisine for most, before you really get into the variety of tacos and burritos.\nAddress: 32 Lorong Mambong | Tel: 64621650 | Opening hours: Daily 11am-11pm\xa0\xa0Café Iguana\nFor fajitas\nPart of the Brewerkz family, Café Iguana makes the case that Tex-Mex done right is delicious – and they’ve been doing it right since 2000. Marketing manager Margaret Marshall reminisces that while main ingredients were readily available, niche products such as tortilla presses, chiles and quality avocadoes took more planning; Iguana even innovated with dim sum steamers for tortilla warmers in the early stages. Check in by the Singapore river for icy cold, fruity margaritas and specially brewed Iguana lager to go with sizzling fajitas (from $25), with all the works – guacamole, sour cream, pico de gallo (fresh diced tomato and onion), onions and peppers. A basket of warm nacho chips and marvellously fresh and zingy salsa (free with any drinks order) is a nice touch.\nAddress: 30 Merchant Road, #01-03 Riverside Point | Tel: 62361275 | Mon-Thu 4pm-1am, Fri 4pm-3am, Sat noon-3am, Sun noon-1am\xa0\xa0Belmonte Latin Foods \nFor Mexican ingredients\nWe snuck Belmonte in, not just because they have ready-made pantry staples for delivery such as tortillas ($5.26 for 10), salsas ($4.21) and flans ($5.26), but also because Francisco Belmonte helped kickstart a tortilla revolution when he started the first facility to make fresh tortillas in 2002. This Mexican native is now the top importer of Mexican grocery shelf items and fresh produce, such as Hass avocados ($4 each) and tomatillos ($9.50, 500g). Belmonte notes that his biggest challenge is in high freight cost and erratic demand, but that Mexican foods are no longer alien to Asians.\nAddress: 2 outlets including #G5 Ridgewood Condo, 5 Ridgewood Close | Tel: 96529274 | Opening hours: Tue-Fri 5-8pm, Sat & Sun 11am-6pm\xa0\xa0Hungry Chico’s\xa0\nFor corn chips with homemade sauces\nChef T P Huang started Hungry Chico’s in 2008 after 20-something years at Chico’s & Charlie’s (1979-2001). This delivery and takeout outfit counts its baked fish fillet ($10) as the signature, after years of rave reviews from customers. This is also its most expensive item, with quesadillas from $6 and crispy shell tacos from $3.50. We tucked into chef’s freshly-made salsa ($7.50 for 500g) and rich cheese dip ($9 for 500g), alongside Mission brand yellow corn chips ($9, 500g) – good ol’ TV snacking staples that hit the spot. Stay tuned for the review of the baked fish.\nHungry Chico’s | Tel: 61008226 | Email:\xa0chef@hungrychico.com\xa0\xa0Viva Mexico \nFor Mexican food sampler \nA two-piece band plays Mexican music, including some mariachi (on Thursdays to Saturdays), adding to the lively taberna feel at this tourist stretch at Orchard Road. Don’t dismiss it as another Tex-Mex joint; Viva Mexico makes the effort to go regional with a wide range of food and tequila, since 2009. Get an introduction with the Viva Sampler ($28), a rare combination platter that gives you petite portions of tamales, adobo beef ribs, fish ceviche and crab nuggets. The tamales are wrapped in banana leaf instead of corn husks – to keep fresh better – and gives good bite; the adobo beef ribs are addictively tangy. You can’t go wrong if you make this your first foray into Mexican, though the premises could do with a bit of sprucing up.\nAddress: 23 Cuppage Road, Cuppage Terrace | Tel: 62350440 | Opening hours: Daily noon-2.30pm, 6-11pm\xa0\xa0CRITIC’S PICK \xa0Señor Taco\nFor tacos and Mexican hanger steak\nFounder Alejandro Blanco reckons it’s the spicy salsas, and 15 different kinds of air-flown chiles, that has endeared Senor Taco with Singaporeans since 2009. They even produce corn and flour tortillas ($4.50 for 10) that you can order from their La Mexicana factory, made fresh everyday. With four outlets, it’s a fair bet that this taqueria (taco shop) concept has evolved to full restaurant status, with an extensive sharing menu that includes the massive arrachera del patron ($44.90 for 500g). Served on a hot plate, this typically Mexican hanger steak is perfectly grilled, sliced and served with onions, baby potatoes, jalapeño and cheese quesadilla, to be eaten with warm toasty tortillas and Pacifico beer, exclusive to Señor Taco. There are five Mexicans here to welcome you warmly, including Chef Mario Galan, formerly from Casa Latina.\nAddress: 4 outlets including #01-18/19/20 Chijmes, 30 Victoria Street | Tel: 63371377 | Opening hours: Sun-Thu 6pm-midnight, Fri-Sat 6pm-2am\xa0\xa0Muchos Mexican Bar & Restaurant \nFor burritos\nThe slightly grubby décor (probably the scene of many a tequila party) won’t win any kudos, but think of Muchos as a casual, fun friend that you\xa0\xa0 can visit anytime for hearty, classic Mexican dishes. This Katrina Holdings (the company behind Balithai, Hutong and Bayang) mid-range outlet opened in 2010 and has two outlets: the Clarke Quay one is well received by expatriates and tourists, while the younger outlet at Plaza Singapura has more street food selections. Our hunger pang pick is the burrito, filled with a choice of hot grilled chicken ($18.90), vegetables ($16.90) or beef ($21.90), and accompanied by a delish mango-tomato salsa and chunky fresh guacamole.\nAddress: Block 3D River Valley Road, #01-04 Clarke Quay and 68 Orchard Road, #01-34 Plaza Singapura | Tel: 63384748 and 63386001 | Opening hours: Sun-Thu noon-midnight, Fri & Sat midnight-1am and Sun-Thu 11am-11pm, Fri & Sat 11am-1am\xa0\xa0CRITIC’S PICK Casa Latina\xa0\nFor chile-and-chocolate sauce\nThis Mexican restaurant was conceived almost by default, confesses Shandre Krishnan, who co-owns it with brother Bala. Exposure to Mexican restaurants in the US and Canada led them to open Casa Latina in 2010 with former chef Mario Galan at the helm, confidently introducing the taste of mole poblano (chile and chocolate sauce) and queso fresco (crumbled, light fresh cheese). Their Waterloo Street outlet is currently closed for renovations, but they have sprouted a new branch at the Albert Court Hotel. We do hope the renovated colonial bungalow on Waterloo retains the homey furnishings and paintings by the Mexican ambassador’s wife. Try the pollo divorciado (‘divorced chicken’, $32), so-called because of its two sauces – the mole and the pipian verde (creamy tomatillo with pumpkin seed) – takes you far from the usual tourist tacos and burritos, and into the kitchen of a real abuela (grandmother).\nAddress: 42 Waterloo Street and 01-09 Village Hotel Albert Court, 180 Albert Street | Tel: 68846929 | Opening hours: Daily noon-3pm; 6pm-midnightAuthor© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/gordon-ramsay-bread-street-kitchen/:['The position of intern at Gordon Ramsay’s Bread Street Kitchen has been filled.Twenty-one-year-old Koh Han Jie of Institute of Technical Education (ITE) College West beat three other contenders at a cook-off held on 22 September, at Marina Bay Sands, for the six-month-long position.Koh, a first-year culinary student undertaking a Diploma in Culinary Arts and Restaurant Management from the Institut of Paul Bocuse, beat three other contenders for the prized position in Gordon Ramsay’s soon to open restaurant, Bread Street Kitchen.The ten-minute cooking challenge was issued and judged by Ramsay and the president and chief executive officer of Marina Bay Sands, George Tanasijevich.The four candidates had to create three dishes using a mystery single ingredient. The ingredient, revealed at the start of the cooking challenge, was eggs.\xa0In the video below, Ramsay specifies how the eggs should be cooked.\xa0Koh won with\xa0his butter-brushed omelette. The rest of the candidates present were from\xa0The Singapore Hotel and Tourism Education Centre (SHATEC), At-Sunrice Global Chef Academy, and the Culinary\xa0Institute of America (CIA).About why he is picking an intern from the local culinary schools, Ramsay said, “We’re starting with the foundation –\xa0to bring in local colleges and to have a look at local talent and more importantly start to look at the collaboration on where we’re going.”A seasoned mentor from his work with ‘Hell’s Kitchen’ and ‘Masterchef’, Ramsay is not newbie at dealing with interns. On how interns should approach working with him, Ramsay gave this piece of advice: “Copy now and follow the exact instructions. As you get older, get rid of me and put more of you on the plate. Let that evolve.”Marina Bay Sands has recruited over 300 local interns over the last four-and-the-half-years for their food and beverage training and mentorship programme. \xa0\xa0BREAD STREET KITCHEN, SINGAPOREBread Street Kitchen is scheduled to open at Marina Bay Sands in April or May 2015, Ramsay confirmed the date at a press conference before the challenge.The Singapore outlet of the three-Michelin-star restaurant’s menu will be slightly different from the flagship in London’s.“As my first restaurant in Singapore, it’s not going to be serious expensive, and clearly it’s not going to be cheap, but it is going to good value for money.”“We will adapt and transform the Bread Street Kitchen London’s British-European menu into the Singapore style blend,” said Ramsay. “That process started three months ago –\xa0we’re looking at localising dishes from London.”Menu prices for Bread Street Kitchen Singapore are still being worked out. “As my first restaurant in Singapore, it’s not going to be serious expensive, and clearly it’s not going to be cheap, but it is going to good value for money.”When asked about his Singapore team, he said, “It’ll be nice to have two or three members of our team in Singapore spend time in London prior to opening, so we’ll get the right synergy.”Posed with questions about the competition and challenges of opening in Singapore, the chef who was also in town for the Formula One Singapore Grand Prix said: “Marina Bay Sands has been brilliant at looking at what type of restaurants they haven’t got. Bread Street Kitchen is something that is not here already. I like that bit of ‘cool Brittania’ style that’s coming in. Like I said, I may be late, but we know it’s not how you start, but how you finish.”\xa0The chef who won his chilli crab dish segment at HungryGoWhere-led Hawker Heroes challenge in 2013, tells us more about what to expect at Bread Street Kitchen Singapore in the video below:Ramsay first fell in love with “Singapore’s culture of good food, great service and most amazing surroundings” when he first did a cookery and demonstration with Alain Ducasse for a group of 25 housewives at Raffles Hotel in 1998.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/singapore-noodles/:['The quickest way to get into an argument about food with a Singaporean is to insist on the existence of Singapore noodles. While the dish can be found on Asian restaurant menus all over the world, there is no such thing on this food-loving island. And insisting that it’s an actual dish will only raise the ire of gastronomically proud natives.“What is it? Bee hoon (rice vermicelli) fried with curry powder?” scoffed one incredulous Singaporean gourmet when I mention the dish. “Who even makes that in Singapore? No one would eat it!”Yet apparently, lots of people do. In western parts of the world, especially the US and UK, Singapore noodles is typically fried rice vermicelli flavoured with curry powder. It could contain anything from sliced red and green peppers and carrots, to chicken, beef, bok choy and char siu.\xa0British food companies like Waitrose and Marks & Spencer even sell frozen versions of the dish.Our Malaysian neighbours have a rendition of it too, but instead of using curry powder, they typically do it with soy and chilli sauce, and sometimes Worchestershire sauce and ketchup.Who invented Singapore noodles? No one knows. The popular opinion is that it originated in Chinese-American restaurants in Europe and the US in the early 1980s.Perhaps it was called Singapore noodles because it sounded exotic. ‘Fried curry noodles’ just doesn’t have the same ring. Or perhaps its name is a nod to the curry powder itself. Curry spices, after all, were traded in Singapore, along the passage between India and China back in the day — although that theory seems a hyper-philosophical stretch. Or perhaps its creator simply wanted to replicate a taste that he or she experienced in Singapore.Ever the voice of reason, esteemed Singaporean food writer and cookbook author Christopher Tan opines that “it’s just a creative misreading of local flavours”. “It’s not a million miles away from our Indian-Muslim beehoon goreng,” he says. “If you think about it — similar basic concept, if very different execution.”Tan has a point. In fact, take out the curry powder and Singapore noodles is not a very different dish from, say, Heng Hwa beehoon or the xin po mi fen sold at zi char stalls all over the island. Indeed, just about every Singaporean — regardless of race — has our own authentic version of fried beehoon made by our mothers, grandmothers, uncles or fathers. So if Singaporeans are going to agree on what Singapore noodles should be, then it may well be the fried beehoon that we each grew up on — that quintessential comfort food be it home made or dished out from a warmed tray or blackened wok at the hawker centre.The recipe that follows then is my Peranakan mother’s soul-satisfying fried beehoon with udang kering (dried shrimp). This is my personal rendition of Singapore noodles — a true and comforting taste of home. What’s yours? Passion (and gluttony) for good food led Annette Tan to pursue a career that marries her talent for writing with her love for beautiful plates. Food writer, stylist and instructor, Tan contributes recipes and images to magazines like Appetite (Singapore) and BBC Good Food (Asian Edition), and is the restaurant reviewer for Today newspaper. Also the editor of The Miele Guide, she somehow manages to find time to feed her family and friends often.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/prince-coffee-house/:['Rating: 4 out of 5Prince Coffee House was so named because it was first established at Shaw House along Beach Road where the old Prince Cinema was located. After 13 years at Shaw House, the Coffee House relocated to Coronation Plaza, where they remained for 21 years.Then their lease at Coronation Plaza expired, and they thought that it might be a good time to call it a day. Luckily for all of us, a young investor came along who was willing to continue supporting the restaurant. With that they relocated to Beach Road, a stone’s throw away from Prince Cinema where it all began!The wonderful thing about Prince Coffee House is a lot of the cutlery and furniture from their old restaurant remain. The table mats are still very much the same ones that they have been using since their days in Shaw House. And the food of course hasn’t changed. If you are hankering for good old oxtail stew, pork chops and steak served on ox-shaped hotplates, then head here.\xa0I am glad to report that the beef hor fun is still good. The old Hainanese chef, who started cooking at Jack’s Place in the ’60s before coming out to open Prince Coffee House with his partners, is still very much in charge. The beef is tender and the sauce very much what I remembered it to be. And the smokey, metallic wok hei flavour of the rice noodles is simply irresistible! Still one the best plates of beef hor fun you can find in Singapore!\xa0Corn beef — a food we used to see on our plates all the time — is still served at Prince, with long beans. I was told by the boss that they have a special way of preparing it here that cannot be replicated at home. And he was not kidding! This dish was awesomely simple and simply awesome! I would be quite happy to eat this with a bowl of rice!Another piece of good news is that the set lunches at Prince do not seem to have kept pace with inflation. From Monday to Friday, set lunches are only $8.80! For that you get a soup, usual favourites like fish and chips or chicken chop, followed by coffee and a slice of apple pie (or something else)! If you want steak, it’s $13.80 which is essentially hawker stall prices. And the pork chops are served with their signature sauces that have not changed one bit.Fans will know that not every visit to Prince is a sit down occasion. Many people flock there to buy their ever popular takeaway dishes, such as yam cake. The quality of the chunky cut yam and Chinese sausage is unmistakeable. Simply bring it home, pan fry it and eat with chilli and a bit of kecap manis!And, finally, the most iconic takeaway from Prince, the old fashioned chicken pie, chunky and with a sauce reminiscent of Campbell’s cream of chicken soup. If you sit by the door, you will see everyone from students to drivers in sports cars pulling up to haul away boxes of this traditional Hainanse coffee house fare!Places like Prince Coffee House are living culinary museums. In a time when most cafés are trying to recreate a retro look by buying up antiques from across the causeway, Prince has their own set of antique cutlery which is still being used to serve customers. So when you eat your beef hor fun or chicken chop, just remember that the plate you are eating from has been in service for more than 30 years!\xa0In-depth ratings:\xa0Food: 4.5/5\nService: 4/5\nValue: 4/5Prince Coffee House | Address: 249 Beach Road (opp Park Royal) | Tel: 6468 2088 ?Opening hours: Daily 11am–9pm\xa0Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/potato-chips/:['This week, we pay homage to the mighty potato chip. Despite its undesirable tag as “junk food”, everyone seems to love it anyway. And of course, any self-respecting couch potato would have at least a bag or two stashed away in the larder.Here at inSing.com, we take our potato chips very seriously. So, we chomped our way through more than 10 different brands to find out which one is most deserving of your precious calories.\xa0Red Rock Deli–Sea SaltAvailable at Candy Empire and selected Cold Storage outletsPrice: $4.60 (90g)Product of: AustraliaRating: 5/5Our top recommendation hails from Down Under. Each slice was a golden-blond, thick-cut specimen full of wholesome flavour. The chips tasted very fresh, with hardly any trace of oil. They packed a powerful crunch, too.They also possessed a subtle earthy sweetness brought out by light dusting of sea salt. These Aussie chips seriously rock!\xa0Kettle Brand Potato Chips–Sea SaltAvailable at major supermarkets\xa0Price: $4.50 (142g)Product of: USARating: 4.5/5Having tested various brands of kettle-style chips, this emerged as our favourite choice. Compared to regular chips, kettle-cooked chips are thicker and have more bite. They also tend to feel greasier as they’re fried in low-temperature oil.Despite that, we found Kettle Brand’s potato chips to be the least oily compared to the other brands we tried. They were full of jaw-breaking crunch, as well as a deep earthy flavour. Some of us thought the chips were a tad dense. But we all agreed that the salt level was just right.\xa0Jim Beam Kentucky Straight Cuts–Southern salt with a hint of pepperAvailable at Candy EmpirePrice: $4.80 (100g)Product of: AustraliaRating: 4.5/5Teetotalers, fret not. There is no booze in these chips. There’s just loads of natural potato flavour in these airy but superbly crunchy crisps.Perked up with a smattering of black pepper, these straight cuts are clearly made for grown-ups. Although there was a hint of artificial seasoning, most of our tasters liked its great texture and seductive flavor.\xa0Marks & Spencer–lightly sea salted potato crispsAvailable at Marks & Spencer outlets\xa0Price: $4.50 (150g)Product of: DenmarkRating: 4/5The thickness of these chips was perfect–thin enough to be light, but thick enough to provide a solid crunch. They tasted fresh, with an appealing deep golden-brown hue. But it was a pity that their natural spud flavour was overwhelmed by an overly generous dosage of salt. Strictly for salt junkies.\xa0Tai Sun Potato Chips–lightly saltedAvailable at major supermarkets\xa0Price: $1.25 (80g)Product of: MalaysiaRating: 3.5/5\xa0As we ripped open the bag, a lovely aroma of fried spud wafted from within. They tasted as appetising as they looked. Although very thin, they had sufficient crunch. The low sodium is great for those who prefer less salt. Too bad these easy-to-like chips were marred by mild greasiness.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

According to the stall owners, it’s because the gold leaf and silver leaf are made of real gold and silver respectively, and are hence very expensive.In fact, the gold leaf is made with 24-carat gold.That said, the gold and silver sheets/leaves are purely ornamental; they are flavourless, and since the sheets are so thin, do not add any texture to the ice cream. But they certain make the whole ice cream look more\xa0atas and luxurious.And they’re also 100% safe to eat, since they are biologically inert and are simply passed out from the body.We prefer the sea salt caramel ice cream over the purple potato ice cream — it had a delicate salty-sweet flavour that was satisfying but not overly heavy.When we first visited Small Potatoes Ice Creamery last year, we felt that their Purple Potato Ice Cream had a slightly too pronounced potato taste, which may put some off. They’ve since switched the purple potatoes they use for the ice cream, and the potato flavour is more subtle now.Overall, we think Small Potatoes Ice Creamery’s soft serve ice cream is one of the better ones we’ve had, especially their sea salt caramel. But paying a premium for a jazzed-up look to the ice cream? We say it’s okay to do it just once for the novelty factor, but beyond that, we’d rather stick to the original flavours.\xa0The Sea Salt Caramel with Gold Leaf and Purple Potato with Silver Leaf are available at Small Potato Ice Creamery’s Square2 and 313@Somerset outlets.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

It was only towards the end of the series that you see more of my personality coming through.”\xa0Besides the series, the 52-year-old is also working on several other projects. He is putting together a new cookbook as well as an encyclopedia on Malay cooking. There’s also the Chef Wan travel club where his fans will get to go on overseas food adventures with him. This is being made into a reality series. He’s developing a range of kitchen products as well. If these weren’t enough, he also updates his Facebook page regularly to keep in touch with fans.Despite embracing new media, Chef Wan is a traditionalist when it comes to cooking. In fact, he got quite upset when we asked him if there was such a thing as modern Malay food. “There’s nothing modern about Malay cooking and I don’t believe in it. In KL some chefs are serving Malay nouvelle food. They put a small piece of fish with three drops of assam pedas sauce and charge you $45 for it. That’s ridiculous!”Before we ended our interview, we asked the chef how he juggles so many projects and manages to stay energetic at the same time. To that, he replied, “When you are passionate about what you do, you find the energy to keep going.” We couldn’t agree more.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/ah-hua-teochew-fishball-noodle/:['This fishball noodle stall — located in the west side of Singapore in Pandan Gardens — garnered a lot of media attention this year because they do a good fishball noodles using their fishballs which are handmade at their stall everyday.While handmade fishballs are not exactly uncommon in Singapore (but it is getting rarer), this stall goes the extra distance by hand-making their other fish paste items of flat fish rulers and fish veg rolls as well.Hand-making such items is almost unheard of when it comes to handmade fishball noodle stalls in Singapore.\xa0Started by Lim Jian Hua, now 61, the recipe for the fishballs, fish paste items and the noodles comes from his father.Lim started working at his father’s noodle factory in his teens before switching over to making fishballs when the factory closed down.\nHe stayed in the business for 23 years, running five fishball noodle stalls and a fishball factory at the height of his success.Due to the last economic downturn, the business had to be paired down to make ends meet and now his stall at Pandan Gardens — which was started in 2015 — is the only one left.He now runs the stall with his 30-year-old daughter, Jean, who quit her full-time admin job to do marketing and front-of-house.\xa0When it comes to handmade fishballs, Ah Hua’s version is as good as it gets — it’s made the previous evening for the next day’s business and is made by Lim himself using 100 per cent yellowtail fish.It comes nicely salted with a juicy, soft firmness and he makes two varieties — plain salted and one mixed with flecks of tee po (dried sole fish) to give it a little bit more savoury punch.\xa0Like all fishball noodle stalls, Ah Hua’s fishballs can be had with any sort of noodles either dry or with soup but the dry version ($3/4/5) is arguably the bigger highlight as it is dressed in a captivating sauce that has a very gritty, earthy chilli sambal flavour and nice liberal lard notes.There is a less-is-more approach with very little sweetness or sour vinegar notes, which is very refreshing for a fishball noodle dish.\nThat said, the dressing can come a little light in the salt department sometimes but when eaten with the generously salted fishballs, it balances right out.\xa0The other must-try dish is their Signature (as it is written on their signboard; $5) which is bee tai mak (rat’s tails, rice noodles) dressed in a simple sauce of lard, possibly onion oil, tang chai (preserved cabbage) and fish sauce.Here is where they serve their handmade fish paste items of flat fish rulers and fish veg rolls which is incredibly rare these days.Almost no fishball noodle stall we know of hand-makes them anymore, only here.As a side note, if a fishball noodle stall does go the handmade route, they normally concentrate their efforts on making the more popular fishballs and/or he giao (fish dumplings) instead of these other fish paste items.\xa0The resultant flavour is pretty amazing — juicy, springy fish paste — plain and shaped flat — or wrapped in a roll with carrot sticks and chinese parsley stems. It’s like the frozen variety you get from the supermarket or at cheap steamboat places but ten times nicer.\nThe overall flavour of the dish is interesting, a bit delicate but in a good way — it allows the flavour of the ingredients (fish paste items, minced pork and bean sprouts) to shine through.If you ask them for chilli, they will serve you only sliced chilli padi and insist on no added soy sauce as they feel it ruins the delicate flavour combination of the dish.They used to add he giao into the dish but it seems to have been phased out in recent months. A pity.If you have stomach for only one dish, make it this one. It’s worth coming halfway across the country for this.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/original-cake/:['ANOTHER castella cake store?\xa0was what went through our mind when we caught wind of Taiwanese castella cake chain Original Cake opening its first outlet here in Westgate in Jurong.Pardon our exhaustion, but in this year alone, four castella cake franchises have already opened in Singapore.Yet Original Cake is not just any other ordinary castella cake bakery.\xa0They opened in 2011 in the Tamsui district of Taiwan, and claim to be the first bakery specialising in the confection.On its opening day on 23 September, queues started as early as 5.45am — not surprising, since the chain announced that it would give away 800 free original-flavour cakes on that day.Original Cake joins the ranks of similar shops such as Le Castella in Tampines One and Ah Mah Homemade cake, which has stores in Bukit Panjang Plaza and Vivo City, in fueling the craze for castella cake. They do not take orders for now, but there is barely any additional waiting time once you get to the front of the queue.\xa0I visited the shop after lunch on a Wednesday afternoon, and could smell the aroma of the baking cakes from a couple of shops away. The queue wasn’t as long as I expected, with just 17 people (yes I counted!) in front of me. Each block of cake is good for up to eight people, and the freshly baked cakes are usually meticulously sliced and packaged in front of eager customers.The cakes came piping hot, and I was advised to let the cakes cool down before closing the box lids, to prevent the cakes from turning soggy. What surprised me was how long they could stay warm for, outlasting the 35-minute train ride back. The cakes also keep for up to 3 days from the night of purchase, if you store them in the fridge.We finally got to tasting the incredibly fluffy cakes, which came in three flavours. For those who love their eggs, the Original Cake($11.50), is best. You can smell the eggy fragrance even from a distance, and once you put the cake into your mouth, the flavour just hits you.The Golden Cheese($13.50) flavour is pretty unique, and the sight of the cheddar cheese oozing out of the cake center is enough to make your stomach grumble. The cheese also adds a savoury kick to the mildly sweet sponge, without being overly heavy on the palate.The Frozen Chocolate Cake, which is the most expensive of the three at $16.50, seemed less popular as compared to the other two. It was also my least favourite, because I felt like the Hershey chocolate chips just didn’t meld as well with the chocolate sponge. It was also pretty dense, and I couldn’t stomach more than two slices of it without feeling full.Overall, the cakes tasted better than I thought they would, and the light, fluffy texture of the cakes held up even after being placed in the air-conditioned office. If you’re in the area, the store is worth checking out if you have time to spare, but I wouldn’t wait more than an hour for it.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/murukku/:['When you think of Deepavali treats, one of the first things that come to mind is murukku. In the past, making murukku was a labourious task. The rice and black gram had to first be washed, dried in the sun, dry roasted and then sent to the grinding shops to be processed into flour.These days however, many brands of pre-mixed flour are available so there’s no need to go through all that trouble. By mixing some additional ingredients and spices to the pre-mix, you can serve up murukku as tasty as those made from scratch. Try this easy recipe the next time you have friends over for a party – it goes well with beer too.Makes: 30Ingredients:\n1 packet Alagappa’s murukku flour – sifted\n¼ teaspoon perungayam (asafoetida) powder\n1½ tablespoons white sesame seeds\n¾ tablespoon omam (carom seeds) – grinded or pounded and sifted\n1 tablespoon unsalted butter – softened\n2 ½ cups water\nOil for deep frying\xa0\xa0Method:Step 1: In a large bowl, mix all the dry ingredients together with a whisk. Add butter and mix together.\xa0Step 2: Next add in the water, a half cup at a time, and knead the flour to form dough mixture.\xa0Step 3: At this stage the dough will be quite soft and sticky. To prevent the dough from sticking to you, coat your hands with a thin layer of oil or water.Step 4: Fill the murukku mould with the dough and secure the cover. You’ll want to form the murukkus before dropping them into the hot oil.Brush the back of a large flat ladle with oil. Position the murukku mould above the ladle and turn the handle with your right hand to squeeze out the dough while guiding the mould with your left to make three medium circlesStep 6: Turn the ladle over and gently drop the murukku into the hot oil. Fry till golden brown.\xa0Step 7: Once the murukku cools, store in an air-tight container.\xa0* The spices used in this recipe area available in Mustafa Centre and most Indian grocery shops.\xa0\xa0Tips:\n1. Dough consistency: \n Dough is dry and cracked. There is too little water in your dough, and this makes it difficult to turn the handle of the mould. The texture of the fried murukku will also be hard. To remedy this, add a tablespoon of water at a time till you get the right consistency.Dough is too mushy and breaks easily. This means you have too much water in your dough, as the strands of dough break easily as you’re turning the handle of the mould. Add a bit of flour at a time and try again.2. Murukku mould: This usually comes in two varieties. One type requires you to push the dough out by the pressing on the handles, while the mould that you see in the pictures above has a handle that you turn. The latter requires less strength and is easier to use. The moulds may come with metal plates that have different patterns on them. Use the plate with three holes for this recipe. Murukku moulds are available at Mustafa Centre. Prices vary from $15 to $25.\n3. Variations: You can substitute the spices in this recipe with others such as cumin and coriander. For a murukku with a kick, try adding chilli powder or cracked black pepper.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/500-calorie-meals/:['When we are all busy with work and seeing to the needs of our family, the first thing to fall off our list is our commitment to a healthy diet. It is always tempting to be careless about the way we eat for the sake of convenience.Thankfully, with some know-how and simple changes, a healthier and lower-calorie diet will be within your reach. Check out the latest campaign by the Health Promotion Board (HPB)\xa0and its Healthier Dining Programme, which promotes 500-calorie dishes that take the guesswork out of portions and include more vegetables, wholegrains and leaner cuts of meat.Here are some meals prepared by just two of the board’s partners. Though vastly different in who they serve, these two caterers unite under the same vision of dishing out healthier wholesome food. The Wok People operates only in office canteens, to provide employees with the wholesome fuel they very well deserve.It is a one-stop solution for cafeteria management, it hires skilled chefs who plan the menus for cafeterias and maintains a lively variety to sidestep customer food fatigue. It made sense to them to join the Healthier Dining Programme because the head chef is more than capable of rejigging his menus to suit a healthy regimen.Preparazzi, on the other hand, is ever-ready to feed its client’s guests at gatherings with nutritious food. A popular upmarket caterer, it is known for the quality of its catered dishes which are prepared to the standards of fine-dining restaurants. The ready-to-eat meals are delivered to doorsteps in smart black bentos. All you need to do is to re-plate and serve the food in the comforts of your own home.\xa01. Hawker delights – Minced meat noodles\nOne of the healthy 500-calorie dishes is bak chor mee\xa0(minced pork noodles). The chef at The Wok People uses leaner meat cuts, eliminates the lard, and adds in more vegetables in this healthier version. In his hands, the dish transformed into something light and nutritious, but still tasty and filling. Keep a lookout for HPB’s partnering food vendors at your workplace or your company’s cafeteria that serve some of your favourite local dishes in healthier portions with better, healthier ingredients.\xa02. Meat options – Chicken breast\nFor meat-eaters, opting for leaner cuts helps you to manage your intake. At one of the cafeterias run by The Wok People, it serves up a grilled chicken breast meal — perfectly grilled chicken breasts with all the juicy goodness paired with nutty brown rice and a salad. It is a popular choice for its generous serving, and still checks in at the requisite 500 calories. The choice of brown rice over white rice makes a significant difference because the wholegrains give the body a steady release of energy throughout the day. This meal is good for those with hearty appetites who like to feel satiated, but with the bonus of healthier eating.The Wok People | Address: 315 Alexandra Road #05-01A, Sime Darby Business Centre Singapore 159944 | Tel: 67782810 | E-mail: enquiry@thewokpeople.com\xa0\xa0One whiff of this dish above and you will immediately be enticed by the aroma of truffles in the baked truffle chicken crafted by Preparazzi.

Healthier oils, such as olive oil, have a higher unsaturated fat content compared to other oils and fat.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/nam-wah-chong/:['According to the boss of\xa0Nam Wah Chong, possibly one of the oldest sellers of\xa0fish head steamboat in Singapore, it was his paternal grandfather who started selling fish head steamboat back in 1927 at Merchant Road.Some foodies have made claims that it was his grandfather who brought the dish over from Swatow. This nugget of information remains unclear, but his grandson did mention that fish soup served in a steamboat was not widely available the last time he visited Swatow.The history of fish head steamboat is a varied one. While it is common these days to use pomfret or groupa, in the old days it was song fish (Asian carp) and specifically, the head of the song fish used — hence it name.Song fish was chosen because its head is quite big and has all the mushy, fiddly bits that are nice to nibble one. As a freshwater fish, it can taste a little muddy at times, but the old people love it. The younger generation however prefer to eat fish meat, and thus pomfret and groupa are used even if the pomfret head is too small.Know that if you plan on having a meal at Nam Wah Chang, be prepared to wait almost an hour, especially if you go on a weekend.Calling itself a steamboat corner is a massive understatement. The little corner has expanded to another shop space a few doors down and their steamboats line the back alleys and the roadsides. The boss let on that he was planning to expand to the second storey as well, if so, they might as well call themselves Fishhead Steamboat Central instead.The fish soup here is your classic Teochew fishsoup without the addition of milk. The sweetness comes from the fresh fish which they’ve sourced from the same supplier for the past 30 years.The shiokness comes from some serious ti poh (fried sole fish) which makes the soup wonderfully savoury. Overall, the soup is very cheng (clear) and tastes very much like an upgraded version of fish soup that doesn’t get served in a steamboat. My wife gave it two thumbs up.They also serve a few tze char dishes like ha cheong kai\xa0(prawn paste chicken) and pork ribs.

Translated as “yang zhi gan lu”, it means “sweet dew drops falling from a willow branch”.Its origins are disputed, as chefs of Chinese restaurants in both Hong Kong and Singapore have tried to lay claim to inventing this much-loved dessert.But what’s undisputed is how divinely refreshing a bowl of icy-cold mango sago is on a hot day! Imagine that celestial concoction—sweet, luscious mango and smooth sago pearls, contrasted with bursts of bittersweet pomelo—sliding down your parched throat.Are you drooling already? So where should you go if you want to do the tango with mango sago?

Large cubes of golden mango, sago pearls, and pomelo sacs seductively adorned a mound of shaved ice and mango puree. Creamy and silky, the mango puree was full of natural, wholesome goodness.To nitpick, they could have been more generous with the sago and pomelo sacs. That said, proportions and flavours were well balanced. On a couple of visits, the mango was slightly under-ripe. But, on the whole, they’ve been rather consistent.For offering the purest flavours and best value, Mei Heong Yuen is our favourite choice for mango sago.\xa0\xa0Ah Chew Desserts1 Liang Seah Street, #01-11 Liang Seah PlaceOpening hours: Mon-Thu: 12.30pm-11.30pm; Fri: 12.30pm-12.30am; Sat: 1.30pm-12.30am; Sun: 1.30pm-11.30pmPrice: $4.00Rating: 4/5Ah Chew’s version tasted more like a milky mango drink. The base seemed to be made from a blend of mango puree, milk and ice. Despite being more watery than we were used to, it was very likeable.The mango base had the right level of sweetness and possessed an alluring scent. Each bowl was topped with a generous amount of plump pomelo sacs. Beneath were neat cubes of intensely sweet, ripe mango. On separate visits, we found that they were able to maintain a consistent standard.It’d be great if they had added more sago. Also, instead of shaved ice, they used ice chips. This meant we had to spit them out or crunch on them. Either way, they didn’t complement the overall texture.\xa0Tong Shui Desserts101 Upper Cross Street, #02-49 People’s Park CentreOpening hours: Daily: 11am-8.30pmPrice: $3.50Rating: 3.5/5There was a very subtle hint of milk in Tong Shui Desserts’ mango sago. A splash of evaporated milk was added to the mango puree, which gave it a touch of smoothness, but did not make it creamy on the whole.We were also impressed with their heavy-handed use of mango cubes and sago pearls. The pomelo sacs were sufficiently plump and juicy, albeit rather bland. The mango could also have been sweeter and riper.Overall, Tong Shui Desserts’s mango sago was nicely executed and reasonably priced.\xa0\xa0\xa0Ji De Chi63 Jurong West Central 3 #03-102/03/04 (JP2), Jurong Point Shopping CentreOpening hours: Daily: 10.30am-10pm\xa0Price: $4.00Rating: 2.5/5Ji De Chi’s version appeared very similar to Mei Heong Yuen’s. But when we compared closely, it fell short of Mei Heong Yuen’s standard.While the mango puree had thick consistency, it tasted watered down. Also, there were fewer mango cubes and sago pearls. Both pomelo and mango had less-than-ideal quality.This was a most promising-looking dessert. Pity about the lack of flavours. If they had used better ingredients, this would have been excellent.\xa0\xa0\xa0Honeymoon Dessert1 Harbourfront Walk, #01-93 VivoCityOpening hours: Daily: 11.30am-10pmPrice: $5.50Rating: 1/5Honeymoon Dessert is a well-known dessert chain from Hong Kong. Their mango sago was made with coconut milk.Perhaps that’s how Hong Kongers like it, but we didn’t appreciate this particular style. They added a lot of coconut milk to the mango puree, to the point that it overwhelmed the mango flavour.As a result, the coconut milk also made the dessert too cloying for our liking.

From Malay epok epok to Chinese style curry puffs to those with baked puff pastry, this handy snack is devoured at all times of the day, even on the go!inSing.com embarks on the mission to find the holy grail of Chinese-style curry puff, characterised by a light and buttery crust filled with mildly spiced curried potato. The crust has to be thin and melt-in-the-mouth, the potatoes powdery soft, and the spice paste aromatic. Will we find our perfect puff?\xa0Tip Top Curry PuffOpening hours: Daily: 9am-9pm\nPrice: $1.10\nRating: 4.5/5Each puff was densely packed with a filling of neatly cubed potatoes that held their shape but disintegrate into powdery goodness upon bite. Using a special Indonesian recipe, the rempah (spice paste) was fragrant and the flavors were well-rounded, albeit on the sweet side. There’s a quartered egg and chicken pieces in the filling. Of all puffs in this roundup, this offered the best value for money.Although the crust felt a little dry, the good thing was it didn’t feel too rich, so you can easily wolf down at least two puffs at one time. Best of all, the puffs here tasted really fresh as they were made on the spot and fried in small batches. If not for the slightly thick and dry crust, Tip Top would be the perfect!\xa0\xa01A Crispy PuffsOpening hours: 8.30am-10pm\nPrice: $1.20\nRating: 4/51A Crispy Puffs can be recognised by their distinctive shell-shaped crusts. The flaky pastry separated into multiple layers result in a wonderfully crispy and light crust. Best of all, it didn’t feel greasy. We also liked the moist filling-the spice paste was very pleasing and there was no awful powdery taste. It’d be perfect if it was less salty. Tip: This curry puff is best enjoyed fresh as the crust does not reheat well.\xa0\xa0Tanglin Crispy Curry PuffOpening hours: Mon-Sat: 6am-4pm\nPrice: $1.20\nRating: 3.5/5Tanglin’s curry puff lives up to its name of being crispy. The layered, flaky crust was airy and thin, and crispy when hot. Those who prefer the flaky kind of pastry will like this. The curried potato filling was very substantial, and contained a quartered egg. We thought this had the potential to be a great curry puff, but it had its shortcomings. The nearly faultless crust was a little too greasy. As for the filling, the flavors were well balanced, but relied too much on curry powder instead of other spices for fragrance. Although it’s supposed to contain chicken, we could hardly find any of it in the filling.\xa0\xa0Katong Chicken Curry PuffsOpening hours: Tue-Sun: 8am-6.30pm\nPrice: $1.00\nRating: 3/5At $1.00, this is the cheapest puff in the roundup. Its budget price tag means the austere filling has no egg and only a couple of chicken dices. Some people might not take to the finely-cubed, almost mashed up potato filling, but we were strangely addicted to the molten consistency. Biting into the crispy crust with hot, lava-like curried potato spilling out was just irresistible. The crust felt solid, but tasted light and melt-in-the-mouth. The spice paste was aromatic, but would be better if spicier.\xa0\xa0Lagoon Chicken Curry PuffOpening hours: Daily: 12pm-9pm\nPrice: $1.20\nRating: 2/5We weren’t impressed by this curry puff at all. The dough-like crust was stodgy and lost its crispness quickly. Not only was it small in size, there was very little of the curried potato filling. Even though there’s a discernible amount of chicken dices, these were dry. The spice paste was the spiciest in this roundup, which might find favour with chilli lovers. However, the excessive use of curry powder was unpleasant. Not value for money at all.\xa0\xa0Old Chang KeePrice: $1.20\nRating: 2.5/5The good thing about Old Chang Kee’s curry puffs was that the crust stays crisp even when cold. It tasted buttery without being too flaky, but the dough felt too thick and heavy. The interior was tightly packed with curried potato, a quartered egg, and a couple of chicken pieces. The flavors of the filling were nicely balanced, but the spice paste wasn’t aromatic enough.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/sentosa/:['A good meal is one of the best ways to honour the most special lady in your life — your mum. On fun-filled Sentosa island, there is a plethora of restaurants that suits almost every kind of mum. From gourmet dining aficionados to calorie-watchers, from mothers who enjoy cocktails on a beach to those who have a taste for fine wine, there is something on the island for every mum. Go on, book her in for one of these treats.\xa0FOR BEACH-LOVING MUMLife is better at sea. Tanjong Beach Club has for years been a beach lover’s favourite food haunt and for good reason. You could begin the day by sipping cocktails with mum while perched on one of their comfy beachside daybeds, then retreat into their restaurant to tuck into some hearty eats. Their thick-cut truffle fries dusted with parmesan ($15) are among the best on the island, and their hearty lobster bun with avocado and a side of fries ($38) is a decadent sandwich that can easily be shared. End your meal with a walk along Sentosa’s pristine Tanjong beach.Occupying newer digs along Sentosa’s sun-kissed Siloso beach, Ola Beach Club is a Hawaiian-themed entertainment concept encompassing a restaurant and bar, as well as a water sports program (if mum is an adventure seeker, give these a try). Food-wise, you will find quintessentially Hawaiian-inspired dishes that exude flavours of the popular Pacific holiday destination. Their Ahi Poke Bowl ($20) is a hearty starter, though it can be a meal in itself, with wholesome choices of various tropical fruits, grains and other toppings and marinades. There is also the Saimin Salad ($15), a cold noodle salad featuring Japanese somen and fried fishcake. Wash it down with some of Ola’s tropical-inspired drinks, such as the Uliuli Tiki ($22), a gorgeous turquoise-hued drink made with Blue Curaçao liqueur, vodka, homemade vanilla passion fruit puree and coconut froth.FOR HEALTH-CONSCIOUS MUMSSentosa may be dedicated to fun and indulgence, but the island paradise boasts a number of restaurants that promise a delicious yet healthy meal. If your mum is a nutrition obsessive, these are our recommendations for you.\xa0Tangerine at ESPA in Resorts World Sentosa has a menu designed by acclaimed Thai chef Ian Kittichai. The flavours here are strong, thanks to the use of aromatic Thai herbs grown in their own little herb garden; the restaurant aims to promote holistic living, adopting a farm-to-table ethos and using good-for-you ingredients that rework classics into “spa cuisine”. We enjoyed the pretty, guilt-free plates and the fact that there is full transparency regarding nutritional information. Their dinner-only tasting menu ($98++, paired with herbal teas) is a worthy treat for mums. The best dishes are the punchy Asian bouillabaisse with Hokkaido scallops, sea bass and baby kailan; and the seared beef short ribs with a spiced quinoa salad, shimeji mushrooms and a green peppercorn jus.The Garden restaurant at Sofitel Singapore Sentosa’s So SPA is another top choice for its calorie-conscious fare, with a construct-your-own salad being their signature offering. Choose a base of greens and add on other items like vegetables, grains, legumes, fruits, nuts, cheese and proteins. There are premium ingredients such as Kalamata olives, alfalfa sprouts, endives, pine nuts, buffalo cheese, homemade smoked salmon and wasabi miso-glazed Chilean sea bass to make up your meal. The menu also caters to those who have dietary restrictions, with a range of gluten- and dairy-free, as well as low-salt and high-fibre dishes. Since both eateries are housed within spa environments, mum’s special day could also include a pre-meal massage.\xa0FOR VINO AND COCKTAIL-LOVING MUMSWhether your mum is a discerning wine drinker, or just someone who enjoys the occasional celebratory cocktail, W Singapore – Sentosa Cove’s WOOBAR has got her covered. First off, the vibe is upbeat and spunky and will put mum right in the mood to celebrate. Their exhaustive wine list has several varietals to choose from, and their list of cocktails range from the refreshing Saigon ‘75 ($22) where chilli-infused vodka is mixed with basil, ginger and citrus; to the quintessential Singapore Slingshot ($26) where you can sample WOOBAR’s very own house-brewed gin, with benedictine, grenadine, bitters, cherry popsicle and triple sec finished with pineapple juice.Want to drink with a view? Capella Singapore’s al fresco terrace venue, Bob’s Bar, is our pick. Mum will be torn between gazing out and admiring the South China Sea, taking selfies with the hotel’s resident peacocks, or sipping on one of their tropical cocktails. The Makuahine ($20), which means Mother in Hawaiian and pronounced as mah-koo-ah-hee-neh, is one of their special cocktails for Mother’s Day. They use a mix of top quality Navegante Capella Rum mixed with fresh lemon juice, Jagermeister, Ginger syrup and Peychaud’s Bitters. Cheers!\xa0\xa0FOR THE GOURMAND MUMSentosa has no dearth of restaurants that cater to the discerning palates of lovers of fine food.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/hao-yun-lai/:['Restaurant setting: Rendezvous Gallery is becoming quite the new dining spot with various restaurants and cafes opening here in recent months. Chinese herbal restaurant Hao Yun Lai is the latest to join the cluster and promises to stand out by offering something quite unique — a pre- and post-natal menu, on top of its regular menu.The interior of the restaurant though is nothing special, being a pleasant but standard Chinese restaurant. What will catch your eye though is the beautifully presented food by head chef Chai, who takes pains to ensure every grain, leaf or drizzle of sauce is in place and who uses unusual ingredients, like charcoal tofu and lily bulbs, that in themselves are visually interesting.What to eat: While the pregnancy and post-partum dishes are the specialty here, the dishes on the regular menu are well thought through too.Traditional Chinese Medicine principles are applied to dishes on both menus, and we’re told that every dish was put together in consultation with a Tradition Chinese Medicine physician. Chef Chai himself keeps a medicine cabinet full of herbs in carefully labelled drawers and jars. The medicinal properties and health benefits of each dish are also explained in detail in the menus, which are rather hefty as a result.\xa0We’d highly recommend their soups—boiled to infinity, they are thick with nutrients and goodness, and you feel healthy just drinking them.Try the double-boiled pigeon soup ($22.80) which is thought to be many times more fortifying than chicken soup, and whose health benefits span everything from regenerating Qi to promoting longevity. Also try the duck soup ($16.80) which is strong, potent—and delicious.For mains, the pan-fried cod with celery sauce ($12.80) is light and tasty, while the claypot chicken ($14.80) is interesting in that it uses chickens raised not on grain but on sakura blossoms. We’d definitely order the charcoal beancurd with bamboo fungus and pine mushrooms ($14.80), which is tofu made with, as its name implies, charcoal. Overlook the greyness of the tofu, and you have a lovely, smooth curd that is very nutritious too.If you want rice, the spinach fried rice with goose ($14.80) is fluffy, not at all greasy and is made with two types of grain—rice and amaranth—that make for an interesting mix of textures.To accompany your meal, choose one of their health juices that contain such a high concentration of nutrients they are like vitamin supplements, only better tasting. The grape with honey and ginger juice ($4.90) is very nice and easy to drink, while the purple cabbage juice ($4.90) tastes nicer than it sounds.\xa0Hao Yun Lai /Address: #02-01 Rendezvous Gallery, 9 Bras Basah Road / Tel: 63339846 / Opening hours: Daily 11am–3pm, 6–11pmAuthor© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/clarke-quay-top-73-1-handmade-fishball-noodles/:['Rating: 4/5 (for the fishballs); 3/5 for the noodlesTwo things will catch your eye at this stall. Firstly, the larger-than-ping-pong-ball sized fishballs. Secondly, the long signboard which says “Clarke Quay Top 73+1 Handmade Fishball Noodles”The stall has been around for more than 20 years. It was first opened by old Mr Tan at Clarke Quay near the historical ‘cha chun tau’ area, which means ‘jetty for boats carrying firewood’. It was where Mr Tan would sell Teochew-style fishballs to the firewood merchants and workers.It was named “73+1” because Mr Tan felt the name was catchy and it was something even illiterate workers could read.Although the business has been handed down to the second generation, the heritage and recipe are still being preserved. The current owner Tang Kwan Chye, known as “Ah Cai” to regulars, still believes in making the fishballs by hand in order to retain its freshness.When asked what the secret to his fishball was, he said it was a mixture of his father’s recipe and dedication to making the fishballs fresh on the spot. Indeed, when the fishballs were running out, Ah Cai promptly went to the kitchen and made a few hundred more fishballs on the spot in front of my very eyes.\xa01. The fish meat is placed in a huge container, stirred in one direction until it becomes this shiny and sticky white paste.2. Some of the fish meat is kneaded and ‘massaged’ until the paste becomes springier.3. A lump of the fish paste is squeezed out through the thumb and index fingers to form a round shape, and is further scooped out into a ball with a spoon.4. The fish balls are dropped into a container of slightly warm water.5. The fishballs are left to be soaked in the water for about an hour.6. The result: bouncy yellow-tail fishballs.\xa0While the meepok ($5.00) I had was rather ordinary, the huge fishballs were absolutely bouncy and springy. The soup, flavoured with lettuce and preserved cabbage, was the usual clear version which brought out the essence of the fresh yellow-tail fishballs.\xa0\nClarke Quay Top 73+1 Handmade Fishball NoodlesSingapore Food Trail30 Raffles Avenue, #01-09/12\nOpening hours: Sun-Thurs: 10.30am-10.30pm; Fri & Sat: 10.30am-11.30pmAuthor© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/chang-ji-gourmet/:['Out of all the stalls that open early in the morning for the breakfast crowd in Chinatown Complex, Chang Ji Gourmet is one of a handful that draw long queues.In business for about 50 years, the stall is now run by second-generation owners — two sisters and one brother, who are now in their 50s.\xa0They sell fried beehoon, fried yellow noodles, porridge and that’s it. You can’t buy any of the sides that one normally associates with economic beehoon like luncheon meat, fried eggs or fried fishcakeEach dish costs $1.20 but you’ll see many patrons order both a fried staple as well as a porridge for their breakfast. Longtime patrons will remember that they used to charge 50 cents a dish until the early 2000s which was when they upped their prices.\xa0There are other economic beehoon stalls which are open elsewhere in the food centre and they have the usual options but they have far less crowds, even though the price of the fried beehoon/noodles is the same.Once you taste the food at Chang Ji Gourmet, you’ll understand why.The stall has a stripped down, less-is-more philosophy when it comes to taste. And it’s a taste which is almost impossible to buy in any economic beehoon stall in Singapore.\xa0The fried beehoon ($1.20) is as simple as it gets. Fried with soy sauce, oil and some bean sprouts, it holds back on the dark soy sauce so that there is almost no sweetness in the taste.Sample fried beehoon from any typical economic beehoon stall in Singapore and you’ll find that the opposite is often true — there is either a lack of flavour or an over-sweetness in the flavour due to too much dark, sweet soy sauce added.\xa0The same is true of the fried yellow noodles ($1.20). Many patrons would opt for it as it has a richer egg noodle flavour but again the taste is stripped down — enough savouriness, fried richness, a bit of towgay and that’s it. The texture of the noodles is softer but still with a bit of bite.They will ask if you want chilli and again there is that less-is-more approach — with spiciness, a hint of sourness and absolutely no sweet or savoury notes. The chilli sauce just adds….chilli and that’s it.Contrast that to other chilli sauce offerings from other economic beehoon stalls. The flavour is usually power packed with a lot of oil and dried shrimp flavour or very very sweet, both of which will dominate the inherently basic fried staple taste.\xa0The Fish & Peanut Porridge ($1.20) is equally simple. A traditional Cantonese dish, it’s flavoured with just dried salted fish and peanuts and the taste has a very straightforward savouriness, with hints of oil-richness coming from the peanuts.It’s definitely different from how good Cantonese porridge is supposed to be — thick, creamy and rich. The porridge rice grains here are smooth but the consistency is more watery, with the salted fish bits and soft peanuts give the dish a nice texture.Observe some of the patrons and you’ll see them mixing fried beehoon with their porridge, which is why you’ll hear the nickname “shark’s fin porridge”. It has a similar look to the real thing and the fried beehoon gives the porridge more texture and adds oil-richness to the taste.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

Malik’s father later opened a stall at Adam Road Food Centre, where it still operates now.The current version of their nasi lemak has vastly evolved from the original: Selera Rasa’s coconut rice is famous for its use of basmati rice, a pricey ingredient-switch done for health reasons. Both of Abdul Malik’s parents were diabetic, and the basmati rice better suited to their diet since it has a low glycemic index. Abdul Malik also realised that the light, fluffy texture of this thin, long-grain rice gives the nasi lemak an exceptional texture. A long time was spent perfecting this recipe because basmati rice does not absorb coconut milk easily.The hard work has paid off: the rice with the alluring, lingering fragrance is airy, fluffy, moist, with a subtle scent of coconut milk and pandan.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/wedding-ang-pao/:['Dear Newly-weds,I was going to get you one of those rectangular metal contraptions with which when you depress a lever it turns your bread brown, or one of those cylindrical gadgets which fluffs rice grains. But the man in the shop shook his head – nobody gifts toasters and rice cookers, everybody wants money.\xa0So here is $88 instead – so you can choose what colour you want in frying pans, cutlery or Nespresso capsules.While there is no rule of thumb which can’t be bent when gifting money, I did consult some wedding flow chart about how much to give in wedding hongbaos (Mandarin for ‘red packets’): the range starts from $80 (venue: Changi Village Hotel) to $250 (venue: Capella, Sentosa). But here is what I think: family or friend, BFF or nodding acquaintance, rich or poor, Chinese, Eurasian, Indian or Malay – the dollar bills should not vary.I gift $88. No need to return me the eight dollars – 88 is a full-figured number, and in few of Chinese dialects their pronunciations allude to “prosper”. What more could a just-wed pair want?A heftier hongbao? Sorry lah, not anymore from me. I’ve done my sums:You see, as a senior singleton, I am a six-time loser in the cash gift stakes: there’s the bridal shower, then the wedding. Next the baby shower, then baby’s one-month. It’ll soon be the baby’s first birthday, and then a grandparent passes on (ok, choi!). Multiply this by the number of friends and colleagues, and one may have to take in the washing or apply for an overdraft.\xa0I thought you invited me to share in your joy, not in the cost of your nuptials. “It seems the flowers alone cost $20,000,” someone commented at a wedding I attended. No, the groom wasn’t marrying Elton John. A-choo! (Sorry it’s the pollen).Really, we’re all thrilled for you, but do we have to chip in for that Michelin-starred menu served at the St Regis ballroom (also $250 per hongbao) which was transformed into another Gardens by the Bay? Your Dior dress was beautiful, as the air-flown Michael Buble crooning the Hawaiian Wedding Song was charming. Not to be carping – we weren’t asked if we wanted the lilies or the geraniums.Certainly at weddings such as these, the couple and their families are not going to notice too much who gave how much, not when you can pick up such a fab tab. If you can afford to spare nothing to celebrate the big day, better donate the hongbaos to a deserving cause (which some have done).Young couples who have just collected the keys to their heartland estate flat could use some help in footing the wedding cost. In which case, you can’t go wrong with a minimum of $100 in the red packet. If you can, boost it to $120. Good friend – oh go on, give $150. Alternatively – just a suggestion – large groups of mates can share and spring for a set of designer chairs or aircon system or kitchen unit as wedding present.Wedding luncheons and tea receptions can be skimmed at $80 before you slink away. Try not to scoff $40 worth in sausage rolls and teh tarik (‘pulled’ milk tea) though.The choice of restaurant and hotel is the other guide: a five-star joint means the couple can afford it, are willing to go into hock for it, or are counting on guests’ generosity. The recommendation is still $120 to $150. If you can really toss back on the drinks, bump it up to $180.You don’t need to know the couple well to know if they need help with the final bill: observe, then, depending on your own budget, anything from $150 to $200 would be very decent. Unless they’ve told you they are going round the world on honeymoon – then, $88 should do the token trick. Let them pay for half of the dinner you’re eating, why not?Similarly, don’t feel the pressure to match bigger hong baos given by guests who attend wedding dinners at which families pay for everything – the kids get to keep all the hongbaos.As for the couple whose wedding I attended and have since divorced, any chance of getting half the money back?Good wishes,\nNearly Broke\xa0Sylvia Toh Paik Choo is not as crabby as she sounds; she only looks that way. She stands by her $88 hong baos because “it looks like two fat ladies”\xa0– she’s one of them.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/bubble-tea/:['The bubble tea craze is definitely back in full force!Originated in Taiwan in the ‘80s, bubble tea can be described as a flavoured beverage with a tea base, spiked with fruit syrup or flavourings. Customers can have their drink with or without milk, and as well as choose between different ice-blended versions. Nowadays, bubble tea shops also offer a gamut of other toppings and ingredients ranging from Oreo cookies, coffee, vanilla ice cream to even durian.\xa0A distinctive feature of most bubble teas is the inclusion of black tapioca pearls. You can also choose to have yours with jelly strips.The bubble tea craze in Singapore first started in the early 2000s but its popularity waned after a few years. These days, it’s making a strong comeback, fuelled by innovative new concoctions and the added presence of at least two established players from Taiwan, Koi Cafe and Gong Cha.A good bubble tea has to have firm, chewy pearls that are well-separated and a fragrant tea that’s not overly sweet. We taste-tested five cold milk tea with pearls and another of the outlet’s specialty tea to find the best.\xa0Gong ChaAvailable at Novena Square2 and City Square Mall.Price: Gong Cha milk alisan tea ($2.40), milk tea ($2.20)Rating: 5/5It has only two branches in Singapore but it’s making all the right moves as far as bubble tea is concerned: It offers different sugar levels (0, 30%, 50%, 80%, 100%), hygienically packed straws, stylish packaging, a good variety of drinks and a great marriage of traditional bubble tea selection and innovative, modern interpretations.To make a fair comparison, we tried the milk tea with 100% sweetness. Gong Cha’s came out tops, with its nicely-balanced sweetness and fragrant tea. We think it will taste even better at 50% or 80% sweetness though. The pearls were bouncy and while soft on the outside, had a firm centre that gave it a good bite. We had a generous serving of those.We also tried an interesting specialty tea, the store’s signature Gong Cha milk alisan tea. The homemade creamy milk froth is added on top of the tea, not blended into it. Then, a little green tea powder is sprinkled on top. We had this at 50% sweetness. We loved the interesting contrast of the slightly salty and creamy milk topping against the zesty Alisan tea.Gong Cha offers warm bubble teas too, and something we’ll try on our next visit.\xa0KOI CafeAvailable at six branches islandwide, including People’s Park Complex, Illuma and Toa Payoh Central.Price: Jasmine green milk tea ($1.90 for medium size, $2.50 for large), ice cream milk tea ($2.90 for medium, $4.30 for large)Rating: 4/5This is the most popular bubble tea chain in town at the moment, with long queues forming at almost every one of their branches. KOI is known for its health conscious approach to bubble tea, as it allows customers to dictate the level of sweetness ranging from no sugar, 25%, 50%, 70% to full sugar.Alas, their default milk tea with pearl at 100% sweetness was way too sweet for us. That, with the overpowering milky taste, masked any flavour the tea had. What redeemed the drink were the pearls. Smaller in size to all the other stalls, they were done very well. Each pearl was distinct, had a good bite and smooth texture.We also liked KOI’s ice cream milk tea with pearls at 50% sweetness. It was light and refreshing but still had a distinct tea flavour. A scoop of vanilla ice cream was added to the tea, which provided for an entirely new experience. However, we faced a minor challenge getting to the ice cream. Perhaps KOI can provide spoons?KOI provides straws that are individually sealed in plastic. This may not be an environmentally friendly move, but it is a hygienic touch. Another nice touch is the queue number system at KOI, so you know when your turn is up.You may also want to check out the ai-yu tea, which has received rave reviews online.\xa0That Bubble TeaBlk 203, Toa Payoh North, Singapore 310203Price: Milk tea ($1), cookie spin Oreo ($1.80)Rating: 3.5/5The milk tea was fragrant and not too sweet. While it may be slightly on the milky side, that robustness added body to the drink. The pearls were also firm and well separated. This stall, which had the best value among all the ones we tried, specialises in a huge selection of flavours.We also tried the Oreo ice-blended. The ice was blended so finely that the creamy drink resembled a lighter version of an Oreo milkshake. We had this with jelly bits and the combination definitely worked. The contrasting texture of the crunchy jelly and the smooth drink was very addictive.\xa0Each-a-cupAvailable at various locations islandwide including ION Orchard, The Heeren, City Square Mall and Changi Airport T3.Price: Jasmine green milk tea ($1.90), fantasy ice blended ($2.20)Rating: 3/5The tea here was not as well flavoured as Sweet Talk’s and had only a hint of fragrance. But it was still fairly good. The pearls, which were bouncy and firm also made up for it the lack of fragrance.We also tried fantasy, a strawberry and lychee ice-blended drink with jelly bits. The jelly bits had a really good bite and were a good contrast to the mushy shaved ice. Overall, the drink was refreshing, but too sweet for our liking.Each-a-cup prides itself on “using concentrated fruit juice” and “not syrup. We were happy about that and really did see bits of real strawberries and lychees floating in our drink.\xa0Sweet TalkAvailable at various locations islandwide including Bishan Junction 8, Century Square and Orchard CentralPrice: Milk tea ($1.90), strawberry ice nlended ($1.90)Rating: 2.5/5The milk tea was strong and fragrant. And thankfully, although it was quite sweet, the sugar level was still acceptable.The pearls, however, were the worst among all that we tried. Most of the pearls were not spherical, with many having strands of tapioca flour dangling from them like worms! The majority of the pearls were also stuck together, creating masses of gooey substance that got stuck in the straw. We had to clear out the straw numerous times before we could drink from it again.We also tried the recommended strawberry ice-blended with pearl, and had a huge sugar rush as a result. It was so sweet we felt like we were drinking semi-frozen strawberry jam right out of the bottle!Thanks for the generosity Sweet Talk, but it’ll be good if you’re a little less heavy handed with the sugar syrups.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/kyushu-pancake-cafe/:['Imagine having to make reservations three months in advance before dining at the restaurant.That’s how popular Kyushu Pancake Cafe is in Taipei. And now the Japanese pancake franchise has hit Singapore.Opened on 10 May 2016, along Thomson Road, just opposite Novena Church and downstairs from Novena Regency residences — there won’t be any shortage of foot traffic. Not that being located in the North will be a deterrent for fans of the light and chewy Kyushu pancakes.What’s unique about their pancakes is the flour made from a mix of 7 different types of grains from Kyushu. The flour mixture consists of wheat from Oita prefecture; sprouted brown rice from Aya, Miyazaki; millet from Unzen, Nagasaki; pressed barley from Saga prefecture (this gives the pancakes fluff); the purple rice and red glutinous rice from Kumamoto and Fukuoka (lends a chewy texture); and non-glutinous rice from Kagoshima.The results are uniformly browned flapjacks with a slightly chewy texture and the gentle fragrance of organic grains. Go for the Kyushu Good Ol’classic pancakes ($7.90) — there’s also a buttermilk option ($8.50) — served with freshly whipped cream, white wine honey (made from a reduction of Chardonnay and wild flower honey) and seasonal fruit syrups.\xa0No maple syrup is served here but then you don’t really need it when you have fruit syrups —could be blueberries, kiwi, or strawberries — that are freshly made daily.Also a regular on the menu is the French Toast ($10.90) which sees a rather complicated prep process: the ‘bread’ is cut into cubes, soaked in a beaten egg mixture overnight, air-dried and painted with honey before being cooked on the griddle. Instead of having a custardy texture like other French toast, these are more like tender sponge cake or muffin that you can drench with the white wine honey.Seasonal items like the Matcha Mont Blanc pancakes ($18) has a limited run. High grade matcha is blended with the most expensive chestnut puree to form a soft carapace of creamy swirls on top of the pancake. Let’s hope they make this a regular item.One item that is exclusive to the Kyushu Pancake Singapore outlet is the Karaage Chicken Waffle ($19). Chicken thigh meat is used instead of breast meat for a juicy, succulent, crispy patty that rests on a mattress of fluffy waffles.Slurp-worthy beverages include Tomato Soda ($6.50) that is, according to the owner Jeffrey Yap, commonly served in expensive kaiseki\xa0restaurants. A whole Momotaro tomato is slow-cooked in syrup, peeled and served whole in soda. Also a must-order is the extra creamy Dorayaki smoothie ($8) with red bean and yogurt — there’s a tinge of burnt biscuit flavour in the milkshake-like drink — Doraemon would approve.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

But if you take time to stroll along the outdoor plaza fronting the Singapore River, you might just be rewarded with something different.Enter Sque (pronounced as S-kyou) Rotisserie & Alehouse, a new gastrobar by Emmanuel Stroobant, Singapore’s punk rocker celebrity chef persona, and his wife, Edina Hong, both co-founders of the Saint Pierre Group of restaurants.“We want to introduce yet another casual dining concept like Picotin and Brussel Sprouts because fine dining is slowing down,” says Edina Hong, “Sque is a laidback venue, perfect for quick lunches and to chill out over beer and bistro fare.”Befitting its airy location by the Singapore River, the 256-seater bistro boasts a 40-meter wide frontage with a predominantly al fresco space. The rustic-minimalist indoor dining area, decked with cool blonde-wood tables and high chairs, sits just 50.Your dinner at Sque will be a felicitous booze-food pairing session and appropriately so, given Sque’s depth of beer menu. There are more than 200 different types of beers (priced from $6.50 to $50 per bottle) on the menu: ranging from rarely seen selections such as apple cider beer, pear-flavoured beer, chocolate-flavoured stout to the ubiquitous Tiger beer.\xa0Pair these tipples with finger foods such as the Himalayan salt-studded onion blossom ($13) and homemade fish fingers with tartare dip ($20). Or, the decidedly European bistro fare of braised snail in butter with garlic and mushrooms ($18), bone marrow mashed with garlic and wild mushrooms crowned with toasted bread crumbs ($17) and Sque’s house salad ($16), a hearty toss of roasted Kurobuta pork belly with abby spinach and cheddar cheese cubes in a beer vinegar dressing.But Sque is not just a beer shrine, the canteen-style counter proudly proffers a menu of rotisserie meats: chicken, pork rib, lamb leg, you name it, of which the beef rib ($38) is a standout. Here’s a humongous hunk of Lousiana-styled bone-in beef rib doused in a seriously addictive marinade of cumin, smoked garlic and cayenne pepper.For an imminently beer-centric sweet ending, ask for Belgian chocolate with kriek beer pie ($14).

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/calories-in-a-day/:['If you’re not already aware of your daily calorie intake, it’s time to start! Consuming more than you need will lead to weight gain.The recommended daily calorie intake for men and women are different.\xa0Being conscious of your calorie intake can help you maintain a healthy weight, or lose a few extra pounds if necessary.While 2,200 and 1,800 kcal are commonly cited as the recommended daily caloric intake for adult males and females respectively, these are just the median figures.For a more accurate number, you need to take into account your age, gender, weight and lifestyle.For example, a desk-bound worker, who spends most of his day sitting down would not burn more calories than say a delivery person who is constantly on the move or moderately active.You can also download the\xa0Healthy365 app\xa0by HPB for iPhone or Android — a step tracker and food intake calculator that features an extensive database of local dishes.\xa0One of the simplest and most effective methods for controlling your calorie intake is portion control.Often, we eat what is on our plate rather than what our body needs.By deciding beforehand how much we need and what goes on our plate, we are a lot more likely to succeed in controlling our diet and calorie intake.Here’s a scenario: You’ve identified that your recommended daily calorie intake is 2,200 kcal.It’s now time for dinner, and you’ve already consumed 1,500 kcal throughout the day.That leaves you with an allowance of 700 kcal for dinner.\nYou should then portion what goes onto your dinner plate accordingly to keep those extra pounds away.\xa0\xa0A range of dishes on your dining table to choose from:\xa0\xa0To achieve your target of 700 kcal, you can only pick, for example, the brown rice (137 kcal) + beef rendang (201 kcal) + sambal egg (67 kcal) + fish ball soup (53 kcal) + spinach (163 kcal), which would add up to 621 kcal.If you wanted the scoop of ice cream, you would have to forgo another item such as the sambal egg.Depending on your physical output for the day, you might also want to adjust your food intake accordingly.For example, if it’s the weekend and you did nothing but sit in front of the TV all day, you could consider adjusting your portion downwards.\xa0Consuming too many calories which we do not use up will lead to weight gain.Studies show that when our body weight is at an unhealthy range, we are at a higher risk of health problems such as high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, among other chronic diseases.\xa0Consuming the\xa0right number of calories is a good first step towards achieving a healthier body.However, you should know that not all calories are equal.Keeping to the calorie count on a diet consisting of only sugary cakes, meat dishes, or a glass of wine is far from ideal.This is because your body needs a variety of vitamins and minerals, as well as\xa0fibre\xa0to function properly.One simple way to achieve this is to follow\xa0My Healthy Plate guidelines for a balanced meal.Simply put, fill your plate with ½ portion of\xa0fruits and vegetables, ¼ portion of whole grains\xa0and ¼ portion of meats or proteins.Eating healthy is not limited to eating the right amount and the right mix.It is also important for optimum nutrition to choose healthy foods prepared with healthier options and ingredients.\nSteamed chicken, for example, is far healthier than deep-fried chicken.For example, whole grains are healthier than refined grains (white rice or bread) as they contain more vitamins, antioxidants and fibre.In addition, they also keep you filling full for longer, which helps reduce the risk of overeating.Choosing healthier cooking oils are also important as they can affect your body’s good (HDL) and bad (LDL) cholesterol levels.\xa0\xa0If fat loss is one of your weight loss goals, merely controlling your calorie intake will not be enough to do the trick.\nDiet and exercise are pertinent when it comes to healthy weight loss.You should be doing a combination of cardio and strength-training exercises, which are useful in losing fat as well as gaining muscle mass.Instead of turning to fad diets that may have negative side effects on our health, a better, healthier option would be a healthy lifestyle that includes healthy eating habits and includes physical activity each day.Don’t forget to rest well by getting at least 7-8 hours of sleep every night!This article was first published on HealthHub.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

Tucked away at the outskirts of Orchard Road, the Japanese-owned restaurant chain has outlets all over the world. Famous local food bloggers Dr Leslie Tay of ieatishootipost and Brad Lau of LadyIronChef have named this as one of the best ramen places in Singapore. We couldn’t resist trying its famous tokusen toroniku (pork cheek) ramen.Choose from four different tonkotsu soup bases: shio (Japanese for ‘salt’), shoyu (‘soy’), miso ($19.50++ each) and kara-miso (spicy miso, $20.50++). We went with shio.Santouka’s ramen is different. The sliced meat, which is the star of this dish, is served separately from the ramen. We prefer to dip the meat in the soup for a brief moment to warm it up before eating. The shio broth is rich and flavoursome, yet not overly salty. The springy noodles are cooked to perfection, and the pork slices are very tender and have the perfect fat-to-meat ratio.We also ordered the\xa0komi tamago (flavoured boiled egg, $1.50++) and yaki gyoza (chicken dumplings, $5.50++).\xa0 The egg is disappointing.\xa0 It is too firm and doesn’t have the runny egg yolk you’d expect of a well-cooked komi tamago. The gyozas, on the other hand, are delicious. It comes piping hot and pan-fried to perfection. The dough is thin and has just the right amount of stuffing. Juicy and flavoursome, they are also not too greasy. Make sure you eat these warm.The ramen at Santouka certainly doesn’t disappoint – in fact, it is one of the best among the many ramen places we’ve tried in Singapore. This explains why there were people waiting outside the restaurant even before it opens for business when we were there that day.

To add insult to injury, the service charges on the bill rarely goes to the waiters.‘The restaurant takes it,’ a waitress once told me. ‘So we depend on tips and if we’re lucky, we might make $18 a night in tips. And if most of the customers are Chinese, forget it\xa0— the Chinese never tip. And they always drink water. Tap water, some more!’\xa0Not to sound like Marie Antoinette, but $1,100 a month doesn’t get you very far in Singapore these days. It’s no wonder waiting tables not a viable long-term occupation for most. That also explains why so many waitstaff these days are non-Singaporeans.Which takes me to my second point: I once waited on tables at a local restaurant\xa0— it was part of my research for a story I was writing. Halfway through my first night, I swore I would never be rude to a waiter again in my life.As if the work isn’t already backbreaking enough, the customers can be evil. At the severe risk of over-generalisation, the Singaporeans I served were rude and patronising. The nicest bunch I encountered were the expats. Almost without exception, the Americans, British and Australian tables I served would look me in the eye and engage in animated conversations. They made requests with smiles and reciprocated with, ‘Thank you!’Almost without exception, the locals treated me like a maid (or how I imagined they would treat their maids). My greetings, as I handed out menus and served Coca-Colas, would either be ignored or acknowledged with a sullen expression. They never engaged in eye contact and snapped their orders. I felt barely human, with no reason to exist other than to refill their glasses of water and ferry them the bill.\xa0Of course, there were bright spots. At the end of a particularly brutal lunch service during which I’d been hobbled by blisters in my feet, a Singaporean customer came up to me and slipped me a business card for a podiatrist. ‘I notice you’re limping a little. Go see my friend. She’s excellent.’It made my day, though not enough for me to want to stay on much longer than my undercover assignment. As one waitress confided, ‘That’s why no one wants to be a waiter. It’s such a stressful job. The customers are very fussy and demanding. Quite often, they use vulgar words or are so insulting. Someone told me I was stupid to my face once. I went to the kitchen and cried.’So who’s to blame? The restaurant industry? An ungracious society that should know better?Restaurateur Cynthia Chua of the Spa Esprit Group (Barracks, Skinny Pizza, Open Door Policy) says the food and beverage business is a difficult one. ‘It’s hard to hold onto staff and keep them motivated as it’s so easy for them to get jaded and discouraged. The customers can be difficult, the hours long, the compensation is poor, it’s physically taxing and they simply don’t receive recognition for what they do. In Singapore, waitering has traditionally been considered a low skill or a fallback, hence the lack of talent.’With all of this going against them, why would anyone want to be a waiter? To earn the top tier of $2,500 a month, or to be treated with disdain and disregard by the customers? Well, they do it because, sometimes, this is the only job that’s available and they have families to support. But that doesn’t mean they don’t deserve a little respect.____________________________________________________________________________A carefully reformed ex-lawyer, Daven Wu has spent the past decade or so atoning for his former sins by professionally eating out a lot.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/masterchef-asia/:['‘MasterChef’ has come to Asia and three Singaporeans were among the 15 Asian contestants in the very first season of ‘MasterChef Asia’. Presided over by judges, Hong Kong-born celebrity chef Susur Lee, Singapore-born Audra Morrice (a ‘MasterChef Australia’ season 4 finalist) and three-Michelin star chef, Bruno Ménard.We asked the Singapore contestants what it was like to compete in the very first ‘Masterchef Asia’.\xa0\xa0What are your backgrounds and how did you get involved with food?Woo Wai Leong: I’m 27-year-old, an ex- lawyer and a bit of a food geek. I began cooking in my teens and I’ve participated in cooking competitions in university.Sandrian Tan: I’m 41-years-old and I’m (currently) a homemaker. I used to work in the semiconductor industry for eight years. My cooking is a fusion of Thai and Chinese. (Tan is born to a Singaporean Chinese-Hainanese father and a Thai mother.)Lennard Yeong: I’m also 27, an ex-engineer and I’ve spent the past five years creating my own unique dishes with the help of YouTube and cookbooks.\xa0\xa0What motivated you to enter the competition?Yeong: I’ve been cooking at home for about 4 to 5 years and there’s only a certain level you can hit when you cook at home. Joining a competition like this would take me out of my comfort zone and give me the opportunity to grow. ‘Masterchef Asia’ is a once in a lifetime opportunity. If i didn’t do it now, the dream might not come again.Woo: I’ve always been a big fan of the show and I’ve always wanted to be a part of it, so I jumped when the opportunity came up.Tan: I never thought I would have the courage to do this sort of competition, but I had a family member pass away (her mother passed away from pancreatic cancer) so I thought, life is so short, just go for it.\xa0\xa0How did you feel when you found out you were selected to compete in ‘Masterchef Asia’?Yeong: We went through like several rounds of auditions and every round was nerve-wracking. When I got the call, it was such a rush of emotions but I knew there were a lot of things I had to settle before I joined the competition, like quitting my job. There was so much stress even before the competition so when I entered, I was already on the edge.Woo:\xa0After each audition round, you get happier and happier but you know it could all come crashing the next round. I was at work when I got the good news. I was really happy. I left work early, went home and told my family.Tan: I was on holiday when I got the news. I got the message on my phone and I was screaming. My husband thought I dropped something into the river!\xa0\xa0So is it as hard as what we see on television?All: It is harder.Tan: What you see (on tv) is really just all fun, fun, fun.Woo: It’s a change in your workflow, a different kitchen, unfamiliar surroundings and unfamiliar equipment. It is a lot harder than it is. In between the challenge finishing and the judges tasting your food, there is actually a lot of downtime, sometimes two hours and the food is out there. Certain sauces will not survive such a long wait, so you have to recalibrate your cooking vocabulary to factor in that time.Yeong: As a viewer, you see two days of filming condensed into an hour of television. You don’t get to see stuff like the sleepless nights staying up to study. There’s definitely a lot of stress going on behind the scenes.\xa0\xa0What are your feelings about ‘Masterchef’ now?Woo: You can divide my feelings on ‘Masterchef’ into two periods: pre-‘Masterchef’ and post. Before I’ll be saying things like “Come on! You can do better than that,” or “what a rookie mistake!” After going through the competition, you realise that when you’re in the zone, under time pressure, you can make even the simplest mistakes. Now whenever I watch ‘Masterchef’, I’m very understanding.\xa0How have your cooking skills improved since competing on ‘Masterchef’?Woo: I learnt a lot from the Indian contestants who taught me how to use spice… Previously I would have dismissed certain cuisines or dishes as being easy to cook, but after I left the show, I have a deeper respect for those cuisines.Yeong: Before the competition, I was always doing more Western-style cooking at home. Asian food was my weakness. I’ve now developed a deeper appreciation for Asian flavours. I really love cooking Thai food nowadays.Tan: My background is more Asian cooking so being introduced to all these ang moh (western) techniques really broadened my knowledge. It’s like drawing. You’ve been drawing a certain style all your life and then you enter a competition like this and you realise that there are so many styles of drawing.\xa0\xa0What was the first dish you cooked after the filming ended?Woo: I just made a simple steakYeong: I cooked otak. I never learnt how to make it but I learnt the process of cooking it during the show.Tan: Actually I didn’t cook for almost two weeks, but when I did, it was just a simple homemade Chinese soup.\xa0\xa0What are your plans, now that the competition is over?Woo: Before the competition, I was part-timing as a bartender, so now i have now re-joined the bartending industry. I’ll be taking it easy and enjoying life until all the excitement from the show dies down and then I’ll look for a full-time job.Tan: After this whole thing dies down, I’ll be going back to the corporate world, but it won’t be F&B related. It’s alot of financial commitment to open up a restaurant or any business in Singapore.Yeong: I’ll be looking for a full-time job after the promoting, and the show is over.\xa0\xa0Would it be food-related?Yeong: That is still a question I’m asking myself. My mother is the breadwinner in the family and she is retiring soon, so I have to look at being financially stable enough to support myself and my parents in their retirement. It won’t be F&B for now but I hope to do so in the future because it is my passion. I dont want that part of my life to go away.\xa0\xa0Masterchef Asia premieres 3 September.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/wang-wang-crispy-curry-puff/:['Started by an ex-chef at Pan Pacific’s Hai Tien Lo, Chang Lee Wong, now 57, set up Wang Wang Crispy Curry Puff\xa0in 2003 to make a unique style of curry puff.The concept is simple: combining the Teochew-style of flaky pastry — similar to what you would see in Teochew pastries like tau sar piah and Teochew mooncakes — with a potato curry filling.Soft dough is folded numerous times such that the resultant raw pastry has more than 10 layers. Instead of being baked like how many Teochew pastries are, it is deep-fried like a typical curry puff.The result is a wavy, layered-looking puff that is wonderfully flaky, crumbly, oil-rich and delicate when you bite into it.Have a plate ready though as the flakes are incredibly delicate and fall all over the place.The filling is gravy-like and is full of meltingly soft potato cubes. In the middle, a large chunk of soft, moist chicken meat.The overall flavour has a nice mix of spiciness, is prominently savoury, though the curry spices are not so in your face.\xa0Be warned that each puff is very oil-rich, significantly richer than a normal curry puff. One puff is usually enough to fill you up.The pastry is also not salted so you’re tasting the filling and experiencing the texture of the pastry but none of its taste. Some people say this is why the puff lacks a little oomph.They have three other flavours — sardines, black pepper chicken and yam. Many say that Chang’s black pepper chicken is the original but for us, the sardine puff stands out the most as it has a nice moist filling and enough fish savouriness.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/koothurar-nasi-biryani/:['Famously known as “the Beach Road nasi biryani”, this stall occupies a corner stall in a coffeeshop below a nearby HDB block, a stone’s throw away from Golden Mile Food Centre.It has no signage, but you’ll know which stall it is by the long daily queues that form under the block from 11am onwards for their nasi biryani which is more local Singaporean in style as opposed to the more “authentic” Indian restaurant dum biryanis.Originally operating in a coffeeshop at Victoria Street in the 1960s, this family business relocated to their present location in 1985.Every element of their biryani is done right from the masala spice paste which is made from scratch and has no powdery residue in the taste to the incredibly soft and tender mutton and chicken. ($6.50, includes boiled egg)\xa0But the killer is really the amazingly fluffy biryani rice which is made using high-quality basmati rice (very few broken rice stalks) and quality ghee — the fragrance of the ghee in the rice is particularly aromatic.Examine the rice, and you’ll notice that they add a scattering of aromatic spices and herbs like garlic, ginger, onions, coriander and mint.\xa0The thokku/dhal curry gravy on the side is also appropriately thick and tangy with an underlying savouriness and comes with chopped carrots and brinjals.If you’re one of the first in line when they start serving at 11.20am, they’ll throw in some masala potatoes, keerai dal masiyal (South Indian spinach and dal mush) or cauliflower poriyal (cauliflower stir-fry) depending on what’s available.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/chef-in-black-emmaneul-stroobant/:['Sitting down with the iconic bleached-blonde Chef in Black is certainly not the typical experience one might expect from engaging with a classical French chef. Dressed in his signature attire of black tee and blue jeans, Emmanuel Stroobant, 41, of TV programme Chef in Black, exudes charisma and his infamous bad-boy attitude. Born in the hometown of Liege in the French-speaking part of Belgium, Emmanuel worked his way up into management from a dishwasher position at age 18. Declaring the adrenaline of the kitchen atmosphere to be his preferred choice, he embodies the energy and vitality of his media image. Today, Chef Stroobant runs and consults at more than seven fine and casual dining establishments including Saint Pierre, Brussels Sprouts, Picotin and San Marco, and is expecting to roll out a new project this month.\xa0You’ve come a long way from native Belgium. How did you end up in Southeast Asia? Did you experience culture shock when you first arrived? \nAfter acquiring a degree in hotel management and having worked in the industry in Belgium for some time, I spent some time travelling in the US and subsequently worked for five years in Australia. I received a proposition to work in Carmen’s in Kuala Lumpur in 1987, and subsequently came to Singapore in 1999. I’d say the culture shock was less daunting in Singapore than it was in Malaysia, as I had to pick up a bit of Malay there. So I was already prepared when coming to Singapore- in fact, I associate this city more with New York City than with Asia!\xa0You’ve rolled out your own TV programme Chef in Black. What were some of the most memorable experiences encountered during the filming?\nIt has to be the Longhouse in Kuching. We had to travel for hours to the jungle and down the river to get there, and when we reached, I discovered it didn’t have any electricity or clean water. It was like the middle ages! I was totally unprepared for that experience, but it was definitely memorable. There wasn’t even a kitchen for me to cook in. I’ve also tried some interesting foods. In Vietnam, I had dog meat – not proud of that – and some live prawns in Thailand which jumped around in your mouth while chewing! Definitely a very interesting experience.\xa0In Chef in Black, you travelled to different parts of Southeast Asia to sample the local cuisines. How has the food in this part of the world influenced your cooking?\nIn Saint Pierre, I would have to say not at all. I keep the French cuisine pure and classical-focused here. We do use Japanese ingredients however, as they’re known for their freshness. In my other establishments, we’ve experimented with some Asian foods such as Thai or Chinese mussels, tom yam, curry-based dishes and so on. At home, it’s a completely different story though. My wife, Edina, loves her Asian food.\xa0You are often termed the “sexy chef in black.” How far do good looks help you in being a celebrity chef?\nWell, I suppose on TV it certainly helps. I do have my weaknesses however — my diction and accent make it difficult to appeal to a broad-based audience.\xa0You’re said to work 18 hours a day. When you do find free time to do what you enjoy doing?\nI’m not working in the traditional sense of chopping carrots in the kitchen. Rather, I can be working from home or out visiting my suppliers. I’m always very involved in my business. In my free time, I do yoga, ride my bike, read books-books on management, novels, anything that catches my attention at the moment. I also enjoy drinking, although that’s only somewhat work-related.\xa0You are a firm believer of the benefits of eating organic food. Does it really taste different? What do you think of the variety and availability of the organic produce in Singapore? \nYes, organic produce definitely affects the quality and taste of the food. We did a test some time back on the difference in taste between organic pork and normal pork, and the difference was significant. But in Singapore, certified organic meat and produce is for some reason very hard to find and costly. It’s also season-dependent, so the availability is inconsistent. For instance, in winter, Australian pork tastes better and in summer, the pigs are leaner and less well-fed. We do firsthand import and marketing whenever we can here at Saint Pierre, picking and choosing from the organic food truck. Of course, it’s unrealistic to be doing the marketing every single day, but compared to having a vendor pick and choose your peaches and not knowing which is ripe or not, it’s far better.\xa0You’ve been awarded various titles and awards over the years for your culinary innovations. How do you keep your creations fresh and exciting while retaining quality?\nI’ve been very lucky-I travel a lot, so I get to experience and experiment with new and different kinds of good food. I’m often inspired by my travels, but my creativity does come in phases. Sometimes I can go on for ages, but sometimes there is nothing. I keep a notebook on me constantly to jot down ideas and sketches. I’m also always cooking up new ideas in my office.\xa0Your signature look is the all-black outfit and bleached blonde hair. How did this look come about? Is black your look of choice or do you favour other colours more?\nIt came about in 1998 when France won the World Cup. I was in a bar with two crazy DJs and we made a bet to dye our hair the French colours-they did red and blue, and I did white. Edina quite liked it so it has stayed for 10 years. According to her, she’s always wanted a blonde husband (laughs). As for the colour black, it’s convenient to wear in and out of the kitchen where things get messy. It’s easy, simple and classic. I do wear other colours as well (gestures to his blue jeans)!\xa0What do you enjoy cooking at home for your wife and friends?\nEdina and I have very different tastes-I love to kick back with sashimi and chardonnay, but she prefers local food like laksa and popiah. For house dinners with friends, we usually throw together what’s in the fridge. So it can sometimes be three chefs throwing some simple fare together and relaxing with some drinks.\xa0What’s your favourite hawker food in Singapore?\nI love beef noodles. Edina’s brother owns a beef noodle shop back in Seremban, Malaysia and there’s a franchise here in Singapore.\xa0You run Saint Pierre with your wife Edina Hong. What’s the secret to managing a successful working and personal relationship with your wife?\nRespect. We each have our separate departments-she takes care of the marketing and accounts, while I do the cooking and manage the technical sides of the restaurant, such as the sound systems and cooking equipment. We have incidents of boundary conflict but nothing too serious, and we never bring home the problems from work. We don’t see each other very much at work in the first place, as we have separate offices and she is generally more involved in Saint Pierre than I am-I usually just come in to work the shifts.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

When we heard that the Japanese bakery had opened its first outlet in Singapore at Millennia Walk we had to check it out.As expected, the bakery was doing brisk business the day we visited. There was a wide variety of buns, pastries and sandwiches available. It was hard to make a choice but we finally settled for its signature Hokkaido curry bread ($2.50), pear danish ($2), Hokkaido chocolate bread ($2.10)and banana bread ($1.80).The deep fried curry bread didn’t disappoint. The bread was deliciously crispy on the outside yet soft and chewy on the inside. The curry filling was savoury and slightly sweet. It had a paste-like consistency and was dotted with chunky potato pieces. Very tasty! Best eaten warm.\xa0We also loved the pear Danish. It looked gorgeous and tasted divine. Some pastries can be tooth-achingly sweet but this had just the right amount of sweetness. The delicate slices of the pear were cooked perfectly–they were soft and juicy while the pastry was crisp and flaky. There was also a filling of smooth custard. It was a winning combination.\xa0The banana bread and Hokkaido chocolate bread were both enjoyable but not outstanding. We wished the chocolate bread had a stronger chocolate flavour. The banana bread was filled with custard interspersed with nice chunks of the fruit but wasn’t memorable otherwise.We hear that the Hokkaido scallop gratin bread is another bestseller but unfortunately it wasn’t available when we were there.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/fu-hui-wantan-mee-lor-mee-bishan-family/:['They say a family that eats together stays together. But a family of hawkers has taken that to the next level.At Block 150A Bishan Street 11, Goh Bee Leng, 44, helms Fu Hui Wantan Noodle & Lor Mee, a bustling noodle stall.She arrives for the day at 5am before lowering the shutters at 2pm. But she’s not alone in this.\xa0Her younger brother Goh Kok Tiong, 43, and mother Grace Wong, 63, who helm stalls of their own, are mere steps away.What’s it like to be with your family day in, day out? HungryGoWhere sat down with them to find out.Goh Bee Leng and Goh Kok Tiong grew up watching their hawker parents ply their trade, selling wanton mee since the 1990s.\xa0The elder Gohs have been in the trade for 30 years at various industrial canteens islandwide, in such areas as Potong Pasir, Kallang and Chai Chee. Rising rents forced them to shift often.It wasn’t until June 2005 that Goh Bee Leng took on the mantle herself.“I slowly learnt and picked it up. I used to work with them, but I eventually branched out on my own,” recalls Goh Bee Leng in a mixture of Mandarin and English.\xa0Wong says: “I told her: ‘You can’t be working behind me (in the stall) forever; you should strike out on your own and learn for yourself’.”\xa0They did, however, help her scout out a good location for the stall and get started on the business.Another stall became vacant at the same coffee shop in 2008, and Goh Bee Leng persuaded her mother to take it up, this time selling chwee kueh.In 2018, dad Goh Hung Ping, 73, closed his Potong Pasir stall to set up at Goh Bee Leng’s Bishan stronghold.By that time, Goh Kok Tiong had left his job as a lorry and crane driver to take over the reins of the family business from his father.But that also meant shaking things up.Recalls Goh Bee Leng: “I was already selling wanton mee, so he couldn’t sell the same thing.”Today, Goh Kok Tiong dishes up a moreish prawn mee with pork ribs (from S$4.50) and fishball noodles (from S$3.50) at his stall.\xa0Goh Bee Leng adds: “We wanted to give customers more variety and choice in their food. If not, they’d get tired of always eating the same thing.”\xa0That takes the Goh family’s little empire to a six-man hawker army across three stalls.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Junction Westgate opening with promos; will house 23 tenants, including new halal teppanyaki\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHawker Hustlers: Hipster hawker Ray Yeo of Bei-Ing Dimsum Club on reinventing dim sum and his love for all things Japan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere’s a camaraderie among the stalls that’s clear even to an outsider.Besides her family, Goh Bee Leng’s workers have been with her for years. And you’d probably overhear friendly ribbing and banter while you queue for your noodles.When the day is done and dusted, they bundle up together for the drive home to Punggol.\xa0That’s where the whole family lives within the same block of flats, albeit in different units — Goh Bee Leng, mum and dad in one, and brother Goh Kok Tiong with his wife and family in another.The family usually regroups in the evening for dinner at the elder Gohs’ home.They even travel together.\xa0Several times a year, the gang shuts the stalls for a few days to take a big family trip. This usually happens during the school holidays, so that Goh Kok Tiong’s kids, aged five, 16 and 17, can join the fun.And the hawker family continues to grow. Goh Kok Tiong’s wife Lina Lim, 37, already helps Wong run her chwee kueh stall, while the siblings’ brother-in-law Ng Kian Chong — their youngest sister’s 45-year-old husband — is in the process of learning the trade from the father-and-son duo. It’s the family’s hope to open another stall — selling their signatures — at a separate location in the next two years.The family tries to keep prices low, starting from S$3.50 for a bowl of noodles. They are located in a housing estate, Goh Bee Leng says, so she wants to keep her food cheap.Goh Hung Ping adds: “There are a lot of old folks here, too. If the food is too expensive, they won’t be able to afford it.”Goh Bee Leng also intends to keep prices stable, so as not to alienate their regulars, who form the bulk of her clientele.\xa0(She knows them so well that once she glimpses them in the queue, she can already start preparing their usual orders without having to wait, she says.)The family charges less, but it’s enough to survive on.They foresee having to raise their prices in the coming months because of a recent increase in rents. But they will keep this to a minimum, she says.When it comes to the food, experience counts, says Goh Hung Ping. “Truthfully, it’s not something you can just learn.”One thing that sets Goh Bee Leng’s recipes apart? After receiving feedback from loyal customers, she uses lean meat in her crowd-favourite lor mee (S$4).Taste is subjective, she says, but her regulars prefer the mouthfeel and fragrance of the lean meat, instead of the usual braised, three-layered fatty pork that’s the norm at many other stalls.The chilli is housemade as well. “You’ve to fry it yourself if you want good chilli,” says Goh Hung Ping.Goh Bee Leng’s customers also have the choice of fried fish noodles (S$4), chicken feet noodles (S$4), and of course, wanton mee (from S$3.50). She adds a little dark soya sauce to the wanton mee for extra colour and flavour — something that not many stalls do, she says.At her brother’s stall, Goh Kok Tiong considers his prawn noodles (from S$3.50) his signature, but diners should also try the bak chor mee (minced meat noodles, from S$4), which comes with mushrooms and fishballs.Those looking for a snack should check out mum Wong’s kueh stall, which sells a range of bites such as soon kueh (S$1), chwee kueh (from S$1.60) and chee cheong fun (rice noodle rolls, S$1).All in all, it’s been a decades-long exercise in trial and error. The family deems going to various stalls to taste and dissect dishes and improve their own recipes a group activity.And it’s a continuing one, too — the family never stops looking for ways to make their food better.That seems to have paid off. The stalls attract a steady stream of customers — mostly getting takeaways — around lunch hour, all the way until they close their stalls around 2pm.Goh Bee Leng says she can turn out around 300 bowls of noodles daily, a number that can shoot up to 400 on weekends.For the family, job satisfaction is something they take seriously.\xa0“We want our customers to feel happy eating our food — that’s the most important thing,” says Wong.Book a ride to Fu Hui Wantan Noodle & Lor Mee.Block 150A Bishan Street 11, 01-161\nNearest MRT station: Braddell\nOpens: Mondays to Sundays (7.15am to 2pm).

No time to endure long queues at hawker centres in the scorching heat?No problem.Say hi to VendMart, Singapore’s largest vending machine cluster featuring the widest variety of unique vending machines. This vending machine cluster was launched on 11 October 2017 by Giant, the ubiquitous supermarket chain in Singapore.VendMart is the result of a collaboration between Giant and local companies to bring together 17 vending machine concepts.One of the goals of the initiative is to support local start-ups and entrepreneurs by giving them an avenue to promote their brand and products.Foodies will be delighted to know that many of the vending machines there dispense food. And not just your same ol’ packet and processed food such as potato chips, but foods that you could previously only find at restaurants and hawker centres.Food such as crabs, in all its different saucy glory (salted egg yolk, black pepper, chilli)…\nPizzas…Popiahs!Pastas, including chilli crab spaghettiThere are also drinks as well, such as freshly squeezed orange juice (watch our Facebook video to see the machine in action)And herbal teas.Now, you’re probably wondering how the food dispensed by these machines taste. Well, you’re definitely\xa0not\xa0going to get restaurant-quality food here, as a bite into the pizza basically made clear to us, but as far as vending machine foods go, the food’s pretty good. Many of the machines do come equipped with special features that help preserve the quality of the food before it lands in your hands (and into your stomach). The Shiok Pizza machine, for example, has an inbuilt oven to bake the pizza before it dispenses it; and some other stations, such as House of Seafood’s one, warms up the dish of your picking for two to three minutes before dispensing it.We were most impressed by the Q-orange vending machine, which keeps oranges in a temperature-controlled environment to make sure the oranges are as fresh as possible before they are squeezed.VendMart will be housed at Giant Tampines and Giant IMM hypermarkets till December 2017.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/marina-bay-sands/:['As the cocktail bar scene continues to flourish in Singapore, bartenders are moving beyond the sugary vodka-tinis of the 90s to serve up handcrafted tipples that are creative, perfectly balanced, spirit driven, and incoporates a high quality ice program.There is no better place to start your bar hop than\xa0at Marina Bay Sands’ Celebrity Chef bars. Social Hour on\xa0Tuesday evenings allows guests to enjoy selected cocktails at half price from 6pm – 9pm. Continue your revelry with 25% off bottle service from 9pm till closing time at Singapore’s newest rooftop hangout, Flight Bar & Lounge.So what makes a good cocktail? Join us on a virtual bar hop through\xa0Marina Bay Sands’ Celebrity Chef bars to find out.\xa0\xa01.\xa0Start off with the basicsThe classics never go out of style and for good reason but reinventing an iconic drink can bring new delight to an old favourite. The Osteria Mozza’s Singapore Sling 1913 is shaken up with dry gin, cherry brandy, Benedictine DOM, bitters, lime juice, and soda but their rendition is made more fresh and fruity with the addition of Peter Heering liqueur.The Old Fashioned is given a slight twist at Flight Bar & Lounge. The\xa0Java Old Fashioned is a\xa0smokey concoction which melds Bourbon whiskey with the bittersweet notes of cocoa syrup and Aztec chocolate bitters.\xa0\xa02. Fresh ingredients and premium spiritsAnother element of good cocktails are high quality ingredients. In the speakeasy style spirit forward tipples, the choice of booze can make or break the drink.\xa0CUT’s Rough Love features Tanqueray No. Ten, a gin backed by 14 years of history and\xa0recognised as one of the best gins in the world. The drink is topped with bubbly Champagne and\nslightly piquant Yatagarasu Shiso Ume that shows up well against the citrus notes of the gin.In order to uphold the reputation of the celebrity chef restaurants at Marina Bay Sands, premium ingredients are always used. This philosophy extends to the bar as well. The Bar at Waku Ghin offers not one, but two new ways to enjoy the Bloody Mary. The Ghin Bloody Mary is made up of top notch ingredients like the Original Spiced Vodka (infused with chilli, garlic, black pepper, Tasmanian pepper berry, bay leaf, dehydrated tomato), tomato juice, clamato juice, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, served in a glass rimmed with Tetsuya’s truffle salt. High quality ingredients create nuanced flavours in this crowd-pleasing drink.\xa0\xa03. Shaken or stirred?Watch any James Bond movies and you would know that the fictional British secret agent prefers his martini “shaken, not stirred”. Which is better? Bartenders say that each technique is used for different purposes.Citrusy drinks are usually shaken to release flavour of the fruit and allow it to blend well with the sugars. Shaking also creates foam to give the drink a\xa0good bubbly body and make it extra delicious.\xa0Have a taste of a tropical Tiki cocktails at db Bistro & Oyster Bar.\xa0The Mai Tai is a summery rum based quaff with citrusy notes of orange and lime. The Zombie is another shaken rum-based drink with the fruity taste of apricots, pineapple, and lime. The third variation, Royal Hawaiian, has gin with a refreshing touch of lime and pineapple.On the other hand, drinks that are spirit forward or incoporate only light mixers are better prepared stirred. Bread Street Kitchen’s\xa0Tio Abuelo\xa0with Bombay Sapphire, Passionfruit, Tio Pepe, Sherry & Tonic is given a quick swirl before it is served.\xa0\xa04. Perfect with ice and garnish\xa0A good ice program is integral to a good cocktail. In fact, that cube in your glass is as important as the booze. Large spheres of ice ensures that the cocktail does not dilute too quickly while keeping the drink chilled. The\xa0Penicillin from Adrift, for example, is kept suitably cold with a large ice cube so you can slowly enjoy the alluring smokiness of the peaty\xa0Islay Whisky with muddled ginger and honey.The cocktail, Love You Long Time from newly opened Spago, showcases the brilliant use of garnish. Ketel One Vodka and sparkling sake forms the base of the cocktail while tangerine adds layers of sweetness and Thai basil leaves cuts through with its crisp notes, providing a good balance. Continue to crush the basil leaves as you sip the drink to keep the flavours strong even as the ice melts into it. At Long Chim, the 555 boasts Cocci Americano, Fords Dry Gin topped with coriander, lemon and cucumber. Other than adding an attractive dash of colour to the presentation, the herb-vegetable-fruit combination lends another dimension to the flavours in the cocktail.\xa0\xa0Find that these tips help you to appreciate what goes into your cocktails?

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/taste-known-source-steam-stone-fish/:["Before anything, we have to address the elephant in the room: the restaurant is actually called “Taste Known Source Steam Stone Fish”.Yes, it is a mouthful but it sounds a lot better when you say it in Mandarin — Wei Zhi Yuan Zhen Qi Shi Guo Yu. Loosely translated, it means something along the lines of — “the original well-known taste of ‘steam stone fish'” which is exactly the speciality of this Sichuan restaurant located on Pagoda Street, the main tourist strip in Chinatown.\xa0Steam Stone FishFairly well-known in Sichuan province, the dish is often marketed with the story of how it became part of Sichuan cuisine, which goes something like this: back in the Qing Dynasty when China was ruled by Emperor Qian Long (1711-1799), the Emperor went on a trip to Chang Sha in Southern China and was impressed by a fish soup which was served in an earthen stone pot in one of the eateries. He liked the dish so much that he named it “Good Fortune Fish”.Traditionally, the soup is boiled over a fire in a stone pot packed with natural minerals. The minerals seep into the soup and you get extra nutrients as a result.\xa0At Taste Known Source Steam Stone Fish, they have adapted the concept by placing a whole raw fish (sea bass, snapper and the like; $28 to $48) and a mala\xa0(Sichuan spice mix) concoction into a stone pot with a steam outlet at its base. The outlet pumps hot steam into the pot, and after six minutes, the fish comes out perfectly steamed and the broth lightly simmering.You can order a variety of steamboat ingredients like cabbage, black fungus and pork belly which you cook in the simmering broth like a traditional Sichuan steamboat hotpot after you’ve eaten the fish.According to the chef/owner Tang De Hai, the advantages of the hot steam method is that — unlike other Sichuan hot pots which use an open flame — the hot steam keeps the broth piping hot and adds moisture at the same time, so the broth doesn’t dry out or get too salty towards the end of your meal. An ingenious method and true enough, as the meal goes on, the taste of the broth stays consistent throughout.\xa0The flavour of the broth is how a good mala broth should be. Made with a myriad of spices such as Sichuan bean paste, dried Sichuan chillies and peppercorns, garlic and xiang liao (aromatic spices) including liquorice, green cardamom, star anise and cinnamon sticks, the taste has an oil-richness, the right amount of spiciness with that numbing peppercorn sensation and a complex savouriness that mixes black bean paste and stock flavours.The only flavour missing is the taste of rendered beef fat which is traditionally the only oil used in a Sichuan hot pot but has since given way to vegetable oil as diners have become more health-conscious over the years.Besides “Hot & Spicy” which is the original flavour and is what most Sichuan fans will order here, they also have a whole host of other flavours ranging from lobster and Sichuan hot & sour to more interesting regional flavours like Duo Jiao which is more Hunan and consists of chopped red chillis brined and a resultant salty, sour flavour.The level of spiciness can also be customised — level one for a mild spiciness to level three for the real deal.\xa0\xa0Chef TangJudging by its clientele, the two-year-old restaurant seems to get a fair number of regular followers, and a lot of it has to do with its chef-owner Tang, a 48-year-old Sichuan native who has over 30 years of cooking experience. Besides being the senior chef trainer and adviser for the illustrious National Culinary Training School in Sichuan, he was the first master chef at Si Chuan Dou Hua in 2002 and has started up some of Singapore’s top Sichuan restaurants like Lao Sichuan and Ba Yu Ren Jia.\xa0The menu at Taste Known Source Steam Stone Fish runs the gamut of popular Sichuan dishes as well as general Chinese favourites like sweet sour pork and chilli crab (it is a tourist belt after all), and there are two particular dishes which impressed us the most.\xa0\xa0Chong Qing Spicy ChickenFirst is the Chong Qing Spicy Chicken ($18.80) which is exceptional and has been a signature wherever Chef Tang goes. We would go so far to say that it is the best la zi ji that can be found in Singapore. Marinated in doubanjiang (Sichuan chilli bean paste), diced chicken is nicely deep-fried with a juicy texture and is tossed in a mountain of Sichuan peppercorns, dried chilli, ginger slices, spring onions, with sesame seeds and groundnuts. Try just the chicken alone, and you’ll be hit by all the accompanying spices. The overall effect is savoury, spicy, aromatic, numbing and it’s a dish you’ll remember fondly for days after.Ya Bah TuThis dish is something you’ll see on the tables of hardcore Sichuan food fans, but you won’t know how to order it unless you read Chinese. In English, it says Live Frog with Dried Chilli and Chilli Padi ($25.80), but the Mandarin name “Ya Bah Tu” (deaf mute rabbit) explains the dish a bit better.Cooked in a style similar to the more famous Shui Zhu Yu (water cooked fish), intense spices and hot boiling oil is poured over poached frog meat and vegetables but here, the fresh (not dried) green variety of peppercorns — which are directly imported from Sichuan — are used, and it gives the dish an intense aroma.\xa0The flavour is incredibly spicy, and the numbing effect which you get from the peppercorns is incredibly bold here. The addition of sweet leeks helps round out the big savouriness of the dish.Back in Sichuan, this dish would be served with rabbit which explains the name of the dish but as getting a supply of rabbit meat in Singapore is almost non-existent, says Chef Tang, so he substituted frog meat instead. Beef and chicken can also be used instead.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com"]
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/hajjah-meriam-family-stall/:['Rating: 4/5According to Wikipedia, this dish has minced meat, sardines, egg and chopped onions in it and it is fried on a frying pan before being placed into the cavity of a baguette halved lengthwise.\xa0 Can you guess what local food this is?It’s kentang ball – which is a novelty for me. It had mashed potato about the size of a cricket ball filled with minced beef inside. The whole thing was deep fried in a batter and then served in a bowl of spicy chicken soup. Imagine eating mashed potato with minced beef and essentially you have it. Certainly worth a try if you haven’t had it before.The roti john here, on the other hand, is something to rave about. After a bad experience in the past, I was apprehensive about the dish, as I didn’t wish to waste calories on yucky food again. But thankfully, my faith in the good old roti john was restored after I tried the one served here. The crust was toasted till it was light and crispy and the minced mutton in the omelette was savoury and adequately spiced. It came with a great homemade sweet chilli sauce. The roti john is definitely one of the better ones around.Rating – Food: 4; Value: 3; Service: 3\xa0\xa0Hajjah Meriam Family Stall Blk 14, Haig Road Food Centre; #01-15Opening hours: 2pm-10pm (Daily)Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

Also available in the two meat variations mentioned earlier, the well-marinated meat was generously crusted with crushed black pepper.

On the upper floors of its new annex, the Mustafa supermarket is a treasure trove of spices, produce, convenience foods and more, characterised by a what-you-see-is-what-you-get display. We scoured through infinite options to bring you the 10 best buys—some of these you never knew you needed, until now!\xa0\xa0Powdered black saltSaid to have brilliant Ayurvedic properties, and a better choice for a low salt diet—Mumtaz black salt ($2.40), which in its powdered form looks pink/orange, is great for digestive disorders and to keep blood pressure in check. It has a distinct sour taste and is used often to flavour fruit juices and makes for a mean lemonade ingredient.\nTip: Use when you want to a kick in your home-made Mojito.\xa0Chili cheese naanA mind-boggling variety of naan (oven-baked flatbread) are packed into the Mustafa freezers. It was hard to choose but Ashoka’s mini chilli cheese naan ($2.40) came out tops for taste and ingenuity. Fluffy soft bread, stuffed with delish processed cheese flavored with green chillies and spices—it really is a meal in itself. All you need is a microwave, and a little butter for brushing. For those less adventurous, you can go for the plain or garlic versions.\xa0\xa0ColaHere is something new for all cola connoisseurs. Thums Up ($0.80), owned by Coca Cola in India, is a stronger, fizzier and all around more robust cola and a great accompaniment to a meal of spicy chicken tikka (bite-sized chicken pieces cooked with yoghurt and spices) or briyani, some say it has a slight betel nut tang, and is preferred for its mildly unsweetened flavour. Spotted only at Mustafa in Singapore, it can be bought in a six pack as well.\nTip: Goes well with whiskey, if that is your kind of drink.\xa0\xa0Green chilli sauceThe Ching’s Secret green chilli sauce ($2.90) is exclusive to Mustafa and a staple condiment at hawker stalls in India. This blend of pulverised green chillies may look unappetising, but great when drizzled over a bowl of noodles or doused over greasy fried foods.\xa0 \nTip: Try it with a potato curry puff, available at Mustafa’s ground-floor cafe\xa0\xa0MangoesIn the Indian sub-continent the mango is the king of fruits. At Mustafa, the sweet aroma hits as you approach the fresh produce section. Expect baskets of mango varieties from India, Pakistan, Taiwan and Thailand. We spotted Thai mangoes as big as sports shoes and the pulpy Chaunsa from Pakistan—the one from which you ‘drink’ the flesh directly by biting through the skin. Prices begin at $4.90 per kilo and can go up to $27.90.\nTip: For all-round intense flavor, splurge on a case of the Alphonsos.\xa0\xa0Premium quality figsNot only do these make for healthy snacks, the elegantly packaged goodies make for gorgeous gifts. Our pick is the silver etched box of Tari’s Premium Quality Dried Figs ($4.90)y. The figs even come diced, coated with chocolate and stuffed with nuts.\xa0\xa0Rose waterThe best-kept secret from grandma’s beauty stash can be bought for $1.50. Chilled Calcutta rose water can be used as a toner or as an after sun-splash as it is highly anti-inflammatory and has a cooling effect on sensitive skin. Freeze in ice cube trays and rub rose ice on your face for a quick skin spa.\xa0 \nTIP: Rose water may be used for aromatherapy, and to add perfume to food. You can also add a few drops to a pot of briyani.\xa0\xa0SaffronTucked away on a tiny shelf between the dry spices and canned drinks, is the most elusive spice of them all. Packaged in boxes of 1- or 2-grams, the vibrant red threads of saffron emit an aroma even when tightly sealed. The best ones to buy are the Iranian Sargol variety ($10.90)—1 gram is more than enough—a few strands are all you need to flavour an Indian dessert or stir into a risotto. Saffron brings out the best in mascarpone cheese; marry the two to make a killer pasta sauce.\xa0\xa0ShrikhandAmul’s shrikhand (strained yogurt, $4.50) is made of fresh curd, cream and sugar. Semi-soft, this thicker-than-yoghurt healthy dessert has a sweetish sour taste that’s hard to beat. Available in almond and saffron flavors, the almond variety has actual pieces in it, but we like the luxe saffron for its heady aroma.\xa0\xa0Tea spice mix\nWhile age-old establishments around Serangoon Road claim to brew their tea for hours on end with cloves, cardamom and nutmeg, you can have just as satisfying a brew at home with the Ramdev tea masala (spice mix, $2.20).

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/butcheries/:['Mention the word ‘butchery’, and chances are that images of bloodied aprons and hanging carcasses of meat come to mind. But the reality of a modern butchery is poles apart from traditional butcher shops at a wet market. Specialist butcheries are now serving up a range of fresh premium meats in style.A number of premium butcheries have sprung up in Singapore to cater to our evolving tastes. Many well-travelled and well-heeled foodies are no longer content to settle for ready-packed meats from supermarkets. Enter the gourmet butchery, which caters to a growing group who wants the best-tasting cuts and the experience of premium service. Mark Foo, business development director, Swiss Butchery, says this is due to the increasing awareness and affluence amongst Singaporeans. “As more Singaporeans travel, live and study abroad, or visit specialty butcher shops, they get further educated and appreciate the quality and taste of premium meat,” he says.This is one of the reasons behind a rising trend of Singaporeans — and not just expatriates — becoming regulars at these butcheries. In fact, the percentage is about 50-50 for locals and expats patronising Culina’s butchery counters at NTUC Fairprice’s Finest outlets, according to Michael Chong, general manager, Culina. Even at standalone butcheries like Meat The Butcher, around 40% of its customers are locals, says managing director Ronald Ang.\xa0Why buy gourmet?Premium butcheries specialise in providing high quality meats, guaranteed freshness and that little extra — be it in the personalised experience of chatting with the butcher, or having your meat marinated or cut in front of you, to your specific requirements. “You can take your time to discuss with the butcher how you want your meat. He can slice your Parma ham paper thin, or if you’re health-conscious, trim off all the fat from the oxtail. “We can even customise marinates according to your taste-it’s a personal relationship,” Ang says.This experience differs from shopping in a supermarket, where what you see is what you get. At a butcher shop, you may also find premium meat types and cuts that you may not be able to find elsewhere. Plus, you get the assurance of quality, service and properly-handled meat, Foo says. Unlike reading a label off a pre-packed meat, buying from a butcher also means that you can get on-the-spot advice on which cuts are suitable for your needs, and find out how to store and cook it right. “We can help you find exactly what you need for that dinner party, BBQ or family meal and even provide cooking instructions,” says Kellie Webster, communications manager from The Butcher at Holland Village.But the most important reason to go the gourmet way is the guaranteed quality and freshness of the product. Quality doesn’t just mean that the meat tastes better, there are also other implications. According to Webster, “Good quality goes a long way if you purchase good quality meat; it is easier to cook and easier to make your meals taste great. They also tend to be healthier, as less fat is included in products such as sausages, and additives and dyes are not used.”Speciality butchers often fly in their meat direct from countries like Australia and New Zealand — 100% chilled, not frozen, such that freshness is guaranteed. Small premium shops also tend to have a high turnover rate, ensuring that the meat is never left on display for long. In addition, “Most premium butcheries like ours will also vacuum pack the meat you purchase, helping to further extend the shelf-life of the meat,” says Phoebe Oo of Huber’s Butchery.\xa0One-stop-shopOn top of the quality guarantee, gourmet butcheries also offer a wide range of fresh cuts and pre-marinated meats that are not available in regular supermarkets. Wagyu beef, kurobuta pork, Swiss-style cervelat sausages and wild game are just a few of the unusual meats that can’t be bought easily from a regular supermarket, while the convenience of easy-to-cook pre-marinated meats is also a popular hit with many customers. Brenda Korn, a housewife, has recently moved here from USA and is a regular patron of Meat the Butcher. “When I want a good piece of meat, I come here,” she says. “I find that it’s comparable to what I can get back in the US. I usually go for the ribs, marinated lamb chops and beef tenderloin, because it’s very convenient and the quality is good.”Besides meat products, premium butcheries are also stocked with other exotic condiments that can be paired with your meal. Some customers even find that more enticing than just simply, buying meat. Education officer Celine Cheong, 48, who visits Huber’s Butchery or Culina once every fortnight says, “The range of products is the main draw for me. I can get anchovies, feta cheese, yoghurt and cream, at reasonable prices. Of course, the meat range is also very good and I buy pre-marinated meat like shish-kebabs and lamb chops.”But for customers like civil servant Ken Leong, 31, the experience was a little overrated.\xa0 Although he appreciated the excellent service, the taste of the food failed to match up to his expectations. “While there was large variety of marinades, perhaps they were a little too exotic and weren’t exactly to my taste after all,” he says. “The prices were also a little steep.”\xa0To pay or not to pay?While the prices are generally higher at gourmet butcheries than at supermarkets – think $9 to $12 more per kilogram for Australian beef tenderloin, specialist butchers argue that you are paying a premium for the quality. “Meat cuts are not all created equal. Generally, the more expensive cut is usually from a particular part of meat that is more tender and not a working muscle-such as the shoulders and flank, which are tougher and take longer to cook,” explains Foo of Swiss Butchery. The more expensive cuts usually come from the ribs, rump and loin of the animal.Even in terms of processed items like sausages, 500g worth of pork Chipolata can cost up to 30% more at a premium butcher, but the fact is that the range is also a lot wider-you don’t see things like the Polish Kielbasa at a regular grocery store. What a customer should look for is value for money, and one way to stretch your dollar is to buy in bulk. For example, at Peter’s Butchery, purchasing a whole portion (like the whole tenderloin) can save up to 35% of the cost of a pre-cut portion. But for those who are still reluctant to do their weekly meat shopping at a premium butchery, “seasonal shopping” like what Kenneth Goh, 37, does may be more feasible. The wealth manager visits Swiss Butchery about twice a year, mainly when he hosts parties. “I find the selection of pre-marinated meats to be wide and I like to give my guests some variety. So far, I’ve always got good responses,” he says.Another drawback of shopping at premium butcheries is that there are limited outlets, with a large number of them clustered in the Bukit Timah area. So for those who are not willing to make a trip to the nearest butchery, shopping online and making use of their delivery services will be the next best bet. Swiss Butchery’s Foo has a final word of advice for those who are new to gourmet butcheries, “Try new things, and make sure you ask questions! With such a wide range of products to choose from you’ll be delightfully surprised.”\xa0\xa0Don’t know the first thing about choosing meat? Ronald Ang from Meat the Butcher shares some useful tips:1) Check for the ‘bloom of the meat’, which is the reddish colour. Meat should be reddish and not dull and greyish in colour-this indicates that the meat is not fresh.2) Make sure the meat is not slimy or sticky, but firm to the touch.3) There shouldn’t be an offensive smell.4)\xa0 For gourmet beef, look for the marbling-how much inter-muscular fat there is. The higher the marbling, the higher quality and tenderness of the beef.\xa0\xa0Where to go: CulinaMain store: Block 8, Dempsey Road, Tel: 64747338;\nOpening Hours: Mondays to Fridays, 10am to 9pm; Sat & Sun, 9am to 9pm.\nButchery counters at NTUC Fairprice’s Finest in Thomson Plaza, Bukit Timah Plaza and Fairprice Grand Court Orchard.\nWebsite: www.culina.com.sgFounded in 1994, Culina Pte Ltd has been supplying fine food produce to leading hotels and restaurants all over Singapore.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/singapore-hawkers-cook-the-french-way/:['Restaurant kitchens like Picotin and, on a more global scale, the salt-filled kitchens of Gordon Ramsay’s, aren’t the only places you see classic “French” method cooking school techniques being applied.Sure, they may not be in chef’s whites. But our wonderful and beloved hawker uncles and aunties poach, sauté, and roast every day, proving that some cooking techniques are universal around the world, no matter what you call it.\xa0There is one big difference however: hawker chefs get the meal out in minutes, and in a ridiculously tiny kitchen space. Quick meals, freshly made to order, using classic school-taught techniques – you can’t get more skillful on-the-go food than that. We observed some hawker kitchens and took notes:\xa0\xa0Broiling and grilling\nSatay\nThis method of direct cooking either over or under some serious flame gets food cooked fast, and with lots of tasty charred edges to boot. In professional restaurant kitchens, broiling and grilling is performed using the oven broiler, a salamander, or on a gas-fired grill, all under heavy duty hood exhausts used to suck up the billowing smoke. Classic grilled foods include steak, burgers, fish and chicken.Satay is the hawkers answer to grilling. While some hawkers stay inside and under an exhaust fan, most satay chefs\xa0take this flaming technique outside, to take advantage of the open air (smart because it gets mighty hot standing over the fire). Over the heat from a hot charcoal or wood fire, satay chefs fire up seasoned sticks of prawn, chicken, mutton, pork, octopus, beancurd skin – you name it.\xa0\xa0Deep-frying\nYou tiao and hum jin pang\nFood is quickly cooked by immersing in super hot oil for just a few seconds to a few minutes. Restaurant kitchens use a large pot to fry, or have their own commercial frying stations with baskets to lower the food into the oil. Instead of tongs, hawker chefs use large chopsticks to gently turn the food as it fries. Hawker chefs use their wok to fry anything from crispy fish to curry puffs to youtiao (Chinese crullers) and hum jin pang.\xa0\xa0Poaching\nChicken rice\nIn this technique of “immersion wet cooking”, ingredients are slow cooked in a liquid such as water, stock, wine. The temperature is kept barely simmering to cook the food gently. The result is super juicy, tender food.Classic French dishes are poached eggs, poached salmon, and poule au pot, or “poached chicken”.Hawker chefs use this same technique to create the classic Singaporean dish that we all love – Hainanese chicken rice. Here, chicken is gently simmered or poached in a rich but gently seasoned chicken stock until mouth wateringly tender and juicy. Unlike many restaurant poached dishes, where poaching liquids may go down the drain, hawker chefs make the most of it by incorporating the broth into the rice and soup.\xa0\xa0Roasting or barbecuing\nRoast chicken, duck and pork belly\nDry heat is applied indirectly to cook the food, such as in an oven. In restaurant kitchens, big hunks of meat and poultry are set in special roasting pans, which are often on a rack to let the fat drip into the bottom of the pan, and then cooked in the oven. The fat sizzles and melts away in the hot dry air, creating the best part and everyone’s guilty pleasure: that golden crisp and chewy-crunchy skin.Hawker chefs have got the technique down golden, roasting up chicken, duck and pork in their own ovens, narrow enough to fit in a tiny hawker space but tall enough to hang and roast multiple pieces of meat. And just like in Western-style barbecues, an addictive sweet and clingy sauce is slathered onto the meat to caramelise as it roasts.\xa0\xa0Sautéing\nCarrot cake, hokkien mee and char kway teow\nA classic French technique of dry heat cooking. Ingredients are cooked in a pan with oil or butter over moderate heat. To sauté means “to jump”. Applied to cooking, sautéing refers to the way ingredients are tossed and shaken about in the pan. Food is also cut into small pieces so it cooks quickly.Hawker chefs use this same technique 24/7 and you can hear them doing it from a mile away. Instead of the skillet, hawkers tend to use one large wok, with the gas heat operated with a foot pedal instead of the knobs on a stove. Carrot cake, hokkien mee, and char kway teow are cooked this way, and transferred onto your plate in a flash. Add to this the unique essence of\xa0wok hei, a smoky flavour infused into the food that comes from the combo of high heat and a seasoned wok, and we have what sets hawker food apart from French restaurant food. Makes flambé-ing (where the dish is set on fire to burn off alcohol and impart a smoky flavour) look tame, right?\xa0\xa0Steam cooking\nChar siew bao, xiao long bao and dumplings\nAnother form of “wet cooking”. For this method, food is cooked quickly by enclosing it in a super hot and moist environment. This is the perfect cooking technique to prevent food from drying out.In restaurants this is practiced by placing the food in a steamer basket that’s then set within a pot with a few inches of simmering water at the bottom. For larger scale steaming, large commercial sized steamer cabinets are used.Hawker chefs use the steaming method for an infinite number of dishes, especially for dim sum, as well as steamed buns, dumplings, vegetables, and whole fish. Food is set in a bamboo steamer, and then the steamer is placed in a pot or steamer oven.\xa0In her former life in the United States, Yvonne Ruperti was a pastry chef, bakery owner, magazine writer, and cooking show co-host on America’s Test Kitchen TV.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/boeuf/:['Steak is probably one of the most beloved dishes in the world. Alas, steakhouses are often lavish affairs and not the most wallet-friendly.If you’re one of those beef fans who can’t justify the price of dining out at Singapore’s usual fancy steakhouses, then you’ve to check out Boeuf, a casual steak restaurant along Telok Ayer Street.Because, unlike many of its competitors, Bouef focuses on both quality and affordability.One of the great deals you can find on its menu is a recently launched free-flow all-day ribeye promo, where you get two hours to devour all the Argentinian ribeye steak you can stomach for S$48++.It’s available only on weekends, from 12pm to 10.30pm, with last orders at 9.30pm. That’s a pretty good price, considering a single portion of 200g alone costs S$32.The cut in focus is an Argentinean Aberdeen black Angus 300+ days grass-fed that Boeuf has specially sourced. Ours was given a quick sear and arrived magnificently luscious and medium-rare, while carrying a satisfying whiff of smokiness.If you’re a smaller eater, there’s something for you, too. Reach for one of the three-course set menus available for lunch and dinner on weekdays.\xa0At S$29.90, Boeuf’s three-course set lunch is quite reasonably priced for an eatery in the oft-expensive CBD, considering steak is one of the main options.\xa0Available from 12pm to 3pm, it starts with a classic wedges salad before you’re served your choice of mains: A wagyu beef burger, Boeuf’s signature steak tartare, or black Angus flank steak.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50% off at picturesque date spots, including Wildseed Cafe at The Alkaff Mansion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou’d also be served either coffee or tea, along with macarons, as post-mains refreshments.\xa0The three-course set dinner, available from 5.30pm to 9.30pm, is also pretty good value if you’re looking for a convenient date spot after work.\xa0Appetisers are a choice between the burratina di puglia or signature beef carpaccio. The mains are a bit more indulgent with three rich proteins to choose from: Australian MB2 ribeye steak, USDA prime sirloin steak or chicken roulade.\xa0Boeuf then ends the dinner with an impeccably caramelised classic creme brulee that hits all the right spots.On occasions where you’re feeling a bit more fancy, there’s a plethora of even higher-quality beef dishes available at Boeuf.\xa0A lavish option is the signature dry-aged prime rib bone-in (1kg at S$18/100g), which is precisely aged in-house for 30 days.\xa0The beef is seasoned with Cognac and porcini mushroom powder before ageing, to lock in all that richness and ensure an immensely luscious mouthfeel. Other popular a la carte options include the wagyu tartare (S$28), made from quality MB5 wagyu rump, and sinfully rich bone marrow (S$30).Wine aficionados can also consider tapping into Boeuf’s extensive wine curation, since all bottles are given a 15% markdown at the second-storey wine lounge between Tuesdays and Saturdays, from 3pm till late, with every purchase of a cheese or charcuterie board.If you want both affordability and variety, the board Minnie (S$48) is one of the top recommendations, since it comes with two types of cheese, umami bresaola (air-dried, salted beef), and tangy veal rilette.EDITOR’S NOTE: Boeuf’s free-flow ribeye promotion was previously available on weekends and public holidays, from 12pm to 3pm and 5.30pm to 9.30pm. The restaurant’s latest update is that it would be offered from 12pm to 10.30pm only on weekends, with last orders at 9.30pm.For other ideas on what to eat in Telok Ayer, read our reviews of Supercurry and Aisyah Restaurant.\xa0Boeuf is on the GrabFood delivery service and offers free delivery (up to S$3 off) with GrabUnlimited.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/cereal-citizen/:['If you spend plenty of time on social media, you’ll probably have seen one of those foodie videos profiling Cereal Killer, a super cool cereal cafe in London. But here’s some good news for cereal lovers who can’t afford a plane ticket to the UK – we’ve now got our very own cereal cafe in Singapore, so that’s one more option for whenever you’re craving for something sweet!First things first: the cafe in question is called Cereal Citizen, and it’s not affiliated to Cereal Killer whatsoever. Cereal Citizen was actually started by Ang Qiu Ting (better known as Bong Qiu Qiu), Rachell Tan (Pxdkitty), and their friend Carolyn Lim. Whilst Cereal Killer serves over 120 types of cereal, Cereal Citizen only has 24 varieties on their menu as of well; that having been said, they do have other offerings such as sweet and savoury Crododos (donut-shaped croissants), ice cream, and milkshakes.Whilst the space they occupy is pretty small, it’s clear that the owners of Cereal Citizen have put quite a bit of thought into the ~aesthetic~ of their cafe. On the first level, the friendly cashier who takes our order isn’t standing behind a boring old counter, but a faux pushcart decked out with a pink and white striped awning. There’s a neon pink sign bearing the cafe’s name displayed proudly on the wall, and several posters – all in pastel tones, of course – brighten up the space.The staircase to the second level is rainbow-coloured, and as Qiu Qiu shares in an Instagram post, this staircase is fast becoming a favourite amongst Instagrammers in search of that perfect backdrop for their #OOTD pictures. On the second level, apart from seating space, there’s a play area which consists of hula hoops, a toddler-sized rocking horse, and even a miniature kitchen. There’s also a vintage radio that we wish we could steal, and the windows are adorned with gauzy curtains and fairy lights.Moving on to the food! From the menu, we ordered the Cereal + Ice Cream ($4.90) and the Crododo + Milkshake ($10.90), both pictured below, as well as the Crododo + Tuna ($9.90).Out of these three items, the least impressive of the lot was the Cereal + Ice Cream. Although 24 cereals seems like a pretty decent list to choose from, all the options are fairly mainstream (we’re talking Fruit Loops, Coco Pops, and Milo Balls), and we didn’t see any exotic or hard-to-find cereals. Whilst the Rainbow ice-cream we ordered looked very pretty, its taste was slightly reminiscent of cough syrup. They do have other ice cream flavours (vanilla, chocolate, yam, matcha), though, so we’d recommend trying another flavour, or getting your cereal with milk instead.Moving on to the Crododo + Milkshake – you get to choose the cereal you’d like to be served atop your Crododo, and there are also several options for the milkshake (Chocolate Banana, Strawberry, Strawberry Banana, Matcha, Yam, Banana, and the best-selling Oreo, which we ordered). Texture-wise, the Crododo isn’t super similar to a croissant – it’s denser, and not as light and flaky. That having been said, the Crododo is still pretty fragrant and buttery, and makes for a decent snack. We also liked the milkshake – whilst the consistency could’ve been a bit thicker, they were extremely generous with the Oreo bits, and that’s what makes or breaks an Oreo milkshake, isn’t it?Last but not least, the Crododo Tuna (Tomato & Onion or Mayonnaise Corn, served with teriyaki sauce, cherry tomatoes and cornflakes) is pretty palatable. If you don’t have that huge of a sweet tooth, we’d say order one sweet item and one savoury Crododo (apart from tuna, they also serve Crododo with guacamole) to balance out the flavours.Bottom line? If you love checking out new cafes and Instagramming your finds, definitely pay a visit to Cereal Citizen (and take a picture with their pastel rainbow staircase). Ambience and Instagram-worthiness wise, this cafe is definitely a frontrunner. As for the food? It’s worth a try, but we’ll be more excited when/if they start introducing more exotic cereals from overseas.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

You’ve now got a new, cooler cousin: the nasi lemak curry puff from Old Chang Kee.The curry puff chain has launched the Nasi Lemak Chicken’o — a marriage between one of Singapore’s most popular dishes, and one of her most iconic snacks.Instead of the usual potato or sardine filling, this curry puff contains many ingredients you’ll find in nasi lemak: peanuts, ikan bilis, and sambal. And just as its name suggests, the Nasi Lemak Chicken’o also contains chunks of chicken.Alas, there’s no basmati or jasmine rice, but the pastry shell has been infused with pandan essence and coloured green.Yes, we know this whole thing feels super gimmicky, but it’s actually quite tasty, and it’s definitely more nasi lemak-y than McDonald’s Nasi Lemak Burger last year.The pandan-infused pastry shell doesn’t quite work — it’s no where as fragrant as piping-hot coconut rice — but the Nasi Lemak Chicken’o does nail the spicy-sweet sambal, which definitely delivers a fiery kick.Our Nasi Lemak Chicken’o also contained generous amounts of ikan bilis, peanuts, and chicken chunks.So, our verdict? It’s not particularly original, and yes it may feel gimmicky, but it’s a perfectly serviceable, fairly tasty snack.At $2 for one, and $3.50 for two, it’s also reasonably priced.You can get the Nasi Lemak Chicken’o at all Old Chang Kee outlets in Singapore from 1 March 2018, while stocks last.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

Examine the ingredients closer, and you’ll notice that they also throw in soft sheets of dried fish maw, an uncommon ingredient but works well in sopping up the gravy.Also a must-order is their chicken rice as it has an old-school taste profile to it.The white poached chicken is beautifully tender and soft and the roasted chicken — while usually drier than white chicken — comes more tender than usual.It is drenched in a strong complex savoury sauce with liberal slathers of sesame oil and there are no sweet notes in the taste.\nIt’s a stark contrast to the other popular stall at the Food Centre — Hainanese Boneless Chicken Rice, where the saucing comes savoury sweet.The rice comes quite firm with strong ginger notes and not much chicken fat oiliness, a good contrast to the oil-rich chicken.The chilli sauce is spicy and sweet. It works well when eaten in conjunction with the rice and the chicken.Also unusual is the ginger which comes pure minced and plain with no seasoning.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

The black-and-blue-fronted diner can seat about 30 customers; at our lunchtime visit, there were at least 10 customers in line.What to eat: Ramen Bar Suzuki claims they sell the ‘real’ traditional tonkotsu (Japanese for ‘pork bone’) noodles, and further exerts that ‘there are only two places in Singapore’ that serve the authentic deal. (When asked, they revealed the other is Ippudo.)Ramen Bar Suzuki offers three ramen choices — the basic white, red (hot and spicy), and black\xa0— similar to the other ramen shops such as Keisuke Tokyo and Menya Musashi.Authentic tonkotsu is generally distinguished by its cream-coloured broth made by boiling pork bones, fat and collagen for six to eight hours. While most other shops add chicken or vegetable stock or soy sauce for flavour, the broth is left un-enhanced here.The signature white ramen ($12.90) is cloudy and thick, without the unpleasant smell of pork bones. It is less salty than most other versions in Singapore; we think it tastes pure.\xa0The jet-black ramen ($13.90) is a richer option with garlic and squid ink, with more flavour.The noodles made from Japanese wheat are thin, similar in thickness to the local mee kia (Chinese dialect for ‘kid noodles’, similar to/ what is used in wanton noodles). This stays true to the Japanese spirit of tonkotsu noodles which are made thinner so that they can be cooked and served faster to busy Japanese workers. Unfortunately, we thought that the thin noodles were a little too soggy.Those not here for the ramen can still get full on the unlimited servings of steamed rice, bean sprouts, potato salad and hard-boiled eggs during lunch; and fresh cabbage for dinner.\xa0Ramen Bar Suzuki | Address: 61 Circular Road, #01-01 | Opening hours: Mon-Sat 11.30am-3pm, 5.30pm-midnightAuthor© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/potato-head/:['If you Google “things to do in Bali”, Potato Head will probably be featured in just about every list that pops up.For those who aren’t acquainted with the place, it’s a beach club – actually, the most iconic beach club in Bali. It’s where you go to sling back a cocktail or two, witness an amazing sunset, and see and be seen.Whilst Three Buns @ Potato Head Singapore is by the same guys behind Potato Head in Bali, the concept is a little different. For one, Three Buns @ Potato Head Singapore specializes in gourmet burgers – these are freshly prepared daily, and incorporate house-made relishes and artisan buns.If you love your food spicy, you’ll be won over by the Burning Man ($20). Consisting of prime 120g beef patty, applewood smoked cheddar, roasted jalapeño relish, hot ketchup & dashi mayo, this burger is packed with spunk and heat; you might just have to wash it down with a cocktail or two.Then there’s the Fun Boy Three ($23), which comes with a 150g Black Angus beef patty, applewood smoked cheddar, roasted portobello mushroom, garlic & miso butter, and truffle aioli. The beef and mushroom combination isn’t by any means inspiring, but the truffle aioli definitely saves the day; extra points are also awarded for the demi brioche bun, which is toasted to perfection.Last but not least, the Watermelon Man ($19) might look strange on paper, but the ingredients in this burger complement each other in the most unexpected way. Other than a 150g Black Angus beef patty, you have a slice of watermelon which is grilled, spiced, and caramelized, sandwiched between quader de cavra cheese, ketchup, pickled onions, and three islands mayo.This is the first time we’re having watermelon in a savoury dish, but it’s surprisingly good. It’s crunchy, juicy, spicy, sweet, and refreshing at the same time; these flavours contrast beautifully against the slight tanginess of the creamy quader de cavra.Also new on the menu are three rice bowls – the Burning Rice ($17), the Bellyfull ($18), and the Pokemon ($19).The Burning Rice is essentially the Burning Man, reinvented as a rice bowl. Comprising of stir fried rice, 100g Black Angus beef patty, gochujang (a fermented Korean paste made out of red chilli and glutinous rice), scallions, dashi mayo, cheddar cheese and fried shallots, this is a hearty, spicy dish that will fill you up to the brim.The Bellyfull, on the other hand, features twice cooked and miso glazed Dingley Dell belly pork. This is topped with confit daikon, baby kailan, a free range egg, and fried shallots. We’ve got nothing but lovely things to say about the pork, which is amazingly juicy and succulent.Last but not least, the Pokemon is a strong contender for those who love their poké bowls. This sumptuous rice bowl comes loaded with marinated yellowfin tuna akami, ponzu, organic quinoa, avocado, daikon, tomato, cucumber, jalapeno, and spiced mayo. Whilst this is probably the healthiest dish on the menu, it certainly holds its own amongst the other items in terms of taste.Given how filling the mains are, we know this is a tall order, but don’t leave without trying Tree Buns @ Potato Head’s sides and desserts. We like the Naughty Fries ($13, comes with spiced béarnaise, hot beef chilli, crisp shallots, parmesan & sesame seeds); they also have Corny Fries ($9, a meat-free cousin of the Naughty Fries which incorporates charred and pickled sweetcorn).For dessert, go for the Open Hot Cookie Ice Cream Sandwich ($7, featuring a chocolate chip and honey roasted almond cookie, vanilla ice cream puck, and a chocolate & coconut ice “magic style” sauce). You’ll have to wait 15 minute for this, but it’s worth it! Also equally tempting is Big Poppa’s Banana and Hot Butterscotch sundae ($10, this is a decadent combination of vanilla ice cream, espresso caramelised banana, hot salted butterscotch, banana jelly, toasted walnuts, coco nibs & chantilly cream).Apart from their finger-lickin grub, Potato Head Folk, along with other bars in Singapore have released a new line-up of unique cocktails.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/craft-beers/:['So it’s a week to pay day and the clock has ticked past all reliable happy hours. What do you do if you want a beer? Well, there’s more to budget drinking than a tall can of questionable strong brew from a convenience store.Here are five places you can head to for a proper drink even after your bank balance drops to two figures:\xa0The Cider Pit\nFor British beers and more\nIf it weren’t for East of Avalon Wines and its spin-off — The Cider Pit — our knowledge of cider in Singapore would not have gone past Strongbow and E33 (remember that stuff?). Thanks to them we also have access to more British beers than the average town drunk in old Blighty.The Cider Pit might be in its third incarnation along Joo Chiat Road, but its focus hasn’t changed: a selection of around 50 beers from the simple to the special with a couple of local craft beers thrown in for good measure. Prices start at $5 for half pints ($10 for pints) of beer and cider on tap, a list which currently includes Badger Hopping Hare, Cider Pit Premium Lager (brewed by Brewerkz) and Aspall Draught.For $6 a half pint, you can move up to Jungle Beer’s Kiasu Stout, the best beer in the world according to the Asia Beer Awards 2013. Bottled specialty beers start at $8 for 330ml and $10 for 500ml.\xa0\nThe Cider Pit | Address: 328 Joo Chiat Road,#01-03 | Tel: 64400504 | Opening hours: Mon-Fri 5pm-1am; Sat & Sun 1pm-1am \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\nBottles & Taps\nFor unusual beers in an unlikely location\nIf you live in the North-East, your trek to hop heaven is now a lot shorter. Opened about two months ago in a location that wasn’t quite synonymous with unusual beers, Bottles & Taps is already garnering a small following. It has 50 beers to choose from, with the list growing by the day. Currently on tap are BrewDog’s Dead Pony Club and Punk IPA as well as Wychwood’s Hobgoblin, going at $12 a pint. Most of Brewerkz’s bottled beers line the fridge and cost $8 to $9 while Stone’s Levitation Ale is also $9 (all 330ml bottles). A variety of interesting lesser-known beers are in the same price range too, like the Kiwi duo of Tuatara IPA ($10) and Yeastie Boys’ tea-infused Gunnamatta IPA ($11), along with Western Australia’s Feral Hop Hog ($10).\nBottles & Taps | Address: 1G Yio Chu Kang Road | Tel: 96612111 | Opening hours: Daily 6.30pm–midnight\xa0Smokey’s BBQ\nFor American beers\nAs a result of the 20 or so hours it takes to get American beers here from the West Coast of the US, ‘affordable’ is a bit of a relative term. Fortunately, there are places like Smokey’s, and with outlets in Joo Chiat and Clementi (Sunset Lane to be precise), they’ve covered both halves of the island. The down-home grill and bar has full ranges of Gordon Biersch, Victory, Stone, Rogue, Anderson Valley, Deschutes and Lagunitas with most bottles priced at $12 or $14. Mixed bucket options bring the prices down further. Archipelago is on tap at the Joo Chiat outlet, while the one in Clementi pours RedDot (both from $8 a half-pint).\nSmokey’s BBQ | Address: 73 Joo Chiat Place and Blk 106 Clementi Street 12, #01-54/56 | Tel: 63456914 (Joo Chiat) and 68726857 (Clementi) | Opening hours: Tue–Thu 3–11pm; Fri–Sun 3pm–midnight\xa0Stew Küche\nFor German and Belgian brews in a kopitiam\nOur hawker centres and coffee shops are among the country’s most economical watering holes; a fact that the colourful cast of flush-faced regulars at your local kopitiam will attest to when they’re not asleep at their tables. The Good Beer Company was one of the first to bring craft beer to these humble venues, and, of course, you already know all about them.Another place we like with the same spirit is Stew Küche, located in a coffeeshop on the fringe of the Bukit Merah car and motorcycle workshop area (the same one that’s home to De Burg and Brown Sugar by Eskimo). The restaurant-slash-stall serves up some wunderbar German cuisine and also has a dedicated beer counter where pints of Archipelago and Schneider Weisse will only set you back $8 and $9 respectively. Belgian bottles start at $8 while half-litres of English beer are available from $10. This is, at heart, still a coffee shop, so if you’re all about keeping it real, you can have a big bottle of Carlsberg for $6.\nStew Küche |\xa0Address: Blk 119 Bukit Merah Lane 1, #01-40 | Tel: 62766445 | Opening hours: Tue-Fri 11am-3pm and 5-10pm; Sat & Sun 11am-3pm and 5-11pm\xa0WitBier Cafe\xa0\nFor Belgian and German beers\nLocated in a quieter section of Kampong Glam but still a short walk from the busy Bali Lane, Haji Lane and Arab Street stretch, WitBier Cafe was started up by the team which used to run Just Beer at Atrium @ Orchard. The bar specialises in Belgian and German beers and has a loyal following of patrons who make good use of its welcoming prices. There are four beers on tap which cost $7 a half pint or $23 a jug — Titje, Belgian Real Pils, Warsteiner and König Ludwig Dunkel. Bottles start at $7 too, which will get you a Silly Saison or any of a variety of lambic beers from Timmermans and Liefmans. Add another dollar and you can choose from Vedett and the Australian pair of Boag’s and Cooper’s.\nWitBier Cafe\xa0| Address: 32 Kandahar Street | Tel: 62942377 | Opening hours: Daily 4pm-1am\xa0 A beer enthusiast first and a writer second, Kurt Ganapathy has tried over a thousand brews from 80 countries. Some of his most memorable exploits include tackling the one-time world’s strongest beer – BrewDog’s 41% abv Sink The Bismarck! – and getting his name on the wall of an Irish pub in Melbourne for drinking 100 pints of Guinness (not in one sitting, of course).Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/the-seasons/:['Steamboat and buffet lovers, take note. Tucked away in a quiet corner at Holland Village is The Seasons restaurant, which isn’t quite your typical Chinese steamboat joint.\xa0For one thing, they serve coconut chicken steamboat here, with the soup base comprising of kampung chicken and fresh coconut water (said to help with hydration, moisturize your skin, and even weight loss). Also, all the dishes served at The Seasons are MSG-free, so you can go ahead and indulge without getting that icky parched feeling at the end of your meal.To start off, order the signature Nourishing Coconut Chicken Hotpot ($26.80), which comes with a light, fragrant soup base. The Seasons also serves several “premium” versions of this hotpot including the Sea Cucumber Coconut Chicken Hotpot ($36.80) and the Bamboo Fungus Coconut Chicken Hotpot ($32.80), but we’d recommend sticking with the basic version and supplementing your meal with the various meats instead.\xa0Take your pick from the Pork Belly ($14), Pork Shoulder ($17), Australian Wagyu ($18) and the American Wagyu ($18). There are also seafood items such as the Mashed Shrimp ($18) on the menu; with its extraordinarily springy texture, it’s easy to see why this is a bestseller.\xa0For best results, be sure to use the handy hourglass provided at each table. After you’ve started your steamboat and loaded it up with kampung chicken, put the lid on and turn the hourglass over. Once five minutes are up, you should dig into the chicken immediately; any longer, and the meat will be overcooked.\xa0To complement the food, sand ginger from Guangdong, China, is also provided as a condiment. This is said to aid in detoxing the body and improves both blood circulation and digestion. Taste wise, the sand ginger is mildly spicy with a slight hint of pungency; it pairs pretty nicely with the meat and gives it more depth.\xa0Other than the raw items, there are also plenty of cooked dishes available at The Seasons. The Purple Sweet Potato Cheese Balls ($8) are extremely popular and typically sells out by around 7pm; we also like the Fried Squid ($8) which is crunchy and full of umami flavours.\xa0To wash it all down, we suggest the Grapefruit Peach Tea ($4.50; pictured on the left), which is highly refreshing. Alternatively, go for the Salted Green Tea with Lime ($4.50; comes with a slightly salty aftertaste without being overwhelming salty.) If you’re in the mood for alcohol, the restaurant also serves Watermelon Shochu ($9.80), High Ball ($15), and a range of beer, sake, dessert wine and even champagne.\xa0If you still have space for dessert, try The Seasons’ Coconut Jelly ($8), which will end your meal on a perfect (and not too sweet!) note.All in all, The Season’s signature coconut chicken hotpot is definitely much less intense (but still delicious!) compared to the spicy, oily mala hotpots which are now hugely popular in Singapore. With its healthy, non-oily steamboat options, The Seasons is ideal for diners who want to have their cake and eat it at the same time. Head down to their restaurant, located just a minute away from Holland Village MRT Station, for a hearty and satisfying meal which isn’t too sinful.\xa0This is a hearty, comforting dip. Fresh-cooked spinach is combined with cream cheese, and scented with cumin. A touch of hot chilli flakes and vinegary hot sauce add a bit of heat to balance out the richness. As a final touch, a handful of mozzarella on top bakes to gooey perfection in the oven. The filling can be cooked ahead and refrigerated, then sprinkled with cheese and baked when ready to serve.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

Restaurants and eateries developed enticing menus that demonstrate how healthy eating can be easy, convenient and delicious, too.\xa0Fish & CoThe popular family chain, Fish & Co, created a new menu called the “Under 500 Club” which features a few of its signature dishes prepared in smaller health-improved portions. The Baked Salmon with Citrus Crust is moist and light in flavour with slight crunch enhanced by the tanginess of the citrus. It’s served with seasonal vegetables poached simply so they retain their natural sweetness and a side of creamy mushroom sauce laced with garlic to bind all the elements together.Another favourite is the Shrimp and Clam Aglio Olio which makes use of wholemeal pasta cooked al dente, tossed in garlic, herbs and olive oil spiked with red chillies. We are also fond of the Peri Peri Prawns served with velvety mashed potato and the Baked Cod with Spicy Teriyaki, a combination of sweet and spicy that’s irresistible.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/toast-hut/:['Local coffee, kaya toast and soft boiled eggs for half the price of what the competition sells it for — this is what Toast Hut is all about.Started in 2007 by a young hawkerpreneur Melvin Soh, the now 35-year-old worked in various coffee chains before getting interested in traditional coffee and toast.He set up shop at Old Airport Road Food Centre and the local breakfast sets from Toast Hut are comparable to those dished out by the bigger kaya toast/coffee chains with some noticeable differences here and there.Soh uses small sized eggs instead of the large, oversized eggs used at Yakun Toast, but that isn’t really a minus point as the majority of local breakfast eateries — even a big chain like Killiney Kopitiam — uses small eggs.\xa0At Toast Hut, they are cooked to the firmer side of soft-boiled, where the yolk is slightly more solid, as opposed to being runny.The kaya toast at Toast Hut is similar to Yakun’s version, albeit with a slightly thicker toast, which results in a slightly less crisp texture.The green kaya used is also less sweet, about as sweet as the kaya which Ya Kun uses.\xa0They also do not add large slabs of cold salted butter in their toast. The salted butter is at room temperature when added to the toast, so it is more or less all melted by the time you bite into it.The coffee is roughly the same as is served by bigger chains. Perhaps a little less robust, but only a little.In addition to kaya toast, they also sell French toast, sandwiches with tuna, ham & cheese, ham & egg and Giant Bun — a fluffier, eggier bun, toasted and filled with salted butter and kaya.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/hokkaido-sushi-restaurant/:['Move aside, salmon. When it comes to sashimi, the bluefin tuna is gonna win hands down in this popularity contest.Hokkaido Sushi Restaurant recently up their buffet game\xa0with the introduction of Hon-Maguro (Bluefin Tuna) Week. In addition to the all-you-can-eat Japanese buffet, all diners will get a\xa0free hon-maguro sashimi platter. The buffet is going at $38 for lunch (U.P $48) and $43 for dinner (U.P. $55) until end September 2016.Hon-maguro from Japan’s famed Tsukiji Market will be air-flown in every month (2nd or 3rd Tuesday of the month, subject to availability) and served that very evening so the\xa0tuna sashimi reaches the diner’s plates within 12 hours for maximum freshness.\xa0If you happen to go down on the evening of the very Tuesday when the bluefin tuna arrives, you will be privy to a spectacular show of fish cutting by the chefs at Hokkaido Sushi Restaurant, in which the entire fish is slowly carved into immaculate slices.\xa0Three cuts of the Hon-Maguro will be offered as a complimentary sashimi platter (U.P. $38, a slice of each cut) to all guests of The Hokkaido Buffet Experience—Otoro (Extra Fatty Tuna), Chutoro (Fatty Tuna) and Akami (Lean Tuna).The crimson hued Akami is the leanest cut with a slightly chewier and tougher texture than other cuts of tuna.\xa0The otoro is the fattiest portion of the tuna, and found on the under belly of the fish. Resembling marbled steak, this fatty cut is melt-in-your-mouth tender and just glided down our tongues.\xa0The chutoro strikes a middle ground between the two other cuts, softer than the akami, but less fatty than the otoro.Expertly sliced by the chefs, the wedges of tuna were thick, substantial and so flavourful that it didn’t require any embellishment with soy sauce or wasabi.\xa0True to the Japanese’s mottainai\xa0(no wastage) culture,\xa0even the scraps of flesh near the bone area were carefully scraped together and presented as spoonfuls of minced tuna. They even offered us a taste of tuna bone marrow (not offered on the buffet menu), which has a wobbly jelly-like texture, is free of any aroma, and tastes pretty clear, with a mild fishy flavour. Try putting in a special request to chef as they’re cutting up the fish and maybe they might let you try some too.While the bluefin tuna is the star of the show, the rest of the buffet spread is a big draw as well. You order the signature dishes a la carte style instead of heaping your plate at food stations.Here are some must-eats at the buffet:Pitan TofuThe pitan tofu features pillowy soft tofu drenched in a savoury century egg sauce, and topped with spring onions and Tobiko. With its umami goodness and silky smoothness, it’s no doubt this is a crowd favourite.Ikura Chawanmushi\xa0The Ikura Chawanmushi —the steamed egg custard was suitably creamy and smooth while the plump salmon roe that tops it sent bursts of flavour rippling through our mouths.Assorted sushiThis buffet also scores high marks on the sashimi and sushi front. A platter of assorted sushi includes Aburi Salmon Mentaiko (seared salmon sushi topped with Mentaiko), Ebi (seared prawn sushi) and Hamachi Truffle (yellowtail fish topped drizzled with truffle oil). The salmon and ebi was sufficiently scorched and boasted a smoky flavour, while the truffle oil elevated the flavour of the hamachi. To prevent the sushi from being too sticky, the chefs use organic, high grade Nanatsuboshi rice.SashimiFor sashimi, they offer key varieties like Maguro, Mekajiki (Swordfish), Hamachi, Salmon, Octopus, and Scallops. You can order them together or separately, but we encourage trying them all as they encompass a spectrum of textures, such as chewy for the octopus and tender for the scallop and salmon.\xa0The fish and seafood at Hokkaido Sushi Restaurant is procured and flown in from Tsujiki and Sapporo twice a week, hence their freshness.* Hon-Maguro Week is an ad-hoc event that takes place depending on the availability of the prized fish. To find out when it’s taking place, check out Hokkaido Sushi Restaurant’s facebook page for shout-outs.* Any orders of hon-maguro beyond the complimentary platter will be charged at an a la carte price: $36 for Otoro, $24 for Chutoro and $15 for Akami (3 slices each).* The promotional price is valid till end of September 2016. All guests sitting at the same table have to take up the buffet. There will be no takeaways or leftovers, and leftovers are chargeable at an a la carte price.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/bake-cheese-tart/:['Spoiler alert:\xa0 BAKE CHEESE TART is a party in your mouth.The famous Hokkaido double baked cheese tart has sparked a crazy following across Asia with its\xa0glorious fluffy cheese mousse encased in a sturdy tart shell.With a total of 13 stores, nine in Japan and four others in the rest of Asia including Hong Kong, Seoul and Bangkok. Come 29 April 2016, it is opening its first flagship outlet in Singapore at Orchard ION. This outlet in Singapore will be self-owned, not franchised.Here’s an insider peek into the kitchen of BAKE CHEESE TART Singapore a day before its opening.Everything is made from scratch in Hokkaido. The cheese tarts are double baked — meaning that the tart shell is baked first and filled with cream cheese\xa0in Kinotoya, Hokkaido. Then the semi-finished cheese tarts are air flown to the shops in Singapore.At the shop in Singapore, the tarts are individually brushed with egg wash before being put into the oven to bake at 205°C for 10 minutes.There is only one oven in the Singapore outlet. While the oven can hold up to 10 trays each time, only three trays of tarts are put in to ensure that the tarts are browned and cooked evenly. Each tray can hold up to approximately 36 tarts. This means that each baking process will produce only about 100 tarts even if there is a long queue waiting.After the second baking, the tarts emerge with beautifully browned tops.\xa0The tarts are usually allowed to rest for about 10 minutes before being served. Each cheese tart will sell for $3.50 or $19.50 for half\xa0a dozen in Singapore.Depending on whether you choose to eat it hot from the oven or when it’s been slightly cooled down, it will have a different textre on the inside. When it’s hot, the interior is more like an molten oozy liquid (right). But when it’s slightly cooled, the texture becomes a tender cheesy dream (left).BAKE CHEESE TART originated from the old school Kinotoya confectionery in Hokkaido Japan. Founded since 1983, the bakery is very well known for its chilled blueberry cheese tarts.But here’s a part of the story that you might not know. Back in 2011, Shintaro Naganuma (the second generation owner) was in Singapore to do a pop-up event at Liang Court in one of their regular Hokkaido-themed food fairs\xa0selling the signature Kinotoya chilled blueberry cheese tarts. When he ran out of storage boxes, he decided to offer the tarts freshly baked and still warm from the oven. A long queue ensued and the warm cheese tarts were a smash hit success.Since then,\xa0Naganuma started branching out from Kinotoya to open BAKE Cheese Tart shops that sold\xa0warm from the oven cheese tarts instead of the chilled version. The rest is history.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

The branch will be the casual-dining brand’s first outpost in Southeast Asia.The branch’s exact location has yet to be confirmed. Korean F&B company SPC Group, the same group that introduced Shake Shack and Paris Baguette to the island, will also run Eggslut’s Singapore outlet.Eggslut was co-founded in 2011 by Filipino-American chef Alvin Cailan and his cousin Jeff Vales. It began as a humble LA-based food truck that is now a global egg-loving empire that it is today.The chain also has branches in ten countries around the world, including America, the UK, Japan and South Korea. In 2014,\xa0Bon Appétit\xa0magazine named Eggslut one of the US’ “top ten new restaurants”.Eggslut honours its irreverent name through its relatively simple menu, which centres oozy, no-frills egg sandwiches. The brand transforms the egg sandwich, traditionally considered strictly breakfast food, into an all-day gourmet experience.\xa0One of Eggslut’s cult favourites is its sinful take on the classic Bacon, Egg & Cheese. Crispy applewood smoked bacon, melted cheddar cheese, cage-free over-medium egg (which means runny egg yolk goodness!), and tangy chipotle ketchup are all dished up in a buttery brioche bun.Another menu highlight is The Slut: a smooth potato purée topped by cage-free coddled egg, seasoned with grey salt and chives, and served in an Instagram-worthy jar. Crispy slices of toasted baguette are also available, perfect for scooping up the springy egg.Pair your egg sandwich with other menu offerings – freshly-squeezed orange juice or a salted chocolate chip cookie to add something sweet to the “eggy”-ness.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/ice-kachang/:['From a simple serving of sweetened red beans and shaved ice, ice kachang has undergone several makeovers to become the colorful dessert it is today. It’s now the norm to find grass jelly, green chendol, multi-colored jelly cubes, creamed corn, and attap chee (palm seed) hidden within a mound of shaved ice. When we were kids, the best part of ice kachang was the thrill of digging into the ice to see how many attap chee we could find.Purists say that the heart of ice kachang is the red beans. Indeed, it is getting increasingly harder to find ice kachang with well-cooked red beans. Other factors that go into a good ice kachang include the texture of the ice, the quality of the other ingredients, as well as the flavourings – gula melaka, evaporated milk, syrup, etc – that go into creating the overall taste of this refreshing dessert.Finding the perfect ice kachang proved to be as daunting as searching for that elusive attap chee under a mountain of ice. But here at inSing.com, we’ve found a few excellent ones that ice kachang lovers should not miss!\xa0Annie’s Peanut Ice KachangOpening hours: Mon-Fri: 10.30am-7pm; Sat-Sun: 10.30am-5pm\nPrice: $1.50\nRating: 4.5/5What makes this ice kachang so fabulous? It’s the addition of peanuts that has made so many fans go nutty over this unique version! The crushed peanuts were very fragrant, light in texture, and neither too coarse nor too fine. Besides peanuts, creamed corn and cooked red beans generously adorned a tall mound of airy, finely shaved ice that melted very slowly. The red beans were a little mushy, but provided just the right contrast against the crunchy peanut. Most of the flavour came from the red beans and peanuts. The chendol strips and black jelly cubes hidden within were quite bland and didn’t offer much taste except texture. Also, there was no attap chee! We thought the overall taste could be sweeter, but on the whole, this was one ice kachang we were absolutely addicted to!\xa0\xa0Healthy Buds Desserts & Hong Kong Style Snack\n335 Smith Street, #02-116, Smith Street Food CentreOpening hours: 9.30am – 9pm daily\nPrice: $1.50\nRating: 4/5Healthy doesn’t mean nasty. The ice kachang here was a surprise find and a hidden gem! As the stall uses only healthy and natural ingredients, you will not find artificially coloured syrup on your ice kachang here. Only lashings of fragrant gula melaka and evaporated milk were used to flavour the shaved ice. Additional flavour came from a generous amount of creamed corn. There were also plenty of chunky grass jelly strips and palm seeds. The cooked red beans were decent too; the beans were soft but still whole. Light and refreshing, this simple but healthy rendition of ice kachang would be even better if there were more red beans and if the shaved ice was finer.\xa0\xa0Yue Yuan Coffeeshop\n302 Sims Avenue, Singapore 387516Opening hours: 11am – 10pm daily\nPrice: $2.00\nRating: 3.5/5The good folks at Yue Yuan really know how to cook a mean pot of beans. The red beans here were simply gorgeous! Big in size, the beans were cooked till tender, but still retained their shape. They weren’t overly mushy, and had a lovely scent of pandan. The stall was generous with the red beans. Other ingredients included creamed corn, jelly cubes, and palm seeds. We enjoyed the robust taste of this ice kachang, but after a while, it felt a little too sweet and heavy. The ice melted very quickly too. At $2.00, it was also the priciest ice kachang in this round-up.\xa0\xa0 Dove DessertsOpening hours: Mon-Thurs, Sat: 11am-8pm, Fri: 11am-6pm, closed on Sundays\nPrice: $1.00\nRating: 3/5At $1.00, Dove Dessert’s big serving of ice kachang offers value for money. Although there weren’t a lot of red beans, the beans were nicely cooked, whole and tender. There were plenty of thin grass jelly strips, a few cubes of colorful jelly, one attap chee, and a small topping of creamed corn. What we didn’t like was that the ice was coarse and melted too quickly. Also, there wasn’t enough gula melaka and evaporated milk. Most of the flavours came from coloured syrup, which gave the ice kachang a rather artificial taste.\xa0\xa0Ken’s DelightsOpening hours: 11.30am – 10pm daily\nPrice: $1.00\nRating: 2/5Ken Delight’s ice kachang came in a very pretty shade of pastel pink! Its lovely hue came from rose syrup and evaporated milk. After the shaved ice has melted, it felt as though we were slurping ice cold bandung. And essentially, that’s what it was. In the centre of the shaved ice hid only a wee amount of cooked red beans, thin chin chow strips, and two small palm seeds. At this cheap price, we really couldn’t expect much. But we’d rather pay a little more than to spend a dollar on this ice kachang that’s so skimpy on flavour and ingredients.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/lai-hua-porridge-chee-cheong-fun/:['Rating: 4/5I finally found a stall selling zhar leong (chee cheong fun with fried you tiao) in a hawker centre! For those who haven’t yet tried this Hong Kong dim sum, it is essentially deep fried fritter wrapped in steamed flour and drenched in a slightly sweet and savoury soy sauce. A very simple dish which uses the most basic of ingredients but it really hits the spot and can be quite addictive.Zhar leong isn’t really considered a top dim sum dish in Singapore, but in Hong Kong, it is found in every self-respecting dim sum restaurant. I must say that it is my favourite form of cheong fun (steamed rice rolls) and I would always ask for zhar leong first and settle for char siew cheong fun when it isn’t available. It isn’t easy to find zhar leong in local dim sim restaurants which was why I was very excited to find this stall at Changi Village Food Centre.I thought that it was very smart of Chef Tham to include this dish in his menu. It differentiates his stall from the others. Chef Tham used to be the top chef for dim sum at Goodwood Park Hotel before he decided to venture out on his own so he certainly has good credentials backing him up. The cheong fun was made on the spot upon my order and was quite good as it satisfied my craving for zhar leong.Those who like the Hong Kong style congee can try it here. For me, the Hong Kong style congee is less robust than the Hainanese one. The porridge here reminded me of the congee that Crystal Jade serves. The pork balls were a little different from the usual local ones where minced meat was rolled into balls. These were a little more bouncy and were a cross between machine-made pork balls and handmade ones in terms of texture.There are not many places where you can just sit down and order a plate of zhar leong in Singapore so it is well worth a visit if you are after a tasty snack.\xa0Lai Hua Porridge Cheong Fun#01-18 Changi Food CentreTel: 9652 6038Opening hours: 8am-7.30pm; closed on WedAuthor© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/guan-hin-carrot-cake/:['One of the best carrot cakes in Singapore can be found at Guan Hin, a stall that looks new but has actually been around for many decades.The old couple here has been based at Geylang Bahru Market and Food Centre ever since the early 1970s, but as the hawker centre is undergoing renovations, they are now currently operating out of Chinatown Complex for a year.\xa0They do a more traditional 1960s version of carrot cake ($3/4), one where the homemade white radish cake is cut into thick finger-long strips. But don’t be worried that the thick cake would be dry — it comes incredibly moist and soft-textured, with just the right amount of savouriness. There is also a slight charring to all the cakes that gives every dish a bit of smokiness.\nLike all carrot cake stalls, they have both white and black (sweet black sauce) versions but you’d be hard-pressed to choose which one is best as both versions are equally compelling.The white version accentuates the naked taste of the cakes and the generous egg mixture comes irregularly shaped and is wonderfully soft-textured. The spiciness is prominent and there is a strong garlic flavour to the dish. While the dish is not oily, it is not lacking in any flavour, thanks to the large, chunky pieces of salty chai po (dried salted radish) that they throw in.The black version with sweet black sauce boasts a concentrated smoky, caramalised saccharineness without overdoing it. Texture-wise, it has a thick, reduced honey-like consistency, which is very different from the white version that has a little bit of gravy.The stall doesn’t see long queues but the couple can be seen frying up plates throughout the day as there are constant regular orders.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/ye-lai-xiang-tasty-barbecue/:['One of the early hawker stalls to sell Hainanese-style western food in a hawker centre in the 1970s, you’ll be thoroughly satisfied with the food at Ye Lai Xiang Tasty Barbecue, but only if you manage your expectations.In other words, don’t tuck in and expect Lawry’s for under $10.History\nThe western food stall — which started operations in Tanglin Halt Food Centre in 1971 — was opened by the late Chef Leong who was the head chef of the British Navy in Singapore until the British troops withdrew from Singapore earlier in the year.The stall moved on to Commonwealth Crescent Food Centre but after suffering from serious burns in 1976, Leong relocated the stall to Commonwealth Avenue Cooked Food Centre.It was there that the stall really established itself as the place to go to for classic and proper Hainanese-style western food.Chef Leong passed away in 1998 but the original recipes were passed to his third son, Vance who now runs the stall.A decade later, they had to relocate once again as Commonwealth Avenue Cooked Food Centre was scheduled to be demolished in 2011 under the Selective En Bloc Redevelopment Scheme (SERS).The bulk of the hawkers moved to the nearby Meiling Hawker Centre, but Ye Lai Xiang decided to venture out to Newton Food Centre instead but after an unsuccessful stint, they shifted to Maxwell Food Centre in 2012.The meats\nIt is here where you’ll find as close to an original reiteration of how western food was first presented to Singaporeans in a local street-side format back in the 1970s: pan-fried meats with crinkle-cut fries, a soft and sweet Chinese-style white bun, salted butter, baked beans or diced vegetables and their signature brown sauce.In the Singapore landscape of western meals, the quality is somewhat in-between a typical cheap western food stall and something a little more premium like Aston’s.Its prices are slightly higher than the average western food stall but the portions of meat are more than significantly larger.Take the chicken chop ($7.50) as an example: they give you one and a half times the standard size gotten from suppliers and the meat definitely has a chunkier heft.It has to be noted that the meat is not of the highest quality — it can’t be at those prices — but the stall does its best with the meat.The meats are nicely pan-fried with a decent tenderness and moisture but if you’re a slow eater, you’ll notice that the meats lose their moisture and tenderness rather quickly about halfway throughout the meal.A guess but part of the reason likely due to the common practise of western food stalls serving pan-fried meats almost immediately and not properly resting the meat.A special shoutout to the cutlet dishes (chicken cutlet, $8; pork cutlet, $8) which come with a nicely thin and crispy bread coating.If you observe how they prepare the cutlets, they only put on the flour, egg wash and breadcrumb coating when they receive an order and it’s not kept overnight like how many western stalls do it.Their signature brown sauce\nTheir brown sauce is distinctly different from the usual savoury brown sauces you get in a typical western hawker stall.Butter and flour is added to a bone and vegetable stock base after which a whole host of sauces like HP sauce, Lea and Perrins Worchestershire sauce, Tabasco sauce, red wine, vinegar and other secret spices are mixed in.The final result is a brown sauce that has a subtle reddish hue and a taste that is lightly sweet and tangy with a mild stock savouriness.It is a flavour which takes a bit of getting used to, especially if you’ve never patronised the stall before.Seasoning and sides\nThe seasoning leans towards the lighter side no matter the condiment, so if you like your foods highly savoury, you might want to think twice about coming here.The fries are not salted (though there is a salt shaker on the side) and the meats plus brown sauce are very lightly so.The only decently salted items are the chopped boiled vegetables (classic trio of carrots, peas and corn) and the salted butter.The highlight is the soft and fluffy sweet bread bun — a very high quality example of a Chinese bakery bread bun — and it is lovely eaten with the French-produced salted butter which they provide (Candia brand; another highlight).The baked beans are the best you can get: Heinz English Recipe Baked Beans which has a thicker consistency, a deeper flavour and less sweet, more savoury taste.The downside? The baked beans are given as a side only when you order pork chops ($7.50) or pork cutlets ($8).Other highlights\nTheir fish and chips ($8) are a must-order as the portions are very generous— three huge half fillets of breaded white fish and the meat is wonderfully soft and moist.It is also the only dish where you get coleslaw and tartar sauce — not high quality by any measure but the results are reasonably tasty.They also have more ambitious dishes — lamb chops ($15), sirloin steak using Angus beef ($20) and the very popular Mixed Grill ($21.50), which comes with a huge assortment of meats — bacon, steak, pork chop, chicken chop, lamb chop and sausage.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

The BK\xa0Charcoal Black, a selection of two burgers launched in the chain’s Singapore outlets on Thursday 16 April. They are available while stocks last.We went to try them and here is our verdict:Jumping onto the specialty breads bandwagon, Burger King uses fresh, locally-sourced sesame-studded buns infused with powdered bamboo charcoal for this item. The burgers come with either the flame-grilled Whopper beef patty, or the golden-fried Chicken TenderCrisp (both at $6.35).Burger King once released a charcoal-bun burger in Japan in November 2013, but the recipe of these two new offerings in Singapore are exclusive to this island of ours.\xa0What we ate:\xa0BK Charcoal Black Flame Grilled Beef and TenderCrisp Chicken meals ($8.35 each, with the burger, medium fries and a small Sprite)The bun: The charcoal-grey-coloured bun is soft and fluffy, with no distinctive flavour. The bread is mildly sweet, with a hint of sesame from the seeds on top. The draw here is the unusual colour.\xa0What we liked is the light, fluffy texture, and the fact that these buns are fresh, not frozen.The patty: Both burgers are slathered with a sweet honey mustard sauce and topped with crisp bacon, Batavia lettuce, sliced tomatoes and cheese. The flame-grilled beef is a tad dry, but it is a Whopper-sized patty (about 30-per-cent bigger than the usual patty) that spills out of the edges. It is a messy but generous burger. The TenderCrisp, on the other hand, is juicy, well-seasoned and fried to a crisp. It is chicken thigh for the patty, which is mildly spicy.\xa0\xa0Value for money:\xa0Not the cheapest set meal or burger out there, although the generously portioned burgers and the premium ingredients make this good value in our books. Go for it, we say.\xa0Also try: The BK nuggets (five pieces for $1.95) which are new on the menu. They replace the chicken tenders as a quick, affordable snack on-the-go.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/janggut-laksa/:['What we liked:\n— The iconic Katong spoon laksa is excellently done here\n— The Singapore-style chicken curry is one of the best we’ve hadWhat we didn’t:\n— The prices are a little on the high sideThere are many laksa stalls in the Joo Chiat/Katong area but only two of them made Katong laksa the famous dish that it now is.\nOne of them is the now-defunct Roxy Laksa which started in 1952 at the old Roxy Cinema (now Roxy Square) and Janggut Laksa whose owner invented the dish of laksa in the 1940s.The story goes that original owner Ng Juat Swee started selling his unique creation of laksa around the Marina Parade beach area in the 1940s. His younger brother, Chwee Seng, joined him in the business and by the late 50s, the stall was based at 49 East Coast Road under the name “Marine Parade Laksa”.The business closed down in 1978 due to increases in rental but reopened two years later at Far East Square as Janggut Laksa.\nFast forward to current times and the business is now being handled by the second generation and they now have four outlets across the island.\nTheir current laksa offerings are perhaps less intense in taste as compared to earlier years, predominantly due to less dried shrimps, less tee po (dried solefish) used in the gravy and also not being able to use charcoal for the cooking.But the final result has actually resulted in an arguably better tasting laksa.Instead of dried shrimps and tee po dominating the flavour, the flavours are more delicate and restrained such that you are able to taste the cockles, the laksa leaf and the light coconut creaminess.\nThere is a nice blend of savoury dried shrimp/dried fish stock flavours, light but still present and there is a combination of oil and milk richness in each bite.The other highlight are the multitude of textures which can be had in a bowl — curdled coconut milk bits, leaf and ground spice bits, crunchy towgay and firm chor (thick) bee hoon.\nAs it is spoon laksa, all the ingredients are cut up — fishcakes, prawns, beehoon and ask for more chilli if you don’t mind the spice as it adds a nice amount of spiciness and mild sweetness, just enough to round out the dish.The downside is that their laksa is pricier than most places — $4.50/5.50/6.50 — but that doesn’t stop the lunchtime crowds at their flagship stall at Queensway Towers.It is customary to eat laksa with otah\xa0($1.30) and — even though it is factory made — it comes nicely moist, flavourful and rich with herb and fish bits.Not talked about much but almost as popular is the chicken curry, but it is a little on the pricey side.\nThe Curry Chicken w Rice/Bread ($4.50/5.50/6.50) comes thick and robust with a moderate spiciness and very little sweetness. Taste-wise, it is one of the best renditions of a Singapore-style lemak (rich) curry available to buy.A pity the portions are a little lacking — you only get three small mid wings, two small drumsticks and rice. It makes for a modest portion if anything.You can get that addictive curry with a fried chicken cutlet ($5/6/7) but again, the portions are small for the price.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/lau-hong-ser-rojak/:['Have a bite of the rojak at this unassuming stall and you’ll understand why there’s often a waiting time of at least an hour of waiting during peak times.\xa0Lau Hong Ser Rojak started in 1974 and second-generation owner Lim Khai Ngee — now 56-year-old — took over a year later in 1975.He is an anal perfectionist and he even knows the exact date when he took over the stall from his Father: 25 December 1975.\xa0He applies that same OCD attitude to his rojak ($2/3/4/5/6) and insists on using more premium ingredients than is usual for rojak — his hae ko (shrimp paste) comes from Penang, he uses higher grade dried cuttlefish from Vietnam and higher quality century eggs and pickled ginger from China.Many aspects of his rojak are also made on in his stall — like the sambal chilli and he even toasts and hand-crushes the peanuts.\xa0Items like the dried cuttlefish, you tiao (Chinese dough fritter) and tau pok (tofu puff) are toasted over charcoal, so there is a nice smoky aroma to the flavour.All these little touches results in a rojak that is simply phenomenal and is arguably the best that you can buy in Singapore.\xa0Rojak is a salad of chopped pineapples, cucumber, turnip, bean sprouts, tau pok and you tiao and Lim’s dressing has a honey-like consistency, with a depth to the flavour that lingers long after you have finished the dish.Along with the smoky aroma, the tau pok and you tiao\xa0have a light crispness and the vegetables a fresh crunchiness.You can also order Fried Bean Curd (commonly known as stuffed tau pok; $0.80) which has cucumbers and bean sprouts stuffed inside a tau pok, then charcoal grilled to a smoky crispness.It is dipped in a sweet chilli sauce that mixes hae ko and chopped peanuts for more of an earthy flavour and a little crunch.\xa0A must-order is the Dried Cuttlefish ($2/3/4/5/6) which has a deeper and earthier flavour as compared to the dried cuttlefish varieties found at other rojak stalls.Even the Century Egg ($1) is noteworthy as it a little more of a molten yolk and it is paired with ginger slices that are sliced thicker, a little darker in colour and have more of a ginger flavour to them.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/hajjah-sadiah-othman-muslim-food/:['This stall which began in the 1960s was started by the grandfather in the family and is now run by the third-generation — two brothers and three sisters.While halal yong tau foo dominates the frontage of their stall, they are actually most popular for their Malay-style wok-fried staple dishes like mee bandung (meat and seafood noodles in a spicy red gravy) and their many varieties of mee goreng and bihun goreng.The reason why is because dishes like mee goreng done in a Malay-style is quite hard to find.The stalls that do serve it don’t fry it as robust as Hajjah Sadiah Othman.In Singapore, the Indian muslim style — which comes drier and with red colouring — is the norm.At Hajjah Saidah Othman, their wok-fried staples are served in a few different ways: dry, more gravy-ish, with seafood or with cockles and they are also priced lower than what is usual ($4).\xa0Look past the stall frontage and into the kitchen and you’ll see up to three woks furiously burning away to serve the many orders they get.The main base dish is one that has a beautifully thick reduced gravy with a strong, bold umami flavour\xa0— spicy, sweet, savoury and rich and there are other flavours that add variety to the taste — chopped coriander, tomatoes, fried onions.There are also a variety of textures at play — vegetable crunch, soft egg-iness, crisp fried onions, meaty minced mutton bits and soft but firm noodle bite.You can choose to have it dry or a bit more watered down and the version with bee hoon (Bee Hoon Basah, $3.50) is incredibly popular with the crowd as is\xa0Mee Goreng Kerang ($4) which uses yellow noodles and adds cockles for a little bit more intense seafood flavour.\xa0The other dish which gets plenty of orders is their Mee Bandung ($4) which can also be ordered with gravy or more soup-ish.A variety of ingredients — minced mutton, fishballs, poached egg, prawns, chopped chye sim — are served in a spicy thick soup that has chilli, onion, shrimp paste and dried shrimp flavours and the taste is wonderfully bold and umami-like.One downside is the freshness of the ingredients is not always spot on — we’ve encountered sour fishballs on the rare occasion, a sign that raw ingredients have not been kept properly, likely due to improper refrigeration.Do feedback to them if you do encounter it.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

However, I couldn’t find it anywhere in the newly renovated complex, so I decided to cross the road to the old shophouses on the opposite side to see if we could locate it. It was there that we chanced upon this rustic Teochew porridge stall. The crowd of people slurping their hot porridge along the sidewalk got me even more excited.Sure enough, the food here was absolutely rustic and tasty, which explained why it was so good. On top of that, it was cheap too! The steamed fish was cooked to perfection. It was tender, moist and the steaming sauce was delicious. Though it was rather oily, like a steamed version of fried fish, it was really tasty!The mei cai (preserved radish leaves) were equally oily and delicious. Teochew porridge is plain so this dish went well with it. It was even better together with the braised pork. I would have liked the braised pork even more if the skin was fried before stewing. The style of braised pork here was not really Teochew style as it had a thick gravy instead of a watery one, but it was excellent with the porridge.It was too bad that by 1pm, most of the dishes had already been sold out.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/solo-ristorante/:['What we liked:\n— The uni pasta and grilled octopus are two of the must-have dishes here\n— The food is exceptionally well-executed and dependable\n— The decor and setup is small and cozy\xa0What we didn’t:\n– The prices are a little on the high sideNow with a new chef, upmarket Italian restaurant Solo Ristorante is bringing back the traditional in an exciting way.When Solo Ristorante burst onto the scene back in 2018, there was a lot of talk and press about the place because it was helmed by none other than the godfather of high-end Italian food in Singapore, Gabriel Fratelli.Back then in 1988, he was a hot young Italian chef who first introduced Singaporeans to the concept of upmarket Italian food when he was helming Sheraton Towers’ Domvs.As for Solo Ristorante, things have changed two years down the line.Fratelli left Solo Ristorante in February 2019 to “pursue other interests” and the restaurant is now on a different direction with new chef/owner Simone Fraternali, 34, who took over in March 2020.Despite his youth, Fraternali is no slouch in the credentials department.He’s been a Chef de Partie at three Michelin Star Da Vittorio in Brusaporto, Lombardy and at one Michelin Star restaurant La Tana in Asiago.In Singapore, he’s worked in various high-end Italian restaurants — Il Lido, Aura Restaurant and Lounge and So Sofitel Sentosa — before becoming head chef at the city-based SO Sofitel Singapore.The food at Solo Ristorante currently no longer has that wild experimental, artistic flair that it once had but instead has an understated traditional approach that gently pushes the envelope when it needs to.Arguably, its a good thing as it’s the kind of place where you’re guaranteed a solid meal every single time.Antipasti dishes like the Branzino ($20) — raw seabass dressed with a light lemon emulsion, shallots and chives — adds just a little pimento for that spicy kick and the Wagyu Carpaccio ($30) is how you’d expect it but with the addition of some lightly pickled artichokes to break up the flavour a bit.Some other dishes like the Melanzana Alla Parmigiana ($18) is just well-executed tradition but with the addition of some slightly unripe cherry tomatoes and a plainer-tasting (but delicious) tomato sauce on the bottom to freshen up the taste, so that it doesn’t get too rich.That sort of gentle innovation — where a single ingredient or two is added for that spark — exists throughout the menu and there are a couple of dishes where it works especially well.The first is the Tagliolini ($45) handmade onsite and dressed with an intensely creamy smoky uni sauce. Big, robust and slightly sweet with full of seafood flavour, it was introduced by Fraternali during his Il Lido days and it is always one of the most popular dishes wherever he has been based.The other dish is the Polipo ($38)— a grilled octopus leg which has an unreal soft and tender texture because it is braised in a mix of its own juices, wine and spices before being flame-grilled for that charred smokiness.If you’re dining here, do save some stomach space for desserts. The selection is limited but what they do have is carefully curated. Among them, the Torta Al Limone ($14; lemon tart) is the dessert which is a must-try.White chocolate is added to the lemon curd filling for a slightly different take of a sweet richness. It is served with a strawberry and basil sorbet which perfectly complements it.\nGentle innovation at its best.This was an invited media tasting.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/carne/:['What we liked:What we did not like:There is a new burger stop in Singapore, and it’s quite different from the other burger joints around. Opened by Mauro Colagreco, a top-notch Italian-Argentine chef, CARNE spots a tight menu of beef, chicken, bacon and veggie options. All their products are created with quality ingredients, from 100% Grass-fed meat to 100% organic vegetables and even seasonal fruits.Perched on the busy Amoy Street, it is just 3 minutes away from Telok Ayer MRT station. The store can be easy to miss as their big CARNE signboard is blocked from street view.\xa0 But, we stepped in and gave some of their highlights a go.The moment you walk in, the first thing you will see is their clean industrial set up. We visited the store in the evening, so it was packed with the after-work crowd. But, there is sufficient space between the seating areas, so it is not too noisy even when packed.They have an easy online ordering system in place, and you can take as much time as you want to decide on your choices. After scanning a QR code and placing our orders, we were quite surprised when our pagers went off within just 5 to 10 minutes.We were first served our burgers: Crispy Chicken ($20.90 with cheese) and Veggie ($18.90 with cheese). These came with our chosen side, the Triple-cooked Agria fries ($8.90).Starting with the Crispy Chicken, we decided to try it along with the fries. The crispy chicken burger is an adequate size and comes with a rather juicy slab of chicken. The chicken is fried till crisp, yet the insides are still juicy and tender. We liked how the chicken was very lightly seasoned and how thin the batter was.The chicken tasted really fresh, and the flavours went well with the other components- the vegetable, buttered buns and sauces. To get the individual ingredients’ full flavour, we sampled them separately and were really impressed with how the chef had paid attention to detail. You could tell that they had tried out different combinations to settle on the right proportions.The triple cooked fries were somewhat in between what you would expect out of wedges and fries. Though the fries were rather large, the potatoes were well mashed up, and there were no chunks when we bit into the fries.The skin was crispy and slightly salted. Thus we could enjoy the organic flavour of the potatoes.Next, we indulged in the Veggie burger. Since it was a vegetarian rendition, we did not expect much.\xa0However, we were pleasantly surprised by how much the entire dish tasted like a pizza.The dish was well thought out as they had used the right amount of chilli paste to pair well with the huge portobello mushroom. Their two cheese ingredients further elevated the natural flavour of the mushroom.The cheese was easy to bite into and had a little resistance to it as it had been melted and seared. We enjoyed the bite that came with it as well.Overall, it left us feeling full yet wanting more.No matter what, having a dessert after such a savoury spread is a must. We chose their Salted Caramel milkshake ($10) and the Orange and chocolate sacher torte ($12).The milkshake had bits of peanut on their whipped cream topping that sent us down the memory lane as it tasted so much like the filling in our favourite traditional peanut pancakes.Though the amount of whipped cream was quite a lot, the drink did not disappoint. It had a strong butterscotch taste that was not overly sweet but just nice. You may find a bit of the salted caramel residue at the drink’s base, and that was just the perfect end to the milkshake.To end our night on a refreshing yet sweet note, we went for dessert. It contained a rich serving of orange slices, peels, orange gelato scoop and chocolate brownie chunks at the base of it all.Almond slices hiding in the bowl, and it gave each mouthful a delightful crunch.The brownie was thick yet rich in chocolate flavour, so you will enjoy this, especially if you are a chocolate fan. The authentic flavour of it was cut through by the citrus taste from the orange slices.The gelato was creamy and light on the taste buds.\xa0It ensured that our palate was not too overwhelmed and that we had a good balance.In all, we enjoyed the balance of the flavours, and it was obvious that these dishes had lots of attention to details.While these were our picks, you can try some of their other signatures, like the beef burger as well. It holds butter buns, natural grass-fed beef, local oak lettuce, organic tomato and organic red onion.The burgers and other dishes are slightly pricey, but after trying them out, we can see why. So, be ready for your wallet to empty after eating here.Most of their materials are also sustainable and eco-friendly, so that was a huge plus for us.If you are in a mood for fast food but would like to try a different take on it, CARNE would be the place for you.For more information on what CARNE’s offerings are, visit https://www.carneburgers.sg/.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/zhong-pin-noodle-house/:['What we liked:\xa0\xa0What we didn’t:\xa0Located at Bukit Merah Central, Zhong Pin Noodle House is one of the few stalls in Singapore where you can get Sarawak-style Laksa and kolo mee.While it’s not strictly authentic as the dishes have been tweaked to the tastebuds of Singaporeans, the flavours you get here are very captivating.Operated by husband and wife Roy Ong and Xan Tan, they initially opened at Bukit Timah Market and Food Centre in 2015 but because of an increase in rental, they had to relocated to their current location of Bukit Merah Central Food Centre in 2018.\n\nRoy left his career in the logistics industry in 2015 and switched over to being a hawker.He had a lifelong interest in cooking and had previously picked up tips from an old laksa hawker in Kuching before starting the business.The Sarawak Fusion Laksa ($5) is the main highlight as it features a robust stock which is boiled for over 12 hours using old hens, pork bones, soybeans and ikan bilis.That said, it has been made less spicy and less oily as compared to laksas in Sarawak and Kuching to apparently suit the tastebuds of Singaporeans.The laksa also uses thin bee hoon as compared to the thick bee hoon that Sarawak Laksa uses.Even then, the resultant gravy is still decently coconut-rich and robust but there is more of a spice and stock flavour, which is freshened up by a whole lime, which is provided on the side.For those who want it spicier, the laksa comes with a thick sambal chilli that adds quite an earthy spiciness into the gravy.In the bowl are three semi-peeled medium prawns which are consistently sweet and bouncy, shredded chicken, egg strips, some bean spouts and coriander.The other highlight is Roy’s own spin on Sarawak Kolo Mee ($4/5) which comes incredibly sinful and flavour-packed.Kolo mee stalls in Sarawak and Kuching normally offer three variations of the dish (white, black and red) but here, Roy only offers two — a mix of black and white and an off-menu red version which he will make if you ask for it.Kolo mee noodles — similar to instant noodles — are specially imported from Malaysia and are tossed in a robust savoury sauce which has lots of lard and fried onion oil notes.\nThe noodles are blanched well with a very springy noodle texture and the dish toppings are very generous for the money.Char Siu slices are generously thick and are reasonably tender with occasional fatty bits and the flavour is slightly sweet.Also included is a very soft-textured, fat-rich minced meat concoction that is very flavour intense if eaten on its own but it blends nicely when mixed in with the noodles.The red version adds a bit of the char siu marinade into the mix, giving the noodles a reddish hue and makes the overall dish sweeter.The overall taste has a very big, bold, robust pork fat rich flavour, which will wow you for the first few bites but it can get overly rich if you’re a small eater.The red version will have its fans but we personally preferred Roy’s black and white version which balances the savoury and sweetness better.The stall also offers Mushroom Minced Meat Noodle (bak chor mee; $4) which is also worth ordering as Roy is very generous with his toppings of minced meat, fishballs, meatballs and lots of braised mushrooms, lard and fried onions.The noodle dressing is pretty robust with a noticeable dash of sour black vinegar, though it doesn’t have any dried fish or fish sauce flavours, which we feel would elevate the dish even more.Even then, the overall flavour is still pretty compelling and is a good choice for bak chor mee in the Bukit Merah area.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/fu-shun-jin-ji-shao-la-mian-jia/:['There are many Cantonese roast meat stalls in Singapore, but very few of them manage to be excellent in all three of the roast meats that are typically offered — char siu (barbecued pork), siu yok (roast pork belly) and roast duck.This stall in Maxwell Food Centre is one of the few roast meat stalls in Singapore that manages to come close to being excellent across the board.Opened in 2008,\xa0Fu Shun Jin Ji Shao La Mian Jia was opened by Chan Tuck Kwai, a 54-year-old Singaporean who has been cooking since he was a teenager. The demand for “Ah Kwai’s” roast meats are so high that there are constant queues which start\xa0from when it opens during lunchtime until it closes in the early night.\xa0The char siu here is basted throughout the charcoal roasting resulting in a thick coating of marinade on its skin. Both lean and fatty cuts are offered and the roasting is so good that even the lean meats have a lovely soft texture to them.The marinade is also addictively good as it has a deep savory, not-too-sweet flavour. There is added smokiness thanks to a nice slight charring on every strip of char siu.\xa0The siu yok is as good as it gets with a nice and moist meat texture and a biscuit-like crunchy skin, as is the roast duck and its excellently crispy skin and meat which is nicely moist and meaty.Try the dumplings as well. They are generous with their fillings and care has been taken to season them properly. The soup that it came in was a bit lackluster unfortunately.\xa0A shout out to the gravy on the side — brown, dark and rich. It has a smoky deep savoury flavour that goes very well with rice or noodles.That said, we found issue with the sambal chilli. It is wonderfully flavourful with a prominent dried shrimp flavour and a big oil-richness. Great in rice and noodles but it does dominate everything that it is put into, including the natural flvour of the meats. A more restrained, less oil-rich sambal chilli would work better for their roast meats.A note on their opening times. They officially open at 11am but there has been more than a few occasions where they have opened as late as noon. The inconsistency can be frustrating as a queue quickly forms when the stall shutters open. If you want to be the first few, expect to do a lot of waiting around.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

At Shi Miao Dao Yunnan Rice Noodles, diners cook their own meal — and all it takes is 10 seconds.While it boasts more than 750 outlets in China, its newly opened outpost at Food Republic @ VivoCity is its first in Singapore. It brings to our shores\xa0one of Yunnan’s most famous dishes – “crossing-the-bridge rice noodles”.Their soups are served in bowls that are pre-heated at 250 degrees Celsius, and the heat brings the broth to a boil, which cooks their thick vermicelli, made from pure rice flour with no additives, within 10 seconds, hence their name. (“Shi miao diao” means 10-second noodles in Chinese.)When your order is ready, all you need to do is dunk your ingredients in, and voila! Meal ready.Their best-seller is the Original ($7.80), a milk-coloured broth brewed for six hours from chicken and pork bones. Clear and comforting, light but flavourful, the original also happens to be our favourite soup base.\xa0Also available are three other variations — Tomato, Mala, and Pickled Cabbage ($8.50 each) — they all build on the original soup base. We like the Pickled Cabbage which, enhanced with pickled cabbage, spices and aged vinegar, strikes a good balance between sour and spicy. The mala is a fiery option perfect for those with more feisty taste buds; you can customise your soup base according to four levels of spiciness. We had level two spiciness, which was a little too mild for us — so we reckon if you want to taste a distinct Szechuan spiciness, level three would be a safe option.Each set of noodles also includes an impressive spread of ingredients, such as chicken drumlet, beancurd skin, quail egg and black fungus, the lattermost being one of our favourites with its crunchiness and savouriness. Pork ham and fish slices can be added on at $1 per portion.

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/chilli-crab/:['Chilli crab – Singapore’s unofficial “national dish”, comes in different versions. Most would agree that the main factor that distinguishes the dish is its gravy. Some are brimming with spices such as ginger, galangal (blue ginger) and turmeric, while others have a sweet and sour taste, and spiked with chilli oil. The dish was reportedlt created in 1956 by Lim Choon Ngee and his wife Cher Yam Tian at a humble seafood eatery at Kallang River. When business grew, they moved to Upper East Coast Road and set up Palm Beach Seafood. Their original version was fresh crab cooked with chilli and tomato sauce, and served with crusty French bread. To this day, this recipe can still be sampled at Roland Restaurant in Marine Parade Central. Today, the restaurant is managed by the couple’s son Roland. In the 1960s, the founder of Dragon Phoenix Restaurant, master chef Hooi Kok Wai and his team re-invented the chilli crab dish. To create the luscious spicy-sweet gravy, the chef melded chilli and ginger sauce with lemon juice, sambal, ketchup and egg white. This was then tossed together with fresh crab.We sampled the chilli crab at five famous seafood joints in Singapore to review the freshness and meatiness of the crabs, as well as the taste and spiciness of the gravy.\xa0No Signboard Seafood \nThis wildly popular eatery is often packed with groups of families and office workers, even during late hours. The huge outdoor setting is warm and doesn’t hold much ambience, which doesn’t make it the most comfortable place to dine in. That doesn’t seem to faze the diners though, and this could be partly due to the service at the restaurant, which is brisk and efficient despite crowds. The chilli crab here didn’t disappoint. The eatery whipped up the most fiery sauce. It was made with a nice blend of prawn paste, garlic and a medley of spices, which added to the complexity of the taste. We could taste the flavourful seafood stock in the gravy which was brimming with beaten eggs and orange roe. Priced at $40/ kg, the Sri Lankan crabs were succulent and juicy. The restaurant also serves other seasonal crab such as Australian and Alaskan crabs.\nNo Signboard Seafood | Address: 414 Geylang Road, next to Lorong 24 and other locations| Tel: 68423415 | Operating hours: Daily: 12pm-1am\xa0Red House \nRed House was the first restaurant in Singapore to introduce mantou buns with chilli crab in 1988. At that time, everyone else was serving\xa0plain bread. This accidental success came about because the restaurant’s regular bakery was closed during Chinese New Year that year. So as not to disappoint customers, Red House replaced the bread with custom-made mantou (plain buns) from another supplier. This August is a good month to have chilli crabs at The Red House, as the place is offering the dish at $33/kg (usual price is $40/kg). For us, we ordered the “small” portion of Sri Lankan crabs. But when the dish arrived, it actually looked rather huge. The meat was sweet and succulent, and the sauce was robust with a tinge of spiciness and sweetness, with the spiciness kicking in towards the end. The sauce had ingredients such as red chillies, chilli padi and fresh tomatoes. We were told that Red House’s version was always sweet and spicy (inspired by Peranakan flavours). This was different from the other restaurants we sampled, they had a more distinct flavour of spices and peanuts.\nRed House | Address: East Coast Seafood Centre, East Coast Parkway | Tel: 64423112 | Operating hours: Mon-Fri: 5pm-11.30pm, Sat-Sun:11.30am -11.30pm\xa0Seafood Paradise\nAlthough the restaurant’s location was out of the way, it didn’t stopped regulars from making their way there. The service staff were friendly and thoughtful, making our dining experience a memorable one. When we ordered our chilli crab dish, the waitress kindly informed us that, as crabs were not in season, the crabs would not be as meaty. This was indeed the case. To make up for it, the chef gave us some complimentary pieces of crabs so that our dish was value-for-money (impressive service!). Taste wise, the crabs were very fresh and the gravy had hints of spices, ginger, lemongrass, shallots and dried shrimps in it. The spiciness was also well balanced. The crabs were mostly from Sri Lanka and were priced at $38/ kg. The restaurant also offered crabs from India.\nSeafood Paradise | Address: No. 91 Defu Lane 10, #01-01 Swee Hin Building | Tel: 64872429 | Operating hours: Daily: 12pm-2pm, 5pm-10.30pm\xa0Jumbo Seafood\nThanks to the sea breeze and balmy setting, this outlet is always crowded on weekends, even during late hours. Fortunately, the service staff are efficient despite the crowd. The Sri Lankan crabs here ($40/ kg) were commendable – they were firm, fresh and juicy. However, the same could not be said about the sauce; it was slightly bland and flat. It could have been better if it was spicier. In fact, of all the restaurants we reviewed, the gravy here was the least spicy. The only saving grace of the reddish gravy was the delicious roe in it – which we couldn’t help but polished off with the golden brown mantou.\nJumbo Seafood Restaurant | Address: 1206 East Coast Parkway #01-07/08, East Coast Seafood Centre | Tel: 64423435 | Opening hours: Mon-Sat 5-11.45pm, Sun and public holidays noon-midnight\xa0Mattar Road Seafood Barbeque\nNg Hung Leng and his wife run this small seafood stall, and have been preparing crabs for almost two decades. The couple apparently takes two days off just to prepare their own chilli paste. At first look, the reddish brown gravy was starchy and unappetising. Indeed, the consistency of the gravy was too thick and gooey. However, this dish might appeal to diners who like their chilli crab served with a thick and spicy sauce. The gravy is best described as being quite similar to a peanut satay sauce. Like most of the other places reviewed, the crabs here were very meaty and fresh. The live Sri Lankan crabs, which could be seen in front of the stall, were priced at $33/ kg.\nMattar Road Seafood Barbecue | Address: Block 51 Old Airport Road Food Centre, #01-63 | Tel: 64472798 | Operating hours: Daily: 4pm to 11pm.

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/japanese-food/:['We can’t seem to get enough of Japanese food. Even though Singapore is filled with Japanese restaurants, long queues can be seen at many of these outlets. But which of these eateries are frequented by the Japanese themselves? Cuppage Plaza and Robertson Quay, for instance, are popular haunts for Japanese salarymen having a good meal after work, or a sake or two, while Liang Court is filled with Japanese families on weekends. And the options are growing with the number of new outlets springing up at ION Orchard and Orchard Central. inSing.com speaks to the Japanese community in Singapore to find out their favourite Japanese restaurants here and what their expectations are of these eateries.\xa0What Japanese expats want\nGrand Copthorne Waterfront Hotel sales manager Kiyomi Tsuge enjoys going to restaurants such as Nanjya Monjya and Nagae near her workplace. “I seek authenticity and value for money. This applies across the various types of Japanese cuisines. I personally prefer those that are run by Japanese as it makes me feel more at home, allowing me to speak my own language.”Genta Yamashita, restaurant manager of Saint Pierre an award-winning modern French restaurant says that the Japanese restaurant he goes to is Mimigar (Okinawan cuisine restaurant) located at Gallery Hotel. “I also like to go to Chankonada, a kind of Izakaya-style restaurant, which serves ‘Chanko’ (the steamboat that Sumo wrestlers eat) at Orchard Plaza as well as Shabuhana, a shabu shabu restaurant at Mohamed Sultan Road.” He adds, “Honestly speaking, I don’t eat out so often in Japanese restaurants as they are quite expensive and I also don’t have the time. But these restaurants are my favourites.”As for Kiyoshi Yoshizawa, photographer of Jambu Studio, he likes to check out new Japanese restaurants – such as Botejyu and Ootoya at Orchard Central. “I like to sample different dishes and try out home-style Japanese food especially after work or on weekends. These places are also quite affordable for me.”\xa0Japanese food standards\nWhen asked what she thinks of the standard of Japanese food in Singapore, Kiyomi says in her six years here, the standard keeps getting better. “Even those run by Singaporeans have very high standards. Although it’s not the same as what we get in Japan, there are so many Japanese restaurants, one gets spoilt for choices,” she says.Genta only has praises for the standard of Japanese food in Singapore. “Compared with Japanese food in other countries, \xa0Singapore’s Japanese food standard is top class.\xa0I think one of the biggest reasons is because Singapore is quite a comfortable place to live for the Japanese. Most of them say that they can have mostly the same lifestyle as in Japan. It also means it is a good environment to bring in Japanese chefs to Singapore (even if they cannot speak English).”Where the authenticity of food is concerned, Genta says that most of the Japanese chefs here find it is difficult to create the same taste as in Japan, even if the restaurants get the same ingredients air flown from Japan. He says the travelling time affects the freshness – especially for raw food. The other reason is the difference in the water. “One of the chefs I’ve worked with said he needs two times the bonito flakes to make a same dashi stock while in Singapore. They said the water here is ‘hard’. But I can say Singapore serves some of the highest quality Japanese fare outside of Japan. And many restaurants in Japan are venturing to Singapore to open up new businesses.”Kiyoshi who has lived in Singapore for more than 10 years visits a lot of Japanese chain restaurants around the island. But sometimes, he doesn’t feel that the standard is as good as what he can get back home. Nevertheless, that hasn’t stopped him from trying out the food. “The value is decent and the variety is good,” he says.\xa0Corporate dining \nApart from the places where expats go to after work, there are also fine dining restaurants that draw in the corporate crowd, for instance Inagiku at Fairmont, Singapore. Nobuhiko Sano, general manager, comments on its popularity, “The ambience at Inagiku is ideal for business meetings and discussions. Items on the menu are carefully conceived by our chefs to cater to the myriad preferences of our Japanese guests. Corporate guests also appreciate efficiency in our service and our provision of consistent high quality food, which we offer at reasonable prices.”Over at Chijmes is Japanese Dining Sun, another restaurant that appeals to businessmen. “We serve traditional Japanese cuisine with a modern touch created by our Japanese executive chef Toshio Sawai\xa0and\xa0we are glad that the taste and quality we deliver\xa0is\xa0accepted by our Japanese guests.\xa0If you’re only going to one Japanese restaurant this month, make it one of these outlets recommended by expats for their food and authenticity.\xa0Japanese Dining Sun @ Chijmes\nAddress: #02-01 CHIJMES, 30 Victoria Street\nTel: 6336-3166\nOpening hours: Mon to Thurs, Sun: 12pm to 3pm, 6.30pm to 11pm, Fri to Sat: 6.30pm to 12amThis restaurant at Chijmes is popular among Japanese businessmen thanks to its interesting food promotions. Executive chef Toshio Sawai says, “The main issue of Japanese food in Singapore lies in the ingredients. In Japan, ingredients are swimmingly fresh and this is a little challenging to recreate in Singapore. Though we try to import from Japan as much as we can, especially for our special Japanese-themed promotions, some ingredients (mainly meats items) cannot be imported from Japan or are simply too pricey and we have to look for alternative sources such as USA or Australia. That said, we are glad that wagyu beef from Japan can now be brought in.”The restaurant is planning to feature wagyu beef in its upcoming Kyushu Gourmet Experience from 25 August to 5 October alongside other ingredients from Kyushu. In the regular menu, the chef recommends sushi and sashimi (seasonal price) and beef foie gras grill (from $35.80).\xa0Inagiku\nOpening hours: Mon to Sun: 12pm – 2.30pm, 6.30pm – 10.30pmInagiku is frequented by Japanese businessmen who appreciate the well-executed creations featuring premium seasonal ingredients air-flown from Japan. Head chef Yoshiyuki Nobukawa combines traditional and contemporary techniques and focuses on the freshest ingredients. The chef is one of the few in Singapore who has the license to prepare fugu, the deadly puffer fish.His signatures include hirame sashimi – live flounder sashimi with sea urchin and caviar, sesame sauce and fresh lime ($45), grilled hairtail fish, prawn, shiitake mushroom flavoured with miso paste and wrapped with hoba leaf and thinly-sliced wagyu beef on stone grill with wasabi mustard and Japanese cress ($120). Other signatures include grilled scallops with egg yolk sauce ($35), and deep-fried Kagoshima Kurobuta pork cutlet ($38) – this sweet and mild pork is specially flown in from Kyushu.“Some ingredients are hard to get in Singapore but generally I am satisfied with the quality which is the same as in Japan. However, some ingredients are not allowed here, such as whole live fugu (puffer fish) and Japanese beef tongue,” says the chef. “As for Singapore’s dining scene, there are many casual Japanese restaurants opened here which are quite nice. Although not very authentic, they have many varieties available,” he adds.\xa0Torisho\nOpening hours: Mon to Sat:11.30 am – 2 pm, 6.30 pm – 10.30 pmTorisho Taka by Aoki is the first fine-dining yakitori restaurant in Singapore. It draws a good Japanese crowd who enjoy the top quality ingredients used by executive chef Takao Aoki.Chicken (free-range) is the most widely used ingredient in his range of yakitori items (mostly between $4 and $6). The menu also features beef, vegetables, fish and foie gras with balsamic vinegar sauce at $18 per piece and Wagyu sirloin at $15 per piece.The chef says he uses dried fish flown in from the Iwaki-shi Fukushima prefecture as well as indigenous Japanese vegetables, such as shironegi (Japanese leek), ginnan (Gingko nut) and shiitake mushroom. To preserve the authentic traditional yakitori flavours, the chef shipped Binjo charcoal from Japan. He believes that only wood from the Kochi prefecture imparts the best flavours to the ingredients when grilling.\xa0En Dining \nOpening hours: 6pm-12am, Sun-Thur, 6pm-3am, Fri-SatEn Dining is usually filled with Japanese businessmen and ladies who enjoy the well-executed Okinawan cuisine. Typical dishes created by a chef from Okinawa include stir-fried bitter gourd with pork, tofu and egg ($9) as well as stewed pork belly and radish ($9.80).Recommended items (great for sharing) include the refreshing daikon salad with bacon and soy sauce dressing ($9.50), wafu steak – cubed sirloin steak with special soy sauce ($17.50), tatami iwashi – crispy pressed small dry sardines ($9.80) and softshell crab maki ($15).You can also share the kushi mori ($17.50) – grilled chicken, Japanese green pepper, pork belly with enoki, chicken meatball, grilled chicken soft bone, and mushrooms. And end with the luscious matcha panna cotta with red bean ($6.50).\xa0Nagae\nOpening hours: Mon to Sun: 12pm-2.30pm, 6.30pm-10.30pmThis small restaurant is packed with Japanese expats during lunch. The Japanese chef prepares sashimi at the counter which displays a wide range of fresh fish that is flown in twice a week.The manager of the restaurant says their specialty is sushi and sashimi as well as grilled seasonal fish. There is a huge range of fish to choose from. If you feel like treating yourself, try the tuna belly ($40 – two pieces), or yellow jack ($14 – two pieces). Otherwise, zero in on the assorted sashimi ($38) or sample the grilled fillet of mackerel with salt ($16).The set lunches are value for money and highly satisfying. Try the perfectly grilled salmon set lunch ($18) which comes with rice, chawanmushi, fruits, coffee or tea.\xa0Kura No Naka Japanese Restaurant\nOpening hours: 11.30am- 2.30pm, 6pm-11pm, dailyThis spacious restaurant run by three Japanese ladies has a faithful following since it opened. The dining crowd consists of mostly Japanese people who come here after work for a meal and drinks.Feast on refreshing appetisers such as tofu salad ($8), tomato ebi salad – whole tomato and prawn mayo salad ($15) and daikon salad – white radish with tuna salad ($8). Then aim for the juicy deep-fried oyster coated with breadcrumbs ($18) and dragon maki (deep-fried prawn roll) ($16). One of the signatures and top sellers is the hearty tofu mentaiko cheese – baked tofu with salted cod roe and cheese ($14) or the succulent saikoro steak – tenderloin cube steak with garlic ($20).\xa0Ootoya \nOpening hours: Mon to Sun: 12pm – 9.30pmThis famous Japanese chain has 240 outlets in Japan and abroad. Started in 1958, Ootoya serves home-style fare. Japanese families love to come here for a dose of casual comfort food prepared by a team of Japanese chefs.Try the Ootoya special dish ($11) which is a combination of homemade croquette and deep-fried chicken with a sunny side up egg. \xa0Or dig into the crispy fried chicken with sweet and sour kurozo sauce (Ootoya’s black vinegar sauce fused with apple juice), priced at $12.Others to sample include deep-fried chicken and potatoes with leek sauce and vegetables ($12) as well as charcoal grilled atka mackerel ($13). The chef says that he uses bincho charcoal to sear the meat evenly and this process seals in the juices.\xa0Menya Shinchan Japanese Noodle Restaurant\nAddress: 30 Robertson Quay, #01-05 Riverside View\nTel: 6732 0114\nOpening hours: Mon to Fri: 11.30am – 3pm, 6.30pm-10pm, Sat to Sun: 6pm-10pmThis small, modest ramen eatery is a favourite haunt for Japanese expats during lunch and dinner. The owner Tajimi Eiji (president of Ramen Society) says that he wanted to introduce good ramen to Singapore.The soy sauce pork ramen infused with sesame and garlic oil flavour ($12) is light yet very flavourful. This crowd pleaser is served with a few slices or barbecued pork and heaps of beansprouts. The egg which you have to order separately comes with a perfectly cooked semi-soft yolk. For something richer, you can order the miso based soup at $13. You may also like to try the seafood based broths flavoured with dried sardines or the new pumpkin ramen ($15).Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/soi-11/:['Thai food lovers, here’s another legitimate Thai food eatery to add onto the list of places to frequent. Located at the S-11 coffee shop directly across Yishun MRT Station, Soi 11 is the place for you to fulfil all your Thai food cravings. Because the menu is so extensive, you’ll also get acquainted with some new Thai dishes you’ve never tried before.Soi 11 was previously known as Sabpard Thai, but they’ve recently rebranded after a change in management. The new owners are a Thai and Singaporean duo, and other than the outlet at Yishun, they also have another stall at a coffee shop in Block 640 at Bukit Batok Central.According to the friendly Thai ladies manning the stall, the bestsellers at Soi 11 are the Pineapple Fried Rice ($6) and the Pad Thai ($6). You can also find other classic Thai dishes such as Pandan Leaf Chicken ($10), Green Curry ($8), and Tom Yum Soup ($8) on the menu; however, what we’re interested in are their Issan dishes such as the Larb Moo (Minced Pork Salad, $8) and Mango Salad ($6).If you’re not familiar with Isaan food, this refers to North-eastern Thai food which bears a significant resemblance to Laotian cuisine. Whilst Isaan food can be readily found across the different parts of Thailand, including Bangkok, the same can’t be said for Singapore. You’ll have to go to a specialty Isaan restaurant such as E-Sarn Thai Cuisine if you’re hoping to savour Isaan dishes in Singapore (that is – until now!)The Larb Moo is a quintessential Isaan dish which contains onions, roasted rice powder, parsley, and lots of chilli. The end result is a savoury and tangy dish, with added crunch from the roasted rice. In Thailand, you’ll find many different variations of this salad consisting of the same dressing, but featuring different proteins. Be forewarned: if you’re not extraordinarily good at handling spicy food, you’ll probably want to request for less chilli whilst ordering this dish.The Steamed Squid With Lime Juice (Pla Muek Nueng Manao) is another dish which is popular in Thailand, but less so in Singapore. This is served in an elongated metal “hotplate” with two burners below which keep the soup warm. Whilst the squid is a tad on the chewy side, you’ll be won over by the bright, zesty flavours of the chilli. The soup is a tangy, flavourful concoction which is sweetened with the addition of the parsley and cabbage; it’s perfect when slurped up in conjunction with a big bowl of rice.Other notable dishes at Soi 11 include the Basil Chicken with Egg and Rice ($6), which is salty, spicy, and extremely satisfying, as well as the Omelette ($8), which is unbelievably light and fluffy, and fragrant enough to smell from a mile away. Whilst Soi 11 is a relatively new addition to the S-11 coffee shop at Yishun, it’s pretty popular with diners, and you’ll have to wait for at least 15 minutes if you pay them a visit from 6.30pm onwards. Alternatively, drop by during off-peak hours (2pm to 5pm) if you don’t fancy waiting.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/day-night-fried-kway-teow/:['Hidden inside 163 Bukit Merah Central Market & Food Centre is a char kway teow stall that adds a few modern touches to the dish and will\xa0 appeal to those who prefer their char kway teow a little more savoury and less sweet.The stall is run by Xu Chun Cheng, who has been frying char kway teow for more than 20 years.He learnt the craft from his father who also made his living as a char kway teow hawker.You’ll notice that Xu uses a customised silver wok with no handles, something which his father also had when he fried char kway teow.\xa0Xu runs the stall with his wife who helps with the food preparation and the order taking.The char kway teow ($3/4) here is a little different from traditional char kway teow in that Xu uses the thinner flat kway teow instead of the traditional broader flat kway teow — in addition to yellow noodles — and it changes the texture of the dish quite a bit.Instead of a big springy bounciness, the char kway teow has instead a slippery smooth texture with a little springiness to it.Overall, the dish is fried well with a little bit of wetness and with a more savoury slant to the flavour as opposed to the dominant sweet black dark soy sauce flavour that is characteristic of many char kway teow.Order it with chilli and it adds a nice earthy and spicy flavour which blends well with the rest of the dish.\xa0Each plate has all the requisite char kway teow ingredients — soft eggs, chives, decently thick fish cake and lap cheong slices, bean sprouts and cockles.The lap cheong, in particular, has its skin peeled off, pre-sliced and fried beforehand to bring out the fragrance before it’s fried again together with the the noodles and the rest of the ingredients.A small heap of pork lardons are added to the side of the dish instead of it being fried with the dish so it stays crispy while eating.Unusual for char kway teow stalls, a whole lime is also added to every plate to presumably cut through the richness but truthfully, its not really needed, as char kway teow is meant to be a sinful dish anyway.The dish does have a few small downsides — while nice, it sometimes could do with a little more smoky wok hei and perhaps a little cockle juice for a little more depth to the flavour.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/old-chang-kee-4/:['Old Chang Kee is no stranger to releasing new flavours for limited periods and cheese is the theme this time round.Their two newest flavours — the Cheesy Curry Chicken ‘O and the Spicy Cheese Mid Joint Wings have been available since 1st November, so we popped by our local Old Chang Kee outlet to see what the fuss was all about.\xa0Cheesy Curry Chicken ‘O (1 for $2, 2 for $3.60)Imagine a standard Chicken ‘O curry puff but a generous piping of nacho-style cheese is piped onto the pastry before the curry filling is added.That is in essence what the Cheesy Curry Chicken ‘O is about and it actually works pretty well.Old Chang Kee’s curry filling is fairly savoury and well-rounded and the cheese flavour adds more creamy goodness into the mix.As you bite into the puff, the cheese bit is kept to one side so you can decide how much of a cheese burst depending on which angle you bite into the puff.The cheese flavour itself is similar to what you’d get when you order nachos and cheese at the cinema – creamy, cheesy, savoury, nothing like real cheese but tasty in its own right.As usual the usual problem plaguing Old Chang Kee puffs is it’s lack of any spiciness. Not one for spice fans.\xa0Spicy Cheese Mid Joint Wings ($3.50 per cup; six pieces)While six pieces seems like a generous offering for the money, what they’ve actually done is to take three of the middle section of a three-part chicken wing and half it into two.The half mid joint is then lightly battered, fried then a spicy Doritos-like cheese power is sprinkled on top.It has a fairly cheesy flavour and has a nice potent spicy hit. Combined with the salt flavour and fried richness of the mid joint wing, it’s a makes for a nice mid-afternoon snack.\xa0Our problem was actually with the packaging itself.It comes in a box and the two satay sticks provided are a little useless at actually picking the wings up.We prepared tissues and used our hands instead.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/old-chang-kee/:['Pop into your local Old Chang Kee outlet and you’ll notice something different about the Chicken Mushroom ‘O.Instead of the standard curry puff shape, it now has a half-moon crescent shape and it’s easily 30 per cent bigger.But the best news of all? It still costs the same at $1.60 a puff.Old Chang Kee refreshed its Chicken Mushroom ‘O on 6 July of this year with a new shape and a new pastry that has a noticeable buttery taste and fragrance.That was always the main criticism with the old Chicken Mushroom ‘O — that it was a good take on the classic Singapore chicken pie, except for the fact that it didn’t have that buttery crust, so this new version moves it closer to its inspiration.Most outlets will still have stocks of the old Chicken Mushroom ‘O version, so they will sell both versions until the old stock runs out, leaving only the version 2.0 ones.We bought both to see what the differences are and indeed, the size of the version 2.0 is indeed much bigger especially when you put the old and the new next to each other.The new crust is indeed more buttery but with less of a crunch as compared to the old crust.The rest is roughly the same — equal crust thickness and the same filling of carrots, chicken and potato.What is different for sure is in the eating. Biting into the crust and the filling, the new puff does have a richer taste, almost too rich for some.Whatever the case, you are definitely getting your money’s worth with its bigger size so that’s an immediate thumbs up from us.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/old-chang-kee-2/:['When it was reported in 2018 that Old Chang Kee opened up an outlet in Covent Garden, London,\xa0the first thought on every Singaporean’s minds was — what does it taste like? Does it actually taste good or is it old and chunky? (pun intended)Well, I had an opportunity to visit the London outlet on my annual family holiday this year and to cut a long story short, it’s good…and better.Better than the Curry’O you get in Singapore, that’s for sure.I didn’t have time for a sit down but I did manage to check out the store and buy the standard Curry’O for takeaway — or as they call it over there, the Signature Chicken Curry Puff With Egg.\xa0It’s about one and a half times bigger, with a thinner, Malay-style shortcrust pastry.There’s more filling and the filling is nicely moist. Instead of chunky potatoes and chicken pieces, they’ve opted to use smaller potato cubes and smaller chicken pieces.The curry flavour is roughly the same as what you’d get in Singapore with the level of spiciness rather low. If you’re familiar with Old Chang Kee, you’ll know that their curry puffs are pretty low on the spice-o-meter anyway.\xa0As for the price? £2.95 ($4.96) versus the Singapore price of $1.50. The reason why the London puffs are more than three times the price is because of the bigger size of the puff, rental, labour costs and the cost of importing the curry paste from Singapore.Like in Singapore, the pastry is made in a central kitchen and the fillings are cooked in the store’s kitchen. The final sealing, crimping and frying of the puffs are also done at the shop.\xa0A tiny niggle is that the puffs could have come piping hot. Then again, when I popped by the shop, it was on a Thursday evening (6pm) and there was no queue with only a couple of tables taken up.Business wasn’t as brisk like the first six months of their opening so the puffs had been lying around for a bit.\xa0That said, the puff is so good that if I ever lived in London, I’d be going down to the shop every week to satisfy my local cravings, that’s for sure.There were other flavours like Creamy Chicken and Mushroom (£2.95), Beef Rendang (£3.50) and Chilli Crab (£3.20) but I didn’t taste them.The store has also added nine dishes from Old Chang Kee’s restaurant venture, Curry Times, since its opening a year ago so now you can get Singapore favourites like Nasi Lemak, Laksa and Dry Chicken Curry.\xa0The shop is a collaboration between Old Chang Kee and Sandra Leong, a Singaporean who has been living in London for the past eight years.So good job, Old Chang Kee. Now can we please, please, please have the same thing in Singapore as well? I, for one, wouldn’t mind paying more for a premium curry puff.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

We also recommend their Black Angus Beef Skewer ($28).\nAlternatively, you can head over to\xa0Plancha’Lah!, a dinner-only concept that offers\xa0five-course dinner sets, prepared and served from a plancha (open hotpolate).

However, we recommend you skip the Atlantic Salmon ($39), which is rather bland.Even though Andaz Singapore is a new kid on the block, its range of dining offerings looks like one of the most varied for a luxury hotel in Singapore. The food quality is decent and prices are reasonable, and, given the variety of cuisine on offer, is likely to offer something for everyone.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/drinks-from-1965/:['There are many ways to connect with 1965. We can look at old photos, watch archival footage of Singapore in the ’60s, we can listen to the music that filled the airwaves back then and we can seek out objects that existed in that era.But what did 1965 taste like? What did it smell like? Short of finding an old can of beans in grandma’s pantry, there aren’t many ways to know this for sure.We sought help from the wonderful world of wine and whisky: we scoured the shelves of Singapore’s best bars and wine suppliers to find ten drinks available here that were made in 1965. To imagine that the grapes and grain that went into them were growing as Singapore marched towards independence half a century ago is nothing short of awe-inspiring.\xa01965 Kopke Colheita\nPort that captures the essence\nBottling the 1965 Kopke was a process that took a year. Matthieu Delaunay, owner of port wine specialists Colheitas, spent many months in 2014 tasting ports from 1965 to find one that was interesting enough to represent Singapore’s golden jubilee. When he found this one, he knew it was a keeper and purchased the whole barrel. While 1965 may have been a bad vintage for wine in general, here, Delaunay has found a well-balanced port with a beautiful aromatic profile and well-integrated flavours. Thick and sweet with lively acidity that makes the hairs on the back of your neck stand at attention, it captures the essence of our island in many ways from its nostalgia-inducing dried fruit flavours to its surprising youthfulness. In addition to buying direct from Colheitas\xa0($590 per bottle), you can also purchase the wine by the glass at selected venues including the Raffles Hotel, JAAN, CUT and Les Amis.\xa01965 Balblair\nWhisky timed to 1965 perfection\nThe Highland distillery only releases “vintages timed to perfection”, whiskies bottled at their optimum level of maturation making\xa0Balblair whiskies unique.\xa0The oldest vintage they’ve released so far is a 1965 distilled on 23 March 1965\xa0and left to mature in an American oak sherry cask until 2008. The 1965 Balblair received a score of 96.5/100 points from whisky guru Jim Murray while also claiming the title of Single Malt of the Year (Single Cask) in 2013. According to Murray, “it is almost too beautiful for words”. At\xa0$3,000 a bottle from Fine Spirits by\xa0La Maison du Whisky, we’re almost speechless too.\xa0\n\xa01965 Strathisla (Gordon & MacPhail)\nWhisky with a strong following\nFamed for being a key component in Chivas Regal blends, Strathisla single malt whiskies also have a strong following of their own. This 1965 from the Speyside distillery was released by Gordon & MacPhail, independent bottlers who are more than familiar with ancient whiskies. Their most famous release is the Mortlach 70 Year Old, currently the oldest existing whisky. According to the folk at Master of Malt, the 1965 Strathisla delivers a nose of toffee, vanilla and dried fruits with a fruity palate rich in sherry notes. And that would be $1,290 a bottle from Fine Spirits by\xa0La Maison du Whisky, thank you.\xa01965 Glen Grant (Gordon & MacPhail)\nLavish, spicy whisky\xa0\nLike Strathisla, Glen Grant also hails from Speyside and contributes to the blends of Chivas Regal. On its own, it’s the fifth best-selling single malt in the world. While Glen Grant whiskies are generally known for their pale colour and pure flavours, the 1965 offers a rather different flavour experience thanks to the 48 years it spent in first fill sherry casks – it’s lavish, spicy and perfect with a good cigar. It is spriced at $1,120 a bottle from Fine Spirits by\xa0La Maison du Whisky.\xa01965 Samaroli Coilltean Blend\nBold scotch whisky\xa0\nFounded in 1968, Italy-based Samaroli is one of the biggest names when it comes to independent bottlers. They’ve gained a cult following for the unique casks of whisky and rum that they’ve managed to unearth and the 1965 Samaroli Coilltean Blend ($988 a bottle from\xa0The Italian Wine Club) is a perfect example of this. This isn’t a safe, dull blend meant to satisfy the masses, it’s produced using 19th\xa0century techniques and promises an eclectic mix of flavours from custard, oats and wild herbs to leather, liquorice and “cosmetics”.\xa01965 Bowmore (Soffiantino)\nOld-style whisky\nWhen one discusses the golden eras of whisky, the 1960s are always part of the conversation. These were the last years before modernisation ended age-old practices that produced whisky flavour expressions distinctly different from what we know today. The Auld Alliance has collected many of these bottlings from reputable distilleries, giving you a rare opportunity to experience whiskies that simply can’t be recreated. The 1965 Bowmore, bottled in the 1980s for Italian importers Soffiantino, is just one of these old-style whiskies in their library. It will cost you\xa0$300 a glass or $5,900 a bottle\xa0at\xa0The Auld Alliance.\xa01965 The Macallan Special Selection\nFrom Macallan’s sherry cask days\nThis whisky comes from a time when The Macallan only aged its single malts in sherry casks. Times have changed, but this intriguing 17 Year Old (it was bottled in 1983) is just the kind of creamy and elegant dram that brought The Macallan the iconic status that it enjoys today. Priced at\xa0$3,690 a bottle at\xa0The Auld Alliance.\xa01965 Bunnahabhain (The Whisky Agency)\nRelatively affordable 1965 whisky\nGiven the age and scarcity of 1965 bottlings, the high price tags will definitely keep most of them out of the hands of the everyday connoisseurs. That isn’t the case for this 1965 Bunnahabhain, however. Priced at a comparatively affordable $64 a glass, this light and fruity “Private Stock”, bottled at 45 years of age, will give you plenty of bang for your buck. If you want it as a bottle, it’s\xa0$1,090 at\xa0The Auld Alliance.\xa01965 Clynelish (Corti Brothers)\nThe rise and fall of Scotch whisky\nWhen you have 50 years of history contained in a bottle, you can expect that bottle to tell a tale or two. What you get with the 1965 Clynelish, bottled for Sacramento supermarket Corti Brothers, is a story of the rise and fall (and rise again) of Scotch whisky. Clynelish still exists as a distillery today, owned by Diageo, but that distillery only opened in 1967. The Clynelish in this bottle comes from an older distillery which dates back to 1819. Closed in 1969, the original Clynelish re-opened under the name Brora in the early 1970s. As the demand for Scotch whisky plummeted, the distillery met its final end in 1983. Today, with the demand for old and rare whiskies stronger than ever, these Brora/Clynelish bottlings have become some of the most sought after in the world. There are only a handful of Corti Brothers bottles left and The Auld Alliance’s director Emmanuel Dron will only sell this one to someone who truly understands its story. The price is also another story: you’d have to ask\xa0The Auld Alliance.\xa01965 Château de Flarambel Armagnac\nA creamy, sweet trio\nSpecially bottled by The Auld Alliance to mark Singapore’s 50\xa0years of independence, this Armagnac hails from a tiny producer in the Armagnac-Ténarèze AOC. An invitingly sweet and creamy spirit, its classic brandy characteristics are beautifully enveloped by oak. This stunning drop goes for $80 by the glass at the bar while a set of three exclusive magnum bottles with hand-painted labels depicting Singaporean icons is available for $15,000.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

For Michael, the decor and even the dress code (there’s none!) are secondary. “I wanted to do away with the fuss and frills of fine-dining. I just want our guests to focus on the dishes and enjoy the experience without unnecessary distractions.”Indeed, all eyes are on the dishes the minute they arrive at your table, thanks to an exotic sprinkling of buds, shoots, leaves and stems. Michael’s cerebral dining concept is about the food engaging the senses and inspiring thoughts on the source of ingredients and the cooking process.Michael’s slow-cooking style meant that beef could be cooking for 40 hours at 70?C, and onion stock simmering for 22 hours at 90?C. That’s the extent that Michael and his team go to serve up the best textures and flavours.\xa0You’ve worked at some top restaurants in the UK, Spain and Denmark. Which is your most memorable stint? It would be Mugaritz in San Sebastian, Spain, simply because it felt like the United Nations working there.

You have chefs from American, UK, Peru–you name it.\xa0What kick started your interest in cooking and to set up your own restaurant?I was in my second year in law school in 2000 when I had a meal at The Fat Duck. The meal was sensational! Cauliflower risotto sprinkled with cocoa powder, snail porridge and the ‘sound of the sea’ dish featuring oyster-seaweed foam with clams and mussels, served with the acoustical sound of the sea, but it was the bacon and egg ice cream served with French toast that sealed it for me.\xa0You are known to use some unique ingredients for your seasonal menus. What are they? I’ve used wood sorrel, garlic chive flowers, society garlic flowers, nasturtiums and wild garlic leaves for a waygu cheek dish. A gurnard dish that my chefs made had borage stems and flowers, a flower that tastes unusually like an oyster called blue oyster flowers, wild sorrel and cornflowers.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/le-xiao-chu/:['Porridge is not typically what most people would consider an indulgent meal, but a Chinese restaurant chain here is hoping to change that mindset.Le Xiao Chu, which has branches in Balestier and Trade Hub, serves up a seafood porridge that can only be described as decadent. Prepared congee-style, this porridge is chock-full of fresh seafood including mud crab, giant prawns, and clams. Depending on how much you want to ramp up the luxe factor, the restaurant offers diners an even more indulgent version that includes lobster and abalone. Other ingredients, including fish maw, sea cucumber, and meat, can also be added as per-item extras.I will admit that I am picky when it comes to porridge. Raised by a Cantonese grandmother, I am used to having the good stuff (think century egg porridge with pig liver and dough fritters) for breakfast. Le Xiao Chu’s seafood porridge, which was inspired by a similar dish from in Guangdong, China, certainly met my high standards.\xa0Served in a claypot, this porridge was a perfect combination of gooey congee and seafood broth. I liked the consistency of the congee: not too starchy nor too watery, with just the right amount of soft rice bits in it. The seafood broth, combined with the amazing flavours of the seafood ingredients, turned this already good congee into a superstar.I loved how everything in this porridge tries to compete for my attention. On its own, the congee with its sweet seafood flavours is amazing. And yet at the same time, every other ingredient, from the fresh mud crab to the prawns and clams, were promising more seafood goodness.This very rich pot of porridge was surprisingly not overly heavy on the palate, coming across as a light, but very satisfying meal.Should the seafood porridge not fill your belly on its own, Le Xiao Chu is also pretty adept at serving a bevy of other great Chinese dishes. I especially liked the restaurant’s signature Garlic Chicken, which is served with a delicious, crispy skin. For the more adventurous, the restaurant also serves Steamed Shark Head, which is chock-full of collagen.If you like porridge, Le Xiao Chu’s seafood porridge should be on your to-eat list. As the porridge is meant for sharing, this Chinese restaurant chain may also be a good place for family gatherings and dinners.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/ri-ri-hong-mala-hotpot/:['A relatively hot craze which started some three to four years ago, People’s Park is a hotbed for Sichuan dishes. In particular\xa0mala xiang guo\xa0(hot numbing fragrant pot) where customers choose raw ingredients (meat, vegetables, beancurd) and they are stir-fried in a spicy gravy. It is distinctly different from mala hotpot where people dip raw meat and vegetables into a spicy soup.A dish hugely popular in China, Ri Ri Hong was the first to open in People’s Park Centre in 2012 selling the dish cheaper (sometimes by as much as half price) than anywhere else and is arguably the most popular here having opened a second outlet within the food centre, to cater to the demand.\xa0If you’ve never eaten fragrant pot before, the process is fairly simple: there is a fridge portion of the stall where you choose your raw ingredients, then you move along, and you are asked how spicy you’ll want it and if you want rice with it. Pay for your order, and you are given a number; then you wait for your completed meal (upwards of $11 and more compared to some places selling it at $20+).The raw ingredients are chopped up and are fried in a potent mala sauce that is made with over 20 different herbs and spices. There are four levels of spiciness — non-spicy, spicy (which is relatively unspicy), medium spicy which most people will be comfortable with. Hot spicy is really catering for hardcore chilli fans. You can tell the level of spiciness by how numb your tongue gets.You can also specify whether you’d like it with more gravy, more soupish or even with a clear broth.Also, be warned that they work on a sell-by-volume principle, so they will give you a lot of one item — so if you order meatballs, don’t expect just two or three. They’ll give you six to eight, and you can’t ask for less. So before you know it, you’ll have a huge amount of food on your hands, especially for those of you who are used to having a lot of variety in your meals.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/dunman-duck-rice/:['We ordered a portion of the braised duck rice ($2.50) as this stall is famous for its braised duck ($28 for a whole duck; $14 for half). But sadly, we were not blown away by the dish.Sure, the duck was succulent and well marinated, and the rice and gravy were suitable accompaniments. But there was an x-factor that was missing in this dish in order for this stall to rise above the ranks of other equally decent braised duck specialists.Instead, it was the kway chap ($3.50 for noodles and a plate of mixed items) that stole the thunder. The flat rice noodles were done well–soft and silky, but with a little bite. The noodles were dunked in a light brown broth that was delicious and topped with wolfberries, fried onions and freshly sliced spring onions.The accompanying items on a mixed plate of braised goodies, including portions of hard boiled egg, fish cake, pig intestine, tau pok and pig skin were delicious. The thick dark sauce blanketing the items was salty, but left a sweet aftertaste. It also had slight notes of cinnamon and star anise, part of the traditional Chinese five-spice combo.The ingredients in kway chap may be humble, but the owners of this stall certainly know how to make them as good as gold.You can also order the duck porridge, which costs $2.50 per serving.\xa0Rating: 3.5/5\xa0Dunman Duck Rice#01-10 Dunman Food Centre \xa0Opening hours: 11am-9pm; Closed on FriAuthor© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/raffles-courtyard-annette-tan/:['Peranakan cuisine is heavily steeped in tradition. In fact, many Peranakan restaurants often seek to reproduce the timeless concoctions of their forefathers as faithfully as possible, making sure to recall the Malaysian, Chinese and Indonesian influences that define this ethnic group. But food writer Annette Tan, also chef behind the private dining establishment FatFuku, has different ideas. She seeks to transpose her traditional Peranakan family recipes to the modern culinary epoch, bringing fresh ideas to well-known dishes.From 12 May to 11 June, Annette’s creative Peranakan menu will grace the lush alfresco setting of Raffles Courtyard. This is part of their Private Chef Series, which features collaborations with esteemed local chefs.HungryGoWhere was invited to sample this interesting menu. Here’s what we thought of it:Annette’s inventiveness comes to the fore with dishes like the Mee Siam Rosti – yes, you read that right – which takes the Swedish potato pancakes and tops them with prawn and quail egg sambal and a Nonya-style mee siam gravy. The novelty of pairing the crisp and fluffy rosti with the spicy accents of Peranakan cuisine makes for quite the interesting treat, and the presence of the meaty prawns and dense quail eggs gives the dish its substance. Whereas the Mee Siam Rosti dazzled with its exciting combinations, the Nasi Lemak Buah Keluak drew us in with its bold simplicity. Fragrant nasi lemak peeks out of a banana leaf package in all its white splendour, while the black buah keluak sambal, enriched with minced prawns and pork for sweetness, adds as much rich flavour to the dish as visual contrast. The bitter but addictive taste of the buah keluak sambal compliments the savoury coconut rice well, while the side of tangy achar adds both a refreshing quality and crunchy texture to the mix. As the Peranakans are known for their kuehs, we are happy to report that the Pandan Kueh Koh Swee – tender squares of kueh suffused with natural pandan juice and coconut – does not disappoint. The snack was sweet but not overbearingly so, and the pandan and coconut flavours made for a gentle, pleasing whole. We capped off our meal with the Roasted Banana Ice Cream with Gula Melaka Syrup, which are made from caramelised bananas roasted with pure cane sugar. It has a depth and richness of flavour reminiscent of fried banana fritters, except enhanced by the highly fragrant gula melaka.This collaborative menu will be available at Raffles Courtyard daily from 12 May to 11 June, 3:00pm to 9.00pm. Plus, on Wednesdays and Thursdays, from 6:00pm to 8:00pm, guests will also have the opportunity to meet and mingle with Annette herself.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

Some are looking for value-for-money, some a quiet spot for sipping highballs after work, and some really great bar food. Whatever the case, there are bars in the CBD that have you covered. We’ve selected three great bars that elevate happy hours to a whole different level!Erwin’s Gastrobar (Marina Bay Link Mall)Walk into Erwin’s Gastrobar at Marina Bay Financial Center and you’ll feel like you’ve stepped into an Italian-style gastrobar from New York City or Sydney. Think sleek-looking brushed metal and wood bar stools and wooden tabletops, classic incandescent yellow lighting and tastefully muted colours.Food-wise, they have a wide range of classic western gastrobar mains, everything from hearty sandwiches and roasted meats to salads and pizzas. It’s also one of the few places where you can get a great steak sandwich ($19.50) — black Angus ribeye, rocket leaves, tomato relish with shaved parmesan and honey mustard on side bread. Not to be missed.But check out their bar bites which go especially well with their popular Jim Beam Highballs — the Beef Hot Plate ($19) — tantalising slices of beef sizzling on a hot plate a with a lovely flavoursome pepper sauce on the side is especially delightful.You also can’t go wrong with the grilled Lamb Skewers ($18.50) where the meat comes juicy and with a great cumin, chilli, yogurt dip on the side.\xa0The Spot (Marina One) Located at the very new and very luxurious Marina One, The Spot is essentially a gastrobar where cutting edge modern European food is its main focus.While they have excellent lunch and dinner menus, it is their bar snack selections that are very extensive – and when it comes to Jim Beam Highballs and great bar snacks, it’s basically a marriage made in heaven.Big highlights are their enticing charcuterie and cheese platters, plus award-winning individual cheeses like the Tasmanian Heritage Double Brie Cheese and the Roaring Forties Blue Cheese from Australia’s King Island Dairy.All cheeses are served with muscatels, quince paste and rye bread, which is another big plus.There are also two other dishes which are worth ordering.The Eclair Sandwich ($18) uses Choux dough bread and fills it with smoked salmon, a spread of salted egg yolk emulsion, curry leaf powder and mentaiko.The other is the Cod Bradade Gratin ($17), a well-loved Provencal dish comprised of salted cod, potatoes, baked and topped with Assam Tomato Jam, Avruga & Ikura Roe Salsa, Pork Skin Crackers.1-Altitude (One Raffles Place)What’s better than a Jim Beam Highball with great bar food and decor?

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/egg-stop/:['Riding on the Korean street food wave that is sweeping the local food scene, Korean toast is quickly becoming a new food trend in Singapore.Following the opening of Isaac Toast, Egg Stop is next to jump onto the Korean street food bandwagon. But how does it fare, and will it stay relevant with local foodies? We take a bite out of these toasts in hopes of answering these questions.Egg Stop proves that it is truly a homegrown brand that caters to all Singaporeans, thanks to its halal-certification.\xa0We made our way to their first outlet at Paya Lebar Square (right beside Paya Lebar MRT), ‘egg-cited’ to try out the toasts Egg Stop had to offer. And just as we expected, there was a long queue that meant we had to wait thirty minutes before getting our hands on the sandwiches.Egg Stop’s menu currently offers six types of toasts, which include Signature Sandwich ($4.60), Chicken Ham & Cheese (4.90), Turkey Bacon & Cheese ($5.50), Smoked Chicken ($5.90), Beef Teriyaki ($7.40) and Avocado & Egg ($7.90). Diners can pay an additional $2 to get the set meal that comes with a beverage, such as an Americano or an Espresso. Or you could pair your toast with an Ade, a fruit-flavoured soft drink.\xa0We picked the Beef Teriyaki Toast and the Avocado & Egg Toast as they stood out from the other available options.The bread slices used are buttered and toasted to be crunchy on the outside yet soft and fluffy inside, making them a plus point for all types of toasts Egg Stop has to offer. In contrast, the bread at Isaac Toast was not crunchy at all and was rather a disappointment.And true to the brand name, all the sandwiches contain an egg in one form or another.\xa0The Beef Teriyaki Toast contains beef slices covered in Egg Stop’s signature sauce and teriyaki sauce, topped with raw egg yolk. The beef was tender and juicy, taking on a sweet taste thanks to the teriyaki sauce dressing. Together with the onion slices, it added a layer of crunchiness which improved the overall texture of the toast.We thought that the Bulgabi MVP toast from Isaac Toast ($6.50) would feature beef slices as well, but it came in a small and thin patty which was an afterthought really. Egg Stop wins this one again.\xa0The Avocado and Egg Toast was slightly disappointing by comparison. We expected a rich flavour, but the avocado seemed bland and unseasoned. However, we did enjoy the rich texture of the scrambled egg, blended with avocado and the signature sauce.The portions for these toasts were rather small, which make them more fit for a snack rather than a complete meal. However, we would still recommend you to try them if you are in the area and feel like you are up for a different take on toasts, or are a fan of Korean street food.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/roland-restaurant/:['People may not realise it but the chilli crab we eat today is completely different from how it tasted back when it was invented in the 1950s.Which is why my colleague and I recently made a mini-pilgrimage to Roland Restaurant to taste what a 1950s chilli crab tastes like. The seafood restaurant is the only eatery in Singapore which still serves the original 1950s recipe.It was a Friday lunchtime and our meal was a revelation of sorts.A few bites, the next few minutes spent in total silence as we took in the experience. Our brains, however, were filled with a million thoughts.Singapore invented the chilli crab? Why does this chilli crab taste so different? Why is the restaurant empty? Why is it located on top of a multi-storey carpark?Yes, for some strange reason, Roland Restaurant is located on top of a multi-storey carpark in Marine Parade, the location of the now-defunct Sin Leong Restaurant, one of the top Chinese seafood restaurants of yesteryear.\xa0But instead of a packed room of patrons, the restaurant was empty, so much so that every crack of a crab shell and tinkle of metal utensil was amplified.We felt a mixture of shock and sadness but also smiles and a complete sense of satisfaction as the crab was freakin’ amazing.We talked to a waitress told us that the restaurant is less than half full during weekday dinnertimes but is at full capacity during the weekends.But we’re ahead of ourselves quite a bit. The story of how chilli crab came to be and how it landed up at Roland Restaurant is a fascinating one in itself.\xa0THE INVENTION OF CHILLI CRABIn the 1950s, Madam Cher Yam Tian and her husband, Lim Choon Ngee, lived in a kampung (Malay for “village”) near the shores of East Coast, Singapore.They would frequently catch prawns and crabs from the sea for their meals but eating the same steamed seafood was becoming quite pedestrian, even for customers, so Lim asked his wife to come up with new ways to cook the crabs. In 1953, she hit the jackpot when she came up with a chilli-and-tomato-sauce concoction which we now famously know as chilli crab.At the couple’s small makeshift pushcart seafood restaurant along the Kallang River, the chilli crab dish became quite popular with patrons and was the main feature of her family restaurant, Palm Beach Seafood Restaurant, which opened in 1962 along Upper East Coast Road.In 1984, the couple sold off part of the restaurant’s shares, migrated to New Zealand but business was slow so 15 years later, they came back to Singapore.Their son, Roland Lim started working in Palm Beach before joining his godfather, Master Chef Sin Leong at Sin Leong Restaurant which at the time had shifted from Serangoon Road to the top of the Marine Parade Central multi-storey carpark.Sin Leong was one of the four heavenly kings of Chinese cuisine who helped shaped the Singapore Chinese restaurant scene in the 1950s and 60s. When Mr Sin Leong retired, he passed the restaurant over to Roland who subsequently renamed it Roland Restaurant in 2000.\xa0MODERN CHILLI CRAB VERSUS THE ORIGINALIn the 1960s, Chinese restaurants took the chilli crab recipe — the hottest food trend of its time — and came up with their own renditions of the dish, the most successful of which is Dragon Phoenix who added eggs and sambal into the mix.It resulted in less of that bottled chilli sauce flavour into what we know as the chill crab sauce of today.In current times, most chilli crab dishes will almost always have egg swirls and sambal in its sauce. The original chilli crab rendition is now a rarity in Singapore’s food landscape.\xa0THE ORIGINAL TASTEThe original recipe sauce is very different compared to the normal chilli crab offerings in Singapore.It has a tomato-y, chilli sauce flavour to it, but it is much more than that — spicy (spicier than normal), sweet, savoury with perhaps a very slight tinge of sourness to balance out the flavours. It’s actually a very compelling balanced flavour.It has a dark reddish hue, very unlike other chilli crab dishes which opt for a bright red colour. The consistency is medium thick with very little starch added and it has lots of large chopped garlic in it.There is a very slight underlying seafood stock flavour which is accentuated when you eat the crab.The sauce is so strong flavoured that it almost overwhelms the natural flavours of the crab if you put too much of it with the crab but that’s more of a nitpick as the sauce is irresistibly captivating.It is a truly unique flavour which tastes nothing like any other chilli crab dish in Singapore, that is, if patrons actually order it.\xa0A DISH FADING INTO OBSCURITY?On the menu, two versions of the chilli crab are featured, the “Traditional Chilli Crab” and “Roland’s Chilli Crab” — which is modified to include sambal and eggs.If you just order chilli crab, the default option is the one with sambal and eggs. You have to specifically tell the waitresses that you want the traditional version.The waitress told us she was surprised that we ordered the original dish as most patrons prefer the chilli crab with the egg swirls.We had mistakenly tried “Roland’s Chilli Crab” on a previous occasion and the taste resembles the traditional but is closer to the modern version of what chilli crab tastes like. The egg swirls tame the intensity of the sauce and gives the sauce its signature layered texture.An hour later, we had finished our meal. We called for the bill and by the time we paid up, a party of four had come in through the door.It was 2pm and aside from the new table of four, the restaurant was still empty.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/healthy-hawker-food/:['As Singaporeans, hawker food is one of the cornerstones of Singaporean cuisine and an integral part of our heritage and culture. We have strong opinions on what constitutes a national hawker dish and argue over which hawker centre has the best Hainanese chicken rice, char kway teow (fried flat rice noodles), bak chor mee (mushroom and minced meat vinegar-based noodles) rojak or satay.Many of us depend on the hawker centre for fast, convenient and affordable meals – but are those meals healthy? Is it possible to find healthy options in a hawker centre?You can find these options at hawker centres like Yuhua Hawker Centre. At no extra cost, most of the 53 stalls at this Jurong East Avenue 1 centre offer substitutes like brown rice and wholegrain noodles. Signs showing the calorie counts of the dishes are also displayed at the stalls. But what if you’re too far from this neighbourhood?You can still eat healthy at a hawker centre by reducing the amount of refined carbohydrates like white rice, bee hoon and noodles. Refined carbohydrates should be avoided as they cause spikes in your blood sugar levels and cause other diseases such as obesity, heart disease, diabetes and insulin resistance.Increase the amount of vegetables on your plate to dose up on the natural goodness of minerals and vitamins. Vegetables, which are high in fibre, take a longer time to digest so you feel full for a longer period of time. Eat more protein such as meats, eggs, beans (legumes) and tofu to maintain a healthy body and immune system.Here are some suggestions for healthy eating in a hawker centre which concentrate on reducing the amount of refined carbohydrates and increasing the amount of protein and fibre:\xa0Economy rice\nThis ubiquitous hawker staple, found in most kopitiams and hawker centres, offers a huge variety of vegetables, meats, fish and tofu dishes with rice. Try limiting the amount of rice you order (preferably no rice) and choose two to three vegetable dishes with a meat or fish dish and steamed egg or tofu.\xa0Yong tau foo\nDo without the noodles or rice and load up on the fresh green vegetables, tofu, egg and fish based items like fishballs or fishcakes. Skip the sweet sauce which is loaded with MSG and sugar, and have your delicious yong tau foo in soup.\xa0Fish soup with extra vegetables\nTry to choose a fish soup which is made without MSG, with sliced fresh fish (not fried). Skip the white rice and ask for more fresh green leafy vegetables.\xa0Chicken rice, no rice\nChoose poached chicken (ask for extra) and ask for tofu, boiled braised egg, blanched vegetables and skip the rice itself. If you are more adventurous, add chicken kidneys and liver for extra protein.\xa0Braised duck rice, no rice\nBraised duck with braised tofu, boiled braised egg, and skip the chicken rice. Get more cucumbers for fibre. Dive into braised duck’s liver and kidneys for more protein.\xa0Popiah\nThis local delight is high in fibre and is packed with protein in the prawns, eggs and tofu.Try eating these hawker favourites and you might find yourself having more energy and maybe even losing some unhealthy weight.

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/chicken-chop/:['Like many of our hawker dishes, street-style western food is a unique part of our culinary heritage. These Western food stalls had a heavy Chinese influence, as the cooks who set up these stalls were mostly Hainanese chefs who had previously worked in colonial English restaurants and hotels.For the past few decades, these Western food hawker stalls provided an affordable alternative for those wanting a taste of non-Asian cuisine. The menu comprised mainly of grilled meats, the all-time favorite being chicken chop.For this edition of Tried & Tested, we pay homage to this disappearing breed of old-time Western food hawkers.

Prices here are comparatively steeper, but they make up for it with generous portions. Each order includes two hearty pieces of juicy grilled boneless chicken leg.The meat was gorgeously tender and juicy, but could have had more charred flavour. One can only imagine how much more sublime the result would be if they had continued to grill their meats over charcoal. The accompanying gravy was pleasantly sweet and mildly tangy, but we wished it had greater depth and savoury flavours.Evidently, there was attention paid to both the main item and side dishes. The fries were well executed. Crisp on the outside with fluffy insides, the lightly salted fries were nicely executed. We especially loved the soft, airy bun, served with good quality butter. It was indeed an old-fashioned touch that brought back fond memories of our childhood!*Operations will cease end of February as this food centre will be closed down.

The well-grilled and extremely juicy meat demonstrated good control of fire.However, there was a hint of frozen meat taste. Thankfully, that was somewhat masked by the hearty brown sauce. The restrained use of black pepper in the tasty sauce added zing to the dish. Crisp, creamy and immensely refreshing, the outstanding coleslaw was easily the most unforgettable side dish in this round-up.\xa0Western Barbeque51 Old Airport Road, #01-53 Old Airport Road Food CentreOpening hours: 11.30am-11pm; closed on MonPrice: $5.00Rating: 4/5Like Tasty Barbeque, the style here is very old-school.The chops were slightly charred, which imparted an intense smoky aroma. While the edges of the meat were browned, the middle part was more moist. We liked how the chicken was well-marinated, which means it was already very flavoursome without the need for heavy sauce or gravy.The sides were simple: fries, baked beans, sliced tomato, cucumber and a buttered bun. The fries were crispy without being greasy. To our surprise, the bun came thickly slathered with margarine and sprinkled with sugar. How nostalgic is that?\xa0Chef Hainanese Western Food1/2/3 Commonwealth Drive, #01-04 Commonwealth Drive Food CentreOpening hours: 6.30pm-10pm; closed on WedPrice: $4.50Rating: 3.5/5Another old-timer, Chef Hainanese Western Food is still going strong, judging by the 20-minute wait during dinner time. Most memorable was their wide array of sides: baked beans, coleslaw, fresh vegetables, crinkle cut fries and a whole baked potato topped with mayonnaise.The chicken chops came with two sauces: black pepper and sweet-savoury sauce. The sauces were extremely tasty, but also made us very thirsty after the meal.Although the dish offered great value, we wished execution had been better. The chops were over-grilled, so they were too dry. The fries also suffered the same fate from spending a minute too long in the fryer.\xa0S&M Western BBQ163 Bukit Merah Central, #02-38 Bukit Merah Central Food CentreOpening hours: 12pm-8pm; closed on Sun & PHPrice: $4.50Rating: 3/5This stall has been operating here for at least 20 years. The style is no-frills, just chicken chop accompanied with fries, pickled slaw and a slice of tomato and cucumber each.They took the time to slowly sear the meat and crisp up the skin. The result was thin, crispy chicken skin that was a joy to devour. However, they snipped the meat in thicker parts so that it would cook more evenly. We thought that by doing this, some of the meat juices escaped, which was a pity. The light but tasty gravy, made with Worcestershire sauce, was a very retro touch.inSing.com made anonymous visits and paid for its own meals at the stalls featured here.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/the-affogato-bar/:['Chances are, if you ask someone local what affogato is, you’ll be met with quizzical looks. Huh? Affogato… what?\xa0they might say. Fancy-sounding though it may be,\xa0affogato (meaning “drowned” in Italian) is a simple coffee-based dessert that features an ice cream being drowned in a shot of espresso. While the affogato has found itself a place on the menus of many cafés in Singapore, it has largely been an afterthought.The Affogato Bar, a small and modest café located at Cluny Court along Bukit Timah Road, introduces an uncommon concept: the affogato as the preeminent star.The Affogato Bar breaks away from the traditional style, which usually features vanilla gelato ice cream with a single shot of espresso with their five unique combinations of ice cream for their affogatos, all of which feature double shots of espresso.Signature creations here include Death by Chocolate ($13.90) and Pot of Honey ($11.90). Both signatures use the Grande Tazza blend of Dimattina coffee which hails from Australia. The blend offers a balanced and flavourful taste, leaning to the chocolate-y side. And boy does the blend go well with chocolate.\nDeath by Chocolate is the highlight here. This affogato showcases a harmonious combination of chocolate sorbet, brownie chunks, chocolate streusels, chocolate top hat and topped with Grande Tazza. The rich dessert anchored by the chocolate sorbet mixes beautifully with the espresso to provide a balance of sweet and bitter.When we were there, the honey swirl coffee ice cream used for Pot of Honey was not available and they recommended the vanilla ice cream as a substitute. We were, however, not as blown away as we were for the Death by Chocolate. Perhaps their original honey swirl coffee ice cream would have been a better fit.\nIf you are looking for something lighter, definitely give the Carota Carota a try. This affogato (along with the Banana Ramble) uses Dimattina’s (a popular Australian coffee brand) mocharoma blend, which possesses a fruitier flavour. The lighter, fruitier Mocharoma blend lends itself well to the other ingredients: carrot cake ice cream, carrot cake, chopped walnuts and homemade cream cheese.Although The Affogato Bar prides itself on their affogatos (obviously), we would be remiss if we did not mention the supporting actors on their menu. The café offers a selection of bagels (plain, sea salt, multi-grain, black and white sesame) and bagel sandwiches. We had the Deli Beef with sea salt bagel ($14.90) and their recommended Breakfast Club ($12.90) with multi-grain bagel.The Deli Beef was accompanied by onions, sun-dried tomatoes, arugula and sun-dried tomato cream cheese. The Breakfast Club adopted the classic combination of ham, egg and cheese. You can’t really go wrong with those combinations, can you?\nWe also tried their signature coffee, Bittersweet Symphony ($5.50, $6.50 for iced) and tea, Parakeet Bay ($6). The Bittersweet Symphony of dark cocoa, vanilla chai and espresso had an overwhelming chocolate flavour that masked much of the bitterness espresso. However, this should appeal to chocolate lovers out there. Parakeet Bay, on the other hand, offers an interesting infusion of green tea, peach and mango. The scent of peach and mango hits you instantly and it was a refreshing drink to say the least.Overall, The Affogato Bar brings something new to the table to both the café and dessert scene, and if you are in the area looking to beat the sweltering heat, definitely drop by The Affogato Bar.\xa0HungryGoWhere paid for our own meal.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/le-castella/:['Le Castella, the Taiwanese brand best known for its light-as-air Japanese-style\xa0sponge cakes, has arrived on our shores.Their castella cakes are similar to Japanese sponge cakes, and are famous for being light, fluffy, and wobbly. They\xa0do not contain any preservatives.When they first expanded overseas and opened an outlet in Seoul, they attracted hours-long queues. The situation here is pretty much the same at the moment — people queue up just to place their orders (Le Castella Singapore does not accept phone or online orders at the moment) and return hours later to collect their cakes. The queue alone to place your order can take anywhere from one hour to five hours.\xa0We could smell the distinct eggy fragrance of the cakes throughout the time we were queuing — something that made the wait that much more agonising.All cakes at Le Castella are freshly made on order, and come piping hot from the oven. And 58 eggs reportedly go into each batch of cakes, which are cut into 10 large pieces, with each individual slab measuring approximately 23cm by 13cm — the staff at Le Castella actually use rulers to help them divide each batch of cakes evenly.The cakes are also made using halal-certified ingredients, and co-founder\xa0Ahmad Adam, 25,\xa0says that they are working on attaining their halal certification.The outlet here currently offers two flavours — Original ($9.90) and Cheese ($11.90) — with a third one, Chocolate, to be launched soon. According to Adam, they\xa0also have plans to launch exclusive, limited-time local-inspired flavours.That said, their bestseller is the cheese castella cake.\nNow, the important question: do the cakes live up the hype?The cakes — we tried both the original and cheese — were indeed light, pillowy, and fluffy, especially when hot off the oven, but they sink quickly and lose a lot of puffiness and wobbliness when they cool down. We enjoyed the original,\xa0which reminds us very much of ‘ji dan gao’ with its delicate eggy flavour. However, the cheese castella disappointed, since the flavour of the cheese was way too subtle.These cakes should preferably be eaten warm, but there are no seats at Le Castella and the cakes’ size makes it difficult for on-the-spot consumption.We think prices are justified, though, especially for the original castella. At a mere $9.90, the slab of cake can be shared between six to eight people. So no complains there.Regardless, don’t expect queue times — up to five hours — to abate any time soon, especially right now when it’s all the rage.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/kallang-cantonese-live-prawn-noodle/:['Kallang Cantonese Live Prawn Noodle has been selling prawn noodles since 1973, but in 2011, they decided to stand out from the competition and offer live prawns instead.So when you order their Live Prawn Noodle ($6/8/10/12), owner Seow Toh Chio, 57, will scoop out live prawns from a freshwater tank in front of her stall and immediately dunk them in hot boiling water. A couple of minutes later, the cooked prawns are strained into a bowl, and prawn broth is poured over them.Located in Old Airport Road Food Centre, Seow is the only hawker offering live prawn hae mee in Singapore.\xa0The resultant prawns are simply amazing. Fresh, sweet-tasting, juicy and springy. It is hard to get better quality than this.In fact, her prawns are so good that some customers order just her broth and live prawns without the noodles.The broth is strictly the clear Cantonese style and is full of prawn flavour. The stock takes centre-stage and is augmented with only a restrained amount of rock sugar and lots of fried onions.\xa0The prices are also much lower than the competition. A $10 order gets you five mid to large prawns plus noodles. Incredible value.Seow gets her live prawns from a supplier every day, but they only come in from 11am onwards.Not a bad timing as her prawn broth tastes better the closer it gets to lunchtime.\xa0The dry noodles are a secondary highlight, redolent with slightly sweet chilli sambal, fried onions and pork lard. It contrasts nicely with the predominantly savoury prawn broth. Seow also throws in a decent amount of kang kong and bean sprouts for good measure.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/lian-he-ben-ji-claypot-rice/:['Easily the most famous hawker stall after Liao Fan Hawker Chan, Lian He Ben Ji has been in the business of selling claypot rice since 1979 and the stall has built up such a loyal following that it is easily a 40-minute wait even when you place an order at its opening time of 4.30pm.The waiting times have undoubtedly been made worse now that the stall has made it into the 2018 list of Michelin Bib Gourmand winners.\xa0Now in the hands of second-generation owners — from founder to daughter-in-law who then brought in her sister and cousin to help out, the stall has been nicknamed the “Three Sisters Claypot Rice” as the entire outfit is run by women only.\xa0The claypot rice ($5/8/10/12/15/20) is cooked upon order and is executed like how all good claypot rice stalls do it — five minutes over a gas stove to cook the rice before the rest of the ingredients are added, then transferred to a charcoal fire to cook for a further 20 minutes.Combined with its popularity, waiting times can stretch to an hour and a half during peak times.\xa0There are decent amounts of ingredients — cai xin, chicken and especially nice are the lap cheong and waxed pork belly slices. Sometimes they put yun cheong (liver sausage) but you don’t see it often and it’s not a lot of it when they do. You can add ingredients (an additional $2) if you feel that you want more of a particular ingredient.Thankfully, they also don’t cut back on the crucial salted fish — about a thumbful or more for an $8 portion — enough to flavour the rice sufficiently.The chicken pieces are nicely marinated though it could do with more Chinese wine flavour and when cooked, the meat is tender, though not as soft as some of the other claypot rice stalls we’ve eaten at.The flavour of the dish is on the whole\xa0good, if not excellent — with a nice smoky aroma, enough oil-richness, savouriness and slightly sweet notes, but it is largely dependant on how much dark soy sauce you add into the dish.Unlike other claypot rice stalls, more than the usual amount of dark soy sauce is needed to reach a decent savouriness here. You’ll see many patrons pour in (not drizzle) huge amounts of dark soy sauce into the dish.The dark soy sauce used is of a lower quality — not as thick, more salty, with less sweet and smoky notes — but it works with the claypot rice here as it adds more salt into the mix than what a premium grade would add.\xa0One downside is the texture of the rice which is very often inconsistent. On some days, perfectly cooked with nice dry, al dente bits, on some others, softer-than-usual bordering on being too moist.The problem we feel is that the pot is very often not left on the stove for long enough for the rice to dry out or the crusty rice bits to sufficiently crisp up. So, the crusty rice bits are very often not crunchy enough, despite it being burnt.It also means that while the dish is adequately tasty, it very often lacks a certain robustness or intensity of flavour that a good claypot rice can get.\xa0That said, it may not be among the top five claypot rice stalls in Singapore but it definitely earns its spot among the top 10 comfortably.\xa0Additional note: You have to help yourself to the chilli sauce at the main counter. It comes moderately spicy and intensely sour. Great for cutting through the richness.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/po-restaurant/:['If you’ve ever stumbled upon restaurants claiming to do “modern takes on local food” or “new spins on traditional favourites”, that’s partly owing to Williln Low, the man credited as one of the pioneers of the Mod-Sin (Modern Singapore) culinary movement. Wild Rocket, the restaurant he founded in 2005, has earned a reputation as one of the go-to places for familiar dishes given fresh interpretations.Low has parlayed his culinary clout into a new project: Po, the flagship restaurant of hip new hotel The Warehouse Hotel, which sits at the bank of Robertson Quay.And just as with Wild Rocket, Low has taken his penchant for celebrating and modernising Singapore flavours to Po.The old-meets-new culinary philosophy of Po also fits with the vibe of The Warehouse Hotel, a gorgeous conserved building that was first built in 1895, but has been updated with a modern look via industrial chic decor.With Po, the dishes aren’t wildly wacky or fancy; the focus here is to simply update or enhance local classics with premium ingredients.Po derives its name from popo (“grandmother” in Chinese), and the\xa0popiah, which is unsurprisingly one of the restaurant’s signatures — you can go for the Classic Platter ($28), suitable for two, Prawn Platter ($38), featuring tiger prawns, and Fresh Flower Crab Platter ($58), which includes handpicked crabmeat.Guests are left to wrap the popiah themselves as Po wants them to experience the traditional way to enjoying the dish.We had the prawn platter, and while we like the vegetables, stewed for four hours to produce a pleasing sweet-savoury flavour, the end result was just okay, which, at $38 (!), is not okay. It’s not bad by any measure, but you can get comparable or even better tasting popiahs at a fraction of the cost.One of our favourites is the Barramundi Salad ($19), a light, tangy, spicy take on raw fish salad. Following the ban on freshwater fish in all ready-to-eat raw-fish dishes by\xa0National Environment Agency (NEA) in 2015, it’s hard to find raw fish salads in Singapore anymore. If you do, the fish of choice is almost always salmon. So the Barramundi Salad from Po is a breath of fresh air.Another dish we enjoyed was the Charcoal-grilled Iberico Satay ($20). The skewers of satay, marinated for twelve hours in a spicy mix, are chunky, juicy, and moderately charred for a smoky aroma. The freshly grated pineapple and peanut dip also enlivened the dish.End your meal off with the Ice Cream Popiah ($15), which, just like the Popiah, is rather pricey. But the locally made pineapple, taro and peanut gelato, are really delicious, smooth and not overly sweet. You can wrap it together with the freshly shaven peanut candy and sprigs of coriander; we had ours separately and still enjoyed it.Overall, there are more hits than misses at Po; the hits are good but don’t reinvent the wheel, but the lows are hardly bad too, more handicapped by the steep prices than shoddy execution.We can see this place being a popular haunt for business lunches or the occasional extravagant family meal.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/meiii-sushi/:['[THIS RESTAURANT HAS MOVED]\nRating: 3.4 out of 5If you had followed K.F.Seetoh’s food adventures, you might have heard of Ah Hong, a ‘very private Japan-trained’ chef. Dubbed by Seetoh as a ‘top chef’, Ah Hong is in fact a local sushi chef and the former chef-proprietor of Marui Sushi, a Japanese omakase haunt at Cuppage Plaza that has since closed. That much is known of this gentle and bespectacled man who has, apparently, once dabbled with Japanese set meals at a Beach Road hawker stall.Since early 2011, Ah Hong has resurfaced at Tanjong Pagar. His new restaurant, called Meii Sushi, is located on the ground floor unit of Tanjong Pagar Plaza and faces a row of shop houses along Craig Road. With an exposed shop front, Meii Sushi is decidedly less private than Ah Hong’s last outpost in Orchard Road, but that it sits only 16 guests hints at Ah Hong’s boutique intentions. Meii Sushi is, after all, a husband-and-wife run outfit where Ah Hong tends to guests at the 8-seater counter while his wife serves diners in an adjoining 8-seater dining room.Meii Sushi is small, yes, but it is not always an oasis of calm. Don’t get me wrong, the guitar piece playing in the background was, indeed, ethereally soothing. But on the night of our visit, a group of Hokkien expletive-spitting blue-collar diners hogging the counter seats got a little rowdy after a few rounds of alcohol.Notwithstanding that, Meii Sushi is a good find.The restaurant has an extensive hand-written a la carte menu that features sashimi, sushi and the works. Worthy of mention is Ah Hong’s unadon ($22 at dinner), rice crowned with a handsome hunk of grilled eel, a favourite amongst the busy lunch crowd. His chiraishi sushi ($25 at dinner), a bowl of rice topped with chunks of sashimi, however, suffered from lack of flavours from the absence of sakura debu (pink fish flakes) and those pearls of juicy salty fish eggs.\xa0There’s also a crop of wallet-friendly set dinner courses here including sushi course ($50), sashimi set ($30), sushi set ($30), tempura set ($25) and a yakisakana (grilled fish) set ($30).\xa0 But the most economical means to experience the best that Ah Hong has to offer is with his 8-course omakase. Priced at just $100 per head, Meii Sushi has, arguably, the best-value omakase in Singapore. The course dinner, for which you’ll not have a say, may include a heady marinated sashimi of wasabi-spiked octopus; a duo of de-shelled oysters in a zesty, vinegar-laced soy bath; or a snack of Japanese cucumber alongside a sambal-like dip of fermented bean paste. While you may have read how Seetoh enthused about the ‘good-for-shock’ fish eyeball in his omakase, we had a humble yet gargantuan and luscious piece of grilled yellow tail fish cheek drizzled with lemon jus. There was also a tempura of crisp and moist smelt fish that crumbled upon contact with the palate – that had us rapt.As with most set meals, you’ll get a serving of sashimi, sushi and the concluding clear consommé; the latter of which arrived with hoards of voluptuous clams. Though, for $100 a pop, you should not expect a dessert. Not even a piece of watermelon.In-depth ratings:\nFood: 3.5/5\nService: 3/5\nAmbience: 3/5\nValue: 4/5Mei-i Sushi | \xa010 Anson Road, #02-54 International Plaza | Tel: 6220 3466 | Opening hours: Mon–Fri: 11.30am–2.30pm, 6pm–10pm; Sat 6pm–10pmAuthor© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/chicken/:['Chicken is undeniably the most consumed form of poultry in the world. More than 50 billion chickens are reared annually for both their meat and eggs, but not all chickens sold in the market today are the same. Consumers are increasingly spoilt for choice as there are substantially more varieties of chickens available. Let’s take a look at some of the varieties.Common types of chicken:\nMost chickens are reared for 50 to 60 days using intensive farming methods, which means that they are typically kept in cages and fed with medication to boost their health and prevent diseases from spreading rapidly. This farming method is extremely effective and gives the farmers the highest yield, and consumers, lower prices. However, because of the lack of exercise and muscle-development, these chickens tend to be the least flavourful though the meat is tender. Spring chickens, which are generally younger and smaller, also fall into this group. This is a good choice for everyday use in soups, stews and curries.Organic chickens:\nThese chickens are fed a strict diet of organic-certified feed and must be free-range. They also cannot be given any form of drugs or stimulants that encourages growth. An average organic chicken have a typical lifespan twice of the average common chicken and are allowed to roam freely to develop their muscles, which almost guarantees the quality of the bird. This explain why an average organic chicken is almost three times more expensive than the average chicken. Organic chickens can be found in Cold Storage and Swiss Butchery outlets.Antibiotics and growth hormone-free chickens:\nThese types of chickens are more recently introduced in the market. The empress chicken (available in Cold Storage outlets and Meidi-Ya) and the sakura chicken (available in NTUC outlets) are slightly more expensive than the average chicken. They\xa0 are free from antibiotics, hormone stimulants and are free-range as well. They are also extremely tasty and definitely worth a try for their price. These chickens are best boiled, steam or roasted.Kampong chickens\nThese chickens are reared for at least 80 days and in an enclosed space where they develop muscles. Do not be fooled into thinking that the kampong chicken is definitely free-range. Most are actually reared in rows of cages using the kampong breed of chickens. The “real” kampong chicken will cost at least $15 per bird and are less fatty with firmer meat. The popular kampong chicken rice is one dish in which the flavour of the meat can be appreciated.How to choose a good chicken?\nA fresh chicken should look plump and rosy. If the chicken is wrapped in a bag, check the package carefully and make sure there is not too much blood in it and the flesh is not bruised or torn. Make sure the skin is intact as this will flavour and protect the meat during cooking.How to store?\nFresh chicken will keep for up to 3 days. Take the chicken out of the bag, rinse and dry it thoroughly before storing it in the refrigerator. After use, wash the boards and knives thoroughly. Make sure the raw chicken does not come into contact with other food as there could be the risk of bacteria contamination. Supermarkets also sell frozen chicken that is defrosted for consumers’ convenience. Do not re-freeze these chickens.Tip: You can keep the bones of cooked chicken and freeze them. After consolidating about 2-3kg worth, you can make a very good chicken stock by boiling the bones with vegetables like carrots, onions, celery and garlic for a couple of hours. This stock can be frozen for about 2 months.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/hubers-butchery-bistro/:['I don’t know why Mr Ernst Huber did not think of this sooner.He has been selling quality meat in Singapore for the past 16 years, so why not maximise this advantage by selling cooked meats such as roast chicken, grilled sausages, steaks and burgers as well?An ex-hotelier and chef, he started Swiss Butchers, which has a reputation for selling quality meats, sausages and other European store staples back in 1994, before embarking on Huber’s.Such honest-to-goodness fare is now available at his own family-run Huber’s Butchery & Bistro\xa0at Dempsey Road.Aside from selling various kinds of meats (including branded meats such as veal from White Rocks, wagyu beef and kurobuta pork) and his own sausages and hams, there is now a small al fresco area in front of the shop where you can sit at café tables and enjoy breakfast, lunch and tea. (The shop closes at 8 pm.)While it may be uncomfortable sitting outdoors on most afternoons, it is relaxing and inviting on cooler days when the sun is behind the clouds.And believe me, the food (and its prices) more than makes up for any discomfort.We had lunch there one day, sitting next to a fan that was blowing at full blast, and we had one of the best-value burgers to be had in Singapore — with a patty that had a firm and juicy bite.At S$10.80, it came with the full works — melted cheese and crisp rashers of bacon on top and accompanied by fries. A small portion of salad obviated the indulgence.My ever-disciplined husband, however, opted for the house specials, which that day was a homemade pumpkin soup and a wholesome parma ham, fig and mozzarella salad. They were appetisingly light and he declared both winners. And why not, since Mr Huber imports his own cured meats and cheeses.I spied a less wholesome offering of sausage meat patties on rye bread and asked for that to be placed in the middle to be shared. It was nicely browned on the outside and savoury on the inside. Indeed that simple patty on toast made for comforting and satisfying fare, especially if matched with cold beer, as would be the homemade sausages on the menu.While I did not try them, the other blackboard specials that change daily looked equally inviting. Typical items include meat loaf and mash, chile con carne on toast, rib-eye steak sandwich, and yes, smoked duck breast with a berry vinaigrette, which at S$12.50, was the most expensive that day.While the food is not ambitious nor fancy, it is honest and simple, relying basically on good meat and ingredients to deliver the goods. Despite this being his first foray into running a café, Mr Huber, the chef, hotelier and butcher, may well have restaurateur tagged onto his many talents!Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/monster-curry/:['What we liked:What we did not like:Mala variations have popped up in almost every eatery in Singapore, and it is apt that Monster Curry jumps on the bandwagon.To satisfy your Mala cravings in a new way, head down to Monster Curry to try out their limited-edition Mala Japanese curry dishes, the first of such kind in Singapore.On the menu, you can find their three new Mala offerings- the Pork Katsu Mala Curry Rice ($13.80), their Tori Karaage Mala Curry Pizza ($9.80), and the Crispy Soft Shell Crab Mala Pasta ($16.80).These dishes are exclusive to their Chinatown Point outlet from Mar 1, for a limited period only.For their curry rice, you can choose between their different spiciness levels from slightly spicy (Xiao La) to medium level of spiciness (Zhong La), and the highest level of spiciness (Da La).\xa0Monster Curry’s signature Japanese curry sauce contains 14 different spices and vegetables, slow-cooked for 2 days.They have blended the all-new homemade mala sauce into the curry sauce, giving the dish the perfect umami-ness mixed with a perfect spicy kick.Our verdict on the Pork Katsu Mala Curry Rice: This was one of our favourites from the series as it was not too numbing but gave us the Mala kick. The curry’s thickness went well with the hint of mala. When eaten with the pork, you can get a mix of sweet and spicy flavours.This goes well with the texture of the meat as well. The meat was tender yet crispy on the outside, making it a hit for us. We wish there were a little more vegetables as that gave the dish a little crunch and balance.With the Tori Karaage Mala Curry Pizza, you will get a thin pizza crust spread with homemade Mala Japanese curry sauce and topped with a generous serving of Tori Karaage.This new 8-inch pizza is suitable for a feast of one, so if you are looking to treat yourself, this is perfect.Our verdict on the Tori Karaage Mala Curry Pizza:\xa0At one glance, it looked intimidating in terms of spice, but when you bite into it, it proves to be otherwise. The pizza had a good blend of curry and mala that was not too spicy for our palates.But, the numbing sensation overpowered our tastebuds, and we could not really enjoy the pizza as much. There was one straight flavour from the mala spice, so we felt that it lacked depth in flavours.However, the chicken chunks were juicy and surely gave us the variant textures we were looking for. If you are looking for a mala challenge, this dish is all you need. Though it was not our favourite, if you are an avid mala fan, try this out.Lastly, their little fusion delight may excite your palate as well.\xa0Choose their Crispy Soft Shell Crab Mala Pasta cooked to al-dente and tossed with a generous serving of mala sauce topped with crispy soft shell crab.Our verdict on the Crispy Soft Shell Crab Mala Pasta:\xa0This dish had the best balance in textures, in our opinion. Starting with the soft-shell crab, we were given three crabs, and they were all juicy and full of flavour.It did not have a strong seafood essence which we appreciated, and the contrast in textures between its outsides and insides was well done. Though the crabs sat in our pasta for some time, they did not turn soggy but instead retained their flavour.When you try the crab along with the pasta, you would realise that the hint of mala from the pasta goes excellently with the crunchy crabs. The pasta was well cooked and had just the right amount of sauce as well. Though there were no other noticeable ingredients, the dish was tasty and quite easily became a must-try.Besides these Mala dishes, you can feast on their other dishes such as Pork Shabu-Shabu Omelette Curry, Gastro Squid Ink Pasta, or even their sweet treat like Matcha with Azuki Beans Honey Toast.For more updates on their latest offerings, visit https://www.monstercurry.com.sg/.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/private-dining/:['Would you pay to dine at a stranger’s house? Private dining is now huge in Singapore, and it’s an experience that’s not to be missed for anyone who loves food and conversation.If you’re wondering how private dining works, it’s fairly simple.Home cooks and/or chefs host people in their own homes and cook a meal for them. The capacity is usually small (most places will take anywhere from six to 12 people), and this sets the scene for a relaxed, intimate dinner.For those who want to try out private dining, a quick Google search will turn up many listicles featuring these experiences, and there are even platforms that collate private dining spots in Singapore. I used DineInn for my very first foray into the world of private dining, and I’m glad to report that it was a smashing success!With DineInn, there are many options to choose from. Some of the home cooks on the site offer takeaway food (delivery/self-collection), and some will even go to your place to cook a meal for you… but if you’re after a private dining experience, click on “Dine at Host’s Place”.From there, you can enter your preferred date or location, or search via cuisine or dish.After browsing for a bit, I decided to try a 15-course Omakase menu by a home chef, Luke, that was highly-reviewed.While omakase is commonly associated with sushi, Luke served a good variety of sushi and non-sushi dishes during his omakase dinner. Three of my favourite non-sushi items were the Sanchoku wagyu beef (+M6) with Okinawan snow salt, slow-cooked pork ribs with gula melaka, and oven grilled Argentinean red prawns with mentaiko.Out of these three dishes, special mention goes to the Argentinean red prawns, which Luke torched in front of his guests to plenty of oohs and aahs. The prawns were amazingly tender and succulent, and surprisingly enough, you could taste the natural sweetness of the flesh even through the rich, strong-bodied mentaiko.\xa0On to the sushi dishes! Luke served a total of nine courses of sushi, presented in three sittings. First up was the ball-shaped Temari sushi, which is traditionally prepared in Japan on Hinamatsuri (Girl’s Day). Out of the unagi, ebi with basil leaf, and hirame (Japanese halibut), I was most impressed by the Hirame; the sakura shrimp embedded inside the sushi ball contributed a salty, umami flavour that really added to the dish.Next was Gunkan sushi, with a twist. Gunkan sushi is typically wrapped in seaweed, but Luke chose to omit this, and instead pan-fried his rice so that it was firm and could hold its shape by itself. The Gunkan sushi came in three combinations – salmon belly with homemade hae bee hiam, sake toro (fatty salmon) with cured quail egg, and prawn with uni and ikura. I enjoyed all three, with the salmon belly with hae bee hiam standing out the most.For the last sushi course, Luke served Nigiri Sushi, again done three ways: jumbo Hokkaido scallops with yuzu, chutoro (fatty tuna) with Hokkaido sea salt, and uni with soy sauce. Here, my top pick was the nigiri topped with lush, juicy scallops. The scallops were a huge hit, but that aside, I also liked the addition of the yuzu sauce, which helped to brighten up the dish.Other dishes I tried that evening include abalone with homemade scallop sauce, snapper pan-seared in miso garlic butter, and umeshu jelly with osmanthus and yellow dragonfruit. No complaints about these dishes, but they weren’t as standout as the rest of the dishes.All in all, the food was amazing, but private dining isn’t just about the food alone – it’s also about having an intimate dinner with the home chef who’s serving you, and meeting and connecting with your fellow diners. I enjoyed being able to chat with Luke and understand the concepts and techniques behind his dishes, and it was also fun to get to know the other people at the table while bonding over our mutual love for food.On the flip side, private dining obviously isn’t as easy or straightforward as picking a normal restaurant to have a meal – you’ve got to research your options, make arrangements with your host, and find your way to their place.That said, private dining is a great experience if you’re willing to invest a bit of time and effort into making it happen – and it lends itself well to events such as anniversary dinners, birthdays, or yearly get-togethers with friends. If you’re trying to plan a meal for a special occasion, and you’re up for a different dining experience, private dining might be a good option!Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/le-yi-shi-fried-carrot-cake/:['In operation since the 1980s, this stall — located at Toa Payoh Lorong 4 Block 93 Market and Food Centre — specialises in an old-fashioned carrot cake that is getting increasingly harder to find in this day and age. Here the kueh strips are cut long and thick instead of chopped up into little pieces.Still run by the first generation, the stall is singlehandedly run by Tan Choi Mui most of the time but her elderly husband does help out during the weekends.Tan and her older sister used to help out their uncle who was a street hawker selling fried carrot cake before they decided to start up their own stall.The kueh used to be handmade at Le Yi Shi but now they have turned to using factory supplied turnip cakes in their old age.The results are not as good as before but quite reasonable as the kueh is now double fried: once to precook them and another time when an order is received and it is fried with ingredients.\nBoth white and black versions of carrot cake ($3/3.50) are sold here and both are equally captivating.The white version is fried to the point where the kueh has crispy edges and there is lots of robust garlic in the taste complementing the egg, fish sauce and chai poh (preserved radish).Salty chai poh is used as per the traditional instead of the sweet variety and it gives the favour a little more of a complex savoury punch.\nThe kueh itself is unfortunately still the weakest link here — despite being double fried, the kueh can be a little dry half the time and it would indeed be less noticeable if it was cut up into smaller pieces.The black version adds sweet black sauce which gives the dish a smoky sweetness that is rounded and isn’t overly sweet.\nOrder either version with chilli and it does a nice job in adding spiciness without over-dominating the overall flavour.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/mee-rebus/:['Literally “boiled noodles”, mee rebus is a popular Malay culinary creation. It is a simple but satisfying dish of yellow Hokkien noodles and sweet-spicy gravy garnished with boiled egg, beansprouts, Chinese celery, green chilli, and fried shallot. A squeeze of fresh calamansi adds tang and brightens up the dish.The most crucial element in mee rebus is the gravy, which is the soul of this deceptively simple dish. Traditionally, it is made from a stock base of dried shrimp, tau cheo (fermented soy bean), fresh herbs and spices, which is then thickened with mashed sweet potato.Different vendors have put their own unique spin on the traditional recipe. We taste-tested five well-known mee rebus stalls in Singapore. Who will we crown as mee rebus champion?\xa0\xa0Afandi Hawa & Family EDITOR’S PICK!14 Haig Road, #01-21 Haig Road Food CentreOpening hours: 10am-8pm, closed Wed & ThuPrice: $2.50Rating: 5/5Previously known as Fandi Mona, they now operate as Afandi Hawa after the food centre was refurbished in 2010. Despite the name change, their mee rebus is still as divine as ever!Besides the usual dried shrimp, their dark gravy is intensely robust with an extra boost of umami-rich ingredients like seafood and mutton. Little wonder then, that their gravy has such intriguing complexity and depth of flavour.Besides flavour, the gravy has great texture too. The smooth sauce coats the noodles without being too thick or watery. The noodles and beansprouts are perfectly executed too—the former is al dente while the latter retains a refreshing crunch without being too raw.Although some regulars say that the gravy isn’t as robust as before, we find that Afandi Hawa’s mee rebus is still the one to beat in this power mee rebus showdown!\xa0Inspirasi Stall207 New Upper Changi Road, #01-11 Bedok Interchange Food CentreOpening hours: Daily: 11.30am-12 midnight, closed during Hari RayaPrice: $2.00Rating: 4.5/5They are better known for their mee soto, but they make a mean mee rebus as well.Though not as meaty or robust as Afandi Hawa’s version, Inspirasi Stall’s gravy is sufficiently rich and flavourful with a pleasing savoury-sweet balance. The slightly translucent gravy clings nicely to the noodles. It’s tasty but feels light and smooth all at once.Overall, the effect is very more-ish and leaves you wanting for more. Portions are decent and reasonably priced.\xa0Dapur Asiah BEST VALUE\n320 Shunfu Road, #02-29 Shunfu Mart Food CentreOpening hours: Tue-Sun: 7.30am-2pmPrice: $2.00Rating: 4/5Like their mee siam which came up tops in our Tried & Tested: Mee siam, Dapur Asiah’s mee rebus is also a labour of love.Their gravy has that authentic mashed sweet potato flavour as well as bold seafood taste. The tasty, umami-rich seafood base blends well with its sweet and spicy flavours. Portions here are generous—a great bang for your buck.The gravy starts to thicken if you let it sit. But trust us, you wouldn’t want to waste a minute waiting to polish off this bowl of delicious mee rebus!\xa0Selera Kita58 New Upper Changi Road, #01-182 Block 58 Market & Food CentreOpening hours: 8.30am-1.30pm, closed FriPrice: from $1.50Rating: 3.5/5Where else can you find mee rebus for a mere $1.50? Yes, the amount of noodles for that price is snack-size, but they throw in a whole egg! Even after upsizing to $2.00 for a jumbo plate, it’s still ridiculously cheap.So, it’s cheap, but is it any good? For those who prefer their mee rebus gravy on the light and sweet side, you’ll like Selera Kita’s version. Flavoured simply with dried shrimp and tau cheo, their gravy has a genteel, old-school feel. It has a thinner consistency than its competitors.Despite being tasty, the gravy could do with a bit more depth. The noodles and beansprouts here tend to be on the soft side of al dente.\xa0Goody N Jolly80 Marine Parade Road, #B1-113 Parkway Parade Shopping Centre, Stall 11 Treats Food CourtOpening hours: 9.30am-9.30pm, closed alt TuePrice: $4.00Rating: 2/5They may have made a name for themselves selling mee rebus, but we think standards here have nose-dived.Our pet peeve is the gravy which is too thick, too gluey, and too salty. The gravy is so starchy and heavy that you can almost cut it with a knife. Also, it needs less salt and more sweetness to balance out the flavours.Prices may be double that of hawker centres, however portions here are obscenely huge.

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/the-auspicious-pen-cai/:['Pen cai has only recently been introduced to the Singapore Chinese New Year table, unlike many other dishes and recipes that have been handed down through generations.The origins of pen cai (poon choi) go back to when Mongol troops invaded Song China. To feed the fleeing Emperor who escaped to Guangdong, the locals gathered the best food available and made a hearty stew. Without a container large enough to put everything in, the hosts improvised by serving the steaming hot food on large wooden wash basins, hence the name ‘pen cai’ (vegetables in a basin).As for the ingredients that go into it — your imagination can dictate the items. From exotic vegetables to fresh seafood and meat, anything goes. Presentation is another matter. Skills are definitely required, as each ingredient must be layered and stacked very carefully. Poultry is usually placed on the top, implying that birds return to their nests. And just like digging for treasure, the closer to the bottom of the claypot, the more flavorsome the broth gets, as all the juices blend with each other.Chefs love to outperform each other in the decadence of their ‘pen cai’ offerings and below, we have compiled a list of our favourites. It’s definitely a dish that brings everyone together, so enjoy it with family and friends at home or at one these fine establishments.\xa0Auspicious Poon ChoyWhere: Checkers Deli (Hilton Singapore)How much & availability: $288 for eight persons.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/ladyironchef/:['For the second story in our ‘Confessions’ series (read the first, by restaurant reviewer Daven Wu), we talk to one of Singapore’s most popular food bloggers for a glimpse of his restaurant reviewing ethos.Food Blogger\nBrad Lau\nLadyironchef, as he is better known, is one of Singapore’s most followed bloggers (his six-month-old Instagram account’s following quickly surpassed his Twitter account’s 12,679 followers). He reveals that his blog gets almost a million pageviews per month. Known for his bright, shot-to-provoke-salivation photos and his restaurant round-ups, the 25-year-old university graduate has been blogging for five years, and has, expectedly, ruffled a few feathers along the way. There is however, a ‘no negative reviews’ policy on his blog – read on to find out why: \xa0How did you get into restaurant reviewing?\nI am a glutton by nature. Writing about what I eat is my legitimate reason for my incessant indulgence without feeling bad.Describe your style of reviewing\nI like to keep things simple. There are only so many words you can use to describe certain foods, so I write based on my emotions. I try not to be too factual, as I want the people who have not tasted the food before to be able to relate to the descriptions. I always make it a point to inquire everything about the restaurant – from its chef, to its dishes, to the philosophy behind the cooking and its operating hours. These information are vital for a comprehensive post-session review.How do you pick which restaurants to review?\nI review establishments at which I’ve had good dining experiences. I have a list of restaurants I like to go to, but I usually pick dining places based on my cravings. It sometimes depends on my superficiality – I mean, who can resist well-thought out food in an exquisite setting?How do you usually rate restaurants?\nI do not give a star rating for my reviews as I believe food is subjective. I always encourage my readers to try things with an open mind. ‘Food’ is definitely the most important criteria – I will eat at a place as long as it serves good food. It’s okay if it has crappy service and no ambience.Do you conduct your reviews anonymously, or via media tastings or do you contact the restaurants directly?\nI pay for most of my reviews. I do attend media tastings occasionally, but I usually turn down 80 per cent of the invitations. Having attended an invited session does not come along with obligation on my part to blog about the respective restaurants. I will only blog about those that are impressive and truly worth trying, and I blog with a conscience. In addition, I will always highlight at the end of the post if it is a media invitation. For most of my restaurant reviews, my friends and I go to a place as regular paying customers; we do not get any special privileges.To reveal or not to reveal yourself?\nUnless it is an invited media tasting, I usually do not reveal myself to the establishment.Having attended an invited session does not come along with obligation on my part to blog about the respective restaurants. I blog with a conscience. We do not get any special privileges.But you do get recognised? Do you think there is a compromise?I do get recognised sometimes. I don’t think there is a compromise as I don’t get special treatment even when I get recognised in the restaurant.\nHow many times do you visit each restaurant?\nIt really depends. There are certain places that I would visit a few times before writing a review. But mostly, I will write about a place if I have tried enough dishes to get a good impression of the restaurant during my first visit.How do you tackle the issue of the food/service being particularly bad?\nI do not write negative reviews as I do not believe in presenting something that I personally do not like.How about food hygiene issues – how do you deal with that?\nI would immediately feedback to the restaurant manager or the person-in-charge.Do you get paid for doing the reviews?\nI do not get paid for writing restaurant reviews. Ads are my main form of revenue.Your photos are very prominent on your blog – why give it so much space?\nAs cliché as it may sound, a picture is worth a thousand words. Many of my readers come to my blog because of the food photos. I take all the photos on my blog, unless stated otherwise. It has become habitual for me to snap pictures of the restaurant and the dishes – whether or not I would eventually use them for a review.Final question then: which camera do you use?\nI shoot with a Nikon D700 [DSLR], 60mm f2.8 micro lens, 24mm f2.8 lens, 50mm f1.4, and SB-600 speedlight [flash].Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/biryani/:['Who doesn’t love a good biryani? And we’re talking about dum biryani, where long-grain basmati rice is layered and cooked together with spices and meats such as chicken, mutton or fish in a large cooking pot. The biryani is left to cook on slow flame for some time and the vessel’s lid is sealed with dough to prevent the steam from escaping. This method of cooking seals in the flavours and natural juices of the meat for a heavenly biryani.The word “biryani” comes from the Persian word “beriani”, and it was the Mughlai conquerors who introduced the dish to India when they invaded the subcontinent. Like how “paratha” became “prata” in Singapore, “biryani” has morphed into “briyani” – the tweak probably happened when our first South Indian settlers started integrating with the locals here.While the more luxurious biryanis are tinged with saffron threads and even a drop of rose water, we round up five dum good ones that are friendly on your pocket.\xa0Jaggi’s Northern Indian Cuisine\nBest for weekend biryani cravings\nWalk into Jaggi’s Northern Indian cuisine at any time of the day and you’re bound to see homesick Indian expats eating here and having a taste of home.\xa0Jaggi’s has been at Race Course Road for 15 years, and the Punjabi family who owns it has been in the food business for two decades. Their dum biryani (chicken/mutton $7) is a ‘special’ and is only available on Fridays (chicken only), weekends and public holidays.A whole thigh comes with the chicken biryani while the mutton version has boneless big chunks of the meat. The Punjabi-style biryani is a tad spicier than most of their Northern neighbours. The rice, which is swathed a uniform yellow from the masala and turmeric, is also infused with a stronger dose of spices. In all, their biryani is a little on the heavy side, but no less fragrant and addictive thanks to the melange of spices.Jaggi’s Northern Indian Cuisine | Address: 34/36 Race Course Road | Tel: 6296 6141 | Opening hours: 11.30am-3pm; 5.30-10.30pm \xa0Kasturi Briyani Dam\nCheapest, also the best Malay-style biryani\nWhen it comes to dum biryani, there are a few well-known names in the Geylang Serai food centre, each with their own loyal following. Our vote goes to Kasturi, whose dum biryani (chicken $5; mutton or beef $5.50) is less oily and starchy as the rice is boiled first before cooking to remove the extra starch.Kasturi was started by husband-and-wife Abdul Mutalib and Gayah seven years ago, but they have passed it on to daughter Sahina who’s now in charge and does the cooking while her parents help serve. The rice is cooked the Indian way, redolent with spices and infused with the fragrance from the addition of pandan leaves, mint leaves apart from the usual coriander. The chicken is cooked slightly differently with lots of tomatoes and tastes more assam masak merah (“assam-cooked red”) than Indian masala style. The biryani also comes with dalcha (mutton cooked in lentil-based gravy), pineapple salad and a lovely homemade chutney made from dates, raisins and lime.Kasturi Briyani Dam | Address: #02-133 Geylang Serai Market & Food Centre, 1 Geylang Serai | Tel: 9761 3992 / 9042 0780 | Opening hours: Tue-Sun 7am-2pm\xa0Tulasi Vegetarian & Cafe\nBest vegetarian biryani\nIf you think vegetarian biryani is limited to those from a frozen pack and cauliflower, think again. Slightly more than a year old, this modish two-storey Indian vegetarian restaurant serves a dum biryani selection worthy of a gourmet menu. Hands-on cooks, the husband-and-wife team – Ramesh Krishnan and Sherena Krishnamoorthy – are themselves vegetarians. Their biryani comes in four different cooking styles ($8.90-$10.90) inspired by the regions of India: Malabar, Hyderabadi, Lucknowi and Chennai.Our favourite is the Malabar dum biryani. Choose from a variety of mock meat that includes fish, chicken, mutton, prawns, even crab. The mock meats taste like the Real McCoy, and the quality is a notch above what you get from the usual vegetarian stalls. We had the ‘fish’ malabar, which was superbly done with the tender ‘flesh’ melting almost like cod on the tongue (for those who have had the real thing). If you like it really hot and spicy, go for the Chennai, which is a ‘chicken-only’ biryani.\xa0The rice itself is excellent – spice-laden and flecked with roasted cashews. It comes accompanied with roasted masala pappadum, raita and a crunchy Nonya-style achar. Expect also Western, Chinese wok dishes, Thai and Malay specialities in their extensive menu.Tulasi Vegetarian & Cafe | Address: 46 Race Course Road | Tel: 6299 3809 | Opening hours: Tue-Sun, eve of public holidays & public holidays 11am-11pm \xa0CRITIC’S PICK Taj\nA biryani recipe that took two decades to perfect\nWhen a non-foodie friend (the sort who eats to live) polished off an entire plate on her own and declared it “shiok!”, you get an idea how addictively good Taj’s biryani is.Owner Ameen Mansoor has been serving dum biryani for over two decades (15 years at this Chinatown spot and before that, a stall which he claims was one of the first few to serve authentic dum biryani). The recipe has been perfected over the years and is a confluence of Indian, Pakistani and Persian styles, according to Ameen.Taj’s biryani is not too spicy and the rice is beautiful – light, fluffy, delightfully grainy with pieces of cashews and raisins for a Persian touch. The chicken biryani ($6.50; $7 for mutton) comes with a whole tender thigh flavourful with masala spices.Ameen still personally marinates the chicken and bone-in mutton every morning. The meats are then layered with the spice-riddled rice and cooked for another two hours over charcoal fire. Fish dum biryani ($7.50-$8, depending on the type of fish) is also available every Friday. Arrive early as Taj is an incredibly popular lunchtime spot.Taj | Address: 214 South Bridge Road (corner of Mosque Street) | Tel: 6226 6020 / 9382 8077 | Opening hours: Mon-Sat 11.30am-8pm\xa0Usman’s Place\nBest for biryani with a good, spicy kick\nThis cosy 45-seat restaurant sits cheek by jowl with a slew of Middle Eastern eateries and shisha joints. Usman’s Place specialises in Pakistani cuisine and also does some lip-smacking biryani (mutton or chicken $9.90; seafood $10.90).Those who don’t like to get their hands dirty will appreciate the boneless chunks of tender chicken or mutton buried in the rice that’s been cooked with the requisite spices, tomatoes and tamarind. A sprinkling of coriander leaves and fried shallots gives the finishing touch.Usman’s biryani is a fiery mix and the masala flavours are pretty intense though you can request for the spices to be toned down. Quell the heat with some raita (cucumbers and onions in yogurt), which comes with the dish.\xa0While you’re at your biryani, order authentic Pakistani fare such as Lahori fried fish (fish coated with a spice paste, pan-fried), fried lamb chops or mutton karahi (a wok-like deep cooking pot used in Pakistan) cooked in tomatoes and ginger sauce – dishes you won’t find easily at other South Asian restaurants.Usman’s Place | Address: 67/68 Bussorah Street | Tel: 6297 0097 | Opening hours: Daily 11.30am to 11pmAuthor© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/lim-kee-banana-fritters/:['After being in operation for almost 70 years, 54-year-old owner Corlinn Lim announced to us that Lim Kee (Orchard) Banana Fritters will be closing at the end of 2018 as he will be retiring. There will be no one taking over the stall as well so eat his fritters while you are able to.Goreng pisang (banana fritters) fans will remember Lim Kee (Orchard) Banana Fritters which used to be located on Somerset Road by the PUB building. The heritage hawker stall — which started in 1950 in a coffeeshop at Koek Road — moved to Maxwell Food Centre around 2008.There was a period of time when the stall expanded to several outlets but now it’s reverted back to being a single shop.\xa0The quality of its fritters has been excellent throughout its history and popular such that their goreng pisangs are priced slightly higher —$1.50 versus $1 or $1.20 — but every piece is like tucking into perfection.\xa0The addictive batter — a mixture of rice flour, salt, water and “something else” (tapioca starch we suspect) — has a lighter-than-air crispness and lime is added into the oil to eliminate any smell of old oil.Only ripened pisang raja (a type of banana) is used (you can tell when it has a slightly black centre). It has a high water content so that the snack is still juicy after frying, it has a nice balance of sweetness and acidity, and a full custard-like flavour. There’s always a lovely softness to the texture.\xa0Sometimes they offer goreng pisang using extra large bananas — the king rajah — which can be had at $1.80.They also sell other varieties of goreng pisang like yam ($0.80), mung beans ($0.80) and sweet potato ($0.80) but they largely pale in comparison to their flagship goreng pisang.The flavour of the batter over-dominates the delicate sweet flavour of the yam and sweet potato varieties making them taste plain. As for the mung beans, it comes smoothly mashed and the added sugar adds more sweetness to the snack, though it does come occasionally dry.\xa0Opt for the tapioca cake ($0.80) as the kueh has a nice soft texture which contrasts well with the crunchy batter and enough sugar is added into the mix.But by far, the fritter which comes close to the quality of the goreng pisang is the cempedak (a cousin to the jackfruit; $1.20). A whole, ripe cempedak fruit (seed included) is battered, fried and it’s wonderfully sweet and juicy. If you’re never tried cempedak before, the flavour is a cross between a banana and a pineapple.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/beancurd/:['A new food fad is causing a friendly war among soya beancurd sellers at the popular Old Airport Road hawker centre, a food centre that has long been acknowledged as one of the best in the country. On any given day, you’ll find queues of people – we saw an average of 15 people during our visits – lining up for a taste of what has been called soya creme brulee!Unlike the traditional type of soya beancurd, this version is smoother, milkier and closer in texture to traditional steamed egg custard found in Hong Kong. It is also eaten cold from the container in which it is set, and not scooped out like the traditional version. Compared to the traditional beancurd, the ‘new’ curd has a subtle soya bean flavour with a tinge of milk and malt taste – something that has been likened to the taste of non-dairy creamer.Many different flavours, such as blueberry, almond, strawberry and even durian, has been infused into this dessert. But as not all the stalls at the food centre sold the same flavours, we tried the original version for this taste test.The need to innovate has also driven one traditional soya beancurd stall to offer new creations such as soya beancurd with interesting toppings like red bean and the use of organic soybeans. We have included this stall in our test.\xa0Here’s the verdict:\xa0Lao Ban Soya Beancurd EDITOR’S PICK!Unit: 01-127 and 01-107 (facebook.com/Laobansoya)Price: $1.50 (original)Rating: 4.5/5This is the original stall that started selling the new version of soya beancurd over a year ago. And while other stalls, such as 51 Soya Bean, have developed recipes very close to Lao Ban’s offering, this is still the one to beat.The dessert here is the softest and silkiest of the lot, and has subtle soya bean taste. It is also tinged with just the right amount of sweetness. We also liked that it didn’t turn watery after some time.The only thing that marred our experience was the very thin layer of skin that formed on top of the dessert. This added a slight roughness to certain parts of the curd.Variety wise, besides the original, Lao Ban also sells almond-flavoured soya beancurd, soya milk and herbal jelly.\xa0QQ Soya Bean Unit: 01-165 (facebook.com/qqsoyabean)Price: $1.80 (original)Rating: 4/5While not as popular as 51 Soya Bean and Lao Ban, this newest entry into the curd war is a surprisingly good find. Texture-wise, the dessert was very smooth and silky, and a little firmer than the one offered by Lao Ban and 51 Soya Bean – this version is the most similar in texture to silken tofu. Made well, only a little liquid leeched out of the dessert as we ate it.Taste-wise, purists who enjoy soya bean milk or the traditional soya beancurd will love QQ Soya Bean’s version – it is the most authentic-tasting of the four we tried. At the same time, the soya bean taste was, thankfully, not overpowering. It was also the least sweet-tasting of the lot.Besides the original, there is also the almond version and soya bean milk on offer.\xa051 Soya BeanUnit: 01-72 and 01-125Price: $1.50 (original)Rating: 3.5/5This stall is opened by Lao Ban’s neighbour, who sells crispy and delicious curry puffs (Wang Wang Crispy Curry Puff), next door. The taste of 51 Soya Bean’s offering was the closest to Lao Ban’s version, but texture-wise, it was firmer and slightly grainier.While it didn’t have the thin film/skin on the surface, quite a large amount of liquid seeped out such that by the time we had our last scoop, it was quite messy and watery. Overall, while the differences between 51 Soya Bean and pack leader Lao Ban were minimal, we feel that QQ Soya Bean was better than this stall on the whole.Interestingly, 51 Soya Bean also has durian-flavoured beancurd. There’s also the almond and strawberry versions and soya bean milk.\xa0Bean Flower WaterUnit: #01-102Price: $1.50 (original)Rating: 2.5/5After the soya beancurd craze started, the owner of this soya bean milk stall converted his business to focus on selling soya creme brulee.Unfortunately, while he is the most creative of the lot with flavours like strawberry and blueberry, his version was the most disappointing. Grainy and overly firm, this curd also had the irritating skin on its surface – a little thicker than the film on Lao Ban’s. The saving grace? It was less sweet than Lao Ban and 51 Soya Bean’s versions, which admittedly, suit those with a sweet tooth more.Bean Flower Water’s blueberry version was also quite unique and tasty, although it had the same textural issues as the original flavoured one.\xa0Gogo BeanzUnit: 01-56Price: $1.30Rating: 2.5/5Gogo Beanz sells traditional soya beancurd with and without toppings such as aloe vera, red beans and sea coconut. We tried the plain ol’ original version, which was scooped out, piping hot, from a tub. Although made of organic soya beans, the taste of the curd was not as strong as we would have liked it to be and the accompanying sugar syrup was very diluted. It would have been better if the syrup was thicker, which would have made the dessert sweeter. It also seems to lack pandan fragrance.Texture-wise, the curd was firm and smooth. Definitely not as milky or creamy as the new soya beancurd, but soft and velvety enough to slide down the throat.Also check out Dr Leslie Tay’s recommendations on other hawker stalls at Old Airport Road Food Centre!Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/monkey-47/:['Gin may be one of the most dynamic spirits ever made, but it has a bad reputation thanks to its origins.First introduced as a drink (gin and tonic) by the army of the British East India Company to ward off malaria, the spirit has spent the better part of the past century shaking off its medicinal association\xa0–\xa0never mind that it is the quinine found in tonic water that is anti-malaria.One gin producer whose links to a war veteran will make you want to reach for your glass more than any other. Monkey 47 uses a much fabled 1945 recipe first created by a British Royal Air Force personnel, who was posted to Germany after World War II. Devastated by the ruins he saw, Wing Commander “Monty” Collins tried to rebuild the Berlin Zoo and sponsored a monkey named Max.There is no monkeying about when it comes to his Black Forest-based gin brand though. The company approaches its unique premium formulation and sourcing standards for its 47 handpicked ingredients with an almost military precision.Managing director and proprietor Alexander Stein’s key focus was to create a gin that “transforms nature’s aromas into a glass” and interestingly, it was first formulated with an approach to crafting a perfume rather than a gin (read more below).A fairly new brand sold since 2010, this German gin is more niche than mainstream. The company produces just 150,000 bottles yearly and has gone on to win multiple awards, with some heralding it as “the king of gins”.HungryGoWhere sat down with Stein for a brief primer on Monkey 47 ahead of this weekend’s Whisky Live event, where it will be one of 40 spirits showcased.Why gin and what was your approach to Monkey 47?\nMy idea was to do a handcrafted gin for my personal taste as there wasn’t much out there I liked. We didn’t want to produce alcohol but aromas, so I think the whole approach makes it a little different.The aromas certainly set this gin apart…\nGin is much more than juniper and this was an opportunity for me to develop something that was more than a gin; an eau de vie (water of life)\xa0that happens to be a gin and that you could drink neat. At the point when we first sampled it, it was a very eccentric and polarising recipe as it was about the flavours and not the alcohol. For me, it was more about transforming nature’s aromas into a glass.\nYou use 47 ingredients\xa0–\xa0a lot of them fresh, not dried or frozen –\xa0how do you ensure each bottle tastes the same?\nThey don’t. Not every bottle of Monkey 47 will smell and taste the same. The recipe does not change, but we do adjust a little. For instance, in May, the citrus fruits are different than in February, this has to do with nature and I cannot influence nature.Unlike others, Monkey 47 is a “cloudy” gin. Why?\nWe use normal soft spring water from the Black Forest. We choose not to cold-treat it as we would then need to filter the minerals, and with that take out the essential oils, which would affect its taste. This is why why Monkey 47 is a little bit cloudy.What is the best compliment you’ve received?\nI’ve heard a lot of times that they (the drinkers) can never have another gin and tonic (after having ours). I think it has a lot to do with the fact that we produce our gin in a very expensive way using the best ingredients, for instance, real lemon, pomelo and citrus peels.Finally, how would one best drink it?\nAs a gin and tonic, have it neat, or maybe paired with champagne. Maybe I am a bad businessman, but with some drinks, it doesn’t make sense to use Monkey 47. If there are already dominating flavors, I don’t see the point. It’s better for the gin to stand out, let it live.\xa0Five things you didn’t know about Monkey 47\xa01. A dream about the movie ’12 Monkeys’ starring Brad Pitt helped to inspire the quirky name.2. Aside from the standard Monkey 47, the company also produces 4,000 bottles of a Distiller’s Cut. Each year, it includes a rare seasonal ingredient such as hibiscus, purple clover, spruce tips.3. Aroma is king for this gin, which was formulated to be a “journey through a herbal garden with a lot of fruitiness”.4. Each bottle is individually numbered and bottled in brown glass bottles that protect against UV rays which would otherwise alter the composition.5. There is a ring that comes with each bottle. The ring functions to keep the natural cork in place but also contains a special inscription, one you will have to find out for yourself what it is.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/mr-biryanis-firetop-claypot-dhum-biryani/:['Now you can see how a traditional Hyderabad Dum Biryani is assembled and cooked right before your eyes.Launched by Mr. Biryani, the Firetop Claypot Dhum Biryani set ($88++; feeds four to five) introduces a bit of theatre into the biryani dining experience by doing the final preparations and steaming of the dum biryani right by your table.In addition to the theatre, it actually makes for a better tasting biryani but more on that later.\nIt might sound a little simple but trust us, the actual experience is actually quite fun to behold.\xa0It starts with a myriad of ingredients, a claypot and a portable gas cooker being brought to your table.Then parboiled basmati rice is scooped into a claypot filled with marinated chicken (or vegetables if you opt for the vegetable biryani).\nOn top of the rice, a range of spices and flavourings — rose water, ghee (clarified butter), garam masala powder (Indian spice blend), fried onions and mint leaves — are added on top.\nThe claypot is then covered with foil then cooked for 20 minutes over a low flame by your table.\nIn the meantime, the staff will serve your choice of two starters and two side dishes which are included in the set and you can tuck into them while the biryani goes through the final steaming process.The best part about it cooking right by your table is that you’ll be able to see the steam and smell the aroma emanate from the claypot and when it’s ready, you’ll get that big waft of steam and aroma when the lid is opened.In addition, there is an actual taste benefit to having biryani made in a claypot.Order their standard Hyderabad Chicken Dhum Biryani option ($10.90) and — presuming you’re having lunch at 12 noon — the biryani you’re eating is at least two hours old as the morning batch of chicken biryani is ready at 10am.\xa0The claypot biryani — on the other hand — is made on the spot so when you tuck into it, it is freshly cooked.\nThe chicken meat comes very nicely moist, something which can’t be said for a lot of chicken biryanis which are not homemade.\xa0The caveat is that you have to eat it right away as the meat loses its moisture fairly quickly, especially in an air-conditioned environment at Mr Biryani’s outlet at AXA Towers.On the flip side though, you get additional toppings of a cherry tomato, boiled egg and cashews when you order the standard Hyderabad Chicken Dhum Biryani.None of those toppings are found in the Firetop Claypot Dhum Biryani set.As for the claypot biryani itself, the rice comes nicely fluffy, buttery and with a big aroma.\xa0The masala covering the chicken is especially good — a slight yogurt tanginess, enough savouriness, oil richness and a lot of spice notes.There’s much more flavour as compared to previous times we’ve had their Hyderabad Chicken Biryani in the past.We’re not sure if its because Chef Govinda Rajan, 51, has improved on the recipe or that it is because the biryani is made in a smaller claypot so there’s more attention to detail rather than on a bigger scale in a big metal vat.Whatever the case, it’s makes for a better tasting biryani and you don’t even need to add the raita and the mirchi ka salan (green chilli and nut curry) than is provided on the side.But if you do, it adds a sour freshness or a nice creaminess to the dish respectively.\xa0As mentioned, the Firetop Claypot Dhum Biryani set feeds four to five people and comes with two starters and two side dishes — picked out of a choice of eight starters and eight side dishes — and there are couple of noteworthy dishes to aim for.\nThe Bhindi Palli Fry is a mix of okra, dried chillies, cashew nuts, peanuts, curry leaves and onions fried with masala for that addictive masala flavouring in a great mix of different textures.\nIt’s a moreish vegetable dish and for those who are not keen on slime, there’s virtually no slime in the okra here.\xa0The Lamb Shank Masala is the other popular favourite amongst patrons. It’s actually not that robustly flavoured.The masala is on the milder side and creamier but still flavourful and oil-rich, but you do get a little more of that lamb flavour in the taste.Mr Biryani’s Firetop Claypot Dhum Biryani is available exclusively at the AXA Tower outlet every Thursday to Saturday for dinners. Diners are encouraged to pre-order at least a day prior as each portion is freshly prepared in separate and limited quantities.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

Airy, soft and chewy, the bread was a delight to chew on.We also liked the generous amount of filling, particularly the boiled potato chunks. The curry paste was smooth and tasted rather sweet.

This is how Bread Society distinguishes its Tokyo Curry Bun from the crowd.Although it isn’t the conventional fried curry donut, we liked how it was close to the real thing minus the grease. The exterior got its crispness from a sprinkling of breadcrumbs baked onto the crust. The bread was pleasantly light and airy.Of all the curry buns in this round-up, Bread Society’s curry paste had the most kick. Its flavour is more localised.

The best part was the tasty curry filling. It had a good balance of savoury, sweet and spicy flavors. The bread was also decent. It was fluffy and not oily.Our only dislikes were the crust and filling-to-bread ratio. The exterior wasn’t crispy enough, and we wished there was more of that yummy mashed curried potato stuffing.Overall, Sun Moulin’s curry bun wasn’t mind-blowing, but it’ll do for a quick snack.\xa0St. Leaven391 Orchard Road, B2 Takashimaya Dept StoreOpening hours: Daily: 10am-9.30pmPrice: $1.50Rating: 3/5This is a new, improved version. There are actually bits of chicken in the curried potato filling. The chunkier filling was nice to munch on. However, we weren’t too impressed with mild flavours of the curry paste.The bread was sufficiently crisp on the outside. The interior, while fluffy, was on the dry side.As St. Leaven operates under the Four Leaves Group, this curry bun is also available at Four Leaves bakery outlets.\xa0Provence Café & Bakery2 Orchard Turn, #B4-07/08 ION OrchardOpening hours: Daily: 10am-10pmPrice: $1.60Rating: 2.5/5The finely mashed curried potato filling was sufficiently tasty.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/omotesando-koffee/:['Omotesando Koffee, the popular coffee brand from Japan, has come to Singapore.Omotesando Koffee first started out as a year-long pop-up store in the Omotesando neighbourhood of Tokyo. The quaint takeaway coffee stall soon gained a massive following for its artisanal brews. Despite the massive support it received, the cafe closed down, since the building that housed it got torn down.Earlier in 2017, though, the much-lauded coffee stall reopened in Shibuya. It has since expanded to other parts of Japan, Hong Kong and now, Singapore. Of course, seeing how Singaporeans are crazy about the latest coffee trends, it was only a matter of time.Omotesando Koffee’s first and only Singapore outlet is located\xa0at co-working space The Work Project, which is housed in OUE Downtown Gallery. Little wonder why the place was flooded with office workers when we visited them recently.\xa0The menu is split simply into hot and iced drinks. On the recommendation of their barisa/store manager, we gave the Iced Mochaccino ($7.50) and Regular Cafe Latte ($4.80) a try.\xa0The cafe latte was recommended for a more balanced taste. Made with just one shot of espresso derived from a blend of six dark roast beans, the latte had a nutty flavour with a subtle citrusy undertone. The flavour was well-balanced,\xa0neither too sweet nor too sour, and the latte also boasted a smooth and milky texture. Another thing we greatly appreciate is its temperature – it’s warm enough to drink on the spot without the fear of acquiring a burnt tongue. So, did we like it? You bet!\n\nNext, we tried their Iced Mochaccino (iced cappuccino with chocolate syrup). The first thing you’ll notice about this drink is its huge foam bubbles topped with chocolate powder. As the chocolate powder and chocolate sauce lining the cup is stirred in, the drink gradually becomes sweeter. The mochaccino is accompanied by the same smooth and milky texture, and you’ll be pleased to know that you won’t find any chunks of ice invading your mouth anytime soon. The beverage is prepared with just enough ice to be refreshingly cold, but not icy.\xa0Service-wise, Omotesando Koffee does try to personalise the experience, with baristas writing down your name on the receipt of every order. They’re also more than willing to help you tailor your drinks to your preferences. Barista-manager Shermaine mentioned that the franchise espouses a\xa0philosophy of interacting with customers on top of serving excellent coffee, and indeed, the baristas were warm and chatty to customers during our visit.Omotesando Koffee is your perfect go-to kiosk if you’re working around the area and looking for some takeaway coffee. We say Omotesando’s caffeinated treasures are definitely some of the better ones we’ve tried, but we’re not sure they’re worth queuing up 45 minutes for. We recommend you going during off-peak hours, or better, when the hype has died down a little.Address: Level 4,\xa06a Shenton Way Singapore 068809\nOpening hours: Mon-Fri, 8am-6pmAuthor© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/jian-bo-shui-kueh/:['Originating in 1958, this hawker business was started by a “Mr Wang” who was a street side hawker next to the old Seng Poh Road Market and his incredibly well-made chwee kueh was coveted by many back in the day.Mr Wang migrated from a Teochew province in China and in the 1990s, the business was sold off to Ang Kien Huat and Toh Lai Hueh.The business is now in the hands of third-generation owner Eric Ang (42) and has been converted into a franchise model with over 17 outlets across Singapore.Only the original stall at Tiong Bahru Market has the name “Jian Bo Shui Kueh”, while franchise outlets bear the names “Zheng Zhong Tiong Bahru Shui Kueh” or “Tiong Bahru Jian Bo Shui Kueh”.In line with their expansion, they have also increased their product line to include a whopping 15 more snacks such as chee cheong fun (rice noodle roll) and nasi lemak to you tiao (deep-fried dough fritter) and hae bee hiam (spicy dried shrimps).Their signature chwee kueh (water cake; five pieces for $2.50) still draws a healthy business at Tiong Bahru but gone are the hour-long queues as the chwee kueh is unfortunately a pale shadow of its former self.That said, it still is a couple of notches above the average chwee kueh and is worth at least a try.The chai po (preserved turnips) is made with a smattering of sesame seeds and dried prawns added in and is nicely stewed with a soft texture.It has a nice smoky sweet taste but the savoury body is somewhat reduced as compared to before, so it tastes a little hollow.We suspect they only use the sweet variety of chai po instead of mixing it with the salty variety. On the small upside, they do give you a lot of it.They have also omitted the incredibly essential ingredient in chwee kueh — pork lard in the chai poh mixture.Instead, they use vegetable oil so it doesn’t have that full bodied feeling and pork aroma.Pork oil ironically makes a dish like chwee kueh not so oily because you don’t need a lot of it to have that full bodied oil taste.To compensate, they throw in more oil into every serving, but it just makes the dish overly oily.As a side note, the chilli on the side is gritty with a hint of dried shrimp flavour but is unfortunately not as spicy as before.The kueh itself is one of the small upsides, the texture is fairly decent if not consistently slippery soft.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/bak-kwa/:['Welcome the Lunar New Year with some finger licking, delicious bak kwa.These savoury and sweet thin sheets of dried meat are all the rage at this time of year. Indeed, even though many shops sells bak kwa all year round, many Singaporeans seem willing to pay that little bit more and queue for hours for their bak kwa hit during Chinese New Year.Ultimately it is money and time well spent as bak kwa has become a favorite gift offered to visiting family members and friends.We conducted a blind taste test on some brands of sliced barbequed pork to find the best. Here’s our verdict!\xa0Kim Hock Guan\xa0This is Singapore’s oldest Bak Kwa store chain. Established in 1905, Kim Hock Guan is now under 4th generation management, currently run by the Lim Brothers. Kim Hock Guan prides itself in only serving sliced bak kwa (they say minced bak kwa contains too much fat and other mixed meats).The brothers believe in serving only the best quality sliced meat with the best texture. The bak kwa is made in-house and undergoes stringent quality checks. The result is a crowd pleasing product that leaves you salivating for more. 105 years in the business is surely testimony to that claim.Address: 150 South Bridge Road #01-02 Fook Hai Building S058727Tel: 6535 2536Operation Hours:\xa0 Mon to Sat: 10am – 8pm, Sun & PH: 11am – 7pm\xa0Kim Hwa Guan\xa0Established in the 1960s, this good old traditional Bak Kwa store has been preparing one of Singapore’s best tasting Bak Kwa. Founder Mr Ng started the business committed to giving his customers only the highest quality and freshest product. Kim Hwa Guan’s thin minced bak kwa is the hot seller at the store. It is one of the thinnest you can find in Singapore and is never burned or blackened. Its soft texture also makes it easy to bite into and chew, and is especially popular with the elderly. Another hot seller is the store’s spicy bak kwa –\xa0 the perfect way to spice up your new year.Address: Blk 32, New Market Road, #01-1022, People’s Park, S’pore 050032Contact Person: Ah HengContact: 90062026Operation Hours: 9:30am – 9:30pm\xa0Lim Chee Guan\xa0Address: 203 New Bridge RoadOpening hours: 9am – 10pmPrice: $44 per kg\xa0Rating: 4.5/5Unless you’ve been living under a rock, you’d know that Lim Chee Guan takes top spot for the longest bak kwa queue every year. The shop really doesn’t need the extra publicity, but truly, its bak kwa is the unanimous favourite among our panel of tasters. The meat was very well-marinated, with a great balance of sweet and savoury flavors. The robust, umami flavours burst in our mouths as we chewed on the tender and succulent meat. It also had a lovely, subtle smokiness. However, this was also the fattiest bak kwa in our round-up, which could prove a bit too rich for some. Also, we detected that the oil was slightly rancid in some pieces.\xa0Bee Cheng Hiang\xa0Address: 189 New Bridge RoadOpening hours: 7am-10.30pmPrice: $45 per kgRating: 4/5One thing we didn’t like about Bee Cheng Hiang’s sliced BBQ pork was its inconsistent quality. Some pieces were juicy and tender, while some were tough and fibrous. The good ones were a joy to devour. The meat was well-marinated, succulent, not too fatty, and had good bite. It was a bit on the salty side, but overall, the sweet and savoury flavors were robust and nicely balanced. If not for its uneven consistency, we’d have rated this 4.5.\xa0Wu Chin Leong\xa0Tel: 63245825Opening hours: 10am-6pmPrice: $38 per kgRating: 3.5/5At first glance, the bak kwa here looked lean and dry, but it turned out to be quite moist and tender. Although the meat lacked fat, it was pleasantly soft and chewy to the bite. Taste-wise, it wasn’t too salty and was sweet without being cloying. However, it lacked a smoky flavour. There was also a hint of chemical after-taste. Overall, we thought it was pretty good, but we wished the flavours were more distinctive.\xa0Kim Joo Guan\xa0Opening hours: 10am-8pmPrice: $43 per kgRating: 3.5/5For many years, Kim Joo Guan was a wholesaler supplying bak kwa to famous retail brands, but it recently entered the retail market. We found that its seasoning tasted similar to Bee Cheng Hiang, with a good blend of sweet-salty flavours. The meat was very thickly sliced, in fact, the thickest among those reviewed here. Although the meat was fatty, it was dry and tough to chew in some parts. The bak kwa also had a very strong char-grilled smoky flavour, which some of us liked, but others thought was overpowering. On a side note, we were rather impressed with its classy packaging.\xa0Fragrance\xa0Opening hours: 9am-10pmPrice: $45 per kgRating: 1/5This was a major disappointment. Fragrance’s bak kwa was overly sweet and had no savoury flavours. Also, the meat was very soft, but not in a good way. The worse part was this strong porky smell detected by all the tasters. Needless to say, it was extremely unpleasant. We tried hard to find some redeeming features, but Fragrance’s bak kwa failed in every aspect.\xa0Note: Prices listed for all the brands above will most likely increase closer to Chinese New Year. Opening hours will also be extended. Please check with individual outlets for latest prices and opening hours.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

Sumadi and his workers has to wake up at 3am to prepare the broth for when they open at 7-9am, depending on when the stock is ready.The mee soto ($3.50) here has an amazingly robust stock, spice-laden and not overly oily, the result of whole chickens (including its insides) brewed for a minimum of three hours, even the normally bland shredded chicken (used as a topping) is properly seasoned here.If anything, it can be a little too salty at times.They automatically splash in some fiery dark soy sauce chili dip but request it to be on the side.It tastes great when mixed in, but a little goes a long way.There is the option to add a burgadil (fried potato cake) for an additional $1 which we would recommend as it comes with smooth potato and has a lot of stock and oil richness.\nSoak it in the broth and it adds just the right amount of savouriness into each mouthful.\nThey also sell mee rebus ($3.50) which has a smooth gravy — and it comes reddish brown as some tomato is added in.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/keng-heng-whampoa-teow-chew-lor-mee/:['From Whampoa Drive Food Centre in 1983 to Golden Mile Food Centre in 1996, this stall does a version of lor mee ($3/4/5) which you’ll either fall in love with or dislike as it’s not the Hokkien style which everyone is accustomed to.The owners claim that their lor mee is a traditional Teochew version where braised eggs are omitted and where there is more emphasis on braised pork and less sweetness in the gravy.While other lor mee stalls give you fried chilli paste on the side, this stall uses a freshly blended sambal belachan instead.They will also automatically add in liberal heaps of sambal belachan, raw garlic and vinegar on top of your bowl, so when you mix everything well, you’ll get a complex taste of all those flavours as well as the light stock flavour coming from the fairly starchy and sticky gravy.If you’re used to having more of the herbal and stock flavours in your “lor”, you might not enjoy this rendition.The gravy goes well with the array of crispy items which they give you like fried wantons, crispy fish skin and impressively large battered fish pieces. The belly pork comes in bits, but it has a soft texture and is nicely flavoured.A fair warning to those not used to spicy foods: the chilli is incredibly spicy as they add in sliced chilli padi.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/waa-cow/:['We’ve always had this idea that school food, as a rule of thumb, is pretty mediocre, but Waa Cow is here to prove us wrong.Located within uTown at National University of Singapore (NUS), this restaurant which specialises in Asian and modern rice bowls has drummed up quite a lot of interest from both students and the wider community at large.Don’t expect to step into a hipster cafe, though – the vibe here is casual and unpretentious, with Waa Cow’s interior decked out in a pretty spartan manner. You order and pay at the counter, and collect your restaurant pager. When this starts beeping, it’s time to head over to the pick-up counter and get your food.On the wall is an illustrated poster, talking about Waa Cow’s commitment to serving good food. Amongst other things, they only use premium akitakomachi rice which they import from Japan, their Wagyu beef hails from an award-winning championship farm in Australia, and said beef is cooked sous-vide (in a temperature controlled water bath inside a vacuum bag) for 24 hours. Even the Wagyu beef sauce takes 12 hours to brew, apparently. Pretty impressive – but we’ll reserve our judgement for when we taste the food.The menu is split up into their Signature Torched Wagyu Beef Donburis (Wagyu Beef, $16.90; Mentaiko Wagyu Beef, $18.90; Truffle Wagyu Beef, $19.90) as well as the non-beef Donburis (Aburi Bara Chirashi, $16.90; Unagi Don, $17.90; Creamy Goma Salmon, $17.90, Aburi Spicy Mentaiko Salmon, $18.70; and the new Mentaiko Salmon, $18.90). You can add an onsen egg, upsize your Wagyu beef, add foie gras, or swap out your rice for mesclun salad. Alternatively, upgrade to a set meal consisting of chawanmushi and a drink ($3), or salmon sashimi and a drink ($5).The first dish we tried, the Wagyu Beef Donburi ($16.90), was pretty darn good. We were impressed with the blow-torched rice which came with an obvious but not overwhelmingly smoky flavour, as well as, of course, the tender, melt-in-your-mouth Wagyu slices. This dish doesn’t incorporate any trendy or unexpected ingredients, but who needs novelty when your flavours are so on point?We also had the Mentaiko Salmon Donburi ($18.90), which is a new addition to the menu. Again, this is a fairly straightforward dish, but the beauty of this rice bowl lies in the cooking. We were particularly impressed with the tender, succulent texture of the salmon; we were glad to see that Waa Cow didn’t make the rookie mistake of overcooking their salmon (which many Japanese restaurants – even reputable ones! – seem to do).All in all, we thoroughly enjoyed the food at Waa Cow, although the portions were a little too small for our liking (you’ll have to order side dishes, or upsize your meal unless you’re a small eater)! Good news for those who don’t have the time to travel all the way to NUS: Waa Cow has also recently opened a second outlet at Raffles Xchange, where it serves rice bowls and a range of Wagyu beef sushi as well.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/huggs-epigram-coffee-bookshop/:['What we enjoyed the most:The chill vibes of the cafe and the book selectionThe Salmon Wellington- unique pastry, a must-haveLatte Gula – for those who do not fancy coffee too muchWhat can be improved:The Tandoori Chicken Wrap – we wish it was spicier but it was still deliciousAs local businesses have been in the spotlight recently, one of the cafes you may have missed out on could be the Huggs-Epigram Bookshop cafe.From Huggs local delights such as coffee, wraps, and cakes, to their books by various local authors, this place screams local talent.To kick off the new year, we tried their new waffle and crowd-favourite beverages.The cafe is located at an iconic spot at The URA Center (to make it easier for you foodies, it is right opposite Maxwell Food Centre).We made our way down, hoping to enjoy a quick pick-me-up before getting back to a hectic day.We were greeted by an 11-meter bookshelf, filled with more than 400 colourful books and titles. With such a captivating centrepiece, it is hard to miss the little Huggs coffee corner on the right end of the cafe.Before browsing the books, we decided to try four of their crowd favourite drinks- Latte Gula, Cafe Latte, Ice Sumatra Kopi ($3.20), and Hoji-cino.We decided to partner our drinks with a Tandoori Chicken wrap ($6), an Ice Cream waffle, and Salmon Wellington ($4.20).The first beverage was the Latte Gula ($5) which was served in a paper cup. The aromatic smell of the latte was the first thing that caught our attention.The drink had a milky note to it and was slightly sweeter than we expected. Interestingly, between the two of us who tried it, it quickly became the favourite for one of us while the other preferred the next drink.This might be because the drink had a pretty light coffee flavour that is surely an acquired taste.For those who prefer strong coffee notes, the next drink that we tried – Cafe Latte ($4.60)\xa0– would be a better choice.This beverage had a thicker, nuttier, and heavier coffee taste.For the size and taste of the drinks, we felt that it was a good value for money.We paired the Latte Gula with the Salmon Wellington.The Salmon Wellington is not a common item on cafe menus so we were excited to try it, and we were glad we did.The pastry was not too flaky so it wasn’t too much of a mess to handle. The cafe staff had warmed it up for us on the spot so, when we dug into the pastry, the salmon was warm and scrumptious.The sweet and tender notes of salmon came through pretty strong for us, which we enjoyed.Next on the menu was the Tandoori Chicken wrap.This wrap was easy on the eyes as well as it came in this light green wrap that was Instagrammable when placed in front of the shelves and next to the coffee.When sliced open, the bold orange colours of the chicken, cheese, and tandoori masala popped beautifully. The flavour itself was interesting, not too spicy (though we would have preferred that) but the meat itself was tender.It was on the sweeter side we would say but if you want something substantial, this will do the trick.While contemplating what we should try next, we were told that they had a new waffle item on their menu. The recipe was specially curated by Huggs’ founder, so we knew we had to give it a try.The preparation of the waffle was precise and quick.They even checked with us if we would prefer a fluffier or crispier waffle. We went with the fluffier option.Once the waffle was prepared, the staff scooped up two servings of vanilla ice cream and placed them on the waffle. She went ahead to drizzle chocolate all over the dessert and finished it off with chopped nuts.Before trying it, we ordered their two highly raved drinks from the Sumatra coffee series. We chose the Ice Sumatra Kopi and Hoji-cino.Another fun fact about the Huggs coffee place here is that they serve Sumatra coffee and tea bean options- meaning these beans are derived from Sumatra and they also have Specialty coffee and tea series whereby the beans used are blends of either Columbian and Brazilian beans or just Columbian ones.The Iced Sumatra Kopi had a sharper note and when paired with the chocolatey waffle, was surely a treat.The Hoji-cino was topped off with Matcha powder and the graininess of the green tea went perfectly well with the milky notes of the beverage and ice cream treat.Though we were feasting at the cafe, you could choose to go with a beverage and pastry while choosing one of the many literary works to drown yourself in.Our recommendation would be the Salmon Wellington and the Iced Sumatra Kopi.If you intend to share or treat yourself, the waffle would be an ideal choice.Other than purchasing the Huggs dishes and drinks, you can also choose to buy back any of the local authors’ works.The books are priced from $9 to $245 with the average price being $26.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

While you can most certainly order what you’re familiar with, it’s much more fun to pick a spirit and a flavour profile and let the mixologists, led by Din Hassan, do the rest. The nameless Ron Zacapa and passion fruit ($25) and Wild Turkey and kiwi fruit cocktails ($19) for example are refreshing, perfectly balanced and come with enough mint leaves and fruit slices to make a decent dessert salad.

From a bar made with wood from sherry barrels, they serve more than 30 gins, and cocktails built around ingredients such as kaya, Japanese ginger and Belgian beer ($18-25).

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/yong-huat/:['In operation since 1949, the stall hits all the checks when it comes to a good plate of Hokkien mee and is arguably one of the top five Hokkien mee stalls in Singapore.Ironically, the stall doesn’t actually specialise in fried Hokkien mee. When they started more than half a century ago, they only sold tah mee (Hokkien for ‘dry noodles’).They have diversified to sell a variety of hawker favourites like fried kway teow, fried mee suah, prawn mee,\xa0tah mee\xa0and of course, fried Hokkien mee in the decades since.The stall is now run by second generation owner Pang Weng Hong, 67, and Pang took over from his father when he was 16.\xa0Their Fried Hokkien Prawn Mee ($5/6/8/10) uses a mix of Hokkien yellow noodles and chor (thick) bee hoon, and the noodles are fried to a nice firmness.There is a small amount of the prawn/pork stock gravy at the bottom of each plate as the Hokkien mee is more stir-fried, rather than cooked in the stock, so it’s a little wet. It does well in adding just enough moisture such that it doesn’t taste dry. It also tastes generously power-packed when you taste the stock alone.The ingredients are also very generous and are well done with very soft-textured squid rings, though the medium half-shelled prawns could do with a bit less blanching.Nicely thick-cut pork belly slices are also added, which is very rare for fried Hokkien mee stalls these days.The killer are the generous crunchy pork lard pieces which they give out. They are decently seasoned and taste amazing eaten alone.A small point but the towgay (bean sprouts) are nicely crunchy as well.Be careful with the chili sambal on the side as there is a heavy dried prawn flavour in it. Add too much of it into the dish and that’s all you’ll taste. Put just a little and it adds a nice layer of smoky savouriness into the overall mix.The downside is that the noodles are not initially fried for a bit of charred-ness and the dish isn’t fried per say, more like its swirled around in a braising stock, so the wok hei is almost non-existent.The only flaw to an almost perfect plate of fried Hokkien mee.\xa0Yong Huat also sells four other dishes which are very decently made if not as well done as their fried Hokkien mee.Their Fried Mee Suah ($5/7/9) is nicely fried with a little wok hei smokiness but the seasoning is very light. So light that you’ll be able to taste the natural flavour of the added ingredients — green vegetables, pork belly, fishcake, prawns egg and lard. Swirl in the strong dried prawn chilli sambal for more added flavour.\xa0Their Fishball Minced Meat Noodles ($5/6/7) is chok full of ingredients — minced pork, fishballs, meatballs, fishcake with bean sprouts, lard, fried onions and spring onions. The portions are huge but you’d expect that at such prices.The noodles are dressed using that same strong dried prawn sambal chilli and oil. While it is decently tasty,\xa0 there is not enough of it to go round and the flavour can be a bit lacking.\xa0The same goes for their Prawn Mee ($5/6/7) which has the same noodle flavouring\xa0 and could use a little more to upp the flavour.Their Fried Kway Teow ($5/6/8) has a nice charred flavour, is chok full of ingredients but could do better with the flavouring. It has none of that cockle juice, comes a little too sweet and could do with a little more oil richness.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

Four branches after (Singapore is the first country outside of Hong Kong to have Tim Ho Wan branches), the queues are still way too long – the Plaza Singapura branch has a record waiting time of up to two hours. Still, many queue up for their baked bun with barbecue pork (three for $5.30)\xa0and ma lai gao (steamed egg cake, $4). You’re better off going to the Toa Payoh outlet at odd hours like 3pm if you want to skip the queuing. Other branches include those at Westgate Mall and Bedok Mall.

The folk at Victor’s Kitchen compensate for this by giving larger-sized dim sum, like in the wet XO sauce carrot cake ($4.80) and siew mai ($4.80).

The 1980s Hong Kong stall lookalike clearly has more than one draw,\xa0 The prawn cheong fun ($4.20) has – in comparison to most dim sum restaurants – smaller rolls and a thicker sauce, while the pork belly buns ($3.50) are miniature version with thinner skin and pork belly fats within. A tip: although not dim sum, their\xa0Thai-style\xa0crab bee hoon is amazing and flavourful, and at only $20.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/coffee-hive/:['Neighbourhood coffee shops are more than just places to wolf down a quick meal.For the many people that frequent coffee shops, these places make them feel like they’re part of a tight-knit community. Coffee shops are social spaces, venues where people can hang out and bond with friends and family. Little wonder why lim kopi (drink coffee) is an activity that friends often speak of doing together.And Coffee Hive, a local cafe franchise, has brought that communal dining experience to the CBD and to malls all around Singapore.\xa0At Coffee Hive outlets all around Singapore, you can connect and bond with friends and loved ones, all while taking in the fragrance of freshly brewed kopi and savouring unpretentious but delicious local fare.The warm, homely atmosphere of Coffee Hive’s many outlets have made them popular haunts for work meetings and family gatherings. At the franchise’s CBD outlets, you can see working executives flocking there for a cup of kopi or for lunch, and its suburban outlets are often patronised by families looking to share some time together.While Coffee Hive’s cosy, convivial atmosphere makes you feel welcome, their food plays an equally important role in making you feel at home. On their menu are familiar flavours and local favourites that will evoke nostalgia in many diners; their dishes carry the warmth and comfort of a home-cooked meal.\xa0They offer a variety of value meal sets ($3.10-$5) that include breakfast/teatime staples such as kaya toast, French toast, sandwiches, and half-boiled eggs. All these are accompanied by an aromatic, piping hot cup of teh or kopi.\xa0Coffee Hive also offers a wide range of local fare, including dishes such as laksa, mee siam, and wanton noodles. Their laksa and wanton noodles are two dishes to look out for — the former’s broth is rich and flavourful, and the wanton noodles’ dumplings are plump and the noodles springy.To cater to its ethnically diverse regulars, Coffee Hive also offers a range of Western dishes, such as Fish & Chips and Rosemary Chicken.\xa0Then there are the East-meets-West dishes, in which Asian and Western influences come together, as can be seen in the Sambal Baked Fish and Vietnamese Baked Chicken.The fuss-free and delicious dishes at Coffee Hive also come in generous portions and at prices that won’t bust your wallet. Its BBQ Chicken, for example, features an impressively huge chunk of chicken, all for a reasonable $6.50. The Sambal Baked Fish features a similarly generous portion of fish at $6.50 — a steal, if you ask us.And the deal has gotten sweeter: Coffee Hive has launched a loyalty card that allows diners to credit 10% of their top-up amount into it. For example, if you top up with $50, you’ll get an additional $5 credited. On top of that, you’ll get a free birthday voucher to use during your birthday month. And the card costs only $2!For the month of October,\xa0between 2-5pm every day, Coffee Hive (except its Science Centre outlet) is offering a cup of hot tea or hot coffee at just $1. If you’re looking to get a mid-day jolt, you know where to get it!While the wallet-preserving prices and the comforting and delicious food are certainly reasons to patronise Coffee Hive, its biggest draw will always be its warm, amiable atmosphere that will make one feel as if they were at home.Coffee Hive can be found at:Cecil Court\n138 Cecil Street #01-02\nSingapore 069538Central Square Village Residences\n20 Havelock Road #01-15\nSingapore 059765Novena Square 2\n10 Sinaran Drive #B1-88\nSingapore 307506PWC Building\n8 Cross Street #01-K1\nSingapore 048424The Adelphi\n1 Coleman Street #01-12\nSingapore 179803Fuji Xerox Towers\n80 Anson Road #01-04\nSingapore 079907Robinson 112\n112 Robinson Road #01-01\nSingapore 068902Fusionopolis Phase 2A @ One-North (F2A)\nINNOVIS #01-05, Singapore 138634\n(Junction of Fusionopolis Way and Ayer Rajah Ave)Immunos\n8A Biomedical Grove #01-17/18\nSingapore 138648Annexe Courtyard\n15 Science Centre Road\nSingapore 609081Loyang Point\n258 Pasir Ris St 31 #01-17 Loyang Point\nSingapore 510258Rivervale Mall\n11 Rivervale Cresent #01-19\nSingapore 545082Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/best-bak-kut-teh/:['Did you know that bak kut teh, literally translated as “meat bone tea” was regarded by Chinese coolies as a tonic to fortify their bodies in the early 1900s?Today, bak kut teh has evolved to become a sumptuous meal of pork rib soup, rice and a variety of side dishes. There are different styles of bak kut teh to choose from, with the Teochew version being the most popular here in Singapore. Its distinctive light and clear broth is made simply by simmering pork ribs, garlic cloves and pepper. The garlic imparts sweetness to the clear broth while the pepper delivers a zingy kick.As one of Singapore’s favourite homegrown dishes, there are plenty of worthy bak kut teh eateries around the island. We pick five famous giants and pit them against each other in this taste test. Who will emerge as the Big Brother of bak kut teh?\xa0Rong Cheng  EDITOR’S PICK!22 Sin Ming RoadOpening hours: Daily: 7am-4pmPrice: $6.00 (mix of spare rib & prime rib)Rating: 4.5/5The champion of this roundup, Rong Cheng is our top pick for their exceptional broth, freshness, value, and overall excellence.Clear and refreshing, the soup boasted great harmony and wonderful multitude of flavours. First to greet our palates were the savoury notes, interspersed with gentle sweetness. The subtle peppery notes slowly emerged at the end, leaving a delightful tingle which teased our palates for more.Here, they offer only a standard mix of ribs. Every bowl comes with two pieces of spare ribs and a premium piece of loin. They were very fresh and clean-tasting. Firm to the bite, we’d have preferred them to be more tender.Service was prompt, with servers coming around to top up soup regularly. We also enjoyed their wide variety of well-executed side dishes. Don’t miss their garland chrysanthemum (tang oh) in soup. Their braised pork trotter is another must-try.\xa0Outram Ya Hua Rou Gu Cha MOST TENDER RIBS7 Keppel Road, #01-05/07 PSA Tanjong Pagar ComplexOpening hours: 7am-4am; Closed on MonPrice: $7.00 (prime rib)Rating: 4/5\nComing in at a close second is Outram Ya Hua. Compared to Rong Cheng, their broth has a more dominant pepper presence. Here, we were first greeted by the pepper followed by the robust savoury flavours. Outram Ya Hua’s version would suit those who prefer a punchier bak kut teh.We were also impressed with their tender ribs. The prime ribs—cut into short lengths—had a good amount of lean and fatty parts. But they were pricey for the small portion.Little details contributed to the overall experience here. The salted vegetable was most appetising. Cut into small cubes, the salted vegetable was soft, juicy and tangy. Even the rice was deliciously fragrant and fluffy.\xa0Sin Heng Claypot Bak Koot Teh439 Joo Chiat RoadOpening hours: 7.30am-4am; Closed on MonPrice: $7.00 (prime rib)Rating: 3.5/5At Sin Heng, they offer two kinds of bak kut teh–the Teochew as well as the herbal version.For the Teochew version, the garlic and pepper broth is flavoured with dark soy sauce. It had a pleasant balance of mildly sweet, savoury, and peppery flavours. The herbal “special” bak kut teh tasted rather similar, minus the peppery edge and with an added bitterness from herbs like angelica root. If we had to pick one, our preference is the Teochew version.The bak kut teh was served in claypot so it remained warm for a longer period. Although on the lean side, the ribs were cooked till sufficiently tender. Portions were hearty and reasonably priced.The only letdowns of the meal were the rice and salted vegetable. Loose and dense, the rice grains were probably of the aged variety. As for the salted vegetable, it was far too briny and salty, as though they had neglected to give it a proper soak before cooking.\xa0Founder Rou Gu Cha347 Balestier RoadOpening hours: 12pm-2pm, 6pm-2.30am; closed on TuesPrice: $8.00 for prime ribRating: 3/5There are at least seven bak kut teh shops in Balestier Road. Sandwiched between them is Founder, the pioneer whose fame probably started the bak kut teh trend along this stretch.Regulars here go straight for the premium loin ribs. Each bowl comes with two tender and meaty ribs, which means each one is $4 a pop. Pricey, but we’d gladly pay the difference. The premium ribs were much more worth it than the lean and tough pork ribs.The clear-looking soup was mostly savoury, with a tiny hint of pepper that’s barely discernible. It was tasty enough, but lacked character. The salted vegetables had the right doneness, but could have been less oily. The you tiao (fried dough) was rather dry and doughy.\xa0Ng Ah Sio Pork Ribs Soup Eating House208 Rangoon RoadOpening hours: 7am-3pm; closed on MonPrice: $7.50 for prime ribRating: 2.5/5This famous establishment is best remembered for turning away Hong Kong governor Donald Tsang because they had run out of fresh pork ribs for the day. Earlier this year, the eatery underwent a makeover, emerging with improved seating, ventilation, and décor.While the ambience was much improved, the food seemed to have gone the opposite direction. Our main bugbear was the porky smell of the meat, which really put us off. Even the strong peppery soup failed to mask the lingering pong.Ng Ah Sio most definitely takes the prize for “most fiery bak kut teh” in this roundup. We had no issue with that; however the broth could have benefited with more depth and sweetness instead of just being salty and super peppery.We ordered the premium spare ribs. They were very thick and meaty, but the texture was a tad stringy. The stewed salted vegetables were chunky and tender, but a bit too sweet and greasy. Compared to the other eateries, Ng Ah Sio’s side dishes are relatively pricier.\xa0inSing.com made anonymous visits and paid for its own meals at the eateries featured here.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/the-butter-factory/:['A Masters Graduate specialising in legal research, Eu-Yen is also the 29-year-old female chairperson of The Butter Factory — a veritable icon in Singapore’s nightlife industry. Eu-Yen has had her hands full juggling law and running the club since her postgraduate days at Oxford and, more recently, with her first foray into the F&B industry with Over Easy, a collaboration with the people behind The White Rabbit and Loof. As if there isn’t enough on her plate, the young achiever is also teaching at SMU as assistant professor of law. With all that under her belt at her young age, Eu-Yen is certainly raising the bar for young women everywhere.What’s the best thing about working in Singapore’s vibrant nightlife scene? \nThe best thing is the people. Everybody we work with is passionate about the nightlife, not just as a job, but as a lifestyle. We also get to meet a lot of interesting people from Singapore and around the region. Like-mindedness in this industry is a real bonus because it builds friendships that make creating a party that much more fun. And that vibe among the team reverberates around the entire party, adding to its edge.How does The Butter Factory keep the partying scene alive in Singapore despite the recession?\nThe Butter Factory has always believed in reinvention, recession or not. We constantly strive to ensure that partying does not go stale. Every now and then, we have theme parties to keep the scene alive. We are especially keen to keep the fun in partying, whether with our music, live shows, or colourful interior decor. In a recession such as this one, we hope that our customers can step into The Butter Factory and enter a world of stress-less indulgence.Why did The Butter Factory move to One Fullerton? How has the new location been working out for the club so far? \nThe main reason behind the move was that our lease at Robertson Quay was due to expire. At the same time that we were deliberating negotiating a renewal, Fullerton Heritage expressed interest in hearing a proposal from us. With the upcoming IR and Fullerton Heritage flanking both sides of the bay, we could already see how that area would be the next entertainment hub. We want to be part of that new scene! So far, it has been working out fantastic for us. We draw a very good crowd, much like the one we used to draw at Robertson Quay, only now in greater numbers.Working in the nightlife industry means being constantly surrounded by beautiful people. Have you ever had an indecent proposal? What does your other half think of that?\nSure I have. I doubt it is rare for clubbers try to pick up other clubbers. It is part of the fun. If I had an “other half”, I’m sure he would just laugh it off.You’re a relatively young, female chairperson in the nightlife industry. One might say you’re a minority. Have you run into any challenges as a consequence of this and how have you dealt with them?\nDefinitely! The greatest challenges are gaining credibility and respect as a young person and as a female. These are relatively stereotypical challenges for any young, female leader in any industry that is male dominated. I suppose the difference is that in the nightlife industry where partying is involved, lines are more easily blurred and one needs to be more careful not to show signs of weakness. I find that the easiest way to deal with these challenges is to believe in one’s true capability and to exude that confidence. With that naturally comes credibility and respect in good time.Where in the club are we most likely to find you on a busy Saturday night, and what will you be sipping on?\nYou will find me in Fash, our new electro room. I would not be “sipping” on anything though. You’ll probably find me gulping down beer or cognac. Sipping is so passe! (laughs)Do you think Singapore’s nightlife industry will hold up well in the recession and why?\nI believe it will. Nightlife in Singapore, as compared to other major cities in Asia, is in its infant stages but it’s already shows signs of being an essential part of the Singaporean lifestyle. We all know in economics theory that the last thing anybody will cut is a necessity and fun is definitely an un-substitutable necessity in life! The government has expressly supported nightlife in recent years and that of course helps heaps. Nightlife entertainment is no longer viewed as decadent and has been recognised as a major driving force behind tourism and the economy. With all that going for us, yes, we will hold up.What’s your personal mantra for success?\nDare to believe.What do you do in your free time when you’re not partying or busy managing the club?\nI do legal research and write law articles. I used to be a practising lawyer and I’ve started my appointment with Singapore Management University as assistant professor of law since July. Of course, there are times when I simply lounge in front of the TV or read a frivolous fiction novel!Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/soon-lee/:['Arguably the oldest stall at Clementi Central’s food centre, Soon Lee is a family-run hawker business that has been in existence for more than 80 years. They specialise in Hainanese porridge, a style which is increasingly hard to find in current times.Started by the family’s grandmother who migrated from Hainan, China, she ply-ed her wares as a street hawker along Upper Bukit Timah before the government shifted her business to Clementi Central’s food centre when it began in 1980. It was a family-run affair at Clementi with five of her eight children running the stall. Third-generation owner Mervin Tan, 38, currently helms the store with the help of a stable of family members and friends.The consistency of the porridge is what makes it unique at Soon Lee. It is not an entirely smooth paste like how it is with Cantonese porridge, nor does it have watery soft whole grains like it is with Teochew porridge. It is instead a middle ground texture with broken up grains and gravy-like gruel. The porridge-making process starts at 3am daily, with the porridge itself being ready by 6am and stirred continuously over a low flame to maintain its texture.When an order is placed, plain-tasting porridge is quickly cooked with a secret savoury sauce and whatever ingredients the customer wants.There are three options on offer — pork, fish and chicken ($3/4) but like all hawker stalls, you can customise the ingredients to your liking.The pork option has sliced pork, pork liver and the handmade pork balls which are very well-seasoned and wonderfully soft and fatty. Some customers will request for just the pork balls only for their order because it is that good.The fish porridge is also commendable as it contains very fresh batting fish slices. The added fish flavour and the customary ginger slices add a nice dimension to the dish.All porridge options are topped off with chopped spring onions, tang chai (salted cabbage), fried onions and pork lard.The addition of a raw egg costs $0.30. Soya sauce and white pepper are provided on the side if you wish to add more flavour to your bowl.Be prepared to wait at least 20 minutes on average, on a typical weekday morning.Longtime customers will remember that they used to add in you tiao pieces with every serving but the practice was stopped in 2013 as the freshness of dough fritters could not be maintained throughout the day.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/yong-xiang-xing-dou-fu/:['This yong tau foo (ytf) stall has been in existence since the food centre began operations in the 1970s and at the exact same spot.You’ll know which stall it is by the long snaking queue of people that queue up for it before its opening at 1pm. You don’t get to pick and choose the ytf items, but they are all excellently well-made as the fish paste is wonderfully smooth and springy. Tofu items have a certain smoothness, and the soup has a nice blend of pork and soybean stock flavours.\xa0They also serve their ytf as a set with no changes and with soup and with no rice or noodles ($4.50). A tip: if you want a second bowl, you don’t have to re-queue. Just ask one of the staff (usually a lady) who will take your order and money.The other interesting fact here is that chopped fermented beans are added into the spicy-and-sour chilli sauce which explains its complex savouriness.\xa0A big thing to note is that every item — the taste of the soup and the fish paste — comes more savoury as compared to the other ytf stalls here, so if you’re a bit sensitive towards saltiness, you might want to stay clear. When you look at the average age of their clientele, you’ll understand why. The majority of patrons are in their 50s, 60s and older (biologically speaking, food tastes blander the older you get). So Yong Xiang Xing Dou Fu is not upping the savouriness on purpose, they are simply catering to their clientele.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

Say no to the typical beers and give these pairings a go; you’ve got to think out of the box to put these in your baskets:Char kway teow with dry gin cocktails\nWith a varied assortment of ingredients that range from bean sprouts to chives, egg, cockles, pork lard, fishcake, prawns and Chinese sausage, char kway teow is a tricky dish to find company for. Gin seems to fit the coupling though – each brand of gin carries the flavours of a unique combination of aromatic botanicals used in its distilling process. Go with a simple mix; Bombay Sapphire ($74.95 from Cold Storage) with soda and a squeeze of lime is just the right kind of dry drink you need to go with the oily and sweet noodle dish.\nOutram Park Fried Kway Teow Mee | Address: Blk 531A Upper Cross Street, #02-17 Hong Lim Food Centre | Opening hours: Mon-Sat 6am-4.30pm\n\xa0Char siew and roast pork belly with German white beers\nYou can never go wrong with char siew or sio bak (Chinese dialect for ‘roast pork belly’) rice. It’s a dish that inspires loyalty, one with secret recipes worth as much as, say, $1.8 million. Our recommendation for your roast meat fix can, fortunately, be just round the corner – pair the\xa0May Flower Roasted Meat Specialist’s meats with classic German brews like Schneider Weisse and Konig Ludwig ($12) which can be found at The Good Beer Company. The white beers go well with sweet char siew and crispy, salty sio bak.\nTip: For something even more localised, try it with\xa0 one of the Jungle Beers ($15 each). \nMay Flower Roasted Meat Specialist\xa0| Address: 335 Smith Street, #02-44/45 Chinatown Complex\nThe Good Beer Company | Address: 335 Smith Street, #02-58 Chinatown Complex | Opening hours: mon-Fri noon-2pm, 5pm-11pm; Sat noon-11pm\n\xa0Fried oysters/oyster omelette with Marston’s Oyster stout\nThe name says it all: Marston’s Oyster Stout ($7.50 at East of Avalon Wines) is a dry-ish English brew that is light for a stout. It does wonders to cut through the oil and oyster flavours and textures to cleanse the palate – something you need to power though those plates of egg, fresh oysters, sour chilli sauce and spring onions. Interestingly, the oyster stout style harks back to the Victorian era, where oysters were the food of the common man and not some overpriced, alleged aphrodisiac, so pairing it with hawker food places it in familiar territory.\nSuper Mummy Fried Hokkien Mee, Carrot Cake, Oyster | Address: 335 Smith Street, #02-103 Chinatown Complex\nEast of Avalon Wines | Address: 281 Joo Chiat road | Tel: 6440 0504 | Opening hours: Mon & Tues 3pm-10.30pm; Wed-Sun 11.30am-10.30pm\n\xa0Hainanese chicken rice with Sauvignon Blanc\nIndeed, when the idea of ‘classing up’ hawker food by serving it with wine first emerged, chicken rice was among the first dishes to be considered. Chicken and white wine are always a good match. Oyster Bay’s Sauvignon Blanc (from Marlborough, New Zealand, $43.95) is ideal as it’s fresh and citrusy. Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken rice’s symphony of stock, oil, garlic, cucumber and chili, for example, calls for something delicate but lively.\nTian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice | Address: 1 Kadayanallur Street, #01-10 Maxwell Food Centre | Opening hours: Tue-Sun 11am-8pm\xa0Laksa with pale ale\nThe debate will always rage on about which Katong laksa is the original, but this spicy favourite has been a bit of an ambassador for Peranakan cuisine, travelling the world and winning fans everywhere from London to Los Angeles. With something as rich and spicy as laksa, the best you can do is to keep things simple and heat-extinguishing, so have a beer, but do take things up a notch with a pale ale. Hawthorn’s pale ale ($7.50 from East of Avalon Wines) is a hoppy drop that brings the heat of laksa to a satisfying climax without losing out to the flavours of the seafood ingredients and coconut gravy.\n328 Katong Laksa | Address: 53 East Coast Road | Opening hours: Daily 8am-10pm\xa0Mutton soup with Malbec\nLike walking into a TCM hall, herbal mutton soup might not be to everyone’s liking. But those who love it can’t live without it. Whether you go for the ribs, the tripe or tendon, the Argento Malbec ($28.95 from Cold Storage) – a luscious Argentinian red wine – will go well. This red goes very well with heavy meat dishes.\nNew World Mutton Soup | Address: 207 New Upper Changi Road, #01-55 Bedok Interchange Food Centre | Opening hours: Daily 10am-10.30pm\xa0Nasi lemak with Chardonnay\nJacob’s Creek’s Chardonnay ($24.95 from Cold Storage) is one of the best value for money wines out there, and it pairs well with nasi lemak too. Bursting with tropical fruit aromas, this creamy-on-the palate swirl with a distinct buttery flavour melds well with the simple, clean flavours of fried fish, chicken, coconut rice, egg and peanuts.\nSelera Rasa Nasi Lemak | Address: 2 Adam Road, Stall 2 Adam Road Food Centre | Opening hours: Mon-Thu, Sat & Sun 7am-6pm\xa0Sambal stingray with Estrella Damm Inedit\nThe object of many foodies’\xa0 uncontrollable cravings and a staple of any seafood barbecue, sambal stingray is a source of much national pride when it comes to local cuisine. The heat of the sambal, the tang of the limes, the juicy flesh and the crunchy cartilage conspire to leave mouths watering and foreheads sweating – this is precisely why it goes well with the Estrella Damm Inedit ($20 from Wine Exchange Asia). A beer crafted with the input of the famously outlandish chef Ferran Adria, the Inedit was made to go with ‘challenging foods’ that are oily and have strong flavours (citrus being among them). Lightly spicy, floral, full-bodied and crisp, it’s as if Adria made it just to be knocked back with a wing of ray.\xa0 \nChomp Chomp Hai Wei Yuan Seafood BBQ | Address: 20 Kensington Park Road, Stall #1 Chomp Chomp Food Centre | Opening hours: Tue-Sun 5pm-midnight\nWine Exchange Asia | Address: 301 Boon Keng Rd | Tel: 6391 1061 | Opening hours: Mon-Fri 9am-6pm\xa0Satay with smoky whiskeys\nYou can see why the succulent meats cooked over an open flame goes well with the smoky notes of the whiskey. Satay has a Japanese cousin in the form of yakitori, so a good thing to match it with is a smoky whisky from the Land of the Rising Sun. Suntory Hakushu Heavily Peated ($170 from Fine Spirits by La Maison du Whisky) is ideal with lightly charred and slightly sweet satay. This, we think, is second only to prawn paste chicken wings when it comes to hawker fare tailor-made for drinking.\nOld Punggol Satay | Address: 120 Bukit Merah Lane 1, #01-52 Alexandra Village Food Centre | Opening hours: Mon-Fri 4.30pm-9.30pm; Sat & Sun noon-9:30pm\nFine Spirits by La Maison du Whisky| Address: 80 Mohamed Sultan Road, #01-10 The Pier | Tel: 6733 0059 | Opening hours: Mon-Sat noon-midnight\xa0 \xa0Cendol with Kahlua\nWe didn’t forget the sweet stuff; a favourite roadside dessert all around the region, the classic cendol has changed little over the years, and for as little as $1.20 at some ice dessert stalls. As ice-cream lovers know, a bit of liqueur makes everything a little better, and the same holds true for cendol. The coffee flavour of Kahlua ($71.10 from Cold Storage) blends seamlessly with the sinful coconut milk and gula melaka of the cendol; have it on the side or pour it straight in.\nMing Fa Cold & Hot Desserts | Address: Blk 531A Upper Cross Street, #02-24 Hong Lim Food Centre____________________________________________________________________________ A beer enthusiast first and a writer second, Kurt Ganapathy has tried over a thousand brews from 80 countries.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/bedok-chwee-kueh/:['Established in 1996 at Bedok Interchange Hawker Centre and now with seven branches across Singapore, this stall really needs no introduction as it is easily the most recognisable name when it comes to chwee kueh in Singapore.That said, we decided that it deserved a re-review because the business recently made a big change to the size of its chwee kueh in the last six months or so. This is the first change it’s done in its two decades of operation.Instead of the steel mould being smaller and deeper, they’ve made the mould much wider and a little shallower. The end result is a chwee kueh that is impressively large and results in a snack that is even better than it already is.\xa0If you don’t know by now, Chwee kueh is a Teochew rice cake that is steamed and topped off with fried diced chye poh (Chinese preserved radish).The change in the shape means that the cake is more evenly steamed throughout and there is none of that thick and dry texture that you sometimes get in the middle.There’s also more flat surface area on the top so you can spread out the fried chye poh topping for more even eating.Unfortunately, it has resulted in a change in its pricing. Instead of four chwee kuehs, $1 now only gets you two pieces but it’s a big two pieces.\xa0Talking about the general quality of Bedok Chwee Kueh, it may not have had the excellent quality that Tiong Bahru’s Jian Bo Shui Kueh had in its early days (the quality has gone down since) but the quality has been generally high.Everything is made in a central kitchen and the kueh itself comes nicely steamed with a soft, wobbly texture, firmer than that of soft egg custard.It melts in your mouth and it is very slightly salted to bring out the flavour of the rice.We have had it too soft and watery before but that’s on the very rare occasion.\xa0As for the chye poh topping, it has a nice mix of sweet and salty flavours — likely a mix of the salty and sweet varieties — slight hints of garlic and nice toasted sesame seeds mixed in. The chye poh is very generously oil-rich and the texture a nice firm/soft in-between.Bedok Chwee Kueh doesn’t add dried shrimps into their toppings, so the flavour isn’t unnecessarily complicated.\nUnfortunately, they do not use pork lard like how they used to in the old days. We feel the addition of it would upp the general flavour of the dish.The sambal chilli on the side is not the spiciest in the world but it has a nice grittiness backed by a bit of savouriness. It does well in complementing — and not over-dominating — the kueh and the topping.The more impressive feat is that it manages to achieve this consistent standard throughout all of its many outlets across Singapore — Clementi 448, Chong Boon Food Centre, Chong Pang Food Centre, Lorong Ah Soo, Chinatown Food Centre, Ang Mo Kio Ave 4.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/cheng-tng/:['The Teochews were the first to sell cheng tng, a sweet Chinese dessert soup. They operated as street hawkers in the Havelock Road area, where coolies working at the quays nearby drank cheng tng as a cooling brew to counter heat and humidity.Originally called five-flavour soup, it consisted of dried longan, gingko nut, barley, lotus seed and lily bud. Later on, dried persimmon was added. Soon, other dialect groups also started to sell cheng tng, and added other ingredients such as white fungus, winter melon and pangdahai (little brown seeds known for their cooling and detoxifying properties.) Reflecting changing tastes throughout the decades, the ingredients used in cheng tng are also constantly evolving.Although every stall has its own unique recipe for cheng tng, what really matters to most people is whether it tastes good. To find the answer to that, inSing.com rounds up some of the best places for a healthy and delicious cheng tng fix.\xa0Hot & Cold Cheng TngAddress: Stall 41, East Coast Lagoon Food Village\nOperating hours: Wed-Mon: 12pm – 11pm\nPrice: $2\nRating: 4.5/5\nThis is a stellar example of what cheng tng should be! There are so many ingredients in the dessert, and each of them is individually cooked to perfection, before being put together to make an unforgettable bowl of cheng tng.Unlike the sago in most cheng tng stalls, the ones you find here are not mushy from overcooking, so they have that pleasant chewy texture that keeps you wanting more. The barley and candied winter melon also have the right firmness. Another old-school touch is the gingko nuts and sweet potato, which have been patiently cooked till candied. It’s obvious the cheng tng here is prepared with thought and passion.As for the soup, both the hot and cold versions are just as refreshing. It’s also flavorful without being too sweet. Price-wise, the cheng tng here is value-for-money as it comes in a big bowl and has lots of ingredients in it.\xa0Mohamed Sultan Road Hot & Cold Cheng TngAddress: Stall 32, Zion Riverside Food Centre\nOperating hours: Tues, Thurs, Sat: 12pm – 8pm\nPrice: $1.50\nRating: 4/5\nSometimes, less is more! Although the cheng tng here has only around five ingredients, the result is a wholesome and rich dessert. What makes it so rich is the generous amount of gingko nut added to it. The stall owner painstakingly cracks and shells fresh gingko nuts by hand. They are then cooked in syrup till sweet, translucent and of just the right texture.Besides gingko nut, there’s also pangdahai, dried longan and lots of bouncy sago in the hot cheng tng. The sweet soup is light and refreshing. The cold cheng tng is slightly different. Canned longan and lychee were added to it. The lychee adds a distinctive scent and flavour that is appropriate for the iced cheng tng.\xa0Ye Lai Xiang Hot & Cold Cheng TngAddress: Stall 31, Bedok Food Centre\nOperating hours: Tues-Sun: 12pm – 8pm\nPrice: $2\nRating: 3.5/5\nHaving served this dessert for more than 50 years, Ye Lai Xiang is a name that many associate with delicious cheng tng. Ye Lai Xiang infuses Hokkien influences in this Teochew dessert with the addition of mung bean and winter melon strips – and the Peranakan influence of infusing the soup with the fragrance of pandan leaves.There are at least 10 ingredients in the cheng tng here! But there are hits and misses. The dried longan is sweet and crunchy, while the single cube of sweet potato is nicely candied. But the mung bean is too hard, while the sago too soft and mushy.The soup is also not as flavorful or smooth as it should be. But still, it’s more unique than the average cheng tng, except that it’s a little pricey for the amount dished out.\xa0Dessert Stall No.13Address: Fork and Spoon Food Court (Toa Payoh HDB Hub)\nOperating hours: Daily 10am – 10pm\nPrice: $1.50\nRating: 3/5\nThe first impression you get from the cheng tng here is, “Wow, that’s a mighty lot of longan!” As a result, the sweet, clear soup is brown from the generous amount of dried longan added to it. Every spoonful is a burst of intense longan flavour. Usually, ice dilutes the sweet soup, but here, even the cold version has that distinctive longan taste. Needless to say, there’s plenty of juicy longan to munch on. But after a while, it feels more like dried longan soup rather than cheng tng.Longan aside, the soup here is full-bodied and not overly sweet. There are also other ingredients like gingko, barley, white fungus, sago, and pangdahai, but unlike the sweet and plump dried longan, they are boringly bland.\xa0Xi Le Ting (Chinese dessert stall)Address: 02-70, Commonwealth Crescent Market & Food Centre 119 Commonwealth Crescent, Singapore 140119\nOperating hours: Daily 1pm – 10pm\nPrice: $0.70\nRating: 2.5/5\nWhere else can you find a bowl of cheng tng that costs a mere 70 cents these days? Not surprisingly, the cheng tng here hasn’t got much ingredients in it; there’s only a little dried longan, barley, white fungus, pearl sago and agar strips, and only the hot version is available. But the soup itself is pleasantly light without being overly sweet.Although there’s no gingko nut, there’s a very traditional ingredient not often found in most cheng tng these days: sliced dried persimmon. Also, the barley and white fungus are cooked till al dente, which is the perfect texture. The cheng tng here is not the most impressive, but will do if all you want is a quick and cheap cheng tng fix.Do you agree with the review? Have you got your own favourite cheng tng stall?

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/popo-and-nanas-delights/:['Even though Popo and Nana’s Delights sells Peranakan dishes, the main attraction here are the Eurasian dishes which are incredibly hard to find outside of family homes. Aside from the odd one or two restaurants (Mary’s Kafe and Quentin’s), finding Eurasian food in a hawker setting in Singapore is virtually unheard of.Opened by siblings Grace and Christopher Chin, they started this stall at Maxwell food centre in 2015 and they serve a mix of Eurasian and Peranakan dishes which are free of MSG and artificial colouring. They offer about 20 different dishes but only four will be on offer for the day and are often sold out by mid-afternoon. The menu is announced on their Facebook page about an hour before they open for business at 11.30am.Named after Grace Chin’s Indonesian Peranakan paternal grandmother (Popo) and her late Eurasian mother (Nana), they offer popular Eurasian dishes like Devil’s curry, shepherd’s pie and beef smore as well as some of the more unusual offerings like beef ball curry and zucchini pie.\xa0On the Peranakan side of things, buah keluak (Indonesian black nut; pangium edule)\xa0stew with chicken or pork and babi pongteh are popular here and they also offer some of their unique creations like smoked duck pasta and crab pasta.Dishes are served as set meals ($6) which is on the higher side than what you would normally pay in a hawker centre but the portions are generous and every set includes rice, vegetable of the day and soup. On the day we ordered, achar, chap chye and a variation on the sambal lady’s fingers with a simple powdery hae bee hiam (spicy dried shrimp sambal) was available.The Eurasian dishes are what to aim for here. The fish mollie —a seafood-based stew with Portugese and Indian origins — is done differently with a thick tumeric and coconut gravy, loaded with lots of minced ginger, covering a crispy battered fish. If you like your curries strong and powerful, you will be disappointed as the flavours are deliberately light so that the flavour of the fish shines through.The Chicken Shepherd’s Pie is one of the few dishes that don’t come as a set meal but what you get is incredible value. The portion is generous and could easily feed two small eaters. The lightly salted mashed potato covering is smooth with a delicate butter richness and the filling — a mix of minced chicken, chicken pieces, peas, carrots corn and onions, is thick and densely packed.\nThe Peranakan dishes like ayam buah keluak and babi tempra\xa0have a taste profile which will not appeal to everyone. The main focus of the flavours are on the sweet or sour flavours and the savouriness is very restrained — a big contrast to most hawker dish offerings. In short, you’ll either love it or hate it.The ayam buah keluak — a chicken stew made with the Indonesian black nut — comes with whole soft stewed nuts, soft chicken and leans towards a more tangy taste. The babi tempra, a soya sauce-based stew with fresh lime flavours, comes with a huge mountain of sliced pork belly, leans towards the sweeter side and has lots of pork fat richness.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/the-social-kitchen/:['COVID-19 has sent us turning to food delivery services more than before. Catering to our needs has been made easier for food brands thanks to the not-so-new invention of Cloud Kitchens.Cloud Kitchens, also known as virtual restaurants, are simply brands moving towards a delivery-only system. This system is nothing new in Singapore, but in recent months, more food brands have been looking into this change.One such brand is Social Kitchen, a Cloud Kitchen-based social enterprise that aims to help local food businesses survive during the pandemic.Though many local food businesses continue to have a loyal following online, delivery and preparation are not everyday tasks that these businesses handled before COVID-19.Thus, with the aid of the Social Kitchen, these businesses have a chance to stay afloat.\xa0The Social Kitchen is also staffed with underprivileged and special needs beneficiaries to provide them with skills training opportunities and income through their central kitchens.To keep the above initiative alive, The Social Kitchen partnered with Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA) for the hiring and training process. So, good intentions and causes aside, the real question is – Is the food tasty and worth it? The answer is a resounding yes!The first dish that I tasted was the ‘Chinatown Flavours’ platter (at $19.90). At one glance, the serving portion is more than substantial. The bee hoon noodles have vegetable slices and sesame seeds for toppings, a side of crackers and two different Ngoh Hiangs.The noodles were springy and far from dry, even though it was packaged and delivered. The prawn crackers added a crisp to every bite, and when dipped into the chilli paste, it changed the game of the dish. The Ngoh Hiang, on the other hand, was crispy on the outside, spongy and delicate on the inside. If you are a fan of the vegetable-based Ngoh Hiangs or the chicken-based ones, fret not as both are available in this platter!\nThe next dish that I quite quickly slurped down was the Mixed Ball Soup with La Mian served with Premium fish and pork balls. The first thing that caught my attention when I bit into the noodles was the burst of flavours. A tinge of sourness and spiciness came through at the same time.Topped with sliced mushrooms and carrot slices, the mixed ball soup elevates the entire dish. The fish balls and pork balls were both juicy and smooth with every bite. The soup is infused with both flavours of the chicken and pork which worked seamlessly well together. Despite the time needed for delivery, the entire dish, priced at $12.90, was still warm, making my stay-home dining experience a much better one.With these dishes and many others on their menu, such as Vegetarian Fried Rice, Handmade Dumpling La Mian, Social Kitchen brings the local flavours right to your home successfully.Whether you are working from home or simply looking to feast while watching your favourite Netflix show, you can support local businesses and the beneficiaries by enjoying a meal from\xa0 Social Kitchen.Their menus and delivery services are available on Grabfood and Oddle!Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/yi-jia-teochew-fish-porridge/:['It’s not one of the famous stalls which are recommended by tourist guides and “best of” lists about at Maxwell Food Centre but Yi Jia Teochew Fish Porridge\xa0sees consistently long queues everyday because they sell a fish soup which is very traditional Teochew.In existence for “many decades” (the stallholders are a bit cagey when it comes to information), they offer fish soup with the more expensive pomfret ($5/7) instead of the more common batang fish (Spanish mackerel) which is common for fish soup stalls in Singapore. You’ll very often see a queue form way past its opening time of 11am as the pomfret options are very popular and gets sold out by 12.30pm or so.\xa0Pomfrets, usually silver pomfret, is highly prized by the Teochew community as it has a firm, yet delicate flesh that is suitable for steaming and soup dishes. But be warned, you might not like eating the premium pomfret here as they serve you the boney parts from the fish cheek, stomach and fin areas — these areas contain the tastiest meat and are well loved by the Teochew fish soup fans.If you’re not a big fan of digging into bones, the whole affair will be a bit frustrating to eat.\xa0In comparison to the more popular and common Cantonese fish soup which has a milky broth and the option of battered fried fish, Teochew fish soup has fish slices, vegetables and bee hoon (rice vermicelli) in a clear fish broth. Usually fish soup stalls go the cheaper route of adding tofu and lettuce to bulk up the dish but here, there is no tofu and they use the more expensive tang oh (garland chrysanthemum leaves) which adds a musky vegetable and chrysanthemum flavour.The flavour of the broth is also deliberately made lighter as it is traditionally eaten with a highly savoury bean paste (taucheo) and pickled ginger dip which they offer on the side. They also offer minced garlic and the standard fresh red chilli and soy sauce.\xa0For fish soup novices, they serve the normal boneless batang fish ($3/4/5) and in addition to bee hoon (thick and thin), they also offer mee sua (wheat noodles), porridge or just soup alone or with rice. There is also the option to add prawns and fish roe.They have another outlet at Tekka Centre which is moe convenient as it is located next to Little India MRT station.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/seng-kee-119-steamed-fish-head/:['If fish head curry is Singapore’s national dish, steamed fish head with hot sauce is arguably Chinatown’s.Located in the blue zone of Chinatown Complex, Seng Kee 119 Steamed Fish Head is a two-stall cze char eatery that has been serving its unique creation of steamed fish head with hot sauce for a whopping 35 years — it’s the hawker equivalent of an almost four decade bubble tea trend.In business since 1983, the owner who goes by the nickname “Kai Zhai” (Chicken son in Cantonese) used to sell chicken rice but business was not good.All that changed after a visit to Thailand where he learnt how to make a Thai sweet and spicy sauce. That formed the heart of his steamed fish head dish which he sold instead of chicken rice and that has proven immensely popular with the Chinatown crowd.The stall is always busy during the lunch and dinner periods when they are open — expect to wait 30 to 45 minutes for your order if you come any later than 5.30pm.\xa0The dish is so popular that it has spawned at least seven or eight copycats in the food centre alone.Priced at just $15, you get half of a huge song fish head (Big Head Asian Carp), which includes not just the head but the fish collar as well. Many customers just eat the fish head with rice and the portion is big enough that it can easily feed two people.The steamed fish head is covered in the stall’s unique thick hot sauce, which is comprised of a myriad of ingredients like preserved beans, chillies, ginger, tomato and sour plum.The resultant taste is an addictive power-packed flavour, which is a mix between Thai and Chinese flavours — spicy, sour, slightly sweet, with ginger and garlic spices. The addition of tau Cheo (preserved beans) filling out the savoury middle adds that Chinese influence.\xa0The song fish is nicely steamed and the meat has no muddy taste, evidence of it being fresh, thanks to the Chinatown market located below the food centre. If you know your way through a fish head, there is lots of fish fat and gelatinous bits to be had.Along with the crunchy fried pork lard on top, the dish is wonderfully sinful.It’s perfect for fish head addicts, but its almost too much of a good thing as the dish does get a little too rich as there is so much fish fat to be had.\xa0Still, there are people who demand for more fried pork lard and the stall will refuse you. A heaped spoonful of fried pork lard is all that you’ll get. No more, no less.Additional note: if you’re coming here for dinner and you want to avoid the crowds, 4.30pm is an optimal time. Any later and you’ll have to wait for your order or worse still, wait around for a table.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/shen-ji-ji-fan/:['Tucked inside Guan Kim Restaurant — an old-school coffeeshop at Tanglin Halt — is a hidden gem of a chicken rice stall because it sells excellent chicken rice at very reasonable prices and the crowd knows it as their chicken rice gets sold out often before their closing time of 1pm.But eat it while you can as the whole Tanglin Halt development is slated to be demolished by the end of 2021 and the owners haven’t decided where they will shift to.The owners, Mr and Mrs Lee are a husband and wife team who have been selling chicken rice for more than 20 years.\nThey started in the Commonwealth area before shifting to Guan Kim Restaurant, then they took a break and relocated to Pasir Ris and Jurong West before moving back to Tanglin Halt in 2016.While white poached chicken is the main attraction at most chicken rice stalls, the star dish here is ironically the roasted chicken as it is well-seasoned and is fried a little longer as compared to other stalls.\nThe result is a roast chicken that has an almost crispy skin and crisp edges at the sides.\nAnd even though the meat for roast chicken can often come a little dry, it is offset as it is dressed in a complex savoury sesame oil-rich sauce that’s full of flavour.The poached chicken is no slouch as well.Large chickens are used and it comes with a very smooth meat texture, though not the smoothest we’ve encountered and again dressed in that strong savoury sauce that upps the flavour quite a bit.\nAll the other elements – like the rice, sides and sauces – are equally commendable at Shen Ji.The chicken livers come smooth and creamy and chicken gizzards are unique because it is cooked a little longer such that it has an interesting soft but crunchy texture.\nAlso order the chicken feet as it comes deboned and cooked to a bouncy springy texture.As for the rice, it comes nice and bouncy, sometimes toothy and with a decent chicken stock flavour and lighter oil richness.\nThe sauces are served quite old school, in a small tray on every table and they are nice and light in taste.\nThey don’t overpower the flavour of the chicken and the rice.\nThe chilli sauce has a nice freshness with balanced light savoury and sour notes, the black soy sauce nicely thick and smoky and the minced ginger comes plain with no added seasoning.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

Which is why, for the nation’s birthday, we’ve scoured the island for an alternative way to blow out the candles. Whether it’s a steak or a secret message in a naan, these alternatives are just as sinful and festive as their traditional counterparts.Jtown Cafe\nFor martabak manis\nThis is a martabak (stuffed pancake)\xa0like no other. Differing greatly from the meatier version we’re familiar with, an Indonesia martabak manis (sweet stuffed pancake)\xa0ends your meal on a sweet note. If you tell the guys at Jtown Cafe it’s your birthday (with proof of identification, of course), they’ll provide one free of charge—with a candle and a belting of a birthday song to boot. The guest of honour can choose between the classic butter and sugar filling, or go for the gold with the chocolate, cheese and peanut fillings. Not only are these fillings sandwiched between the fluffy pancakes, they’re topped with condensed milk, grated cheddar cheese and chocolate sprinkles. Serving three to four persons per portion, order it in advance as Jtown only prepares 30 per weekday, and 60 per weekend. Even if it’s not your birthday, you can still enjoy the martabak manis at $2.70 for a regular (serves one), and $5.70 for large (serves three to four).\nJtown Cafe |\xa0Address: 220 Orchard Rd, #B1-04/05 Midpoint Orchard | Tel: 92305040 | Opening hours: noon-11pm\xa0LavaStone Specialty Grill\nFor wagyu steak cake\nSteak and BJ day (Ben and Jerry’s ice-cream of course — spare your tut-tuts of disapproval) comes only once a year, so make yours special. If you think having both a cake and steak is too much of a good thing, why not make your piece of meat part of the blow-out bash? LavaStone Specialty Grill’s largest prime cut wagyu steak cake ($168.90) is the 750g star at the table. Flanked with a leafy salad and fries at the side and topped with a candle, it serves four persons together with three sets of lava stone.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/dong-ji-fried-kway-teow/:['A stall which has been a staple at Old Airport Road Food Centre since the late 1970s, Dong Ji Fried Kway Teow was under the radar for many decades, known only to regular customers until they were discovered by the media in 2009.Since then, the stall has been winning awards, thanks to “Uncle Teng’s” unique approach to char kway teow ($3/4).Unlike Singapore char kway teow which is predominantly Teochew-influenced and has a heavy dark soy sauce and fish sauce seasoning, Dong Ji’s char kway teow is light in its flavouring, almost bordering on being plain.There are subtle touches of dark soy sauce and fish sauce, while you taste more of the garlic and pork lard. Ask for chilli and there is a sheen of gritty lightly sour chilli.What you do get is more charring of the noodles and ingredients and that gives the dish a decent smokiness.That said, the ingredients, not the kway teow, is the spotlight here.A wide assortment of ingredients are thrown in and you can taste every individual ingredient — lap cheong, prawns, cockles, fishcakes, egg, bean sprouts and chives — thanks to the kway teow not being heavily flavoured.Each dish is made to order and Uncle Teng knows when to throw in which ingredient such that they come out nicely seared but never overcooked.\xa0Chilled prawns are thrown in first and they come nicely sweet, while cockles are thrown in last so that they retain that fresh blood cockle taste.Fishcakes and lap cheong pieces are chunkily cut so that when you bite into them, the flavour of each ingredient comes through distinctly.They used to add in squid rings but they have since omitted that in the last few years.Also, if you love cockles, come after 11am as the supplier only delivers it around that time.As of 2019, Uncle Teng fries in the morning, while his daughter takes over at lunchtime and for dinner time. Her version has less of a pork lard flavour, so request for more pork lard if you want a closer approximation of her father’s rendition.Also note that their portions are on the small side. You won’t feel full even if you ask for $4. However, request for a bigger portion of $5 and they will gladly oblige.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

Ye Ji serves very high quality Chinese economic rice dishes that have a very home-cooked feel to them.Originally street side hawkers in the 1960s, the stall was passed to the second generation daughter when the stall moved to Chinatown Complex in the 1970s.The stall was then sold off some two, three years ago to new owners but the food quality has been nicely maintained through the transition.\xa0Every dish here has a very high minimum standard whether it is something simple like fried chicken wings which are well-marinated with a nice crispness or like a basic stir fried cai xin vegetables which come fresh and are executed with a balanced savouriness and oil richness.The tofu they use in dishes have a fresh quality to them, with no hint of sourness and stir-fried dishes do not have a heavy greasy feeling to them.All the dishes are made in smaller-than-usual batches so that the food remains fresh. Peek at the back and you’ll often see a male cook constantly at his wok churning out dishes.Among the 30+ dishes on offer, you’ll find some unusual offerings like stir-fried chopped fish head in spicy black bean sauce, but what they excel in are really their standard staples.\xa0Dishes like their steamed egg offerings — one with minced meat and the other with salted egg — come with a silky soft egg texture and the minced meat soft to the bite as well. It also has a restrained saltiness, very welcome as the dish can sometimes come heavily salted in other stalls.Their steamed minced meat mixed with chopped tang cai, also comes juicy with a nice soft texture, thanks to sufficient pork fat mixed into the mince.Other highlights include the braised pig skin which has a nice melting soft texture and a great soy taste to the gravy. Also, a highlight was the steamed pork with chilli. It comes with nicely tender with a nice mix of pork fat richness, savouriness and spiciness.The other big highlight are their impressively large handmade tofu items with are overstuffed with fish paste. Vegetable slices — brinjal and bitter gourd — are sliced thick and a single order gets you two pieces. They have a selection of five to six varieties every day. Well worth the money.\xa0That said, there are a few general downsides ever since the new owners took over, noticeable to longtime customers who remember the stall well.The rice and dish portions used to be bigger and the prices not as inexpensive. Whereas the stall was firmly in the cheap and good category a few years ago, now it is simply good and priced a little higher relative to the other chap chye png stalls in the food centre.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

The curry was mildly spicy, thick and paired really nicely with the rice grains.The potatoes were well cooked, and the pork pieces blended well as well.The pork was tender and had soaked the flavour of the curry in. In contrast to the other dishes, this was surely tastier.The Christmas Meaty Bones’ Glazed Pork Ribs were fall off the bone tender. When eaten with the glaze sauce, it was satisfying.The Honey fried Chicken Wing was pretty delicious as the skin was crispy, had a hint of sweetness, and the meat inside was juicy.Though, for its price point, diners would probably expect a little more flavour.One of the sides on the menu is the Curly Fries, which you can get for $14 with any main dish or dessert.\nDessertsMoving on to the desserts, the Fossil Excavation Cake ($16) is a visual treat (perfect for Instagram).The sponge cake layer, which was the base of the dish was thin, which was unique.When paired with the milky cream atop, the massive amount of crushed Cocoa Biscuit and the Grape Red & White Ice Cream, the dessert will probably appeal more to those who have a sweet tooth.The version we were served had white ice-cream that was similar to vanilla flavour and did not have any hints of grape.They do have other desserts such as the Geologic Parfait ($16) which sounds like a fun dish to try.\xa0Is it worth going to?Before finishing up your dining trip, do take a look around their little merchandise booth perched at the front of the cafe.It has Lego sets, little keychains, sunglasses, plushies, pillows and other Jurassic World themed items for the fanatics among the crowd.Now for the most vital part – would we go to this much-anticipated cafe again?If you are looking for a dining option that offers value-for-money or where most of the menu items taste impeccable, then this will probably not float your boat.However, you are planning something out of the ordinary for the holidays or festive season, then Jurassic Cafe is worth considering.While we felt that some of the food might not be worth the trip and price point, some menu items hit the right notes, along with the\xa0merchandise, the impeccable view, and the Jurassic World experience.Do give it a try but you would have to make a reservation\xa0as they have limited seating spaces.For more information, contact the cafe directly at +65 8028 1489 or at enquiry@jurassicworldcafe.sgAuthor© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/jin-ji-mei-shi/:['An easily missed stall with no fancy signages and food award posters, Jin Ji Mei Shi sells some of the best handmade Teochew kuehs that you can buy even though the stallholder is not actually Teochew.Run by 60-year-old Irene Wang, a second-generation Hainanese hawker, the stall has been in business roughly 40 years but they actually started off selling chicken rice before switching over to Teochew kuehs as business wasn’t doing well.Based at Maxwell Food Centre, all the kuehs are handmade everyday by Irene herself and many of the popular items are sold out if you arrive there any later than 11am.Easily the most popular is the steamed yam cake (orh kueh; $2/3/6). Dried prawn bits and yam pieces are mixed with fried yam and shaped into a cake, then steamed. As it is priced on the lowish side, they don’t add more expensive ingredients like dried mushrooms, or coriander or sliced chilli as toppings.It doesn’t really matter as the base cake has a beautiful concentrated, thick, melting texture and the flavour is savoury and rich. The cake has just enough moisture such that it isn’t dry.\xa0The pumpkin cake ($2/3/6) isn’t as popular but will appeal to those who want lighter, more complex textures as the flour-based cake has shredded pumpkin, dried prawns and sliced black mushrooms in it. The added ingredients makes the cake a little lighter but still with a similar amount of oil-richness.Fried glutinous rice ($2) is also something they offer and It has a bouncy texture and the taste lightly savoury so that the flavours of the added ingredients of fried onions, black mushrooms and dried prawns comes through. More expensive versions of the dish come with added peanuts and spring onions.\xa0The soon kueh ($0.80; dumpling with a filling of shredded turnips, black mushrooms and dried prawns) is good but less in demand as good soon kueh sellers are more common. The skins are nicely thin but resilient and the filling has a nice concentrated stock flavour, the turnips cooked through but still firm.The accompanying sauces are a highlight on their own. The sweet sauce on the side has a smooth texture with hints of soybean and sesame seed flavour and a light sweetness — a breath of fresh air when compared to factory-made sweet sauces that come very sweet and over-flavoured. The potent spicy chilli is very oil-rich and has just a tinge of sourness to balance out the richness.\xa0Irene also sells suan pan zi ($2; Hakka abacus seeds) which is incredibly hard to get hold off as it is very often the first item to sell out at around 8am. It used to come traditionally shaped like an abacus semi-domed ball with the characteristic dip in the middle but now it comes in a basic cylindrical shape.The taste, however, isn’t compromised. With lots of thick, crunchy black fungus strips and large chunks of minced meat, the abacus seeds have a firm, chewy bite (less yam, more flour) and there is a big savoury fried garlic flavour to the dish. It used to come with black mushrooms but they have since omitted that from the dish.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/ah-ter-teochew-fish-ball-noodles/:['Pop round Amoy Street Food Centre and you’ll notice queues for this famous fishball noodle stall which sells one of the best fishball noodles ($4/5/6) in Singapore.The business was started by a Chinese migrant who made his living hand-making fishballs and in 1958, he started a fishball noodle stall at Maxwell Food Centre called “Asian Boar Fish Ball and Minced Meat Noodles” — translated literally.His son, Lim Ter Nee, helped his father out for a couple of years before taking over the reins.They relocated to their own coffeeshop in Bukit Merah in the 1980s but was forced to close it during the 1997 Asian financial crisis.After selling fishball noodles in various locations for a few years, the stall relocated to Amoy Street Food Centre in 2003 and was renamed “Ah Ter Teochew Fish Ball Noodles”, named after Lim himself.\xa0The business is now run by Lim’s son, Gilbert and he made quite a splash in the media after being voted one of the Most Handsome Hawkers by The Straits Times in 2005.As a result, this stall is covered by the media on a fairly regular basis but in this case, the stall’s reputation is truly well-deserved as every element in this bowl of fishball noodles is excellently done.\xa0The noodles have a nice firm bite and are dressed in a well-balanced sauce comprised of tomato ketchup, black vinegar, pork lard, fried onions and their special chilli sauce.The sambal chilli paste is of note because it is made with seven ingredients (dried shrimp, shrimp paste and onions being some of them) and is constantly stirred for six hours.\xa0The result is a saucing that is incredibly full-flavoured and bold — lard rich, sweet savouriness and a hint of sourness. Chopped parsley and sliced braised black mushrooms are also thrown on top as a final finish.They are also generous with the sauce as there is enough of it to go round — right down to your last spoonful of noodles.\xa0The other highlight is the large bowl of soup which has all the rest of the ingredients — a mix of fishballs, meatball, sliced fishcake, sliced pork, pork liver and a sprinkling of fried garlic on top.Even though the soup is fairly hot, the liver, pork slices and minced meat are still impressively tender and barely seared through.The soup itself is a highlight as it has a nice rounded stock-sweetness, thanks to the use of pork ribs and whole chickens as some of the soup’s many ingredients.\xa0At Amoy, “Ah Ter” takes the late evening/night shifts while his son, Gilbert runs the morning to early afternoon shifts.\nPreviously, we would have said that the version done by “Ah Ter” was better balanced but now both versions are equally good.The family opened a second outlet at Circular road in 2018 but it relocated to the Food Republic at 313 Somerset in 2020.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/goreng-pisang/:['Goreng pisang or pisang goreng? The answer is pisang goreng, which means fried banana. Grammatically, goreng pisang means to cook a banana.But the question that most of us are more concerned with is: Where can we find truly outstanding goreng pisang in Singapore? There are numerous stalls that sell this beloved local snack, but not all have mastered the secret of the perfect banana fritter. We know that a good goreng pisang must start with ripe pisang raja (it’s a local banana variety which means banana king in Malay), but the perfect batter is incredibly tricky to master.At the risk of trans fat overdose, we scoured the island and taste-tested five highly-acclaimed goreng pisang stalls. Here are our findings.\xa0Boon’s Pisang Goreng183 Upper Thomson Road, Longhouse Food JunctionOpening hours: Daily: 12pm-9pmPrice: Ranges from $0.70 to $1.10, depending on size of bananaRating: 5/5Our quest for the perfect goreng pisang ends here! From the banana down to the cooking time and temperature, Boon Pisang Goreng has nailed it. Whatever size banana you choose, the fruit is of the same sweetness and ripeness. It’s cooked till slightly soft, but still remains firm.But we were even more impressed with the batter. The fritter is of a light, golden hue, which suggests it was fried in relatively fresh oil. Taste-wise, it’s airy, thin and crisp, and has this melt-in-the-mouth quality. Best of all, it feels amazingly grease-free. You can easily polish off two pieces and not feel stuffed!\xa0Lee Kee#01-07, Bedok Interchange Food CentreOpening hours: Daily: 10.30am-10pmPrice: Ranges from $0.60 to $1.20, depending on size of bananaRating: 4.5/5Lee Kee’s goreng pisang came very close to getting full marks from us. We really enjoyed its thin and delicate batter, which stays crisp even when cold. It’s also not too oily, though not as grease-free as Boon’s.The bananas are also cooked to the right consistency – slightly mushy but still retaining some bite. However, we noticed that the smaller bananas tend to be sweeter than the larger ones. Bigger isn’t always better!\xa0Lim Kee (Orchard) Banana Fritters#01-61 Maxwell Food CentreOpening hours: Daily: 11am-8pmPrice: $1.20Rating: 3.5/5Older folks would remember Lim Kee as the famous goreng pisang stall at Somerset Road. With such a long history, we had high expectations for the banana fritter. From its looks, we were certainly impressed. They use huge, jumbo-sized bananas. However, we wished the stall was more consistent with the quality of the fruit. This time round, the banana wasn’t ripe enough. Also, the fruit was too firm, which means it wasn’t sufficiently cooked to release its natural sugars.Although the batter had a slight hint of alkaline, it was wonderfully crisp and paper-thin. If a sweeter banana had been used, this would have been a killer goreng pisang.\xa0Sow Mount #01-14, Clementi Food CentreOpening hours: Daily: 9am-6pmPrice: $1 for two piecesRating: 3/5Sold at $1.00 for two small pieces, Snow Mount’s goreng pisang is the most competitively priced. The stall only offers pisang raja of the small variety. The banana was intensely sweet and fragrant. The crispy batter reminded us of tempura, but its texture was more lattice-like. It would have been rather enjoyable, but unfortunately, the batter was too thick and too greasy.*Clementi Food Centre is closed for upgrading, and will re-open in November 2010.\xa0Toa Payoh Lucky Pisang RajaBlk 177 Toa Payoh Central#01-176Opening hours: Daily: 1pm – 10pmPrice: $0.90Rating: 2.5/5Although the banana was sweet, ripe, and sufficiently cooked, its batter was a letdown. It was quite heavy, and tasted very strongly of alkaline. Also, the batter had a mild rancid oil taste. In the end, we simply removed the batter and enjoyed the banana on its own.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/china-street-cooked-food/:['One of the original hawkers of Maxwell Food Centre\xa0who shifted from China Street,\xa0China Street Cooked Food\xa0has periodically been featured in the media because they sell a dish that is practically impossible to find in Singapore anymore: la che mian (rickshaw noodles).\xa0The stall started operations along the streetside at China Street in 1943 before shifting to Maxwell Food Centre in 1978 and it is now run by second-generation owner 71-year-old Soh Pho Tee.Their signature dish, rickshaw noodles ($1-1.50) was popular with rickshaw pullers during the early days of Singapore. The dish consists of thick Hokkien-style yellow noodles served in a light dried shrimp and vegetable stock broth with fried onions and green vegetable stands.The noodles and vegetables are stewed to an extremely soft consistency, to the point where there is virtually no texture left. The upside is that the broth is made richer as a result. It has a lovely round, savoury stock flavour that tastes comfortingly homemade. The fried onions on top adds a different flavour so that it’s not the same flavour throughout.\xa0They also sell another relatively hard to find dish: a stripped-down version of Hokkien mee sua ($1-1.50; wheat noodles), minus the shredded chicken, ginger and boiled egg. The broth has a delicate savouriness, but there are more condiments as compared to the rickshaw noodles — spring onions, dried mushroom, dried shrimp which lend its flavours to the stock.As people tend to order the rickshaw noodles, their other Chinese breakfast staples tend to get overshadowed which shouldn’t be the case as this stall is actually one of the few places that do a good economic beehoon (fried staples with a wide selection of fried items like canned sausages, fishcake and the like).\xa0They have added a few enhancements to make it a few notches above what you averagely get.\xa0First is the homemade ngoh hiang, an item which is not commonly offered in many economic bee hoon or ngoh hiang stalls. Even though the are small in size, each piece is filled with meat, bits of pork fat and minimal fillers, it is pure savouriness, pork fat richness with a hint of sweetness in the taste.\xa0The other fried items ($0.20 to $0.80) are factory-made but there are certain items — like the hard tofu and canned sausages — which are only fried when an order is placed, so that it is fresh and crispy when you tuck into it.Besides the standard fried yellow noodles and bee hoon, they also offer fried thin kway teow which is fairly unusual and there is a surprising amount of oil-richness and savoury flavour. If you eat alot of economic beehoon, you’ll know that the extra flavour is a big plus as the fried staples usually come quite bland.The other highlight are their chilli sauces. It has a rough texture with real chilli bits and there are two pots to choose from: sweet and sour. Pick your fancy or mix the two for a more balanced sweet/sour taste.Alas, they don’t offer fried chicken wings. A shame as it would be the perfect economic beehoon stall in town.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/ghim-moh-chwee-kueh/:['One of the more famous stalls at Ghim Moh, this 61-year-old stall serves a chwee kueh (Teochew for steamed ‘water’ cake) which you’ll either love or hate.Unlike the sweet savoury chai po\xa0(preserved turnip) topping that dominates chwee kueh\xa0stalls in Singapore, the topping here has very very little sugar — as per what they claim is the traditional recipe.The highlight at this stall is that the chye poh mixture is cooked using pork lard, an ingredient which is virtually impossible to find in chwee kueh.It gives off a great full pork oil richness and aroma and almost all current chwee kueh offerings aren’t made with it these days.\xa0The flavours you get are primarily salt, with hints of garlic and pork lard. Simple but extremely flavourful thanks to the use of pork lard.The chai po mixture is saltier as compared to other stalls, which is why you’ll notice that they’ll put on less topping as compared to other stalls, because any more and it’ll be too salty to handle.That said, chew on the chai po a little more and you’ll taste the underlying sweetness in the chai po once the salt is stripped away.\nUnfortunately because of the lesser amounts of chai po topping, it has led to some people complaining on the internet about how stingy the chai po amounts are at this stall.As for the sambal chilli, it is uncompromisingly made: add some in and you’ll detect the spiciness, the flavour of chilli pepper, a bit of sourness to cut through the oil-richness and that’s it.There are no other added flavours that other stalls use like savoury dried shrimp to distract you (or enhance, depending on how you look at it) from the dish ($2 for four and upwards).The kueh is handmade on a small scale daily by proprietor Lee Sah Bah, 71, who has been in the business since he was eight-years-old.His parents had been street hawkers selling chwee kueh in the Queenstown area. Back then, he and his six siblings used to help out at the stall and the family business moved into Ghim Moh Market and Food Centre when it was completed in 1978.Sah Bah took over the family business when his parents retired.He works at the stall with his wife and children and they use roughly 1,500 aluminium molds to handmake their kueh.The kueh has a firm yet soft, melting texture but the consequence of it being handmade is that\xa0their chwee kuehs\xa0are a little pricier as compared to the competition.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

It might sound like something of a fantasy — we know the difficulty of hunting down dining spots that open during the wee hours of the night, much less Japanese dining spots that cater to the nocturnal crowd.Thankfully, The Ramen House has been providing much-needed night-time fuel for the “cannot eat, cannot sleep” insomniacs out there. It operates from 5pm to 6am on weekdays, and noon to 6am on weekends, ensuring that those hit with late-night hunger pangs can get in a delicious, hearty meal in an accessible location.Diners who love Japanese food will be spoilt for choice: The Ramen House offers more than 100 Japanese dishes, some of which have been given a local twist to better suit customers’ palates.While the phrase “supper place” conjures up the image of many a night market or hawker stall, few supper spots offer you the luxury of dining in an air-conditioned environment. Enter The Ramen House, which, for those who prefer not to be enveloped in smokiness and perspiration by the end of their late night perk-me-up, makes for an ideal, comfortable option.And no, you don’t have to settle for stale leftovers just because it’s possibly your final meal of the day. Treat yourself to an exquisite bowl of ramen bathed in a bowl of broth boiled free from MSG, salt or sugar.\n\xa0The Ramen House’s ramen broth is of the lighter variety – but this doesn’t mean theirs is bland. The broth is made from ingredients like chicken meat, feet and bones, as well as spring onions and mushrooms. It is cooked under high heat for more than thirty hours, till the bone marrow dissolves, imbuing the broth with flavour. This is why their ramen soup, while light, isn’t anaemic on taste and aroma.\xa0\xa0They carry a wide range of ramen, including Vegetable Ramen (vegetarian option) and the Beef Ramen. But their signature and the one that they are most recognised for is the Volcano Ramen.Perfect for those with more adventurous taste buds, the Volcano Ramen delivers a spicy kick. The dish’s “red-hot lava” is made from red chilli and dried Indian chilli padi — loads of ‘em — and the spiciness can be customised to three different levels, but regardless, its feistiness is sure to put fire in your belly.And while ramen will always be the restaurant’s signature, The Ramen House is also a one-stop destination for terrific Japanese cuisine. Their extensive menu encompasses everything from ramen and kushiyaki to sashimi and sushi. \xa0If it’s just light bites you are after, opt for the appetisers, which includes chicken or seafood gyoza ($6.90), Chawanmushi ($3.90), or Deep Fried Salmon Skin ($6.90).Sushi lovers can go for the Salmon Maki ($12.90), Futomaki ($9.90), or the assorted sushi platter ($14.90).Those in need of a protein fix can feast on staples like Salmon Sashimi ($9.90), Salmon Belly Sashimi ($12.90), Tuna Sashimi ($9.90), or Mekajiki Sashimi ($12.90).\xa0Forget about those sloppy seconds from the meal the day before.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/marigold/:['Find out the goodness that goes into your MARIGOLD HL Milk. This article is brought to you by MARIGOLD HL Milk. While most people are concerned with taking care of their families’ health and wellbeing, many of them overlook the importance of working milk into their families’ diets as a nutritious health supplement.Ageing is a natural process we cannot escape, try as we might, and with it come the problems of decreased bone density and reduced muscle mass and strength. It occurs even among the younger set and these problems may affect simple daily activities we take for granted now.Drinking milk regularly, however, may significantly delay the onset of these problems and relieve the symptoms. And what better time to have it than at breakfast to start the day.Choose\xa0Singapore’s #1 selling low-fat milk, MARIGOLD\xa0HL Milk, which\xa0is 99-per-cent fat-free, and 74 per cent lower in fat content than regular milk.In addition, MARIGOLD\xa0HL Milk has a unique BonePlus formula consisting of vitamins K & D to specially help calcium absorption and improve bone strength, delivering the full benefits of calcium to our bodies to jumpstart our day, without the unwanted extra calories and saturated fats.Hence, it is no surprise that MARIGOLD\xa0HL Milk’s winning balanced formula has been recognised by Singapore’s Health Promotion Board and awarded The Healthier Choice.We have put together three ways for you to enjoy your milk in the morning apart from drinking it plain from your mug.\n\xa01. Overnight Oats – Make breakfast at nightIf mornings are a rush for you, prepare overnight oats ahead as a simple, time-saving yet yummy solution. It is so easy to make the night before, put it in the fridge, and it will be ready for consumption when you wake up the next morning.Simply mix rolled oats with MARIGOLD\xa0HL Milk, and add a sweetener of your choice, such as honey. This forms the base for any kind of overnight oats you wish to make. For variety, add fresh fruits and cinnamon for extra nutrition and flavour. You may also switch around with the wide range of flavours MARIGOLD\xa0HL Milk offers in making the oat base. The original MARIGOLD\xa0HL Milk will go perfectly with some fresh strawberries atop the oats, while oats soaked in the chocolate MARIGOLD\xa0HL Milk would be a winner when paired with some banana slices. Experiment and find out what combinations work best with each flavour of MARIGOLD\xa0HL Milk.\xa02. Milk and cookies: A childhood favourite for all agesMilk and cookies are a match made in comfort-food heaven. For days when you are feeling up for a little sweet start to the day, dip some cookies into a glass of MARIGOLD\xa0HL Milk, and you will still get\xa0the vitamins and minerals that you need from the milk.Dip flavoured cookies like chocolate chipped ones into the original MARIGOLD\xa0HL Milk, or dunk plain butter cookies into a cold glass of chocolate, strawberry, or banana flavoured ones. It is also a great way to get the children in your family to start drinking milk at an early age.MARIGOLD\xa0HL Milk is also low in lactose, so even the lactose-intolerant may give it a try.\xa03. Smoothie: One for active family membersMARIGOLD\xa0HL Milk is perfect for those who like to work out in the morning. It is recommended for adults with an active lifestyle since it is high in protein, which helps to repair body tissues.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/central-perk-singapore/:['The balloon you see up there? It’s actually a dessert.Yeah, this ‘balloon’ is actually edible, and no, it’s not actually balloon.Friends-themed cafe Central Perk Singapore has launched the edible balloon, a dessert that was first offered at three-Michelin-starred restaurant Alinea. Janice Wong’s 2am : dessertbar also offered something similar before.\xa0As with most of the dishes at Central Perk Singapore, the edible balloon is inspired by an episode from the sitcom, in which a character is holding a balloon with his mouth in his sleep.The edible balloon is made by pumping helium into a special warmed-up candy mix, which, according to the Central Perk founders, is a “secret recipe” (but of course!).The balloon comes in three flavours: strawberry (red), banana\xa0(yellow) and blueberry (blue), and these edible balloons each come attached to a chocolate stick (or a plain straw if you want). Regardless of which one you go for, they all taste pretty much like, well, candy – no weird flavours that will take you by surprise.But the real appeal of this dessert is its fun factor, which we feel fits the playful vibe of Central Perks Singapore perfectly; once you burst the balloon and suck in the helium, you’ll be able to speak in a nasal “chipmunk voice” for a few seconds.And it’s novel to see the dessert being made live before your very eyes.The edible balloon comes with deconstructed nutella cake ($16 for the whole dessert), which comprises\xa0nutella sponge, \xa0chocolate syrup, and a scoop of frozen yoghurt; the yoghurt’s tartness helps cut through the richness of the other ingredients.Beware: the eating part can be very messy, and two of my colleagues, a little uncertain about how to proceed with eating the dessert, came too close to the balloon and had some of it stuck on their hair. But that actually helped make the whole experience more fun for them.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/tekka-market/:['A familiar sight at the vibrant and colourful enclave of Little India, the re-opening of the new Tekka market comes just in time for the year-end Deepavali celebrations. Slated for renovation under the National Environment Agency’s (NEA) Hawker Centres Upgrading Programme (HUP), Tekka market was closed in 2008 and refurbished to the tune of $10 million.Iconic landmark in Little India\nTekka market was originally known as Tek Kia Kha, meaning “foot of the small bamboos” in Hokkien. This was in reference to the numerous bamboo plants that once grew along the banks of the Rochor Canal. The original Tekka market was built back in the early 20th century, before it was relocated in the early 1980s to its present site across Buffalo Road.Today, Tekka market is arguably Singapore’s largest indoor wet market and boasts an incredible array of seafood, meat and fresh produce including herbs such as fresh dill, lush roma tomatoes and char grilled artichokes, seldom found elsewhere.Split into two levels, the ground floor houses the wet market and food centre, while the second level is filled with sundry shops, tailors and textile merchants.“The food here is very fresh, especially the meat and vegetables,” says Ho Cho Wah, 57, a housewife. “I come here in the morning for breakfast then pick up some meat and herbs before heading home.”With dozens of Indian, Chinese and Muslim hawker stalls serving up a smorgasbord of delightful local fare, it is no wonder then that local foodies and chefs alike descend upon Tekka market for a tasty meal and some of the freshest produce in town.Moving with the times\nUnlike other upgraded markets that sport spanking new facades, Tekka market still retains its original structure, with improvements focused instead on its interior design and amenities. Regulars have given their nod of approval to renovation works and have lauded the marked improvement in cleanliness and layout of the market.“I like the new market better. Now it’s cleaner and more spacious,” says Lakshimi. “I used to come once every two months but more so now because Deepavali is coming,” said the 27 year-old housewife.Indeed, with a new escalator, better wall and floor tiles as well as more elderly and handicap-friendly features, visitors to Tekka market can expect a more pleasant and refreshing environment to shop and eat. Tan Chin Hean, a retiree who goes to the market every week for prata welcomes the change. “The new place is very well-organised and a lot more airy now, I like it!” says the 75 year-old.Changes to the market layout have also been made to create more spacious walkways for customers doing groceries. “In the past, aisles were cramped with boxes and other items from various stallholders,” says CJ Low, who sells fresh beef at the market.“Now it’s easier to do business because there is more space for people to walk around and look at things they want to buy,” says the 64 year-old stallholder.Despite all the renovation and upgrades, however, bad traffic and limited parking lots still remain a problem at the new Tekka market, much to the disappointment of most stallholders.“The new market is cleaner and bigger,” says Mrs Ong, whose family runs a fruit stall. “But there are less people because of little parking space available.”Stallholders have already voiced their opinions to the committee in charge of Tekka market, in hope of finding a solution to the perennial parking problem. In the meantime, however, some stallholders have decided to take a more hands-on approach.“The parking situation is pretty bad, especially in the morning” says CJ. “Sometimes my customers call in advance to place orders and my staff run out to hand them their stuff so they don’t have to wait for a lot.”\xa0M.A. Osman- Premium Grade Air-flown Goat Meat\nStall no #01-130\n A familiar face at Tekka market, Ali Sabry has been in this business for over 25 years, taking over the reigns from his father. M.A. Oman sells premium grade goat meat air-flown straight from Australia and is easily one of the most popular stalls in Tekka market, judging by the crowds at his stall in the mornings.His customers are mainly locals, although he does get the occasional expatriate. Ali, who often works from the wee hours of the morning till early evening says he is appreciative of the recent upgrading, sharing that he is now in a better location than before and that his customers have more space to do their shopping.Chee Boon & Son Fruits Paradise\nStall no: #01-152/153\nLike most stalls at Tekka market, Chee Boon & Son is a family-run business that has been around for the past 40 years. Owners Roy Tan and Khee Hong are warm and friendly, evident by the number of regulars who stop by for a chat while buying groceries.\xa0 The corner fruit stall carries a wide variety of fruit, ranging from Taiwan mangoes and muskmelons to Japanese peaches and grapes.“We are different from your usual fruit stalls because we don’t order our fruit from just one wholesaler. We go to various wholesalers around Singapore daily to select the best fruit for our customers,” says Khee Hong.Allauddin’s Briyani\nStall no: #01-232 \nIf you’re a fan of briyani, then you should definitely make a trip down to Allauddin’s Briyani at Tekka market. Popular among local foodies and bloggers, Allauddin’s Briyani has been serving up this tasty dish for over three decades. Passed down from generation to generation, Alluddin’s Briyani offers customers fish, chicken and mutton briyani, as well as special combo meals with added drinks.“We’re the first hawker to sell combo meals,” says Mohamed who explained that the idea started at a meeting with the CEO of Coca Cola Singapore. Ever the enterprising businessman, he struck up a good deal with the internationally recognised beverage company and has not looked back since.Business is brisk at the stall, with long queues forming from as early as 11am. In addition to briyani, Mohamed also has two other stalls under the famous Allauddin name selling chapatti and drinks.Chia’s Vegetables Supply\nStall no: #01-129\nFollow the sounds of soothing jazz music and chances are you’ll find yourself at Chia’s Vegetables Supply and in the lovely company of Victor Chia. Started 16 years ago by his grandfather, Chia’s Vegetables Supply has grown in popularity in part due to the fresh and unique supply of herbs and vegetables not usually found in most wet markets.Customers to Chia’s Vegetables Supply are from all walks of life, with an equal mix of locals and expatriates so it is no surprise to find French homemakers or Italian chefs coming by to buy herbs and produce. Not one to rest on his laurels, Victor has already brought in new items for sale, such as char grilled artichokes, green Sicilian olives and calamata, to tie-in with the re-opening of the market.“The new market is awesome,” he says. “It has lost some of its traditional feel but it is more spacious and things are more organised.”Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

You may remember celebrating the occasion at home last year with takeaways or home-cooked food, since there were no restaurant dine-ins during the Circuit Breaker.This year, you may want to consider upping the ante for both Mother’s and Father’s Day, now that restaurant dine-ins are back. Chinese restaurant group Crystal Jade is pulling all the stops with the launch of its Parent’s Day menu: a lineup of dishes that were curated with one’s parents in mind.The promotion, which runs from 29 April to 30 June, will see all of the restaurant chains under the Crystal Jade brand feature a special Parent’s Day menu, and each chain will have a number of dishes that are exclusive to them. Scallops are the running theme for this year’s Parent’s Day dishes, so expect this seafood favourite to feature across all menus.\xa0HungryGoWhere was invited to try some of the highlights from the various menus. Here’s what we sampled:Steamed emerald jade scallop & seafood dumpling$8.80 for 3pcs; from Crystal Jade La Mian Xiao Long Bao and Crystal Jade Jiang NanThese gorgeously sculpted dumplings caught our eye with their emerald green skins, all adorned with the glistening golds and oranges of the shredded fried conpoy and fish roe. Biting into it releases chunks of juicy scallops which were fresh and tender, and had a mild sweetness to its delectable taste. If Mum or Dad is a fan of dumplings, this is a must-try.\xa0Braised Irish duck in Teochew style$108 whole, $55 half, $32 regular; from Crystal Jade Golden PalaceParents who like this classic dish will love Crystal Jade Golden Palace’s luxe rendition of the Teochew braised duck. Each slice was meaty with the right amount of fat, and really tender as well. Its delicate taste brought to life with its proprietary spiced braising liquid.\xa0Crispy Tiger King prawn coated with cereal and pumpkin sauce$38 (regular size); from Crystal Jade Dining IN\nAt first glance, we thought these were salted egg prawns, and were surprised to learn that the golden yellow sauce was made from pumpkin. The result is a very delightful dish that is a balanced mix of sweet and savoury flavours. Every prawn was fresh and juicy, with a well-fried coat of crisp, and the pumpkin purée that added a hint of natural sweetness to it.\n\xa0Colourful scallop and jackfruit rolls$20.80 (regular size), from Crystal Jade Hong Kong KitchenLooking for something inventive and artful?

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/hainanese-pork-chop/:['Hainanese pork chop – a distinctly localised Westernised dish – has its roots in English pork chops with apple sauce, but resembles nothing like the original version. The talented Hainanese cooks, who were employed by the colonial British, put their own spin on this English dish and came up with their own unique version.How do you recognise an authentic Hainanese pork chop? The first sign is the use of crushed cream crackers for the coating of the pork chop. Other features include fried potato slices, peas, and sweet-tangy onion-based gravy.We visited five old-time Hainanese eating establishments for this taste test. Which one serves the best Hainanese pork chops?\xa0Yet Con Chicken Rice & Restaurant EDITOR’S PICK!\n25 Purvis Street\nOpening hours: Daily: 11am-9:30pm\nPrice: $10.00\nRating: 5/5Our search for the holy grail of Hainanese pork chop ends here! Yet Con’s version is both authentic and flawlessly executed.Pounded till neither too thin nor too thick, the pork is super tender with a lovely bite. The meat is tastily marinated, yet not too salty. Fragrant and delicate, the crust is made from old-fashioned crushed cream crackers. Beneath the pork chop slices are fried potato slices.What stands out most is the sauce for the chops. Simmered from scratch, this is the authentic brown gravy flavoured with HP steak sauce. One can also detect a gentle kiss of ginger as well as the sweetness of onion. Sweet, tangy and savoury – the gravy is robust, complex and perfectly balanced. The consistency is also just right.Yet Con’s Hainanese pork chop may not score high in the looks department. But make no mistake, this is the real deal!\xa0Golden Mile Thien Kee Steamboat Restaurant\n6001 Beach Road, #B1-20 Golden Mile Tower\nOpening hours: Daily: 11am-9:30pm\nPrice: $10.00\nRating: 4/5Thick and meaty, Thien Kee’s Hainanese pork chop is hearty and rustic.Although the pork chop is quite thick, the meat is surprisingly tender and moist. The crust is also rather thick and crunchy, which prevents it from getting soggy too quickly in the sauce.With a rich tomato base, the sauce has a strong presence of garlic and onion. We like its bold flavours, but the texture is too starchy for our preference. Despite that, Thien Kee’s Hainanese pork chop remains one of the better versions we’ve tried and tested.\xa0Prince Coffee House\n249 Beach Road\nOpening hours: Daily: 11am-9pm\nPrice: $6.80++ for one person rice set\nRating: 3.5/5Prince’s rendition doesn’t look as traditional as Yet Con’s, but it is still a more than decent Hainanese pork chop.Juicy on the inside and lightly crisp on the outside, the pork cutlet is easy to the bite. We suspect the meat may have had some help from tenderiser.Intense in flavour with bold tartness, the bright red sauce is ketchup-based. A generous amount of sautéed onions add aroma and sweetness. Mixed veggies and fries make up the rest of this not-so-authentic but appealing dish.\xa0YY Kafei Dian BEST VALUE\n37 Beach Road, #01-01\nOpening hours: Daily: 8am – 10:30pm\nPrice: $6.00\nRating: 3.5/5YY Kafei Dian’s pork chop dish looks more Western than Hainanese in presentation. It is composed of just three elements – pork chop, crinkle-cut fries, and tomato sauce – but each one is nicely executed.What we were most impressed with was the pork chop. They use pork loin with some fat. The meat is deliciously juicy with good bite. Evenly coated, the crust is beautifully thin and crispy, though a little greasy. The sliced pork chop is carefully propped up so that it doesn’t get soggy from the sauce.Intensely sweet and rich, the ‘ketchupy’ sauce has a hint of chilli. It goes well with the pork chop and crispy fries. Although YY Kafei Dian’s Hainanese pork chop is quite different from the classic version, it is very likeable.\xa0Chin Chin Eating House\n19 Purvis Street\nOpening hours: Daily: 11am – 9pm\nPrice: $6.00\nRating: 2/5Chin Chin’s version has all the elements of a classic Hainanese pork chop, but it is extremely lacking in execution.Coated in cream cracker crumbs, the crust is disappointing soggy. The meat itself is dry and stringy. As for the tomato sauce, it is rather bland and lacks a distinctive identity.The pork chop is served with fried potato pieces and canned peas. Although the presentation is old-school, this is one Hainanese pork chop that fails to appeal.inSing.com made anonymous visits and paid its own meals at the eateries featured here.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

In Singapore, jicama is also known as ‘bengkoang’, and it can be found in local hawker dishes like\xa0popiah, rojak and kueh pie tee.Predictions are swirling that jicama will soon take an honorary place alongside carrots and kale.Jicama, like Jerusalem artichokes, is a source of inulin, a prebiotic that can promote the growth of beneficial bacteria in the gut. Munching on jicama might also boost the look of your skin, thanks to its vitamin C content (one cup of raw jicama slices provides more than 24mg of vitamin C). Eating vitamin C-rich foods can increase collagen production, which can help improve skin texture, speed wound healing, and give you a healthy glow.Still, The Livestrong Foundation, a US non-profit organisation that provides support for people affected by cancer, warns that while jicama root is healthy and completely edible, the rest of the plant is toxic, including the seeds, leaves, and pods.Use this superfood in an easy, Peranakan-Hokkien Popiah recipe.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

Now\xa0flame-grilled beef cubes, a popular street snack in Taiwan, has made its sizzling-hot debut in Singapore, and already people are rushing to get their fix of it.Huoyanshaiziniu (it means “flamed, diced beef cubes” in Mandarin), a takeaway stall located at basement two of Plaza Singapura, is the first concept to offer the street snack here.Started by two friends,\xa0Sean Lee, 23, and Cheo Tian Feng, 21, Huoyanshaiziniu will\xa0serve beef steak cubes that are first cooked over a teppan grill, then torched, and then seasoned.\xa0Huoyanshaiziniu offers three different seasonings for its beef cubes: garlic, seaweed, yakitori. The type of beef used is Australian Angus rib-eye, which Cheo says was decided on after extensive kitchen testing for its rich beefy flavour.The beef cubes are priced at $6.90 for 130g (for all three flavours), and are served in Chinese takeaway-type boxes. The portion is adequate enough to be a meal on its own, at least to small eaters.\xa0Make sure to mix the seasoning and beef cubes well, since they don’t do that for you.\xa0The beef cubes that I had were succulent and flavourful, though not particularly smoky, and I would have preferred them more charred. I think the garlic seasoning is the safest choice if you don’t know what to order, though the seaweed seasoning adds a different layer of flavour to the meat and also melds well with the beefy flavour.\xa0The yakitori sauce ain’t bad too, but tasted a bit too strong, at times even overpowering the beefiness of the cubed meats.If you really like the savoury-sweet yakitori sauce, a good choice is to top up and go for the rice box ($8), so you can have your beef with rice and use the latter to soak up the sauce.\xa0Even though these beef cubes are all packed in takeaway boxes, I recommend eating them ASAP because they dry up very quickly.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

Which puff has got the most power?

A swirling tower of durian cream is sandwiched between two delicate choux shells. Even after thawing, the filling keeps its structure and rich flavour. The pastry remains ethereally light and crisp.Smooth and airy, the filling is a good balance of cream and fruit, with bits of D24 durian pulp. Though some of us prefer a stronger durian presence, overall, the filling is sufficiently robust with a pleasant sweetness and natural durian flavour.Though pricier than the rest, this elegant puff is truly in a league of its own. If you’re looking to impress someone, Goodwood Park’s signature puff is guaranteed to please even the most finicky durian puff aficionado.\xa0Emicakes BEST VALUE\n68 Orchard Road, #B2-04 Plaza Singapura\xa0Opening hours: Daily: 10am-10pm\xa0Price: Ultimate D24 Puffs ($7.00 for 4 pieces), Classic D24 Puffs ($7.00 for 12 mini puffs)\xa0Rating: 4/5At Emicakes, they offer not one, but three kinds of filling for their D24 durian puff range: Classic, Premium, and Ultimate. Classic has a higher ratio of whipped cream than durian, Ultimate is 100% durian, and Premium is in between.For those who just want a hint of durian flavour, the Classic range—available only in mini puffs—is the ideal choice. These bite-sized pastries are perfect for popping into the mouth. Smooth, creamy and amply filled, these petite puffs are rather more-ish.Durian lovers should go straight for the Ultimate version. Each palm-sized puff is fat and bursting with pure D24 durian flesh. Mind-blowingly intense and filling, this is as close as it gets to eating the actual fruit.There are just a couple of downsides. One: When the frozen puffs are thawed, the filling tastes slightly watery due to melted ice particles. Two: The choux pastry is slightly on the dry side. If you can look past these minor flaws, then Emicakes’ Ultimate puff is great value if what you want is thick and pure durian pulp.\xa0\xa0Durian Mpire by 717 Trading230 Victoria Street, #B1-K26 Bugis Junction\xa0Opening hours: Daily: 10am-10pm\xa0Price: $4.80 for 6 pieces\xa0Rating: 3.5/5Durian Mpire is the confectionery arm of durian wholesaler 717 Trading.We were pleasantly surprised by this dark horse. Most impressive is the pastry. The choux shells have a lovely moist and tender texture, with subtly crisp exterior. The durian filling is rich and fragrant with a buttery smoothness. It seems that the filling has been slightly sweetened, but the end result is very likeable.Both the pastry and filling complement each other nicely, with a good pastry-to-filling ratio. Each puff is about two bites worth. Overall, this is a reasonably-priced, solid all-rounder.\xa0Puteri Mas475 Joo Chiat Road\xa0Opening hours: Mon: 12pm-5pm, Tue-Sun: 9am-7pm\xa0Price: $11.80 for 20 mini puffs\xa0Rating: 3/5Another household name when it comes to durian puffs, Puteri Mas’s version is old-school in style.The pastry is tender, spongy and rather thick. Occasionally, it suffers from slight dryness. The filling—made from 100% durian pulp—is pleasantly creamy and rich. A more generous amount of filling would certainly up the satisfaction level here.Overall, Puteri Mas’s puffs are easy to eat and easy to like. Those who prefer more pastry than durian will enjoy this, but those looking for thick filling will be disappointed.\xa0\xa0Four Seasons Durians391 Orchard Road, #B2 Takashimaya Food Hall\xa0Opening hours: Daily: 10am-9.30pm\xa0Price: $3.90 for 4 pieces\xa0Rating: 2.5/5The choux shells are commendably thin and light. Unfortunately, they’re on the dry side. Each puff is filled with unsweetened, 100% durian pulp. The filling tastes natural, however the flavour is a bit thin, mild, and slightly watery. The ratio of pastry to filling is decent, but most of us thought that these puffs are pricey for their size and taste.\xa0inSing.com made anonymous visits and paid its own meals at the places featured here.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

If you haven’t then you’ll get the chance to learn a lot more about him from next February.Joel Robuchon is the world’s most decorated chef by the iconic Michelin review guides, with a cool 26 stars to his name and he is now bringing his exquisite cuisine to Singapore.He’s announced that he is opening two restaurants at Resorts World Sentosa (RWS) next February – Joel Robuchon Restaurant and L’ Atelier de Joel. Both restaurants will be located at Hotel Michael, which primarily targets business travelers. The opening date for a third eatery The Pastry Shop and Lounge will be announced later.Recognised by many to be the most influential French chef of his generation, Joel Robuchon has 21 restaurants spanning 10 countries. He is famous for his influence on French cuisine – moving away from the richness of traditional cooking methods (think heavy sauces) to a more simple approach that emphasises the natural flavours of good quality ingredients. In fact one of his signature dishes is the humble potato mash (half potato, half butter!). It is said to be so delicious that customers have been known to order it both as a side dish and a dessert.The 45-seater Joel Robuchon Restaurant will serve French haute cuisine (and is pretty pricey). This will be his fourth signature restaurant in Asia. The other three are located in Hong Kong, Tokyo and Macau.For diners who prefer a more casual dining experience, L’Atelier will feature chefs in a central kitchen with diners seated at a counter from which they can see their food being prepared. Chef Robuchon was inspired by Japanese sushi bars and Spanish tapas restaurants. The Hong Kong outlet of this eatery was picked as the best restaurant in Asia in 2010 by the Miele Guide.Chef Robuchon says diners in Singapore can expect the same world class food and service experienced in his award winning restaurants overseas. To deliver on this promise, he has hand-picked nine of his best staff to run his restaurants in Singapore. One of them is Japanese Chef Tomonori Danzaki who has worked with Chef Robuchon for more than 10 years. He will be the executive chef at Joel Robuchon Restaurant.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/best-bean-curds/:['Foodies in Singapore sure love their dou hua (Mandarin for ‘soy bean curd dessert’) or tau huay (the same dessert, in Hokkien). Almost two years since the bean curd craze first began, the demand for this new version of the traditional dessert is still going strong. Almost one year down the road, we do another round up of the best bean curds in Singapore, this time venturing out of Old Airport Road Food Centre. Long queues continue to form at established vendors\xa0— and new players are still starting up shop to try and jump onto the bandwagon. Lucky for us, we still get to reap the benefits\xa0— here’s a round-up of five of our best in the entire Lion City:51 Soya Bean\nBest for its variety of flavours\nStarted by Wang Wang Crispy Curry Puff, the taste of 51 Soya Bean’s soy bean curd (from $1.50 a tub) is the closest to neighbour Lao Ban Soya Bean’s (see below) version. It is sweet, smooth and pillowy, though slightly firmer and grainier. Still, queues followed and it’s also built up its own following. While many of the soy bean curd stalls concentrate on plain soy bean curd and may offer a mere additional almond-flavoured version, 51 majors in experimenting with flavours. We tried its mango soy bean curd ($2.50 a tub), which went down a treat despite the slightly artificial tasting mango flavour. It reminded us of a gentler, silkier mango pudding which would fit right in to dim sum restaurants. There is also a strawberry version ($2.50 a tub) and not too long ago, durian, which may make a return appearance.51 Soya Bean | Address: #01-72/#01-125 Old Airport Road Hawker Centre,\xa051 Old Airport Road  | Tel: 90907009 | Opening hours: Daily 9am–10pm\xa0Bean Singapore\nMost innovative toppings\nLaunched late last year, this relative newbie situated a few stalls down from Lao Ban at Maxwell Food Centre is popular for its creative toppings. Definitely something new in the friendly bean curd war, many of its flavoured soy bean curd creations (made with organic soy beans) are paired with toppings such as dark chocolate cream or matcha powder. Its plain bean curd ($1.50 a tub) is smooth, silky and not too sweet\xa0— a good introduction to the rest of the flavours. One of the more popular choices is the mocha bean curd ($2.50 a tub)\xa0— the coffee aroma has a tinge of toffee and butterscotch which hits first. It then evolves into a subtle soy bean taste which isn’t too cloying. Overall, this stall is a must-visit. You can also bypass the lines by ordering via SMS. Orders must be collected within 30 minutes.Bean Singapore | Address: #01-86 Maxwell Food Centre,\xa01 Kadayayanallur Street | Tel: 84187418, SMS only | Opening hours: Daily 10am–late, or until stocks run out\xa0Lao Ban Soya Beancurd\nBest for original taste\nThis is the stall that started the sweet soy bean curd craze\xa0— hence the many references in this article. The office crowd love Li Hui Shing and his wife Hui Ywai Kwa’s light scoops at Lao Ban (Mandarin for ‘Old Companion’) so much that many buy 40 to 50 tubs of its original and almond-flavoured bean curds ($1.50 each) at one go. How the extreme slurpers consume so many before the curds turn, we know not. But this curd ($1.50 each) is definitely positioned to be one cut away from the others\xa0— it is soft and silky with a melt-in-your-mouth texture. Although a very thin upper layer of skin marrs its appearance and adds a slight roughness to the mouthfeel at times, Lao Ban’s version is still the one to beat.Lao Ban Soya Beancurd | Address: #01-127 and #01-107 Old Airport Road Hawker Centre, 51 Old Airport Road; and two more locations | Tel: 81812201 | Opening hours: Tue–Sun 11.30am–6.30pm\xa0Mr Bean\nMost firm bean curd\nAlso known as ‘soy pudding’, Mr Bean’s version is not only the firmest but also the cleanest-tasting of the lot. Tinged a pastel yellow colour, the wobbly pudding is firm and slightly chewy to the bite, with a very smooth texture. Its very subtle soya bean flavour works well for those who dislike an overpowering soy milk taste. Perhaps it’s because the chain uses only non-genetically modified (non-GMO) soya beans. Unlike the other stalls featured here, Mr Bean’s focus isn’t only on this type of modern tau huay; in operation for over 15 years, the company has a comprehensive slew of soy bean products such as flavoured soy milk and soy ice-cream. Do check out their chendol soya milk\xa0— a healthier version of one of Singapore’s most popular hawker desserts.Mr Bean | Address:#B2-48 NEX, 23 Serangoon Central, and nine other locations | Opening hours: Daily 7.30am–10.30pm\xa0CRITIC’S PICK QQ Soya Bean\nBest for soya bean purists\nTheir bean curd ($1.80 a tub) is for those who prefer their desserts less sweet, and pure; it is the most authentic-tasting of the five yet not overpowering. Texture-wise, the dessert is very smooth and silky, and a little firmer than the one offered by Lao Ban and 51 Soya Bean\xa0— this version is the most similar in texture to silken tofu. Like Lao Ban Soya Bean, QQ also offers an almond version ($2 a tub). If you can’t wait a week to get a taste of this, they also have branches in Sengkang and Tampines Interchange.QQ Soya Bean | Address: #01-165 Old Airport Road Hawker Centre, 51 Old Airport Road, and two other locations | Tel: 83393459 | Opening hours: Daily 11am–9pmAuthor© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/peranakan-culture/:['In line with the effort to preserve the Peranakan heritage, this year’s Singapore Food Festival is on “Celebrating Our Unique Cultural Heritage The Peranakan Way”. To understand more about Peranakan’s colourful heritage and how the culture can continue to flourish despite the decreasing number of true-blooded Peranakans, inSing.com speaks with acclaimed Peranakan Chef Peter Wee.Chef Peter begins by explaining that the most important factor in preserving the Peranakan culture is the Peranakan’s in-bred love for their practices, ways and traditions. “Nonyas are taught to cultivate feeling for their creations, and food is a very strong way of preserving our culture,” Peter says.Undoubtedly, cooking and food is a big part of Peter’s life, whose love for culinary creations was passed down to him from his grandfather and nanny. In his spare time, Peter, a fourth generation Baba and the first vice president of the Peranakan Association of Singapore, says he enjoys conducting what he calls “market surveys”. “My grandfather used to know the prices of ingredients sold at the different markets and he passed this habit on to me as well! There are so many markets in the Eastern side [of Singapore] and I really enjoy making my rounds and surveying the prices. You have to know your ingredients to make good food,” he says.As for what makes the Pernankan culture so unique, Peter says it is largely due to the culture’s mixed heritage. “I’d say Peranakan culture has a stronger British influence than one might imagine. It’s maybe 80% Chinese in terms of customs and traditions, and 20% Malay, Indian and British-influenced. The dressing and ways of speaking are quite Malay in nature.” This fusion of cultures is what makes the Peranakan cuisine a hotpot of culture and tastes. “We use pork and the wok in cooking, so that’s from the Chinese, and many different spices such as coriander and lemongrass, which come from Malay and Indian influences.”Needless to say, Peter is highly supportive of the fairly recent unprecedented boom in the interest in Nonya culture. “The culture has undergone ups and downs over the generations, and we’re definitely getting a lot of interest and recognition today, with TV programmes like The Little Nonya which highlights the plight of Peranakan women in those days, and so on.” He also lauds the efforts of bodies such as the National Heritage Board and the Singapore Tourism Board in promoting awareness of the culture both locally and abroad.Going forward, Peter hopes that this new wave of interest in Peranakan culture will not die out but continue being revived in a big way. He notes that the younger generations are attracted to firstly, the material culture of the Nonyas, such as the beautiful kebaya, and secondly, to the food. “They must keep asking for it at home, and that will ensure the food culture will be retained,” he says.Chef Peter Wee’s five favourite Peranakan dishes\nTo enhance our understanding of the Pernankan food heritage, Peter shares with us the culture behind his five favourite Peranakan dishes and his experience in making them.Itek tim (Salted mustard duck soup)\nThis dish has some roots in traditional Chinese duck soup, but differentiated by the use of spices and belachan mix when cooked the traditional Peranakan way. Itek Tim is an evergreen Peranakan cuisine, and is also offered for ancestral worship as well as reunion dinners. “Stewed duck made in three kinds of assam – belimbing (belimbing fruit) assam, plum assam and assam puay (dried tamarind assam) – with a giam chai (salted vegetable) marinade. “I grow and make my own belimbing assam for best effect,” says Peter.Cincalok (fermented krill)\nPassed down over generations of Peranakans, cincalok is tedious and time consuming to make and demands great attention to detail. The dish is fermented with cooked rice and brandy for three days. “If the process is not done right, it can easily turn bad. The whole process is also not clean and dry,” Peter says. Portuguese in heritage and originating from Malacca, the dish is also known by its Malaccan name “grago”. “I really enjoy cincalok because it’s quite unique-its sour flavour whets the appetite and makes for a great appetiser. It also goes so well with fried fish. We always make our own because what you get outside is far too salty.”Achar (pickles)\nA traditional family favourite among Peranakans, this appetiser is fermented in a pot called the “kamcheng”. “This pot is always being carried around by the little Nonya in the popular TV show,” Peter says. A truly original Peranakan dish, achar is a signature family favourite to give away at festive occasions. Every New Year, Peranakan families will make about 7 to 8 kilos of cucumber and cauliflower, cabbage, radish, carrots, vinegar and rumpa (belachan concoction). Green chilli and papaya are favourite additions as well.Buah paya masak titek (green papaya soup)\nPeranakan families like to cook this traditional favourite daily or at least once or twice a week. A green papaya soup with a slightly spicy flavour, the titek comes from a combination of good belachan, shallots and candlenuts. “This is my favourite everyday dish. The main ingredient that gives it its spicy flavour is the white pepper,” says Peter. The soup is boiled with green papaya as well as dried salted fish bones to give it a full flavour. Basil leaves are used to garnish this mealtime favourite.Ayam sioh (stewed chicken)\nThis is a festive dish cooked most often for reunion dinners. As the preparation process can be daunting, it is not commonly served at the dinner table. “The dish consists of a sweet and sour concoction of shallots, assam and sugar which may be prepared with chicken, pork or duck and marinated overnight. Peter adds that it’s not easy to make an authentic ayam sioh – “Most of the time it turns out looking like tau yu bak (black sauce pork) when it should be dryer, like a kind of rending.To celebrate the Singapore Food Festival this year, Peter will be conducting a talk on Memories of the Peranakan Kitchen at the seminar The Art of Peranakan Dining at the Peranakan Museum on 24 July. He will also be giving a cooking demonstration and tour at Katong Antique House on 20 July. The Singapore Food Festival runs from 17-26 July 2009.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/millennium-glutinous-rice/:['Back in the 1950s and 60s, sweet and savoury glutinous rice (lor mai fan) were common breakfast staples which were sold by street hawkers in Singapore but in current times, the dishes are an increasing rarity.Sweet glutinous rice was in particular so hard to find that by the 2000s, there were literally only a couple of stalls selling them, HarriAnns and Niu Che Shui Famous Glutinous Rice.The dish threatened to become even more rare when Niu Che Sui Famous Glutinous Rice closed for good in 2012. The elderly men decided to retire when one of them had fallen ill.\xa0That was when then-50-year-old Steven Lam came into the picture.After being retrenched from the engineering manufacturing industry, Lam, who is Hakka, decided to continue the 40-year-old legacy of Niu Che Sui Famous Glutinous Rice.He opened Millennium Glutinous Rice in 2013, selling the same sweet and savoury glutinous rice offerings that Niu Che Sui Famous Glutinous Rice was selling.\xa0Both offerings are freshly made every day with the rice first steamed then fried with vegetable oil. The highlight is the texture of the rice itself — nicely sticky but not mushy, with a nice firm bounce to each rice grain.The savoury glutinous rice ($1.50/2) — a Cantonese offering — is flavoured using just salt and comes with slightly firm stewed peanuts for protein and extra richness.Lam used to put sliced mushrooms in the beginning but has since phased that out.\xa0The sweet glutinous rice ($1.50/2) — a Teochew dish — has sugar and a hint of salt added for that savoury sweet effect. Depending on how sweet you like your foods, the sweetness levels can be cloyingly sweet or just right.Fried onions are liberally poured on both sweet and salty glutinous rice and they are worth a mention.It is fried by Lam every day and doesn’t have that overly crunchy, dry texture that factory made fried onions have. The fried onions have a distinct onion flavour and the texture crispy with a slight chew to them. Simply excellent.\xa0You also have the option of combining both sweet and savoury into one plate. Eating both together and you get this unique sweet savoury flavour that some patrons prefer — they say that it nicely balances out both varieties.Lam also sells chee cheong fun (rice rolls; $1.50/2) which are surprisingly well done despite the fact that they are factory-made.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/chendol/:['It’s hard to resist the allure of chendol. Served ice-cold, chendol is a seductive concoction of creamy coconut milk, fragrant palm sugar and slippery green jelly noodles.This popular dessert takes its name from cendol, which is the Javanese term for the green worm-like jelly. Chendol was first introduced in Singapore by Indonesians. Later, Indian Muslim hawkers started selling the dessert. The Peranakans also invented their own version, which had the addition of sweetened red bean.The key to great chendol is top-quality ingredients. For this story, we hunted high and low for vendors who make their own cendol strips—traditionally made with mung bean flour and flavored with pandan juice. We found three such stalls, as well as another two worthy chendol recommendations.\xa0Cendol Geylang Serai EDITOR’S PICK!1 Geylang Serai, #02-107 Geylang Serai Food CentreOpening hours: Daily: 8.30am-6.30pmPrice: $1.50Rating: 4.5/5Of all the chendol we tried, Cendol Geylang Serai’s version was the most old-school. Their homemade cendol strips were a beautiful hue of pale jade-green. Fat, toothsome, and with a hint of pandan, the cendol had the best texture out of the three stalls that make their own cendol strips.Another old-school touch is the sweet-salty coconut milk, which is the way it used to be served. For those who grew up on the sweet version, this took some getting used to. However, the sweet-salty flavours were very pleasing, and quickly grew on us.Sweetened with good quality gula melaka, the milk had a lovely scent. The coconut milk base was smooth and not overly rich. All flavours were well-balanced, creating a most refreshing and unforgettable dessert.\xa0Dove Desserts22 Toa Payoh Lorong 7, #01-21 Toa Payoh Lorong 7 Food CentreOpening hours: Mon-Thu, Sat: 11am-8pm, Fri: 11am-6pm, closed on SunPrice: $1.50Rating: 3.5/5Dove Dessert’s chendol is rather similar to Penang-style chendol. They also make their own cendol strips. The jelly was short and skinny, but the texture was springy and boasted a mild pandan scent.While the coconut milk was sufficiently fresh, we wished it could have been a bit richer. The gula melaka was also rather subtle in fragrance.On the other hand, the cooked red beans were packed with robust fragrance. They were powdery and not too sweet. Although some of the beans were broken, this didn’t affect the overall dish too much.\xa0A1 Penang ChendolBlk 822 Tampines Street 81, #01-190Opening hours: Mon-Fri: 11.30am-8pm, Sat/Sun/PH: 11.30am-5pmPrice: $2.50Rating: 3.5/5Located near Temasek Polytechnic, this unassuming little shop makes their own cendol strips. They looked like fat worms, but the texture was a tad mushy. They could have been more springy.However, we were impressed with their use of quality ingredients, such as premium kidney beans and gula melaka. The smoky, caramel-like gula syrup was rich and complex, without being overwhelmingly sweet. The kidney beans were cooked till soft and flavorsome, but still retained their shape.Besides the generous amount of kidney beans, they were also heavy-handed with the use of thick coconut milk. While some of us enjoyed the hearty flavours of the chendol here, others felt the richness got rather overwhelming after a while.\xa0Mubarak Ali Kopitiam665 Race Course Road#01-257 Tekka CentreOpening hours: Daily: 7am-11.30pmPrice: $1.00Rating: 3/5A beverage rather than dessert, Mubarak Ali’s Indian-style chendol—without red bean—was refreshingly old-school.Flavoured with gula melaka syrup and a tinge of salt, the base was a mixture of fresh dairy, evaporated, and coconut milk. Sweet and salty, this milky cocktail was a harmonious blend of rich and complex flavours.Although they don’t make their own cendol strips anymore, the cendol they use is of decent quality. It was a shade of deep jade-green. The worms were fat and silky. Though they lacked fragrance, the texture was a good balance of soft and bouncy.\xa0Sabar Menanti48 Kandahar StreetOpening hours: Daily: 9am-6pmPrice: $2.00Rating: 2.5/5Influenced by Peranakan and Malaysian variations, Indonesian-style chendol now has additions of red bean or kidney bean as well.Sabar Menanti uses the same type of cendol strips as Mubarak Ali. It isn’t homemade, but at least it’s not the garish neon-green variety.Here, the milk base was light and not too sweet. The kidney beans, which were salty instead of sweet, were an unusual touch and a nice contrast to the sweet milk base. However, some of the beans were not evenly cooked. Also, the fragrance of the gula melaka and coconut milk could be bolder.\xa0inSing.com made anonymous visits and paid its own meals at the eateries featured here.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/sajian-mak-dara/:['A relatively new entrant at Geylang Serai Market, the stall has been in business for only 15 years but it has been gaining a quiet\xa0reputation for having some of the best nasi lemak in the area.Many residents in the area which we spoke to pointed to this stall as being their top place for nasi lemak and indeed when we visited this place on numerous occasions, there was always people queuing to buy takeaway packets of its nasi lemak ($3.50).The reason is clear once you tuck into it: fragrant basmati rice with a light coconut richness, not overly oily but it is really the chilli which is unique here.\xa0With a slight oil-richness, a touch of dried prawn flavour and a light spiciness, the sweetness is restrained compared to other nasi lemak stalls who tend to serve their chiili sauce overly sweet and/or spicy.The result of it having less sweetness is that you can actually taste the vegetable flavour of the chillies (as opposed to just the spice), making the chilli sauce seem “fresher” than is normal.The other elements of the nasi lemak, while not extraordinary, are decently done — moist fried chicken with enough savouriness, crisp ikan bilis, thick-cut cucumber slice and fried egg.\xa0It is also popular for\xa0bubur kampong\xa0($3.50/4), an uncommon Malay dish not often found in hawker centres. It’s basically thick porridge served with highly flavoursome condiments like sambal belachan, salted egg, peanuts, ikan bilis,\xa0cai po\xa0(salted radish) and sambal kangkong (kang kong vegetables stir-fried with a chilli paste).The sambal belachan comes extremely strong-tasting, spicy and dominates every flavour in the dish.Some spread the flavour of it by stirring a bit of it into the porridge.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

The father runs the main stall while the second generation run the outlet at Hong Lim.Their fishballs are made every day and have a higher-than-usual salt content as they have retained the traditional method of using salt as a preservative.The fishballs may be a little on the salty side when eaten alone but they work perfectly in conjunction with their noodles which have the right balance of savoury, spicy and oil rich flavours.There is also a hint of black vinegar to cut through the richness.Their noodles also come nicely springy and we’ve never encountered any clumpy-ness.The other specialty here are their “meatballs” — fish paste mixed with a small proportion of minced meat and tee po (dried sole fish).Some of them are included in every bowl and they are addictively good — with a complex savouriness and a little richer in taste.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/best-japanese-strawberry-shortcake/:['It’s amazing how the Japanese are able to import a foreign culinary item and transform it into something uniquely their own. Among many others, all these foods originated outside of Japan: ramen (China), tempura (Portugal), and curry rice (India).The same goes for strawberry shortcake—a confection of pastry, whipped cream and strawberries. The old-fashioned American strawberry shortcake is made with shortcake—a crumbly scone-like cake with crisp exterior and soft, buttery interior. On the other hand, Japanese-style strawberry shortcake uses a fluffy sponge cake base.Delicately light and airy, Japanese strawberry shortcake has been one of the most popular cakes in Japan for decades. With the recent boom of Japanese-style patisseries in Singapore, this confection is now experiencing a surge in popularity here too. Which one takes the cake for best Nippon-style strawberry shortcake?\xa0Flor Patisserie EDITOR’S PICK!2 Duxton Hill, #01-01Opening hours: Mon-Sat: 11am-7pm, Sun: 11am-9pmPrice: $5.50Rating: 4.5/5Newly opened Flor Patisserie is helmed by Japanese chef Yamashita Masataka—who was formerly head chef of Patisserie Glace. Named after the Portuguese word for “flower”, Flor (say “fu-ro-ru”) Patisserie’s creations are made without any artificial rising agents or stabilisers.Without the use of these additives, it takes extra work and skill to produce cakes with consistent quality. Factoring this into consideration, we were most impressed with Flor’s superb sponge base. Ethereally soft and moist, it had a fine crumb with a melt-in-the-mouth sensation.More milky than creamy, the whipped cream was divinely light. Subtly scented with vanilla, the Chantilly cream didn’t leave any lingering slickness on the tongue. The ratio of the cream, cake and strawberries was just right. If not for the slightly unripe strawberries, this would have been a flawless creation.\xa0Kki\xa0 BEST LOOKING CAKE\n7 Ann Siang HillOpening hours: Mon-Fri, Sun: 12pm-7pm, Sat: 12pm-4pm; closed on MonPrice: $8.00Rating: 4.5/5Visually stunning, Kki’s strawberry shortcake blew us away with its clean-cut lines and uniform layers. And it proved that it wasn’t all style and no substance.Airy and moist, the sponge cake was very well-made. Compared to Flor’s sponge base, this had a slightly coarser crumb, resembling a genoise sponge. Those who prefer their cake to have more texture would enjoy this. As for the whipped cream, it was very good, but wasn’t as fragrant or as light as Flor’s.Our vote for best strawberries goes to Kki. The large-sized, long-stemmed variety was specially sourced for their superior flavour and appearance. Indeed, these intensely red berries were the sweetest, most luscious, and best-looking in this selection.\xa0Patisserie Glace12 Gopeng Street, #01-33/34 Icon VillageOpening hours: Mon-Fri: 11am-7pm, Sat: 11am-6pm, Sun/PH: 11am-5pmPrice: $4.80Rating: 4/5Since it was previously headed by Chef Yamashita, it was no surprise that Patisserie Glace’s strawberry shortcake closely resembled Flor Patisserie’s version. Similarly, the cakes here are made without artificial agents like baking powder and stabilisers. The sponge base was also very soft, moist, and fine.On its own, the sponge was a tad too sweet. But when eaten with the whipped cream, the sweetness was balanced out. We loved the light, airy cream, which had a delicious milky taste.Presentation-wise, the cake was simple. The amount of sliced strawberries was appropriate, but we wished that they had used riper, more flavorful strawberries.\xa0Sun Moulin350 Orchard Road, B1 Isetan ScottsOpening hours: 10am-9.30pmPrice: $5.60Rating: 3.5/5Sun Moulin’s creation looked better as a whole cake rather than by the slice. It was topped with jumbo berries, piped cream and surrounded by flaked almonds on the side. When sliced, it tended to look a little messy.Although short on presentation, Sun Moulin’s strawberry cake scored high on flavour. Even before tasting it, its robust scent of strawberry already made us drool. This was probably due to the generous amount of fruit in the cake.With a subtle hint of vanilla, the cream was rich but felt light. The sponge was pillowy soft and not too sweet, but could have been more moist. On the whole, Sun Moulin’s refreshing and fragrant creation was very easy to like.\xa0Rive Gauche68 Orchard Road, #B2-57 Plaza SingapuraOpening hours: Daily: 10am-10pmPrice: $6.00Rating: 3/5Rive Gauche’s strawberry cake was good but not outstanding. The sponge was dense and moist, but a little rough in texture. The sliced strawberries were ripe and juicy, but there was too little of them to experience the full berry flavor.We also had reservations about the cream. It was pleasantly smooth and buttery, but lacked sufficient fragrance and flavour.Overall, this passed the requirements for a classic Japanese-style strawberry shortcake. However, with its relatively high price tag, we were expecting the use of better ingredients.\xa0inSing.com made anonymous visits and paid its own meals at the eateries featured here.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/saltiest-hawker-dishes/:['So you think you’re eating relatively healthy dishes at hawker centres? Think again. We did a little snooping to find out how salty our hawker dishes are exactly, and how much we should actually be consuming. We list our findings, from the dishes containing the lowest to the highest amount of sodium per portion.As a guideline, the average daily sodium consumption is recommended to be no more than 2,000mg of sodium per day in Singapore (it differs in other countries). According to the Singapore Heart Foundation, the average Singaporean consumes around 3,520mg of sodium per day – 76 per cent more than the recommended intake. A diet high in sodium may result in high blood pressure, stroke and kidney failure.\xa01. Lor mai kai\nSodium level: 599mg per portion (150g)\nThese babies shouldn’t affect your daily sodium intake much, right? Well, this dense little bowl of glutinous rice with richly-salted chicken (with skin) makes up a little more than a quarter of your 2,000mg – a good way to start the day if you’re really watching what you eat the rest of the day. Besides, you don’t usually consume this on its own, do you? If you’re at Tiong Bahru Pao, you’ve got to also have the medium-skinned char siew bao ($0.90; lor mai kai, $1.80) and the rest of the dim sum works.\nTiong Bahru Pao | Address: #02-18/19, 30 Seng Poh Rd, Tiong Bahru Market and Food Centre | Tel: 64381663 | Opening hours: Daily 7am-9pm\xa02. Braised duck gizzard\nSodium level: 304mg per piece (47g) \nWe’ve placed the duck gizzard second because, who really eats only one piece? If you’re a lover of this deathly chewy (death to dentures, that is) bird’s ventriculus, you’re likely to consume the whole plate; that would set you back anywhere between 608mg and 3,648mg. If you must consume a piece of this, drop by Ah Heng Braised Duck Rice for a quintessential classic. Their basic plate of duck rice starts at only $3.50. Don’t overdo it though.\nAh Heng Braise Duck Rice | Address: #02-64\xa0Hong Lim Food Centre, 531A Upper Cross Street\xa0| Opening hours: Tues-Sun 8.30am-2.30pm, Closed on Mondays\xa03. Carrot cake\nSodium level: 1282mg per portion (290g)\nYou think this is one of the lightest dishes you can have at a hawker centre, and you might be right – the average weight of a plate of carrot cake is 290g, but that itself packs a little more than half the amount of sodium you should take in a day. Still, we can’t keep ourselves away from Hai Sheng Carrot Cake’s white version (the only version they sell). We recommend opting for the smallest portion ($2; $4 is the biggest) – for good things like this soft, egg-led crisp carrot cake should be savoured, slowly, in small portions, not overdone.\nHai Sheng Carrot Cake | Address: Blk 724 Ang Mo Kio Ave 6, #01-09 | Tel: 90035259 | Opening hours: Mon-Fri 7am-2.30pm, 6-8pm; Sat, Sun & public holiday 7am-8pm\xa04. Char kway teow\nSodium level: 1463mg per portion (385g)\nNo matter how glisteningly oily, nicely sweet and well-studded Outram Park Fried Kway Teow Mee’s char kway teow is with plump blood cockles (fried to the right raw-meets-cooked doneness) we’ll only get in line at once in a very blue moon. It’s not that the lines never end – it’s that we fear our bodies won’t be able to take the amount of sodium (and grease) a plate ($3-$5) sticks us with. We appreciate how generous the portions are, and the hard arm muscle power you put into frying the char kway teow, Uncle Ng, we really do.\nOutram Park Fried Kway Teow Mee | Address: 531A Upper Cross Street, #02-17, Hong Lim Food Centre | Opening hours: Mon-Sat 6am-4.30pm\n\xa05. Ngoh hiang\nSodium level: 1725mg per portion (355g)\nIt does not surprise us that this platter of sausage-like rolls (typically made with prawns, water chestnut, minced pork and five-spice – “ngoh hiang” – powder rolled and deep-fried in beancurd skin, $0.70 per roll), lup cheong (Chinese sausage, price varies), century egg ($1.20 each), deep-fried prawn fritters ($0.70 each), fishballs ($0.20 each) and cuttlefish ($2 each) is lesser in weight than an average plate of char kway teow, but higher in sodium levels. The accompanying sweet sauce (a must-have) adds to the sodium count.

Century egg porridge\nSodium level: 1915mg per portion (648g)\nAh, the go-to dish for many of us when we’re sick. Flavour- (and ingredient-) laden bowls like Hong Kee Porridge’s century egg porridge with meat, intestines and pig’s kidney and liver ($2.50) might work for when you’re so ill you’re only taking one meal a day. Otherwise, we suggest kicking it down a few notches to options like the duck porridge (1269mg per 573g portion)\xa0– that might be a little more sustainable.\nHong Kee Porridge | Address: Blk 119 Commonwealth Crescent, #02-89 Commonwealth Crescent Market | Tel: 90675755 | Opening hours: Daily 7am-3pm\xa07. Claypot rice\nSodium level: 2178mg per portion (595g)\nShare. Don’t try to eat the entire claypot rice dish yourself, even though, we know, that is very possible. There is plenty of crust and sauce to go around, especially when, like at Geylang Claypot Rice, the sweet and salty dark sauce is evenly poured and you allow the rice to pop a little on the bottom before mixing the rice, chicken, pork and salted egg thoroughly yourselves. We’re glad the serving bowls are small.\nGeylang Claypot Rice | Address: 639 Geylang Rd | Tel: 67444574 | Opening hours: Tue-Sun 11.30am-4pm, 5pm-midnight\xa08. Mee soto ayam\nSodium level: 2417mg per portion (569g)\nAt as low as $2, the soto ayam is a bargain, and a hard one to stay away from. It clocks in at more than 20 per cent over the recommended daily intake of sodium, but Inspirasi Stall’s homely bowl (mainly) sweet broth might be one to indulge in once in a while. The bowl comes complete with lontong (rice cakes), bean sprouts and shredded chicken, and as much chilli you can handle. Bring water.\nInspirasi Stall | Address: 207 New Upper Changi Road, #01-11 Bedok Interchange Food Centre | Opening hours: Mon-Wed & Fri-Sun noon-midnight\xa09. Mutton murtabak\nSodium level: 2653mg per portion (410g)\nSo it seems murtabak is the dish to order when you’re just coming off a night at the dance clubs. Drunkies, at least try to remember to order Singapore Zam Zam Restaurant’s chicken murtabak instead\xa0– that is what the Indian-Muslim restaurant is known for, and the chicken version packs 400mg less of sodium. Give yourself some help: you don’t need your body to also be fighting your kidneys for water.\nSingapore Zam Zam Restaurant | Address: 697 North Bridge Road | Tel: 62986320 | Opening hours: Daily 8am-11pm\xa010. Fishball soup with noodles\nSodium level: 2878mg per portion (657g)\nWho would have thunk a bowl of clear broth could do so much damage? If you have decided to go this far, have Yong Kee Famous Fish Ball Noodle’s handmade fish- and meatballs. But resist finishing the innocent-looking soup, even though it is made with the nutrient-rich water used in the fishball making process\xa0– that’s where the sodium is concentrated.\nYong Kee Famous Fish Ball Noodle | Address: 6 Jalan Bukit Merah, #01-121 ABC Brickworks Food Centre | Tel: 62703956 | Opening hours: Daily 7am-1am\nOf the 10 saltiest hawker dishes, which would you eat over and over again?Former food & drink editor at Time Out Singapore magazine, Celine Asril‘s other previous incarnations include food blogger, cook, and food photographer’s assistant.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/fook-kin/:['When the cheekily-named Cantonese roast meat eatery opened along Killiney Road back in 2018, it opened to alot of media fanfare but the food quality was a bit of a mixed bag.While their signature Kuala Lumpur-style char siu was a hit, their other offerings — like the roast pork and roast duck — and some of the side dishes needed some work.But after a year of tweaking, we’re happy to report that the quality has gotten much better and the food is now worth talking about.Fook Kin is a collaboration between The Muttons — DJ Justin Ang and Vernon A, FatBoys the burger joint and Roast Paradise, that much talked about Cantonese Roast meats stall located in Old Airport Road Food Centre.We’ve already done a pretty in-depth review of Roast Paradise.Essentially the same food from Roast Paradise is served at Fook Kin but the menu is much more extensive with drinks, beer and a wide selection of side dishes.The decor is still in an upmarket, funky millennial style with updated retro fittings like marble tabletops, birdcage lamps and blue porcelain bowls.The main improvements are in the food.Their one dish meals like The Roast Paradise ($10.80) is a very hearty lunch option even for a big eater. The recipe is still the same — minced meat noodles with half a ramen egg and a trio of roast meats — but the portions have gotten a bit bigger and the meats are cut into bigger chunks.\xa0The char siu is predictably excellent with a nice charring, generous fat to meat ratio and a balanced sweet savoury flavour. The roast pork is cut in bigger chunks, with reasonably moist meat. There is crispy skin but we would have liked a little more of a crunch.The roast duck was always the weakest of the roast meats and it still is, but the execution is better than before.The duck is advertised to be massaged with 18 herbs, spices and slow-roasted over charcoal fire and served with Angelica Herb Sauce (Dang Gui).Back then, the herb flavours were not so prominent.\xa0Fook Kin has remedied that but the overall flavour and seasoning levels (depending on which part of the duck you get) are quite delicate, especially compared with their roast pork and char siu.It also doesn’t help that the texture while decent, could be a little more tender.On a brighter note, a big shoutout especially to their noodle options ($3).\xa0Over at Roast Paradise, it is known as Hakka Noodles but at Fook Kin, it is simply Mee Pok (flat egg noodles) or Mee Kia (thin egg noodles), but they are definitely no slouch flavour-wise.Lightly flavoured with sweet chilli paste, lard oil and minced meat, noodles come springy and the flavouring works well with or without the roast meats — very nicely balanced.\xa0Among the side dishes, the Triple Happiness Tofu ($9.80) — soft tofu in a delicate moreish savoury brown sauce and topped with pork floss, Ikura (fish eggs), century egg and salted egg is a winner and provides a fresher, lighter taste contrast too the heavier rich roast meats.The Golden Lotus Roots Crisps ($7.80) — thin lotus root slices deep fried and drizzled with an intense salted egg yolk gravy — is also another rich, flavour-packed win which goes great with drinks.Forget level 35 chicken wings. We want to have our hot, spicy foods and eat it too! We believe spicy dishes should have a good dose of chilli kick, but not too fiery that it numbs all your senses and you can’t taste anything. You may cry, jump off your seat, guzzle water like beer or go speechless with some of the dishes here, but if you survive the tongue-scorching experience, you may beg for more.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/murtabak/:['Think of it as a giant stuffed roti prata. But it’s more than that. If you’ve ever had the pleasure of tearing into that hearty creation of crisp, pillowy dough filled with spiced meat and sweet, juicy onion, you’ll know that the sum of its parts is greater than the whole.Originally, murtabak was filled with minced mutton, onion, and sometimes, egg. These days, adventurous murtabak makers have even come up with modern twists like tuna or cheese. However, mutton and chicken remain the bestsellers.How do some of the most well-known murtabak places stake up against one another? Here are the results of our taste test!\xa0AB & ABC Restaurant365 Joo Chiat RoadOpening hours: Daily: 24 hours (murtabak available from 11am-2pm, 3pm-3am)Price: from $4.00 for mutton, $6.00 for chickenRating: 4/5Apart from the dense, chewy dough which required a fair bit of jaw work, there was plenty to like about AB & ABC’s hearty-sized murtabaks. The best part was the nearly grease-free skin. Although it could have been crispier, the dough was an evenly browned, golden crust.The fillings were just as commendable. We preferred the chicken version. It was bursting with sliced sautéed that was sweet, juicy, and retained the right crunch. The curried chicken was tasty and chunky. In fact, we wolfed down the chicken murtabak without the accompanying curry because it was moist and flavourful enough on its own.The mutton version was slightly dry and could have been bolder with spices. But all was well after we dunked it in the dhal curry. Smooth, nutty, and slightly tangy, the rich curry was balanced in flavour without being too spicy.\xa0Singapore Zam Zam Restaurant697 North Bridge RoadOpening hours: Mon-Thu: 8am-12am, Fri-Sun: 8am-2amPrice: from $5.00 for mutton/chickenRating: 3.5/5With tender chunks of chicken in a fragrant spice paste, the chicken murtabak trumped its mutton counterpart which had slightly overdone meat. Thankfully, the coarse ground mutton was paired with plenty of chopped onions. Sweetness from the onions helped to take the dryness off the mutton somewhat.Overall, this was a very rustic-looking murtabak with its unabashed robustness and grease. The dough was thick, chewy, slick, and salty, but it felt like comfort food in the most sinful manner. And did we mention what a guilty pleasure it was to munch on the charred edges?We also liked how they served two different kinds of dip—a piquant curry and a milder dhal with pleasantly mushy lentils. Without them, the murtabak wouldn’t have been as enjoyable.\xa0Spize The Makan Place409 River Valley RoadOpening hours: Daily: 6pm-6amPrice: $8.00 for mutton keema/chickenRating: 3.5/5Of all the murtabaks in this round-up, our favourite dough was Spize’s. It was paper-thin, with a pleasantly chewy and airy texture. When served, the dough was crisp, but turned soft quickly when left to sit.This could be due in part to the juicy fillings. A unique distinction for the mutton murtabak was the use of keema—a mild minced meat curry. It was luscious, tasty, and exceedingly spicy. The chicken version—with finely shredded curried chicken and cubed potato—was even spicier.Even the chilli lovers among us found the spiciness level to be challenging. It’d be ideal if the heat was reduced and more chopped onion added to the fillings.It’s a good thing that both mutton and chicken murtabaks were moist and packed with flavour.\xa0 For once, we shunned the accompanying curry dip, for it was bland and very oily.\xa0New Victory Restaurant701 North Bridge RoadOpening hours: Daily: 7am-11pmPrice: from $4.00 for mutton, $5.00 for chickenRating: 3/5With an established competitor just next door, it was interesting to see how New Victory would fare.Their murtabaks were very similar in style to their neighbour Zam Zam’s. In fact, with a lighter and better-fried crust, we thought the dough tasted marginally better.But on the whole, New Victory’s murtabaks lacked punch. The chicken and mutton fillings were sufficiently moist and tender. But both could have benefited from more onion. Flavour and fragrance were also lacking. The accompanying curry tasted slightly watered-down.\xa0The Roti Prata House246 Upper Thomson RoadOpening hours: Sun-Thu: 7am-2am, Fri-Sat: 24 hoursPrice: from $4.50Rating: 2/5\nThe Roti Prata House is well-known for their crispy prata, and they’ve incorporated the same incredibly thin, crispy dough into their murtabak as well. With tiny bubbles on the deep amber-brown surface, the dough was ethereally light and not too greasy. The only downside was its exceeding sweetness.Surprisingly, the chicken stuffing was unlike any other we’ve tasted. It had cabbage as well as a sharp, vinegary tang. The mutton was relatively tender and moist. Both versions could have done with more chopped onion.Between the two, we favoured mutton. The chicken, with its biting sourness, was too exotic for most of us. As for the dhal curry, it had a pleasant creaminess that was unfortunately marred by a strong powdery taste.On their own, each element tasted fine. But when put together, they formed a mix of flavours and textures that failed to complement one another.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/mr-fish/:['A relatively new entrant at Chinatown Complex, this stall has a rather modern sounding name and logo but what you get here are easily some of the best traditional Cantonese-style fish dishes in Singapore.They serve a relatively small menu, only fish soup or wok-fried dishes like sliced fish hor fun and braised bitter gourd sliced fish, but all of them are done exceedingly well.\xa0The stall opened at Chinatown Complex in 2014 but are by no means newcomers to the scene having sold tze char dishes at Bukit Merah View Market and Food Centre for over 30 years.Run by Mr. Lee, his wife and their son, Alan, they have a firm no-compromise approach to their cooking.\xa0No milk (evaporated or otherwise) is added to the fish broth. The creaminess is achieved the old-fashioned way: adding fish stock to fried fish bones then boiling it until all the cartilage turns to gelatine.The result is a thick stock that has a toasty aroma and a rich brownish colour.Thanks to the wet market at Chinatown Complex itself, all the fish is incredibly fresh and they also offer the more unusual cuts of fish head, belly and collar for the fish fanatics who prefer more interesting textures and meat flavours.The soup can be had with or without chor (thick) beehoon , the most common being ordered is the Sliced Fish Bee Hoon ($5).\xa0The taste has an incredible depth and roundness in addition to the natural creamy fish oil taste and a present ginger taste thanks to large ginger slices which are thrown in.It is also not over salted, a good thing as it showcases the pure taste of the fish stock. You can also taste a little more of the natural flavours of the vegetables, fish and the bee hoon as a result.Our only gripe is that the fish slices were cut a little thicker for a chunkier bite.\xa0Their wok dishes are also very popular as everything is cooked to order. You won’t find trays of pre-fried noodles waiting to be reheated with gravy and toppings.Which is why their Black Bean Sliced Fish Hor Fun ($5) is a must order.They take their time frying the hor fun noodles so the noodles have not only a springy texture but a deep charring to them.The black bean sauce is also nicely robust and thick, and with a savoury rich and smoky taste.\xa0Again, its not over salted so you taste more of the preserved black bean than salt.Braised Bitter Gourd & Sliced Fish ($8/10) is also popular as it combines fresh fish and crunchy bitter gourd with lovely wok hei.Eggs and fish roe are also available at an additional cost.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/cocktails-to-boost-libido/:['Part science and part quackery with a healthy serving of the placebo effect, the use of aphrodisiacs to boost virility and get your mojo flowing is as old as civilisation itself. The endless quest for better sex has gone on for thousands of years across pretty much every culture, even putting some animals on the endangered species list. Luckily for you and your special someone/booty call, aphrodisiacs can be found easily these days; sometimes where you least expect them.In an effort to help you spice things up not just on Valentine’s Day but the other 364 days of the year, and to do our part to solve the country’s problems with low birth rates, we got some of Singapore’s best mixologists to stir up cocktails with everyday aphrodisiacs. Play nice now.\xa0\xa0THE APHRODISIAC LISTCHOCOLATEThe choice of the Aztec emperor Montezuma II who – depending on who you believe – had anywhere between four and 100 childrenThe Science:\xa0Chocolate contains phenylethylamine, a pschoactive compound with stimulative and therapeutic effects, tryptophan, an amino acid which the body synthesises to form the feelgood neurotransmitter serotonin, and anandamide, from the cannabinoid family of chemical compounds. Yes, we know that’s a mouthful. Also used in this drink is cardamom: used in Ayurvedic medicine and is believed to get the blood flowing, if you know what we mean, thanks to the presence of eucalyptol and its purported vasodilative properties.The Drink:\xa0Chocorgasmic by Louis Tan, L’Aiglon\xa0\xa0OYSTERSThe purported favourite breakfast of legendary ladies’ man Giacomo CasanovaThe Science:\xa0While oysters are probably the most stereotypical of aphrodisiacs, they have some of the best scientific backing of anything on this list. They contain zinc, which improves fertility, and iron, which provides energy, as well as D-aspartic acid and N-methyl-D-aspartate; which increases the production of testosterone in men and progesterone in women. Hot peppers on the other hand – and this would be familiar to anyone who can’t live without chili – spur the release of endorphins while literally getting your pulse racing. The ghost pepper, which is used in this cocktail, was at one time considered the hottest chili pepper on the planet.The Drink:\xa0The Slick Pearl by Louis Tan, L’Aiglon\xa0\xa0ALMONDS AND CORIANDERSource of many a memorable Arabian nightThe Science:\xa0The aroma of almonds alone is said to be a turn on, but it might not work if you tend to associate it with beancurd desserts. They also provide you with vitamin E, an antioxidant which aids the body’s production and regulation of hormones (particularly in women). Coriander’s power is actually referenced in the Arabian Nights and it has been an ingredient in dubious love potions throughout history. It does have tons of vitamins A, B-6 and C, though.The Drink:\xa0The Morning After by Jeff Ho, Jekyll & Hyde\xa0\xa0GINSENG, GINGER AND WATERMELONA powerful trifectaThe Science:\xa0In a number of studies, ginseng has shown potential in alleviating erectile dysfunction while generally helping muscles relax and enhancing blood flow through active compounds called ginsenosides. Watermelon contains the amino acid citrulline, which has a similar effect on the circulatory system while ginger contributes with its spiciness.The Drink:\xa0Bittersweet Symphony by Jeff Ho, Jekyll & Hyde\xa0\xa0FIGS, HONEY AND PEACHESAllegedly Cleopatra’s favourite fruitThe Science:\xa0What bananas represent for guys, figs supposedly symbolise for girls – a pretty rough deal to be honest. Beyond scarring mental images, figs are miniature mineral mines rich in antioxidants, delivering magnesium, manganese, potassium, copper and calcium. Honey is a natural energy booster and contains boron which is used in the production of estrogen and testosterone.The Drink:\xa0Sex & Candy by Naz Arjuna, Bitters & Love\xa0\xa0BANANAS, PEANUT BUTTER AND CHOCOLATEA dessert combination to die forThe Science:\xa0Besides the outrageously obvious phallic comparisons, bananas are a good source of potassium which promotes cardiovascular health and vitamin B, which improves blood flow and raises energy levels.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/afandi-hawa/:['The best mee rebus in Singapore can arguably be found at Afandi Hawa and family, located at Haig Road Market & Food Centre.The stall was started by Affandi Ahmat at the old Paya Lebar Airport in 1967, and his 34-year old son Ahmad Tarmidzi is helming the business. He has been helming it since 2008.The beauty of the mee rebus here ($3) is the incredibly deep stock complexity in the gravy. It’s thanks to the generous use of dried shrimps, mutton scraps and whole flower crabs in its making, resulting in a rich, not too sweet sauce with a distinct stock and curry flavour.The texture of the sauce is thick, with small ground dried prawns giving it a more layered texture.The dish comes with a whole egg, all for the price of $3 which is practically unheard of these days.They used to automatically ladle mutton scraps into the dish but now you have to request it. The mutton pieces are sizeable and have this wonderfully soft, melt in your mouth texture.\xa0There is also a small bottle of kecap manis (sweet soy sauce) at the counter if you’d like the flavour to be sweeter and more smoky, though we think its not necessary.Their range of soto dishes ($3) are also commendable. The broth that they use comes very balanced and it’s full of chicken flavour and turmeric spice notes.The dark soy chilli sambal that comes with every soto dish comes sweet and spicy with not much savoury notes, so bear that in mind when you mix it in the broth.They automatically throw in a dollop on top, so if you can’t take chilli or only like a bit of it, ask for it to be in a separate saucer.\xa0Many customers order a begedil ($0.50; fried potato cake) with soto dishes. It has a nice fried richness and apotato sweetness but it’s not intensely flavoured like how some other stalls do it, but it goes well when eaten with the broth.The stall is also generous with their ingredients. Their standard mee soto comes with big chunks of boiled chicken breast.\xa0They also serve Gado Gado ($3) which is decent, if not outstanding. Fish crackers is sprinkled on top instead of prawn crackers which is a nice twist but the gravy could do with a little more robust flavour.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/ikea/:['[UPDATE]\xa0IKEA Singapore’s assistant advertising and public relations manager, Sandra Keasberry, announced in a press release this afternoon: “As a precautionary measure, we have issued a temporary sales stop of meatballs at the IKEA Swedish Food Market and IKEA Restaurant pending results from DNA testing. We expect the test results middle of next week to confirm that there are no indications of horsemeat in the meatballs.”In the same press release, IKEA Singapore added: “There is a halal line at IKEA Tampines where meatballs containing a mixture of chicken and beef from Brazil and Australia respectively are sold. These are halal certified and locally produced. None of our ingredients are produced by the affected suppliers.”\xa0IKEA pulls meatballs from European states on horsemeat tests.In an AFP report, company spokeswoman Ylva Magnusson says that the bags of meatballs have been withdrawn in Sweden. “We take this very seriously and have withdrawn one-kilo bags of frozen meatballs from Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, France, Britain, Portugal, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, Cyprus, Greece and Ireland.”The product has also been removed from shelves in Denmark, according to Dorte Hjorth Harder, spokeswoman for IKEA Denmark.The batch of meatballs sent to the Czech Republic and 11 other countries has been withdrawn, but other batches remain on sale, the firm said. IKEA said it withdrew all its meatballs as a precaution in Denmark, Sweden and France.“We have today been informed that our meatballs could contain traces of horsemeat, based on a test done in the Czech Republic,” IKEA said in a statement.“Our own tests haven’t shown any traces of horsemeat. We now obviously have to study this further,” it added.The batch of 1kg frozen meatballs had been pulled from shelves due to “customer concerns”, IKEA said.Sweden’s National Food Agency said it had been informed of the tests by Dafgaard, the company that produces the meatballs sold by IKEA in most European countries.“It’s the authorities in the Czech Republic that found traces of horsemeat in one of three tests they performed,” said Karin Cerenius, head of food control for the agency in the western region of Vaestra Goetaland.“They still don’t know the amount (of horsemeat) involved,” she said.Dafgaard said in a statement it was performing its own DNA tests on the batch and that the meatballs had been “blocked” from distribution.The Czech veterinary watchdog, the State Veterinary Administration (SVA), said on Monday it had found horsemeat in meatballs supplied to IKEA and in burgers made in Poland that were imported by Denmark-based food chain Nowaco.“Both batches have been suspended, that is, not allowed on the market,” SVA spokesman Josef Duben said in a statement, adding the ban concerned 760kg of meatballs and 360kg of pre-fried burger meat.Czech vets have so far taken 43 samples of products, tested 24, and found horse DNA in three of them, including the meatballs and the burgers, said Duben.Last week, Czech food inspectors ordered the Tesco chain to withdraw frozen “beef” lasagne containing horsemeat, manufactured by the Tavola company in Luxembourg and imported and distributed by Nowaco.They noted that horsemeat is sold for human consumption in the country, but that if not mentioned on the product label, it was misleading to consumers and could lead to a fine of up to three million koruna (about S$190,700).The spiralling scandal that has hit several countries in Europe and spread to Asia broke out in January, when horse DNA was detected in beefburgers in Britain and Ireland where horsemeat consumption is taboo.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/uno-beef-house/:['It’s 7.30pm on a Thursday night when we reach UNO Beef House, and the place is absolutely packed. We step up to the counter, and before we place our order, Rico Lim warns us that it’s a 40 minute wait.After choosing our dishes, we’re eager to ask Rico, the business owner’s son, a few questions about UNO Beef House – but our conversation is cut short every few seconds, as he turns his attention to those who have joined us at the front of the stall, ready to order.“Need to wait 40 minutes, hor” he intones good-naturedly each time, and the majority of his customers aren’t fazed by this piece of information, and choose to place their orders anyway. A select few wrinkle their noses in dismay and say they’ll be back another time, and Rico tells them that the best time to come by is 4pm on weekdays – they’ll only have to wait 15 minutes or so if they pop by then.The secret sauce behind UNO Beef House’s success throughout its 30 odd years of operations – is, quite literally, a secret sauce. According to Rico, this sauce that serves as an accompaniment to their Chicken Chop ($7), Pork Chop ($7) and other dishes contains over 10 different ingredients, and is made fresh in-house everyday.Taste-wise, this secret sauce is surprisingly restrained, and serves to complement our chicken chop rather than to steal the show. It’s slightly sweet, slightly tangy, slightly salty – but there’s barely enough to go around.Sauce aside, the chicken chop is satisfyingly succulent, although Rico swears that the chefs at UNO Beef House don’t employ any special method of cooking. We’re not impressed by the sides, though – the fries, slaw and beans are perfunctory, and the garlic bread is topped off with what can only be described as an anorexic amount of garlic spread.The Minced Beef Spaghetti ($6.50), on the other hand, fared better than expectations. Although the noodles aren’t quite al dente, we like the rich and full-bodied sauce which is thoroughly infused with the flavour of the minced beef, as well as the chunky tomato bits in said sauce.When doing our research before visiting the place, a common thread in the (outdated!) reviews that we found was that UNO Beef House serves generous portions for wallet-friendly prices. Whilst we might have found these dishes good value for money a few years back (when most items were priced at $5), this definitely isn’t the case today.As for the snaking queues and long wait times that UNO Beef House still experiences, we’ve got a hunch that this can be attributed to long-time fans coming back for the taste of familiarity and nostalgia, rather than anything else. That’s our take – but drop by to try their food for yourself, and let us know what you think!Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

This, despite criticisms from fans who moan that the sizes of the “cakes” have been getting smaller and smaller.Maxwell Fuzhou Oyster Cake\xa0was started in 1962 by Madam Pang Siew Ting, who, in order to support her five children, decided to do what she was good at — oyster cake, a common snack in Fuzhou, China. Oyster cakes are practically impossible to find in Singapore now.\nAs oysters were expensive and hard to find in Singapore back then, she improvised using clams or mussels. Over the years, the recipe has been refined to include prawns, minced meat, and oysters.Chewy and crispy on the outside and fried only in small batches to maintain freshness, it is a wonderful marriage of moist minced meat, chopped oysters, crunchy peanuts and coriander, all covered in a rice-based fried batter. It is an\xa0addictive dish that goes well with the chilli sauce on the side. The chilli is fresh-tasting, light on the sugar but still very potent. It’ll be hard for you to stop at just one.This Fuzhou snack is close to extinction in Singapore.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/islamic-restaurant/:['In existence for nearly a century, Islamic Restaurant is one of the first restaurants to serve biryani in Singapore but has it stood the test of time?M. Abdul Rahman — the head chef for the prominent Alsagoff family in the late 19th century — left to set up Islamic Restaurant along North Bridge Road in 1921 and now the restaurant is in the hands of third-generation owner Kalil A. Wahab, 59.In its almost 10 decades of operation, Islamic has served numerous state dignitaries like Singapore’s presidents Yusoff Ishak, SR Nathan and the Malaysian sultans of Brunei, Perak and Johor, all who have tucked into Islamic’s famous biryani.Even if you pop into Islamic Restaurant for lunch these days, biryani is what you’ll see on 80 per cent of the tables.But how good is Islamic’s biryani these days?Islamic’s menu describes its biryani as being “Turkish-Indian” and that’s fairly accurate as it’s a cross between local and middle eastern styles of biryani.Higher quality long-grain basmati rice is used and it comes nicely fluffy but it’s less coloured and not as ghee-heavy as compared to the Indian varieties bought from Tekka.Compare it to Middle Eastern biryanis and there is less of an emphasis of that spice-richness.The masala gravy — the robust gravy that comes with the mutton or chicken when its cooked — is good but only when its done right.We’ve been back numerous times to Islamic over the years and found that the quality can sometimes be inconsistent. (Chicken: $11; mutton: $11.50)When it hits the mark, the taste is wonderful, concentrated, full of spices, savouriness and with a slight tanginess but when it doesn’t hit, it can come rather under-flavoured.The meats are how you’d expect them to be. Soft and moist if you get meat close to the bone and a bit drier if its without bone.Portion-wise, it is similar to what you’d get at any biryani outlet. If its chicken, it’ll be a standard chicken thigh/drum and mutton, about half a fistful.The surprising highlight was actually the dalcha gravy on the side because it comes nice and thick and is thickened naturally using lentils.The flavour is a nice balance of spice, savouriness and tanginess and they dish out small chunks of soft carrots, potatoes and/or brinjals.Part of the experience of Islamic Restaurant is actually dining in at the venue because you can feel the weight of history looking at all the numerous paintings and pictures of the family with the many dignitaries they have served over the many decades.You get the sense that you’re partaking in the same biryani experience that they’ve gone through and that’s pretty cool.On the other hand, we’re pretty sure they had better air-conditioning, because as it currently stands, it’s almost non-existent.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/tiong-bahru-lor-mee/:['Not to be confused with the lor mee stalls at Tiong Bahru Market and Bukit Batok, all with the same names, this stall has its roots in the much coveted Beng Tin Lor Mee in Tiong Bahru, a lor mee stall that was popular with the patrons at Tiong Bahru many decades ago.The story goes that owner Andrew Khoo was a hawker who rented the stall belonging to the matriarch who ran Beng Tin. They became close and he managed to learn the recipe from her.As a consequence, he started Tiong Bahru Lor Mee at Old Airport Road Food Centre and that was 15 years ago.The main attraction is that the taste of the “lor” here is predominantly savoury with very little sweet notes and you can taste a little more of the\xa0 five spice and cinnamon spices.Unfortunately, while the lor gravy is flavourful, it is not particularly thick or concentrated. It is still has that starchy quality — very common for lor mee stalls — so it does become watery fairly quickly.The toppings are also very nicely done here — chunky, deep-fried flaked snapper and thicker-than-usual braised pork belly pieces. They also throw in ngoh hiang pieces but they have that floury fishcake texture to them.Another highlight is that they occasionally offer deep-fried fish roe ($1) which come chewy, chunky and with a nice earthy fish flavour.Do note the while they offer a $3 option, they do not add fried snapper as one of the ingredients.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

Tong Xin Ju Special Shanghai Tim Sum — one of the first street-side stalls to start selling Beijing and Shanghainese food in Singapore — have garnered a huge following for exactly that reason over the course of their almost 70-year history.Now in the hands of 60-year-old Sebastian Hu, a fourth generation owner —, the stall have been covered in the media fairly extensively for their small but concise selection of China dishes like Beijing hor fun/noodles, Shanghai rice cakes, hot and sour soup and of course guo tie (dumplings).The original Shanghainese owner sold his dumplings in a coffeeshop opposite Majestic Theatre (now The Majestic), Chinatown in 1949.\xa0 The business moved to Commonwealth Avenue Cooked Food Centre (Margaret Drive Hawker Centre) in 1972 and when it was demolished in 2011 to make way for new HDB flats, they relocated to Maxwell Food Centre in 2012.We mean it when we say impressive portions for cheap. A $4 order of Pei Jing Noodles ($4/5/6) is almost large enough for a big eater and is packed with prawns, sliced pork, squid, cabbage and wat tan (smooth eggs) in the gravy. The sauce is a typical hor fun gravy that comes with the expected savoury and oil-rich notes. The texture has the right consistency, not too thick or watery, and plus point, not too much starch is added into the mix.The same ingredients and this base gravy is used across all of their noodle dishes (Pei Jing Noodle/Pei Jing Hor Fun/Shanghai Rice Cake) so don’t be surprised if you don’t find much too much difference between them. The saltiness is on the light side for the hor fun and the rice cakes but not so for the noodles. The kansui (alkaline) in the noodles adds saltiness into the gravy thanks to the presence of alkaline salts (sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate).The other must-order dish is their Shanghai-style Hot and Sour Soup ($4/5/6) which has nice balanced spicy, sour and savoury notes and is again chok-full of sliced meat, silken tofu and wat tan. Again the portions are generous for the price, but they do omit certain ingredients — black fungus (wood ear mushroom), bamboo shoots, scallops, dried mushrooms — to keep the prices low.Also seen with every order are their guo tie (pan-fried dumplings) and jiao zi (boiled dumplings) which can be had for $4 (eight pieces). Each dumpling is packed full of soft minced meat, chives and the skins are reasonably thin. They are made in batches throughout the day to maintain its freshness.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

The two stalls gave Blanco Court the reputation for having the best kway chap in Singapore.It is easy to see why — To-Ricos’ kway chap sheets are delicately smooth, pork belly slices nicely tender and their big, small and head intestines are well-stewed, very clean and there are no offensive pig smells.It’s drenched in a rounded, savoury lor (gravy) that is on the lighter side and there is no heavy use of herbs or spices.These are the reasons why it attracts a big crowd, but that said, hardcore kway chap aficionados might find the execution a little too bland and prefer something a little bolder and in-your-face.The business used to have another branch at Ci Yuan Hawker Centre which was run by the owner’s three sons but closed down in late 2018.An interesting bit of trivia: before selling kway chap, the owner used to sell fried chicken and the Brazilian chicken brand he used was called To-Ricos.

That was back in the stagecoach days, before cellophane and styrofoam sanitised the king of fruits to be sold in the supermarket aisles.That was also when the king of stink with spiky shell was still a seasonal attraction, in August and December.\xa0Twice a year, we would look forward to the odious odour from the neighbourhood durian seller, with his pyramid of green “porcupines”, huge baskets for the husks, and large rough brown paperbags for bulk buys.The tools of his bi-annual trade were thick gloves, a spatulate knife, and string to tie single purchases.The familiar barter cries would be heard in the evenings by the street corner:“Ho boh?” (Hokkien for “Good or not?”) the buyer would ask.“Pow chia!” (“Guaranteed to be good!”) the seller would claim.You took your chances with the cheap ones; out of 10 that were unopened, there were maybe six hits. You could either eat the fruit on the spot or go home with the treat.For a couple of dollars more, the hawker would prise it open. You were then invited to stick a finger in, leave your print on soft yielding flesh. If it was a poor choice, he would toss it, and move on to the next durian until the customer was satisfied. That was how we closed a durian deal then.Seasoned buyers, too, had their methods: Mother’s first rule about its shape always started our picking process.The next rule was to pick those with thorns far apart, spread wide. This might work for choosing pale, light-coloured, bitter-tasting durians\xa0– I have noticed these to be the choice of older-generation durian eaters. It’s possibly because they ate it at their mother’s knees, and we all know mothers are never in favour of the sweet. The bitterer, the better, for me.When buying, we would always watch the seller, for some might hold the durian in a manner that hides the brown spots (rotten) and show only the good segments. I always tell the seller “I live just there” (point) and will take back if it’s spoilt.Once home, we would lay down old newspapers and eat the durians off them.Whether we ate one seed or all in the durian, mother always made us take a shell to the sink, fill with water and drink water from it. If we were kiasu (Hokkien for “fearful of losing out”), we would add a pinch of salt to the water. In lieu of salt, make a cross sign in the husk, then drink.We did this in faith; faith that could move not only a mountain of durians in our house, but it also guaranteed none of us woke up with a sore throat from the “heaty” fruit \xa0– tied to a Chinese notion on the hot and cold forces flowing through our bodies and how the things we eat and drink affect the balance of this qi.If we had leftovers, the flesh is fermented a little and stirred into santan (Malay for “coconut milk”), mixed with sambal, and eaten with rice. As for the seeds, don’t boil them to turn the insides edible – that’s a preparation method meant for jackfruit seeds, and that should be a seperate eating session.Durian season comes around only so often – we would pass up on the jackfruit and take another walk around the durian plantation for more of the pungent king. Watch out though, if a durian falls and land on any part of your body, it means you’ve been declared to be a wicked person. You wouldn’t want your intentions known, would you?Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/revisiting-hawker-chan-cheapest-michelin-starred-meal/:['When I told my friends of my plan to queue up for “that Michelin Star soy chicken in Chinatown”, it would always illicit the same response: “But why on earth would you want to?”In the case of Liao Fan Hawker Chan Soy Sauce Chicken, its reputation amongst locals is pretty much universal: not as good as before, quality has gone down the drain, was never that good in the first place and so on.Say what you want about Singaporeans. We have many heated arguments over which place serves the better fried Hokkien mee but whenever a prized stall starts franchising or wins numerous awards, international or otherwise, our opinions on the stall instantly becomes universal: we lament about how bad the food has become.Not that you can blame Singaporeans. They — and me included — have seen the sharp decline in food quality once a stall starts winning seemingly prestigious food awards and/or starts expanding.I won’t name places but local foodies will know which stalls I’m referring to when I mention certain famous brands selling curry puffs, bak chor mee, chicken rice and nasi lemak.Hence the common replies I often get when I tell people I am going to review their favourite hawker: “Don’t tell anyone! The queue will get bigger! The quality will go down!”Which brings us to Liao Fan Hawker Chan. The last time I tried the stall was before it won the Michelin Star in 2016. Aside from tasting the soy chickens at the grand opening of its Chinatown branch next to the food centre, I have never gone back since.BEFORE THE STAR AND THE FAMEBack then, it was called Hong Kong Soya Sauce Chicken Rice and Noodle and there were long queues for the soy chicken as it was selling it the cheapest among the many soy chicken stalls in Chinatown. Plus, the food tasted pretty damn good too.For those of you who don’t know the history, Hong Kong Soya Sauce Chicken Rice and Noodle was started by Malaysian-born Chef Chan Hon Meng who learnt how to cook soya sauce chicken from a Hong Kong chef when he apprenticed at the now-defunct New Lam Thong Tea House Pte Ltd in 1989.After working for the restaurant for a decade, he did a brief stint working in a hotel before branching out on his own to start Hong Kong Soya Sauce Chicken Rice and Noodle in 2008.After gaining the honour of being the cheapest Michelin-starred meal in the world, the stall changed its name to Liao Fan Hawker Chan and it now has four outlets in Singapore, with outlets popping up in Melbourne, Perth, Ipoh, the Philippines, Jakarta, Taipei, Bangkok and, of all the unlikeliest countries, Kazakhstan.BACK TO WHERE IT ALL STARTEDWith that backstory, here I was two weeks ago sipping iced coffee and first in line at chef Chan’s original stall in Chinatown Complex an hour before its opening time of 10.30am.There are still queues outside his stall in Chinatown Complex but instead of locals, the crowd demographic is mostly made up of tourists. You won’t see chef Chan there anymore. If he does appear, it is once in a blue moon to check the quality.His wife, Irene Quek now runs the stall with two other helpers, and out of all the meats, only the chickens are now braised onsite. The other roasted meats are transported from its main roasting kitchen at the other Chinatown outlet, located next to the food centre.If you come early, you can see her quietly eating her breakfast at the table outside the stall before the madness starts after opening.Two Australian tourists, husband and wife, asked if I was in the queue for Hawker Chan and I nodded my head.“So how is the chicken? Is it really good?”, asked the wife.“Many of the soy chicken stalls do the dish well. It just depends if you like it more or less herbal, sweeter or more savoury. They all have different taste profiles,” I answered honestly.I doubt that was the answer she was looking for.A little before opening, Quek calls the line to start forming and she promptly calls me to place my order.To be very honest, everything looked good. The char siu (barbecued pork) looked nicely caramelised and juicy and the chickens golden and glistening. Only the roasted pork belly (siu yok) looked a bit anaemic, but looks aren’t everything.“Soy chicken, barbecued pork and roasted pork belly for two people please. One plate of noodles,” I ordered in Mandarin. Chan’s wife and her staff were prompt, polite and friendly.The price was still surprisingly low. S$12 or S$13, as opposed to S$18 to S$20 for equivalent portions at other soy sauce chicken stalls that do sell char siu and siu yok.I brought the food to a quiet corner table, began tucking in and was pleasantly surprised.THE TASTE TESTThe marinade has an intense savoury flavour, with a subtle sweetness and five-spice powder flavour to it.A lot of the flavour goes into the chicken skin, which is intensely flavoured. The chicken meat makes for a great first few bites but can get overbearingly salty if you don’t eat it with rice or noodles to balance out the taste.The tenderness of the chicken is passable, but this is the one area where the quality has gone down. I’ve definitely had it softer and more tender at other stalls.The high flavouring of the chicken is the reason why the noodles are plain-tasting — not shrimp roe-flavoured like how some other stalls serve it. That said, they serve a chilli sambal on the side if you’d like it more savoury or spicier.The icing on the cake are the roasted soybeans that come with it. Cooked but with a nice bite, along with that soy flavour.The other meats are excellently done. The char siu has nice layers of fat, is juicy and has a nicely balanced sweet savoury taste, though it could do with a bit more off a charred flavour.The skin of the siu yuk is crunchy and the meat is decently moist.The chilli sauce on the side has a sweet, spicy taste with a bit of tanginess thrown in. It’s a taste you’ll either love or hate. Some people I know don’t like its sweetness.Sad to say, the food quality only applies to Hawker Chan’s flagship stalls in Chinatown, not to its stalls at other locations. The quality there can sometimes be rather embarrassing, though it could be just initial teething problems.Looking at the landscape that is soy sauce chicken in Chinatown, the quality differences between the best soy sauce chicken stalls in the area can be very marginal. Hawker Chan still holds its own, despite its expansion, but only at its original outlet in Chinatown Complex.However, the quality of its other outlets in other parts of Singapore and in other countries is debatable at best.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/waffl/:['Places such as Waffl, located in far-flung Jurong East where the nearest bus stop is a good 10 minutes away, have so much more friction to overcome — customer-wise.\xa0Its location is bereft of casual foot traffic, while its nearest neighbour is a coffee shop that’s brightly lit but struggles with tenants. There’s only one stall actively dishing up food on the evening of my visit.Some may call such isolation charming. I argue that charm applies only if the menu is groundbreaking, delicious and innovative. Waffl, unfortunately, falls short on some fronts.\xa0It’s convenient, though, for the folks living nearby, but outside this Jurong East radius, I find little reason for anyone to traipse to Waffl for ice cream and waffles.Waffl has been in business since April last year. Opened by 30-year-old Lutfil and 27-year-old Joshua, Waffl first launched at the now-shuttered Eatbox at Tekka Place.Going by its lean Instagram page, little has changed by way of the menu on offer.After nearly a year in business, one would expect some kind of menu refresh after rounds of customer feedback.Instead, I see the same food options from 2022 with nary a change. Wait, scratch that — the one change I observed is the removal of a cheese slice from all the waffleburgers. The waffles are great. It’s a small and predictable ask for a place whose moniker leans on the food item. Waffl uses the same batter for both its savoury and sweet menu options.\xa0In terms of waffle excellence, there’s little reason to expect anything but the best. Here, the waffles are thick, perfectly browned and come with a mild chew from a proofing process that’s exemplary.\xa0A case in point: Perhaps the best thing I had on the day of my visit was the Buttermilk Waffl (S$4.90) with a scoop of sea salt toffee nut (S$5) ice cream. This is Waffl’s star product, and it clearly shows.\xa0This reminds me fondly of the iteration I had at Tiong Bahru Bakery and I remember enjoying that through and through. It also helps that though the ice cream here isn’t made in-house, they at least come in compelling flavours such as Milo Godzilla and lavender cheese. When it comes to drinks, the Milo Lava Milk Vanilla (S$6) and the iced lychee ginger (S$4.50) taste homemade — perhaps by design. They’re sweet and comforting.While the waffles are great, the fillings they come with aren’t.\xa0The tuna in the Mashed Tuna Wafflburger (S$9.90) tasted as though it came straight out of a can.\xa0Look, I don’t mind this — canned tuna is delicious and can do no wrong. But this lacks innovation. The eatery could have added something acidic for balance — perhaps some lemon would elevate it. I have the same criticism for the Smoked Salmon Wafflburger (S$10.90) that could do with more imagination. Perhaps the eatery could whip up its own sour cream, throw in some capers and drizzle something acidic over it.The Spicy Chicken Wafflburger (S$9.90) wasn’t my first option for a chicken dish — that would have been the kimchi chicken. But on the advice of the cashier, who said “the spicy chicken is our bestseller”, I made a swap.\xa0I understand why customers like this. What’s not to like about a McSpicy adjacent?\xa0But could it have gone further? Yes. Perhaps some cheese slices or maybe a scrambled egg on top. This had potential.And then there’s the cheese-mayo drizzle. All the waffleburgers here come with a side of potato chips drizzled liberally with the cheese-mayo concoction.\xa0There are many things wrong with this, chief of which is the use of potato chips that lose their crispiness when exposed to air. Tortilla chips would have been a better option.\xa0Also, must everything be with this cloying drizzle of cheese mayo?The same cheese mayo can also be found on the 5-piece cheesy spicy drumlets (S$6). These most likely came from the frozen-food aisle — not that I mind, but again, it came with that cheese-mayo drizzle.\xa0Perhaps Waffl sees no need to be innovative with its menu. It’s, after all, the only shop of its kind in the neighbourhood — there’s no competition to speak of.But food should be exciting. It should be forward-thinking and it must drive curiosity. I can imagine Waffl as the type of cafe people from Pasir Ris drive down to visit, enticed by waffleburgers that are generous, creative and made with love.\xa0Waffl, unfortunately, is what happens when you meet expectations and go no further. Is it conducive to conversation? Yes. Tables were well-spaced, though the bistro can get a little echoey.\xa0Is a reservation necessary? No.How to get there? It’s a 10-minute walk from the nearest bus stop at Block 246 Jurong East Street 24. HungryGoWhere paid for its meal at this cafe for this review. Still hungry?

For the uninitiated, bak ku teh is a pork rib dish, where ribs are simmered in a broth of herbs and spices for hours.At Ya Hua Bak Kut Teh, the bak kut teh broth is always piping hot and the pork ribs tender. And frankly, that’s enough to seal the deal for any decent bak kut teh specialist.Gwee Peck Hua, owner of this bak kut teh stall, was apparently the right hand woman of Ng Ah Sio’s father. And most bak kut teh lovers would know that Ng Ah Sio Bak Kut Teh is one of the most famous bak kut teh outlets in Singapore.Ya Hua’s version comes in two variations — a serving of spare ribs at S$6 (more bone than meat) or a serving of prime ribs (with more tender meat) for S$7. The meat was fresh, tender and tasty for both of types of ribs.But the real star of this stall is the peppery and aromatic teh (soup). The soup was perfect for us; it was hot and peppery, so spicy that it cleared our sinus immediately. It was also very addictive — we had two rounds of refill! Our only complaint was that it was slightly oily.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/nan-rong-chee-cheong-fun/:['Nan Rong Chee Cheong Fun is a name that is probably most familiar to those living in the Boon Keng area.Well-loved by its regulars, the humble hawker stall at Bendemeer Food Centre is known for its tasty and wallet-friendly breakfast fare, including its chee cheong fun (rice noodle roll) that’s going for just S$1. Another aspect that endeared the stall to customers was the friendly uncle who ran the stall.Regretfully, he passed away in December 2022, due to an unfortunate accident at home. The stall closed, much to the sadness of its regular patrons.However, after a three-month-long hiatus, the stall is up and running again, and at its usual spot.If there’s a small silver lining to this poignant incident, it’s that Nan Rong Chee Cheong Fun managed to find a long-term successor to take over the reins.The stall is now run by the late owner’s wife and niece-in-law.\xa0Although some crowd favourites, such as its fried beehoon and yam cake, are not available on the menu, diners will be glad to know that they can still indulge in the signature S$1 chee cheong fun.\xa0\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Junction Westgate opening with promos; will house 23 tenants, including new halal teppanyaki\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHawker Hustlers: Hipster hawker Ray Yeo of Bei-Ing Dimsum Club on reinventing dim sum and his love for all things Japan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe relatives manning the store told HungryGoWhere that they have no plans to change the menu or increase prices for now.The chee cheong fun is a popular dish for good reason. Done in the local-style that involves rice rolls being drenched in a sweet dark sauce and served with a smattering of sesame seeds on top, it oozes homely comfort.While it’s a relatively simple item, you can’t complain about the smooth and silky sheets of rice rolls — especially when the dish is available for an affordable price of S$1. Besides its namesake dish, Nan Rong Chee Cheong Fun has another carby option available if you want to supplement your meal — rice dumplings, or bak zhang.The rice dumplings come in two variations: Chestnut dumpling (S$2.50) and nonya dumpling (S$2.50).While they were not astounding, the dumplings were decently sized for their reasonable price tag. I tried the nonya dumpling, which contained a pleasant sweet-savoury meat filling within a chewy outer layer of glutinous rice. You can request for chilli if you’re craving a spicy punch.Sadly, I never got the chance to taste the late owner’s chee cheong fun. Still, it’s consoling to see the beloved stall continuing on in the good hands of his loved ones.Book a ride to its outlet.Bendemeer Food Centre, 01-11, 29 Bendemeer Road\nNearest MRT station: Boon Keng\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (6.30am to 5pm or until sold out)Bendemeer Food Centre, 01-11, 29 Bendemeer Road\nNearest MRT station: Boon Keng\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (6.30am to 5pm or until sold out)AuthorEvan started off writing about food on Instagram, before joining outlets such as Buro and Confirm Good to pursue his passion.

The panel is made up of the most influential food writers and critics, chefs, restaurateurs, and regional culinary experts in the region.This year’s list features restaurants from 19 cities and includes seven new entries as well as eight re-entries.\xa0Le Du from Bangkok nabbed the top spot as The Best Restaurant in Asia. The restaurant, which has consistently been featured on the list, is lauded for its refined take on Thai food that’s interpreted with French culinary lens. It’s also known to champion local ingredients and produce.The news was unveiled on Tuesday night (March 28) in a live ceremony at Singapore’s Resorts World Sentosa.Nine Singapore restaurants earned a spot among the creme de la creme of Asia, which tied us with Bangkok for the most number of entries on the list.Clinching an impressive sixth place this year is modern French outfit Odette, which is also Singapore’s best-performing restaurant on the Asia’s 50 Best Restaurant list. It inched up two spots from the eighth position last year.At the same time, Odette’s pastry chef Louisa Lim was awarded the Asia’s Best Pastry Chef award — an honour that previously went to Maira Yeo of Cloudstreet.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50% off at picturesque date spots, including Wildseed Cafe at The Alkaff Mansion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt 11th place is Labyrinth, a restaurant focused on innovatively interpreting local flavours.

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/my-must-eats-anthony-tan/:['My Must-Eats is a HungryGoWhere series featuring Singapore’s public figures and their favourite food haunts. This week, we speak to Anthony Tan, CEO of Southeast Asia’s superapp Grab.Being at the helm of a publicly listed company, which offers a multitude of services to millions of users, entails a great deal of commitment.Still, Anthony Tan, chief executive officer of regional superapp Grab — which owns HungryGoWhere — makes it a point to connect with family, friends and colleagues over meals as often as possible. Much like his 2012 self, when he founded the company with Tan Hooi Ling.\xa0The 41-year-old and his wife Chloe Tong, together with their four young children, frequently host dinners at their home.Dinner is never a boring affair, since the family usually orders food from the GrabFood delivery service on such occasions. The options are boundless, spanning a variety of cuisines and budget types.\xa0Yet Anthony Tan’s love for local food is never too far away, as we’ve learnt.\xa0He talks to us about some of his favourite food and the eateries he frequents in Singapore.Some of my fondest memories as a child were of visiting Klang, a city in Malaysia where my mum is from. I would spend a few weekends each year there with my parents and two brothers, and we would have bak kut teh at various local joints.My family would sit at a round table and share a big claypot of caramel-coloured herbal soup. I love having soft-bone ribs in the soup, and would have them with lots of sliced chilli and even more garlic in a dark-soy-sauce dip. I also very much enjoy yu char kway (golden-brown fried dough fritters), which taste great both fresh and crisp, or soaked in warm broth.Interestingly, my wife Chloe also has roots in Klang and spent every Sunday of her growing-up years having bak kut teh there with her family, too! Continuing our childhood tradition, whenever we’re back in Klang with our four kids, we would make sure that bak kut teh is on the menu.In Singapore, there are various bak kut teh outlets that we visit when a craving strikes. One we frequent is Kota Zheng Zong Bak Kut Teh.My family gets 80% of our meals from our favourite “digital food court”, GrabFood!One of my favourite dishes to order is fishball mee pok noodles. I love the rich textures and flavours of this dish. The springy noodles, chewy fishballs and crispy pork lard go perfectly with the salty, sweet and tangy sauce. I always get my mee pok spicy for that extra “kick”.For dessert and tea breaks, I like to have traditional treats such as nonya kuehs. Chalk Farm’s kueh salat is delicious — the custard layer is fragrant and smooth, while the glutinous rice layer is moist and chewy.Chicken rice! With extra chilli and ginger.One of the places my family goes to for chicken rice is Hainanese Delicacy at Far East Plaza.\xa0The chicken is tender and juicy, and the rice flavourful. I’m also partial to the salted-vegetable duck soup there — the vegetables in the soup are boiled so soft they just melt away in your mouth.\xa0Nothing comes to mind immediately — I’ve always been pretty adventurous when it comes to food!When I travel, I always make it a point to eat a variety of local cuisine. Some of my favourite Southeast Asian dishes include:\xa0Durian never fails to impress me.\xa0All my family members are huge fans, and my kids have been indulging in durian even before they started crawling.\xa0We get our durians from GrabFood. My favourite durian varieties are Mao Shan Wang and D24 — I like their creamy texture and bittersweet notes.All the recommendations above are available on GrabFood.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/golden-mile-complex-relocation/:['We’re nearing the end of an era soon: One of Singapore’s most iconic malls, Golden Mile Complex, is reaching its final days.Known informally as the “Little Thailand” of Singapore, the mall is home to several tasty and authentic Thai eateries, Thai supermarkets and food kiosks, as well as bustling nightlife spots.Sadly, long-time tenants and customers are making preparations to say their final goodbyes, as the mall will be vacated in May for redevelopment.Golden Mile Complex’s impending closure is the result of an eye-watering S$700 million sale to a consortium in May 2022, after the historic landmark received more than 80% of owners’ consent for an en bloc sale.But where will Singaporeans go for their comforting, spice-rich Thai food fixes from now on, and what will happen to the perennial crowd favourites?\xa0To make things easier for you, we did some digging and came up with a handy guide on where the most popular restaurants have relocated, or will be relocating, to.155 Kitchener Road, 01-01\nOpen: Wednesday to Monday (11am to 10pm)Why visit? Having been in operation for over two decades, BeerThai House is one of the most recognisable establishments within Golden Mile Complex.\xa0Many Thai food lovers swear by its hearty and affordable dishes that are authentic, yet tweaked ever-so-slightly to fit local taste buds. There are now two outlets — one at Kitchener Road and the other at the nearby City Gate at Beach Road, which houses many other former tenants, too.Price range: $$Crowd favourites: The menu at BeerThai is pretty extensive, but if you’re prone to decision paralysis, its classic dishes are always a safe bet. There’s nothing quite like digging into its addictively tangy salads (S$15) or tom yum soup (S$15) to clear your palate after a sinful night of drinking.171 Telok Ayer Street\nOpen: TBCWhy visit? Traditional Thai boat noodles aren’t the easiest to find in Singapore. Most of the bigger franchises specifically modify their recipes to appeal to the locals, so Tha Chang Noodle Bar is a refreshing option.\xa0It’s one of the more commonly recommended spots for a bowl of piping-hot boat noodles that stay faithful to its roots. Surprisingly, its new outlet is located in the swanky area of Telok Ayer.Price range: $Crowd favourites: The boat noodles at Tha Chang, while traditional in taste, aren’t actually offered to you in typical tiny bowls. But we’re not complaining, because small bowls would hardly satisfy that craving! When here, make sure you indulge in a bowl of comforting special pork boat noodle (S$7.90) or special beef boat noodle (S$8.90) that come with a hearty broth served with a heap of ingredients.ARC380, 01-15, 380 Jalan Besar\nOpen: TBCWhy visit? While most of our list comprises Thai-style “zi char” (cook and fry) eateries who have an extensive menu of Thai dishes, Baan Kanom Thai is more of a kiosk. It specialises in unique Thai-style desserts and snacks and can be found in Golden Mile Complex’s well-loved Thai Supermarket.\xa0The shop, which first began as a home-based business selling Thai cuisine before the owners set up their dessert shop in the mall, will move to ARC380. Slated to open on April 18, the standalone eatery will bring back some of its savoury bestsellers during its home-based business days to supplement the sweeter lineup.Price range: $Crowd favourites: Desserts are obviously one of the must-haves here — especially the Thai pancakes that are available in flavours such as pandan (S$5.50/10 pieces) and sweet potato (S$6/10 pieces), or the original Thai crispy pancakes (S$5/eight pieces).Other than that, savoury options such as the fragrant basil pork rice (S$8) and decadent grilled lemongrass chicken (S$25) are worth a try, too.Aperia Mall, 01-53A, 12 Kallang Avenue\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (24 hours)Why visit? Granted, Nana Original Thai has already branched out of Golden Mile Complex way before the en bloc rumblings began, but it still remains a hot favourite for a no-frills meal at the mall.Its new outlet at Aperia Mall near Lavender will better serve those who frequent the Beach Road store regularly, since its other two locations are in the west at Clementi and in Orchard at Far East Plaza.\xa0Price range: $$Crowd favourites: Everyone knows how satisfying a well-fried plate of pad thai can be. However, regulars of Nana Original Thai recommend its lesser known sibling, the pad si yu (from S$11.10) — a satisfying sweet-savoury plate of stir-fried kway teow done Thai-style.City Gate, 02-03, 371 Beach Road\nOpen: TBCWhy visit? Many foodies who regularly use social media would have heard of Flying Pig at Golden Mile Complex a few years back, when its crab omelette rice went viral within local foodie circles.Although this Thai eatery only opened in 2021 and is relatively new compared to many of the heavyweights in this list, it’s got just as many loyal customers filling up its tables on Friday nights.Price range: $$Crowd favourites: Flying Pig’s viral S$10 crab omelette rice might not be S$10 anymore but it’s still a fine deal. For S$12, you get a decent amount of chunky crab meat to go with the silky, creamy omelette topped on a bed of fragrant rice.City Gate, 01-05 and 01-17/18, 371 Beach Road\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (10am to 10pm)Why visit? Have you really been to Golden Mile Complex for Thai food if you hadn’t at least given Diandin Leluk a try? We’re talking about a storied establishment that has amassed numerous fans since its inception in 1985, more than three decades ago.Most would remember the affordable Thai eatery for its sprawling space on the first floor of its original location. Its move to City Gate will see its space split into two smaller units located at different sides of the mall. Not only that, its cleaner and more refined new look will take regulars a while to get used to.Price range: $Crowd favourites: If you are nursing a Thai food craving, you won’t find many famous Thai eateries priced as reasonably as Diandin Leluk, which is offering set lunch promotions at S$8.90 nett.\xa0Available from Monday to Friday between 11.30am and 3pm, each set comes with a main dish, soup, drink, and dessert. Main course choices include the tried-and-tested classics, such as pad thai and pineapple rice.Aperia Mall, 01-40, 12 Kallang Avenue\nOpen: TBCWhy visit? Dee Tongue Thai by Rung Mama is another stalwart at Golden Mile Complex. Around since the 80’s, the unpretentious eatery focuses on authentic Thai offerings that feel like comforting home-cooked food by Thai locals. Here, homemade sauces, flavourful marinades and chilli feature heavily in its dishes to deliver unique flavours.After its last day at Golden Mile Complex on April 2, it will relocate to Aperia Mall, where it’ll join other familiar names such as Nana Original Thai and Thai Supermarket.Price range: $$Crowd favourites: As is the norm at many of these authentic Thai eateries, the tom yum soup (S$12/15) here is a popular dish that’s found on almost every table. Other than that, many of its fans seemed to have developed a strong attachment to its juicy and succulent grilled moo ping (Thai-style grilled pork skewers with sweet-savoury marinade, S$12).HomeTeamNS Balestier, 01-07, 31 Ah Hood Road\nOpen: TBCWhy visit? Of course, we can’t end off a compilation of popular Golden Mile Complex food haunts without including at least one option on mookata buffets. Sure, good mookata places are relatively easy to find these days, but nostalgia just hits differently when you feast at a spot like Cheese Story Mookata.Instead of the popular nearby venues, it’ll be relocating to HomeTeamNS Balestier in May, which is about a 15-minute walk from Toa Payoh MRT station. Bonus: If you’re itching for a karaoke sesh after dinner, Ten Dollar Club is also conveniently located in the same building!Price range: $$$Crowd favourites: Suffice to say, people head here for one reason only, and it’s for Cheese Story Mookata’s affordable buffet (from S$29.90). For that price, you’ll be treated to a glut of marinated meats and seafood including crayfish and salmon. You even get free-flow drinks and ice cream — what’s not to love?For more ideas on what to eat, check out our guide on Clarke Quay eateries or coffee-shop and hawker stalls in Sengkang.Beerthai House, Tha Chang Noodle Bar, Nana Original Thai, Baan Kanom Thai, Flying Pig, Diandin Leluk, and Dee Tongue Thai are on the GrabFood delivery service and offer free delivery (up to S$3 off) with GrabUnlimited.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/oljava/:['Not all authentic Indonesian cuisine is at Lucky Plaza, but you can be sure it has some of the best ones in Singapore.\xa0One we recently discovered is Ol’Java, a fuss-free eatery on the second floor with an old-timey feel, warung-like ambience and a finger-licking array of lesser-known specialties.Barely four months old, Ol’Java takes over the former premises of Gading Street Food, another Indonesian restaurant that has since moved away down Orchard Road.\xa0A glance at the wall tells us about the founder’s vision: Serving Indonesian dishes she loves from her homeland of East Java, particularly the port city of Surabaya. These include street snacks, soups, curries and some rice dishes that are hard to come by anywhere around Singapore.With how Indonesian food is typically priced in Singapore, the S$7.50 to S$15.30 you pay for mains isn’t a bad deal at all. What more for food as authentic as this.\xa0I visited Surabaya in my university days seven years back and thoroughly enjoyed every meal, served by cordial stallowners that barely spoke English.\xa0If you’re into Indonesian food, you’ve to put this on your list, especially if you end up hungry in the middle of Orchard Road.The nasi campur legend Surabaya is hardly the most pretty thing I’ve eaten this week, mostly because of the clumpy strands of semur soun, the sweet-and-savoury vermicelli flavoured with kecap manis (Indonesian sweet soy).\xa0Its taste is another matter. This moreish dish is complete with a boiled egg stewed in soy and spice, and a puffy tofu steeped in curry (I also get hints of lemongrass). The set comes with either stewed chicken (S$10) or sambal beef (S$11). The beef isn’t as spicy as it sounds, but it’s flavourful and tender enough to split with your fork.The accompanying sambal belacan, by contrast, is hot enough to make pepper munchers break out in a sweat. If you can brave the heat, it’s a little garlicky, a little sweet, a little umami, and just delicious. You’ll find this same chilli in most of the dishes at Ol’Java.There’s a dish called ketupat elite (S$7) with an uncanny likeness to lontong, sharing that combination of boiled rice cakes in sayur lodeh (vegetable coconut milk curry), with the addition of fried coconut shreds and tempeh.\xa0The light curry is intensely aromatic (great for a coconut-milk lover like myself), the bite-sized vegetables are soft enough, and the tempeh is earthy and nutty. The namesake ketupat soaks up the gravy well, while holding its firm texture. It’s overall a compelling dish with an awesome name.On to the bebek Madura (S$11.50), a dish from the Madura Island just off the northeastern coast of Java.\xa0Duck is something I eat every time I go to Indonesia, preferably from restaurants that serve only one type of dish: Deep-fried duck in a crumbed coating that arrives so fresh it crisps up on the plate.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50% off at picturesque date spots, including Wildseed Cafe at The Alkaff Mansion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe one here is quite comparable: Crack open the skin to get to the salty meat underneath, soft enough to fall from the bone with a light touch.\xa0On top is a sprinkling of something called kremes — fine-crumbled batter that’s a common topping for fried poultry across Indonesia. The bebek Madura also comes with fried tofu and tempeh on rice.Buah keluak, the black jewel of Peranakan cooking, is used in rawon (S$8.50) — the traditional Javanese beef buah keluak soup famous in places such as Surabaya and Malang.\xa0The best rawon — boiled for hours until the beef is soft and the soup rich with buah keluak’s slight bitterness — should be black but not too thick. And Ol’Java delivers.For those unfamiliar with nasi kuning, the dish name translates to turmeric rice, which is why the rice has a bright-yellow hue. The grains are also cooked with coconut milk, making this a particularly fragrant and moist treat.\xa0The traditional nasi kuning comes with chicken (S$10.80), beef (S$11.80), or complete (S$14.80 — both chicken and beef). Like the Madura duck, the chicken option comes crisp with a light batter, although I found the meat to be a tad drier.\xa0There are fluffy omelette shreds, a stuffed mashed-potato fritter (perkedel) that’s crisp-edged and fine, and most interestingly, tempeh that’s been candied to bring out its addictive maltiness. I can’t fathom why the sate ayam naked or naked chicken satay (S$8.50 for four sticks) has such a scandalous name, but I do know it’s a must-try despite its somewhat steep price.\xa0Sizeable chunks of chicken leg are marinated and grilled on charcoal till the edges are crisp and charred. It makes all the difference; the meat is sweet, juicy and tender.Instead of the peanut sauce commonly served in Singapore, you get chilli padi swimming in thick dark soy — I prefer this to the former.\xa0If you managed to finish every speck of sambal on your plate, you probably deserve a drink. Help yourself to some soft drinks from the fridge or get the iced kopi kampung (S$4.80), a refreshing dark-roasted coffee with fresh milk and gula jawa (Indonesian palm sugar).It’s the sugar that makes this distinct from Western iced coffee, accentuating the beans’ natural sweetness with its caramel and butterscotch notes. Don’t worry, it’s not excessively sweet.Egged on by reviews I saw online, I ordered some fried chicken skin (S$7.50) for the table.\xa0The large pieces are crispy, yes, but also as bland as it gets. A sprinkling of salt and cayenne pepper, perhaps even some lime, would be perfect. You could probably eat this with sambal, but with such huge chunks of skin, it’d be difficult to get them coated nicely.Is it conducive to conversation? Turnaround is high during peak hours, but if you’re coming in the mid-afternoon — definitely.Is a reservation necessary? Walk-ins only.How to get there?

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/boat-quay-bars/:['Located just around the corner from party central, Clarke Quay, Boat Quay can sometimes be seen as its underrated cousin when it comes to Singapore’s nightlife.\xa0Well, we think there are loads it can offer. Not only is Boat Quay conveniently located right beside Raffles Place, it also houses some of the most charming and rustic shophouses that come with spectacular views of the Singapore River.Best of all, when night falls, the small enclave — home to a thriving restaurant and bar scene — comes alive, so don’t underestimate what it can offer.\xa0Its accessibility is a bonus if you work in the CBD — pop by for a quick and refreshing pint after work to wash off the stress of the day.If deadlines have you on the brink of burnout and you’re looking for a reprieve, read on to find out which bars at Boat Quay you can unwind at.26 and 27 Boat Quay\nOpen: Monday and Tuesday (3pm to 12am), Wednesday to Friday (11.30am to 12am), Saturday and Sunday (12pm to 12am)Why visit? One of the rowdiest drinking spots at Boat Quay, The Penny Black is a charming place that is done up in the style of a Victorian tavern. According to the pub, its rustic fittings were designed and built in England by master craftsmen, then shipped piece by piece to Singapore in 1999.After dark, you’ll often find hordes of expats flooding in from the neighbouring skyscrapers to enjoy a smooth pint and, on match days, to watch a game of football. If you’re looking for unpretentious fun and fresh beers from the tap, this pub will definitely scratch that itch.Price range: $$$Crowd favourites: Since it’s modelled after an old-school English pub, it’s one of the places you can go for authentic beer-battered fish n chips (S$26), complete with fries, tartar sauce and mushy peas.

The Public House is a watering hole with plenty of personality and old-school charm. A cosy and anything-goes sort of bar, it feels a bit more vintage and dated than some of its Boat Quay compatriots — in a good way.Besides its whimsical decor, another highlight that makes this quirky joint so popular is its casual ambience, thanks to its spacious al fresco seating area along an alleyway that connects Boat Quay to Circular Road.Price range: $$Crowd favourites: Don’t come here expecting finesse in the food — what it offers are some satisfying local favourites to go with the drinks, such as chicken satay (from S$10), prawn paste wings (from S$12) and sotong balls (S$13). 56 Circular Road\nOpen: Monday to Thursday (11am to 12am), Friday (11am to 2am), Saturday (12pm to 2am)Why visit?

In 1972, half of the shop was adapted towards making and selling steamed dumplings and noodles.Its xiao long bao gained fame for the level of artistry that goes into making them — each delicious morsel comprises succulent pork and rich broth encased in a delicate skin that has precisely 18 folds on its surface. They are then steamed in a bamboo basket.Eventually, as Din Tai Fung began to explode in popularity thanks to the quality and taste of its dumplings, it rebranded into a full-fledged restaurant. Since then, it has garnered international acclaim and won numerous awards. Din Tai Fung was even lauded as one of the “top 10 gourmet restaurants in the world” by The New York Times in 1993.Today, Din Tai Fung is a globally recognisable brand with outlets all over the world, including Singapore, the United States and Hong Kong, the branch that earned the brand its first Michelin star in 2010.While Din Tai Fung has been available on delivery platforms for a number of years, offering comforting fare such as fried rice, noodles, soup, steamed buns and appetisers, it has never offered its xiao long bao for delivery — until now.The soupy steamed dumplings will be available for orders on GrabFood for around two months, from Feb 6 to Mar 31. This will apply to all Din Tai Fung outlets on GrabFood. Operating hours will follow the outlet’s stipulated hours on the delivery platform.To complete your feast, don’t forget to pair the dumplings with other signatures from the restaurant, including the fluffy and aromatic fried rice with pork chop, nourishing steamed chicken soup and the flowy steamed custard buns.Din Tai Fung is on the GrabFood delivery service.

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/8-affordable-japanese-restaurants/:['Perhaps it’s the fact that Japanese cuisine relies heavily on fresh seafood ingredients, or that Singaporeans are serious Japanophiles — Japanese cuisine has always been somewhat expensive here if you’re looking for quality and delicious fare.\xa0But as the Japanese food scene in Singapore evolves, we’re seeing more independent restaurants popping up to provide affordable experiences at lower cost.\xa0Sure, with Japanese food, you pay for what you get. But these eight hidden gems will defy your expectations while keeping you within your budget.Cross Street Exchange, 01-42, 3 Pickering Street\nOpen: Monday to Saturday (11.30\u202fam to 3pm, 6pm to 10pm)Raffles City Shopping Centre, 03-28A, 252 North Bridge Road\xa0\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (11.30am to 3pm,\xa0 6pm to 10pm)Why visit? Koji Sushi is a trendy and casual hideout that’s conveniently located in the central business district area. Speed and affordability is the name of the game here, as it caters mostly to a bustling office crowd. Simple, no-frills dishes made with fresh seafood and other ingredients are served here – and who can say no to that?\xa0Price range: $$Crowd faves: Keep things affordable with its set A (S$10) sushi set consisting of salmon, tuna, swordfish, sea bream and sweet prawn. If you’re a small eater, this just might be enough since the set is served with either soup or salad. If you’re feeling peckish, ordering a second set still keeps you within budget. Alternatively, try the sashimi rice bowl (S$22) or the salmon and roe rice bowl (S$22) for something more filling.\xa0Harbourfront Centre, 01-76A, 1 Maritime Square\nOpen: Monday to Friday (11.30am to 9.30pm), Saturday and Sunday (11am to 9.30pm)Clarke Quay Central, 01-68/69, 6 Eu Tong Sen Street\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (11.30am to 10pm)Why visit? The wide selection of dishes at Hitoyoshi Yoshi Sushi is its biggest draw. Aside from sushi, the place serves ramen, rice bowls and much more. There are plenty of choices for those looking for standard Japanese fare crafted with quality ingredients, while still remaining affordable.\xa0Price range: $$Crowd faves: It’s hard not to love a good aburi salmon mentaiko platter (S$12.80) with its umami and smoky flavours. Those dining in bigger groups can also opt for the giant chirashi don (S$42.90) for an even better bargain, since the cost can be shared between three to four people. Otherwise, a hearty and healthy serving of salmon avocado don (S$12.90) will do nicely.\xa0Jem, 04-13, Jurong Gateway Road\xa0\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (11am to 10pm)Why visit? Simply put, Musubi is not like other Japanese restaurants. It specialises in Japanese tapas and seiro gohan — flavoured steam rice with an assortment of savoury toppings. The establishment also makes its koji in-house, using it to give its mains, small bites, drinks and more a complex flavour.\xa0If you’re a certified greenhorn to the west side, Musubi is a hidden gem that’s fuss-free and affordable. If you’re grabbing lunch here, the lunch menu offers a S$2.80 combo set where you can get tonjiru, a pork and vegetable miso soup, or chawanmushi, a Japanese steamed egg. Top-up S$6 for your choice of a side dish.Price range: $$Crowd faves: Musubi’s shio-koji Aomori salmon seiro gohan (S$16) is its signature for good reason. Who could resist the delicate and salty salmon roe served with broiled salmon and its flavoured rice? For a light appetiser, go for the steam mix vegetable (S$10) or metty pork belly bao (S$6). Be Beaute, 01-02, 10 Anson Road\nOpen: Sunday to Friday (4pm to 10.30pm) Why visit? With pages of manga plastered on the walls and vibrant red stools dotting its space, Shitamachi Sakaba Sumida nails the casual, nondescript Japanese izakaya vibe. It helps that it’s Japanese-owned, too. Though small, the izakaya is popular among the Japanese for its authentic dishes. Because seats are so rare, you may want to drop them a call at 8280 0481 to reserve a spot for yourself.\xa0Price range: $Crowd faves: While you can expect a huge variety of sake, shochu, whisky, and beer, don’t expect a wide range of meals. As izakayas go, most dishes are smaller-portioned appetisers, such as the potato salad (S$7) and the grilled rice ball (S$8). If you’re hungry, the chef has also introduced a daily special, today’s claypot rice (S$17), too.Kensington Square, 01- 50, 2 Jalan Lokam\xa0\nOpen: Wednesday to Monday (11.30am to 10.30pm)Why visit?

It’s also got an extensive menu, from skewers to bento sets, with an impressive food quality.\xa0Price range: $$Crowd faves: Get the house special soft shell crab roll (S$22) to share with your friends or the rainbow roll (S$20) for something a little more ’gram worthy. For mains, the Iberico pork secreto udon (S$21.50) with its beautifully charred top will surely impress you. To finish the meal, have Shifudo’s daichi shokuhin mochimore (S$3.50), an ice cream with soft centre that is wrapped with mochi skin, which comes in seven assorted flavours.\xa0Plaza Singapura, 06-11, 68 Orchard Road\nOpen: Sunday to Thursday (11.15am to 9.30pm), Friday and Saturday (11.15am to 10pm)\xa0Why visit?

Its flavourful, savoury-sweet broth and handmade udon noodles have ensured that it attracts a steady stream of patrons, so do expect a short queue when you’re there.\xa0Price range: $$Crowd faves: With udon in its moniker, it’s predictably our go-to option. The sanuki beef onsen egg udon (S$13.20) is the bestseller as it comes with tender beef slices and a runny onsen egg. For something much richer, try the black garlic tonkotsu udon (S$12.80) as the creamy tonkotsu broth is doused with a generous layer of its housemade black garlic oil.\xa0\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Junction Westgate opening with promos; will house 23 tenants, including new halal teppanyaki\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50% off at picturesque date spots, including Wildseed Cafe at The Alkaff Mansion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBukit Timah Plaza, B1-55A/60, 1 Jalan Anak Bukit\xa0\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (11.30am to 4pm, 5.30pm to 9.30pm)Why visit?

Cubes of assorted sashimi, prawn, tamago, and tobiko are served atop a bed of fluffy sushi rice. Truffle oil is drizzled on the prawn and tamago to give the dish its alluring scent.\xa0Golden Mile Tower, 01-02/04/38, 6001 Beach Road\nOpen: Monday to Thursday (5pm to 12am), Friday and Saturday (5pm to 1am) and Sunday (5pm to 10.30pm)Why visit? Housed within the grey, antiquated-looking building that is Golden Mile Tower, Yorimichi Yakitori Izakaya is an underrated gem that’s worth a visit. While it has a rather weathered look with warm ambient lights and fake cherry blossoms hanging from the ceiling, the vibe here is homely and comforting.\xa0Price range: $$Crowd faves: Yorimichi is best known for its delectable skewers. For a good introduction to the varieties on offer, the kushi yaki set (S$16.80) has five different flavours of chicken thigh, chicken wing, pork, and enoki and shiitake mushrooms.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/geylang-serai-ramadan-bazaar-food-2023/:['The annual Geylang Serai Ramadan Bazaar is back with a bang this year —\xa0larger-scale and longer than before. Running from March 17 to April 22, it’s a whopping 36 days of fun and feasting for everyone.\xa0“Bigger” appears to be the theme for bazaars and markets this year. Similar to the pop-up exhibition ArtBox, the Geylang Serai Ramadan Bazaar has gotten an upgrade, boasting some 700 stalls. This is a tenfold increase from the 70 stalls last year.\xa0Of these 700 stalls, about 150 will be serving food. Most food stalls are located near Tanjong Katong Complex, along Geylang Road and Engku Aman Road.\xa0Though it appears to be an overwhelming space to cover, many stalls appear in multiple sections. For example, you’ll find stalls such as Ah Moi Thai Tea, and Meat My Meat in different sections of the bazaar, so you wouldn’t be missing out on much if you skipped exploring some areas.\xa0\xa0Some big names appearing at the bazaar include Whiskdom, a well-known local bakery, and Fooditute’s Praffles, a prata and waffle hybrid boasting a crinkly, buttery exterior.\xa0Unfortunately, we noticed that quite a number of stalls have not been taken up, in part due to high rental costs, according to some news reports.A post shared by HungryGoWhere (@hungrygowhere)We began our food journey at the bazaar area closest to Tanjong Katong Complex, and immediately made a beeline for Rosti Haus.\xa0Initially attracted by its offer of the unique arayes, a Middle Eastern stuffed pita dish, we deferred to the safer option – a Swiss rosti with chicken sausage (S$12).Thankfully, it was a hit. We gulped down the savoury dish within minutes. It was slightly oily but we didn’t mind. The accompanying sour cream added a slight tang that cut through the greasiness.\xa0There are plenty of drink options available to accompany your meals. Live food stall specialist Sofnade is offering one litre buckets of Thai milk tea, chendol and more (S$5).\xa0If you prefer something with a more nostalgic touch, try the drinks from Gaosyp. This quirky and colourful brand is known for its watermelon milk (S$6.50) and Solero (S$6.50), a lemonade and milk combination inspired by the childhood ice-cream brand.\xa0\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReview: Magg by Royz Et Vous takes humble Maggi noodles to the next level\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Feuds: Zam Zam Restaurant vs Victory Restaurant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12 bakeries for old-school pastries and traditional bread in Singapore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the other side along Engku Aman Road, you can find Picanhas, the halal steakhouse that specialises in secondary steak cuts, making it slightly more affordable.\xa0We got the People’s steak and mash (S$18), served with the eatery’s curry cornflake meringue that’s only available at its pop-ups. It will also have different specials on the menu every day.If you prefer something easier to munch on while on-the-go, try Happy Monkeyz’s Anak Abu (S$6), its original Roti John, an omelette sandwich served with onions and minced meat. Aside from the aforementioned dishes, you can also find local favourites at the bazaar, such as vadai, apam balik and kebab.\xa0Given how pricey meals are these days, the bazaar isn’t all that bad. Back at the height of its popularity, the bazaar was already offering food items at around S$10, so we can’t say we were surprised that some of the food items were priced around that range.\xa0Instead of just snacks and finger food, there are now many stalls serving pretty hefty and modern mains, including lobster rolls (S$16) from House of Lobster.\xa0Although its opening hours are from 10am, most stalls only operate in the evening, so it’s best to head down then.\xa0If you’re pressed for time, keep your endeavours between the main area along Engku Aman Road and the area outside Tanjong Katong Complex. Most food options are available there.\xa0\xa0\xa0For more ideas on what to eat, read our stories on Singapore’s first chicken-only Korean barbecue and late-night dessert spots.\xa0Picanhas, Whiskdom and Meat my Meat are on the GrabFood delivery service and offer free delivery (up to S$3 off) with GrabUnlimited.

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/my-must-eats-nadia-samdin/:['My Must-Eats is a HungryGoWhere series featuring Singapore’s public figures and their favourite food haunts. This week, we speak to Nadia Ahmad Samdin, Member of Parliament for Ang Mo Kio group representation constituency.Member of Parliament (MP) and lawyer Nadia Ahmad Samdin has worn many hats in her career. Previously a current affairs producer for regional news network CNA and an associate director at TSMP Law Corporation, she now works as a counsel and project leader at social enterprise Tri-Sector Associates.\xa0Nadia, 33, is also the youngest MP in Singapore, and you can often find her pounding the pavement in the constituency she serves. It’s quite evident that she knows her Cheng San-Seletar division well, given that many of her food picks are found in the area and well-loved by residents.\xa0Chatting with HungryGoWhere, Nadia admits she’s not particularly bold when it comes to food. “I tend to be loyal to my favourite foods and have a pretty safe palate. My husband, on the other hand, is a little more adventurous and is more likely to try everything once,” she says.From bakeries to halal joints and supper haunts, Nadia talks to us about some of her foodie favourites.My dad would often dabao (take away) breakfast from Geylang Serai for us to eat back home. Gandos (a traditional Indonesian snack made with rice flour and coconut-based batter) or lontong goreng (stir-fried rice cakes) were my absolute favourites.\xa0For lunch, it would usually be nasi padang dishes, which we then ate with rice. My brother would choose fishball soup or hotplate tofu, while I like pucuk ubi (tapioca leaves) and ayam goreng berempah (spiced fried chicken).I also associate food with special festive seasons, which were especially fun as children.\xa0During Hari Raya, my husband favours ayam masak merah (spicy tomato chicken), while I’m on team ayam lemak chilli padi (chicken cooked in a spicy coconut milk curry), so we often order both! Our go-to is Adil.Co at 86 Bedok North Street 4, or if I’m in my constituency, then from Selera Istimewa at Cheng San Market and Cooked Food Centre.On my mum’s side, I think of the Nyonya salad she makes — special nutty chilli sauce with hardboiled egg, tomato, cucumber, lettuce and prawn — and my grand aunty’s century egg with sliced ginger, or the popiah homemade with love at my grandaunt’s home when I was younger. Can’t quite find a substitute anywhere else.My schedule is a little hectic, so I usually eat on the go.\xa0Buns are my favourite — I like the otah bun from Signature Pineapple Tart.Bread at Cheng San Market and Cooked Food Centre in my constituency, and the one from Swee Heng Bakery. When I have time for a sit-down lunch, I enjoy olive fried rice and cereal tofu from vegetarian eating house Shu Vegetarian at Block 554 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 10.As for late-night food preferences, that would be the prata bomb from Springleaf, or the butter chicken with fried rice from Best Hawa Western & Seafood at Kembangan.\xa0One of my residents also has a home-based business called SoulFull, where she makes small batches of popiah goreng with mint sauce that’s easy to cook in the air fryer! Unless there’s the Prosperity chicken burger available at McDonald’s, then all bets are off.I’m that Singaporean who’d have one or two instant noodle packs in my luggage when I’m overseas.\xa0Many of my friends and colleagues will laugh at me if I don’t include this: I drink a lot of coffee, a taste developed during my law school days — and nights.\xa0My drink order is “kopi peng siu dai kah c” — kopi with a bit of condensed milk, not sugar, and topped up with evaporated milk. It’s really delicious! There are many good options, including good old Ya Kun, Teck Huat Coffee Roti (Chong Boon Market and Food Centre) or Heng Heng Coffee Shop (Cheng San Market and Cooked Food Centre).\xa0I’ll usually pair the drink with a plain pandan waffle with butter from Y2 Bakery (Cheng San Centre) if it’s teatime.Food-wise, I’d miss the bittergourd sliced fish soup with ee mee. I know that sounds oddly specific, but there’s just something very nurturing and comforting about it. I enjoy Halim’s Fish Soup in Ang Mo Kio.\xa0Chicken rice from OK Chicken Rice (Block 721 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 8) and the soto ayam from Rahim Muslim Food (Chong Boon Market and Food Centre) with a chicken thigh are also really power.\xa0Oh, and the wok hei taste of really good fried rice or san lou hor fun (three-tossed flat rice noodles)!\xa0To be honest, I don’t have an adventurous palate. I can eat chicken rice or fish soup every day (laughs). But there are dishes that I would like to try and cook one day.\xa0My mum’s ayam sioh (chicken with tamarind and coriander) is something truly special, which I enjoy every Chinese New Year.\xa0Nyonya dishes can be complex and time-consuming, so I haven’t quite worked up the courage to give them a go.Recently, I tried a creme brulee bombolini from Fluff Bakery, which was really delicious!\xa0And while I’m on the Kampong Gelam food trail, my husband and I have also tried and enjoyed the saffron teh tarik from Tarik near Masjid Sultan (92 Arab Street), the ambeng platter from Padi@Bussorah, pasta from Tipo Pasta Bar, pastries from Mother Dough or Konditori, and of course, institutions such as Kampong Glam Cafe, Rumah Makan Minang and Sabar Menanti.Thinking about these makes me feel really hungry now, so I might have to make a trip down soon.Shu Vegetarian, Springleaf, Best Hawa Western & Seafood, McDonald’s, Ya Kun, OK Chicken Rice, Tarik, Padi@Bussorah, Tipo Pasta Bar, Selera Menanti, and Kampong Glam Cafe are on GrabFood, while Swee Heng Bakery is on GrabMart. There’s free delivery (up to S$3 off) with GrabUnlimited. You can also book a ride to all the eateries mentioned in this article.\xa0\xa0AuthorJoy has more than 14 years of experience as a journalist, editor and content creator.
