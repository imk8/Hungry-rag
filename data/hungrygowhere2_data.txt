https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/space-coffee/:['Geylang may have seen some action from the cafe crowd in recent years, with names such as Geylang Drip City opening in the vicinity some time back.\xa0But its reputation as a local and tourist hotspot remains hinged on its plethora of street eats, durian stalls and seedy vice activities — not an urban, independent cafe serving expensive coffee drinks with its offbeat and arty swagger.Not that it has stopped some people from trying, of course.\xa0Space Coffee is the neighbourhood’s latest entrant, and when we heard that it dishes up its own rendition of the traditional fried carrot cake (in Geylang, of all places), we simply had to bite.One thing’s for sure: This barely two-month-old venture has an attractive space with concrete everything and a splash of rustic textures — leather, copper and wood — that’s in vogue for hip, new cafes of late. When we visited, Space Coffee was coming out of its soft-launch phase, with a full menu to come later this month.\xa0For now, you’ll find a limited menu of six key mains and a series of light bakes.There are some hits and misses, but let’s not be so hasty to judge before the cafe has officially launched.\xa0I quite enjoy its attempt to serve up a slice of nostalgia in its creations, whether it’s the namesake Space carrot cake or the coconut bun.\xa0Are these folk trying to offer something familiar to an older person who might wander in out of curiosity? Perhaps. For now, we’ll keep our eyes out for its official launch and hope to be impressed next time round.First up, is the chai tow kway (carrot cake) here any good? It’s not quite at the same level as Toa Payoh’s Michelin Bib Gourmand Chey Sua Carrot Cake, but it’s not bad.At S$15, the space c.c is surely more expensive than any you’ll find in the area.\xa0The radish cubes are sliced in bigger chunks than what you’ll usually find in hawker centres, and it’s soft to the bite rather than dense — a problem with some versions out there.\xa0Coated in bits of egg, the cubes are well-fried and not overly oily.\xa0The crunchy sprinkle of cai po, or preserved radish, brings everything together nicely.\xa0Could it be smokier with some wok hei (smoky flavour)? Absolutely, but that might be a bit too much to expect.\xa0There are some fairly large prawns that I suggest scooping the accompanying sambal with — the salty and spicy kick was, for lack of a better term, shiok.\xa0There’s a laksa linguine (S$20) that’s kind of good but not incredible.\xa0The al dente pasta soaks up the sauce nicely, which would be great if there was a little more depth to the cream.\xa0I get hints of coconut and shrimp, but what about the accent notes of lemongrass, of blue ginger, of turmeric? At least the prawns were plump and sweet. A few adjustments here and there, and I can see this dish being a signature hit.The brioche French (S$13) came in the form of two massive chunks of brioche soaked in egg, then fried to a rich brown. Between each slice is a slather of chocolate and hazelnut spread and gula melaka sauce — my kind of breakfast.\xa0While I’ve had French toast made with brioche many times, Space Coffee’s version is more chewy and dense than fluffy. For all intents and purposes, this is more reminiscent of min jiang kueh (the thick-ish local pancake) than a French toast.\xa0I’m not sure if that’s what the cafe was going for, but I kind of dig it.If you like Vegemite, that salty, slightly bitter and malty spread from Melbourne, go for the Vege-mite toast (S$12).\xa0This very Australian sandwich sees mozzarella and cheddar melted onto slices of toasted sourdough, with a thin layer of the umami spread. There’s not much cheese-pull action, but it’s a moreish toastie with a unique taste.\xa0At this point, you’re probably wondering about the drinks here. The cafe has “coffee” in its name, after all.\xa0Space Coffee uses beans from Tad Coffee Company, a roastery led by a Singapore barista champion.\xa0The current blend, Anna, is a mix of Ethiopian, Colombian and Ugandan beans. My first thought is that its iced oat milk latte (S$8) is delicious, with a dark chocolate and light cherry sweetness accentuated by the plant-based milk. As for my second thought — gosh, coffee has surely become pricier.The cafe also has something called lemon plum sour (S$6), a modern take on the traditional sour-plum-and-lemon drink you can still get at some old-school coffee shops. It’s a refreshing thirst quencher that’s slightly fizzy, zesty and salty.The problem with cappuccinos, which should have less milk and more foam than lattes or flat whites, in a lot of cafes nowadays is that the milk is often understeamed, sacrificing the signature foam in favour of nice latte art. The one here (S$8 for an oat milk cappuccino) is like that — overly milky and slightly bland.\xa0The matcha (S$7) is on the milder side as well, and I had hoped for a stronger-tasting drink with pleasant bitterness and that light, nutty sweetness I have come to expect from a good matcha latte. Then again, it might just be preference.For now, the cafe’s bakes (S$4.50 to S$5) are supplied by Cloud, another new kid on the block on the Duxton Hill stretch.\xa0There’s stuff such as banana cake, shio pan (sea-salt butter rolls) and chocolate bun, but it’s the coconut bun (S$4.50) that catches my eye, since it’s something that’s easily found in neighbourhood bakeries around Singapore.\xa0The crust cuts open to reveal an interior stuffed with grated coconut that’s been cooked in gula melaka and flavoured with pandan. The filling is yummy, though we wish there was a lot more of it.\xa0The bread itself, particularly the crust, is on the drier end.While there are a few kinks here and there, Space Coffee is still in its first months, and the cafe’s concept holds plenty of promise. Give it a shot and see what you think.Is it conducive to conversation? Yes, the space is suitable for small gatherings.Is a reservation necessary? No reservations needed for now.How to get there? Space Coffee sits in one of the shophouses along Geylang Road, opposite the famous JB Ah Meng. The closest MRT station is Aljunied.HungryGoWhere paid for its meal at this cafe for this review.

It’s none other than the cinnamon roll, a sticky and sweet creation with hints of spice. It typically sports a sugar-coated swirl, but bakeries have been spinning their own unique twist to the classic treat.\xa0\xa0The beloved confection now comes in different flavours, and is often dressed in a myriad of sauces and toppings, such as caramel or cream cheese frosting.\xa0Read on to find out where you can get your hands on one.\xa0Multiple stores islandwide\nOpen: Operating hours vary across storesWhy visit? You must’ve seen Rrooll’s speciality cinnamon roll kiosks around Singapore, since it has multiple outlets islandwide. The halal-certified bakery first debuted at Jewel Changi Airport, and its popularity soon spurred the expansion of takeaway kiosks at various heartland locations.\xa0Each roll is baked to perfection, attested by its tedious dough-making and baking process. Not only are its prices affordable, but the fluffy bread also comes in several addictive flavours (think Milo dinosaur and Biscoff coffee).\xa0Price range: $Crowd faves: If you’re a stickler for tradition, you’ll love the cinnamon classic (S$4). It features Indonesian cinnamon and brown sugar that’s complemented by a dollop of cream cheese frosting. Chocolate lovers will enjoy the cocoa orange (S$3.70) that’s a harmonious blend of tangy and sweet. Raffles City, B1-60, 252 North Bridge Road\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (11am to 8pm)Why visit? Cinnabon’s cinnamon rolls are highly sought after, and for a good reason. The American brand is famed for its sweet and gooey pastries, which come in gigantic portions and a whole lotta toppings.

If you’d like to share the love with your pals, the Cinnabon 4 (from S$26.80 for regular rolls) and Minibon 4 (from S$16.30 for mini rolls) are fantastic for takeaway.\xa0The classic is a fan favourite. It touts a glaze made with Makara cinnamon, and is slathered in Cinnabon’s signature cream cheese frosting. Bugis Junction, B1-K2, 200 Victoria Street\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (10am to 9.30pm)Why visit? Dare we say, Star Cinnamon is one of the “OG” cinnamon roll brands in Singapore.

You’ll love the chocolate peanut butter fudge (S$3.50), which sees a layer of decadent peanut butter and chocolate atop sticky dough. If you can’t decide, fret not. The box of six (S$17) or nine (S$24) allows you to choose an assortment of flavours. Go ahead, we won’t judge.Space @ Kovan, 01-14, 9 Yio Chu Kang Road\nOpen: Wednesday to Friday (9am to 6pm), Saturday and Sunday (9am to 4pm)Why visit? Run by a husband-and-wife team, Three Nuts Baker is a Melbourne-inspired cafe that serves oh-so-pretty pastries, buns and cakes. Its bestseller is undoubtedly the cinnamon rolls, which are adorned with walnuts and a rich caramel glaze.\xa0Price range: $Crowd faves: Don’t sleep on the gooey cinnamon roll (S$5), which houses a thick cinnamon filling. Despite its unassuming appearance, each billowy roll will have you craving more. Thanks to the roasted walnuts, every bite offers a mouthwatering, nutty flavour. There’s also a sweetness from the glaze, which wonderfully balances out the nuttiness. Note that it sells out fast, so head down to the outlet early.\xa0\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Feuds: Saizeriya vs Milan Shokudo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n19 Lorong Kilat Road, 01-06\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (8am to 6pm)Why visit?

The roll served here is a crispy pastry with a warm and soft interior — slightly different from other cinnamon rolls available in Singapore.Price range: $Crowd faves: The no-frills cinnamon roll (S$6.50) is best enjoyed with a cuppa. Yes, it isn’t decorated with eye-catching, vibrant toppings, and it doesn’t contain any (sometimes cloyingly-sweet) filling. Instead, it’s an unpretentious bread boasting a flaky, croissant-like crust. As it slowly unravels, it reveals a billowy, buttery centre that is sure to work up an appetite. 49 Haji Lane\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (11am to 7pm)Why visit?

But for us, our go-to will always be the cinnamon bun. Note that the bakery isn’t halal-certified. However, the goodies are Muslim-friendly and don’t contain alcohol or gelatin.\xa0Price range: $Crowd faves: The cinnamon bun (S$5.60) is certainly dressed to impress. Not only does it come in an enormous size (perfect for sharing!), each one is a pretty lil’ thing that’s laced with a butter and cream cheese spread and topped with a picture-perfect drizzle of frosting.

Case in point: Coffees here are capped at S$6.80.\xa0Offering convenience to its customers is another goal. Its stores are 100% cashierless, which means diners have to download Luckin Coffee’s app on the App Store or Google Play. Orders and payment have to be made via the mobile app.While this eliminates the need to queue and makes transactions more seamless, it might feel a tad troublesome if you aren’t a repeat customer.\xa0In celebration of its launch, the chain is offering patrons any drink for only 99 cents for their first in-app coffee order. Yes, even the most expensive drink.\xa0While it is an opening promotion, representatives for Luckin Coffee have said that the deal is ongoing and will apply to all new users, so you don’t have to rush down for your drink just yet.With quality Arabica beans sourced from top coffee-producing regions and coffee blends curated by a team of World Barista Championship winners, there’ll be high hopes for the coffees served at Luckin Coffee.\xa0Luckin Coffee’s most acclaimed drink is its original creation, the iced coconut latte (S$6.40). It uses cold-pressed raw coconut milk to infuse the nutty, tropical aroma into the coffee drink.\xa0If you’re unsure what to order, this would be the safest bet. Luckin Coffee has sold more than 300 million cups of the drink to date. You can have it at regular sweet, less sweet or no syrup.\xa0We found the regular sweet to be slightly overpowering, and would opt for no syrup if you prefer a stronger coffee fragrance.\xa0You can also customise the sweetness level for almost all the drinks ordered at Luckin Coffee. Fascinatingly, even the Americano (from S$4.80) has the option of regular sweet, less sweet, vanilla syrup (extra 50 cents) and no syrup.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTalad Thai Banana opens at AMK Hub with S$2 opening promotion for the first 100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoffee connoisseurs can enjoy drinks from Luckin Coffee’s Single Origin Espresso (SOE) series.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/xiabu-xiabu-singapore/:['We all know Singaporeans are particularly obsessed with two things — bubble tea and hotpot.There are some popular places to get your fix for both, such as the popular Coucou that opened last year. But Xiabu Xiabu, a beloved brand from China, takes it one notch further. It allows you to enjoy both delights, at the same time, and in individual portions. Founded in Beijing in 1998, Xiabu Xiabu has established itself as one of the most popular hotpot chains in China, boasting more than 1,000 outlets. The brand’s Singapore outlet, which opened on Jan 25 at Lazada One, is also its first overseas outlet.\xa0Unlike its sister brand Coucou, which is run by the same parent company, Xiabu Xiabu focuses entirely on bringing affordable personalised hotpot options to Singapore. The name originates from the Japanese term “shabu-shabu” and translates to “individual hotpot” in Hokkien.In line with its belief in providing an affordable personal hotpot experience, the menu offers a variety of sets that start from S$25. All sets include a soup base of your choice, vegetable platter, a drink, free-flow condiments, and access to the dessert bar.Sets range from basic combinations, such as the vegetarian set (S$25) and popular beef set (S$28), to the fancier seafood and beef set (S$38) for those with more exquisite palates.Each individual hotpot comes with a mini default mushroom soup, which is accompanied by your choice of broth that includes the classic tomato and golden sauerkraut.\xa0Or, if you like, you can spice things up with the unique Nanyang curry (+S$2) or hot and spicy in Sichuan style (+S$2) soup bases, too.If the set is not enough, a variety of a la carte options are available to enrich your soup. Some popular options include squid paste (S$10) and Fuzhou fishballs (S$9).\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15 best fish head curry in Singapore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBesides the abundance of hot food options, Xiabu Xiabu also offers an extensive tea menu from Tea Me Tea, which is also served at Coucou. This includes everyone’s favourite drink, the\xa0bubble tea.For the sets, it’s a choice between the da hong pao or aged pu er\xa0tea, but you can top up the difference for more indulgent beverage options, such as the signature da hong pao bubble tea (S$5.80) or cold brew pu er with coffee & coconut milk (S$6.20).Xiabu Xiabu is on the GrabFood delivery service.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/xiabu-xiabu/:['We love our hotpot and the latest entrant to Singapore’s highly competitive market is Beijing-born brand Xiabu Xiabu.\xa0As things stand, it’s a pretty saturated market with giants such as Haidilao and Beauty in The Pot dividing the masses.\xa0Yet Xiabu Xiabu remains optimistic with its USP — individual hotpots for each guest and bar counter seats for dining in.\xa0Although Xiabu Xiabu opened its first store in Singapore only in late January, the brand is prevalent throughout China with more than 1,000 stores. In 2013, it was named one of the largest chain catering enterprises in China.\xa0Its sister brand, Tea Me Tea, is a nod to their Taiwanese founder, and operates both as a separate cafe next door as well as add-ons on the Xiabu Xiabu menu.\xa0The spanking new restaurant at Lazada One seemed to be the most brightly lit place along the quiet Bras Basah stretch of road when we visited on a Wednesday evening, drawing to it some curious stragglers wandering by.\xa0If you haven’t been here before (nor has your plus-one), then you might need some help decoding the menu.\xa0You’ll first have to choose what soup base you’re getting, and each selection will come with a side of Xiabu Xiabu’s signature mushroom soup base.\xa0Next, decide on the set meal, which comes in the options of chicken, beef, seafood or vegetarian.\xa0Each individual hotpot set comes with free access to the condiment table and the DIY shaved-ice dessert table, a single serving of vegetables, and a large drink (including bubble tea).\xa0All in, the sets provide the solo diner with a fairly varied selection of protein, vegetables and carbohydrates — noodles are free as part of the condiment table. But the soup bases don’t live up to their counterparts on the market.\xa0We weren’t a fan of its counter tabletops, one of Xiabu Xiabu’s selling points, which unfortunately felt cramped once the big plates of food arrived.\xa0The lack of space on the countertops also meant the induction stove felt too near and seemed an accident waiting to happen, should a drop of boiling mala get propelled too far.\xa0The most unassuming mushroom soup base, offered as a free option no less, turned out to be our favourite out of the three my dining partner and I tried.\xa0A brown broth with various types of fungi, such as straw mushroom and king trumpet mushroom, the soup was all sorts of umami and well seasoned even before the cooking started.We both opted for the popular beef set (S$28++), which comes with the option of 140g of USA Choice Short Plate, Australian Oyster Blade, or Australian Thin Beef Flank.\xa0Our servings of thinly sliced USA Choice Short Plate, Australian Thin Beef Flank and an add-on of Belgium pork collar (S$9.80) arrived in big, heavy plates that wouldn’t look out of place at a fancy restaurant.\xa0We found no fault with the meats that were of uniform thickness and tasted fresh. The short plate, in particular, was a joy to consume with a layer of fat running throughout each slice.\xa0We also couldn’t pass up on ordering a serving of milkfish belly (S$12.80), a fatty fish not commonly found in Singapore but so popular in Taiwan that it has its own festival in Kaohsiung city.The four thick cuts of fish take a longer time to cook, so give them a leisurely bath in the soup. But when they’re done, you’ll have tender white meat with a generous layer of fatty skin. We highly recommend getting some.\xa0While my dining partner went for the Nanyang curry soup base (add S$2++), a flavour created exclusively for its Singapore outlet, I opted for the classic hot and spicy in Sichuan style soup base (add S$2++) to see how it would stack up against the other mala options out there.Like most thicker soup bases (such as laksa) that are adapted for hotpot, the curry broth here was a thinner version that tasted like it was flavoured with curry masala. You’d have to really commit to your choice; the curry flavour was one-note and got monotonous after a while.\xa0The mala, on the other hand, looked promising with a thick, glistening layer of red chilli oil, but the meat cooked in it came out bland. It also lacked the mouth-numbing kick I’d expect from mala.\xa0Each set comes with a free drink. We had the entire drinks menu to choose from and went for the da hong pao tea (S$3.60 if ordered a la carte) and jasmine bubble tea (S$5.60 if ordered a la carte).\xa0They arrived in a larger cup than we expected, with a thick but mediocre brew of da hong pao for me and a rather average jasmine bubble tea for my dining partner. We couldn’t find enough gut space to finish the drink, but I’m certain bubble tea fiends would be able to.\xa0We were looking forward to the DIY shaved-ice dessert counter, where you get to feed the machine with ice and choose from 10 different toppings. The toppings, however, were quite underwhelming with options that were rather bland, such as watermelon jelly, cucumber jelly, oats and barley, lemon juice, taro and brown sugar.\xa0No doubt it was a fun little exercise just when the food coma kicked in, but we would have liked to see slightly more premium ingredients available. Is it conducive to conversation? Yes. Even at full capacity, the seats and tables are evenly spaced out, so you can hear your friend spill the tea with ease.\xa0Is a reservation necessary? Absolutely. Given that there’s only one outlet in Singapore, make a booking, so you won’t have to wait for seats.How to get there? Lazada One is right by Exit A of Bras Basah MRT station.Things to note:\xa0\xa0HungryGoWhere paid for its meal at this restaurant for this review. Still hungry?

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/lau-fu-zi-fried-kway-teow/:['Just like the old Chinese comic strip it’s named after, the Lau Fu Zi Fried Kway Teow stall has been around for a long time. In this case, the hawker stall has been in existence for over 20 years and its popularity isn’t fading.Long queues can still be seen at the outlet located in the Old Airport Road Food Centre. To taste the dish, some customers make the trip all the way from Woodlands and Jurong, owner Madam Kuah shared with us.Its fried kway teow is known to be fragrant, with enough wok hei, and comes with very fresh ingredients. To be able to cook a plate of good fried kway teow, Madam Kuah, 64 said, preparation is tedious but paramount.In between frying duties at the wok one weekday afternoon, she shared with us some behind-the-scenes stories of her famous stall.What is your specialty dish and how did it come about?My specialty dish is fried kway teow with Martell (a famous brand of cognac) prawns. It’s a dish my son suggested many years ago. At first, we did it just like the drunken prawns in the restaurants. We would put live prawns into Martell before frying them in the fried kway teow.But now, we just fry the prawns with a bit of Martell and top our fried kway teow with the fried prawns. We don’t advertise it now, but regulars will know to ask for it.\xa0What is the secret to cooking a great fried kway teow?You must have a very hot flame and a really good chilli. For us, we also use our own homemade stock, and we don’t add water to the dish.What’s the most difficult ingredient to make for the dish?Among all the ingredients I have to prepare, the chilli is the one that is the most difficult to make.Every week, I prepare almost 20kg worth of chilli for frying. The fresh chillies cost me about S$100, at least. Then, I have to fry the chillies with other ingredients to make the chilli paste and that takes me three hours. You have to fry it slowly and over a steady flame to avoid burning the ingredients. This is the same chilli that we put into our fried kway teow.How do you ration the chilli?If you order the fried kway teow without chilli, my helper would put only a small amount by the side. It’s okay if you can finish it, I will give you more. But there was once she gave a large amount to a customer who said he wanted more chilli, but when we collected back the plates, the chilli was untouched! I felt really ‘sim tia’ (Hokkien for “heart aches”).Share some of the interesting memories you have of your customers.I have customers who come from as far away as Jurong and Woodlands. There was one night when the stall had closed and I was preparing for the next day, a group of customers from Jurong came. They told me that they had come all the way just for my kway teow. I felt bad but I didn’t have any more kway teow noodles. So, I went to borrow some from other stalls and thank goodness they had some to spare. My customers were very lucky.There was also a group of customers who came to order six packs of fried kway teow and asked me to pack them very securely. I asked them why because in my mind, they would just eat it the moment they got home. Then, they told me they wanted to bring my fried kway teow to Thailand!What do you think of your cooking, which has won you such loyal and dedicated fans?Actually, a hawker cannot comment on his or her own cooking. That’s what I think anyway.I just tell people that I try my best and if they like my cooking, please come back and support me. If they don’t, then please let me know how I can improve or perhaps my cooking is just not for you!What’s a typical day like for you?\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 I take the bus from home at about 7am to reach the food centre by 8am for about two hours of preparation work. At 10am, we open for business. My three helpers take turns to come and help me — two at a time. I have frying duties until about 2pm or so, when my son comes to take over. I take a bus home and start preparing the ingredients for the next day.I sleep at about 9pm or 10pm every day. I need the rest so that I have enough energy to fry my kway teow the next day.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/tans-tu-tu-kueh-2/:['The small and humble kueh tu tu kueh, or steamed rice flour cake, can be finished in just one or two bites, but you can be sure you’ll be asking for more of this addictive treat — if it is done well.At Tan’s Tu Tu Kueh, one is definitely not enough. In fact, the tu tu kueh here are so popular that owner Tan Cheong Chuan has opened four more branches. They are at Food Republic in Wisma Atria, Block 964 Jurong West Street 91, Block 449 Clementi Avenue 3, and Block 925 Yishun Central 1. The original Havelock outlet has been in operation since 1971.The tu tu cakes here are made from a family recipe that’s more than 80-years-old. They are slightly sticky but not overly wet. The rice cakes have just the right amount of moisture and are firm.Two varieties of tu tu kueh fillings are available, peanut and coconut. Of the two, we preferred the coconut one. The shredded coconut was coated with delicious gula melaka and put in between two layers of rice flour in a flower-shaped metal mould. The filling had just the right amount of sweetness and paired well with the fluffy rice flour cake.The other peanut version had a coarse peanut filling that also had just the right amount of sweetness, but it was a tad dry for our liking. Perhaps this could be fixed by grinding the peanut a little finer.Overall, however, Tan’s version of the tu tu kueh is a great interpretation of this fast-disappearing traditional snack.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/changi-village-best-bbq-chicken-wing/:['As its name suggests, Changi Village Best BBQ Chicken Wing is well known for its barbecued chicken wings (S$1.20 each). But while the wings we ate were fairly good, we felt it may be an exaggeration to say that they are the “best” in Changi Village.The wings were barbecued competently and charred just right. The meat was not overly dry or oily. We also liked that each wing was cut up into two, so it was more manageable.However, the skin was slightly soggy. It definitely could have been crispier and more fragrant. The accompanying chilli sauce was good, but could do with an extra dash of lime.This stall also offers fried oyster (from S$4), oyster omelette (from S$5), steamed pearl conch (gong gong) (from S$6) and raw cockles (see hum) (from S$3).We tried the fried oyster. Again, while it was well fried, the dish did not particularly excite our palates. Furthermore, we were a little disappointed when we counted a measly four pieces of oysters in the dish, which cost S$4.Overall, Changi Village Best BBQ Chicken Wing definitely has the potential to shine. And we’d like it to do well, especially since we received warm and friendly service from the duo who run it.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/stay-healthy-ramadan-fasting/:['Ramadan is considered a holy month in the Islamic calendar, and is marked by a period of fasting by Muslims around the world.During Ramadan, practising Muslims change their eating habits dramatically.Speaking to the former Relaxnews (a French news agency now known as ETX Studios), nutritionist Charlotte Debeugny provided her recommendations to Muslims who are looking to make the most out of this festive time of year.\xa0Suhoor and Iftar, the two daily meals during Ramadan, are taken before dawn and after dusk, respectively. Suhoor is crucial, as it is the last meal for those who are fasting before they face the day.So it is important to make sure this pre-dawn meal contains protein (found in eggs, cheese, yoghurt and nuts, for example) and fibre (fruit, vegetables, whole grains and more), both of which help stave off hunger over a long period.\xa0After a day of deprivation, there is a strong temptation to overindulge at Iftar. To curb the pangs of hunger before reaching for calorie-rich foods, try having a bowl of cold soup or a healthy salad. The evening meal should also include protein, whole grains and vegetables.Especially during Ramadan, it is important to avoid empty calories and junk food, to eat at least five servings of fruit and vegetables per day, and to ensure that each meal includes healthy portions of protein and dairy products.\xa0While Ramadan is a festive time of year, it has the potential to negatively impact one’s health. Eating at night rather than during the day affects the body’s metabolism, thus increasing the risk of weight gain.Fasting can also lead to cravings, which may lead to an overindulgence in foods that are high in sugar and fat. This can impact your waistline. Charlotte Debeugny recommends eating a few dates or almonds instead of the calorie-rich pastries served during Ramadan, such as baklava or halva.\xa0\xa0To stay in shape during a fast, it is also advisable to stay out of the sun, spend most of the day in cool places and avoid strenuous exercise. Eating fruit before sunrise is a good idea, as the water it contains helps to hydrate the body during the day.Be careful not to drink too much water at once. Coffee and tea are to be avoided, as they can actually lead to increased thirst and dehydration. For additional energy, try drinking smoothies or fruit juice diluted with water.\xa0Before starting a fast, it is necessary to talk to a doctor, particularly for seniors, diabetics taking medication to control their insulin levels, pregnant women and pre-adolescent children.Those with compromised health who still wish to fast for Ramadan should consult their doctor to develop a fasting plan adapted to their condition. At the first symptom of failing health, it is important to stop fasting.\xa0This is an updated version of an archived article.\xa0Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

It has even been invited to tie up with other brands, such as Rumours Beach Club, Park Bench Deli and luxury fashion house, Coach.Loyal supporters know what to expect from the new outlet — the same ol’ hearty and loaded bagel sandwiches and, per its usual practice, a few outlet exclusives.While full details have yet to be released, a social media post promised: “New menu. New space. Wood-fired bagels, folks.”\xa0Each outlet’s menu comes with the same “TMBH classicz” section comprising lox (S$17.30), BEC (S$15.10), avo bacon (S$16.20), and the Personal Best (S$16.20).For first-timers, its iconic lox is probably the safest choice, and comes packed with smoked salmon, tomatoes, scallion cream cheese, onions and capers. You can even choose to customise your sandwich with a choice of bagel that includes plain, sesame, cheddar, garlic and an all-sorts bagel.If you’re in need of something substantial, though, the Personal Best will win your heart with its indulgent components of spam, peanut butter, hash brown, sunny side up, and a spicy aioli dressing.Beyond the classics, you can find exclusives such as Tanjong Pagar’s unorthodox Hogwarts (tamari pork, sunny, housemade salted mustard greens and peanut butter crunch, S$17.30) and Novena’s hefty shiggin’ (smoked brisket, double cheddar, soy pickled jalapeno and mustard, S$18.40).With that in mind, we can’t wait to see what Two Men Bagel House has to offer when its new Joo Chiat outlet opens on April 29.Two Men Bagel House is on the GrabFood delivery service and offers free delivery (up to S$3 off) with GrabUnlimited.

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/hawker-coffee-shop-stalls-yishun/:['We all know Yishun enjoys a less-than-stellar reputation. Yes, it’s been the butt of many jokes, including pointed jabs by streaming service Netflix, which made reference to the neighbourhood in promos for its Stranger Things series.As a former resident of Yishun, it amuses me to see it in the news for all the wrong reasons. Because if you live in this part of town, you’d know that it’s a region teeming with food gems — both old-school and new.\xa0This guide will zoom in on coffee-shop and hawker options, because those in malls such as Northpoint City — a thriving food hub in its own right — need little introduction.\xa0Nestled within unassuming HDB blocks and lively hawker centres, these stalls are unpretentious and underrated — many of them well-kept secrets among residents.Here are eight hawker and coffee-shop stalls to check out the next time you venture to the north of Singapore.928 Yishun Central 1, 01-155\nOpen: Monday to Saturday (7.30am to 7pm)Why visit? This fuss-free stall is a stalwart in Yishun, serving homely, unpretentious bowls that are consistently good. Each bowl is packed with rich flavours and boasts al dente noodles with plenty of ingredients in a thick, creamy broth — no wonder it draws snaking queues during peak hours.Price range: $Crowd faves: The laksa (from S$3) features fishcake, hard-boiled egg, tau pok (fried tofu puffs), cockles and beansprouts with your choice of noodles. We recommend adding extra cockles (S$1) for a truly unbeatable experience.Blk 1, 925 Yishun Central, 01-249\nOpen: Daily (11am to 8.30pm)Why visit? Residents in the area swear by this chicken rice purveyor — and the queues during lunch hour are testament to this. Glistening and soft chicken pieces are drenched in a flavourful sauce and paired with fragrant, slightly oily rice that has just the right amount of bite. The meal feels light but is oh-so-satisfying.Price range: $Crowd faves: Only steamed chicken is served here (sorry, roast-chicken fans). You can opt for the basic chicken breast rice (S$3.50) or order the chicken drumstick rice (S$5) if you prefer more tender and juicy meat.233 Yishun Street 21, 01-472\nOpen: Thursdays to Tuesdays (6am to 3pm)Why visit? Although this stall sells a variety of porridge, it’s most famous for its ke kou mian (or Koka instant noodles). Be prepared to wait if you’re there during peak hours, as each flavourful bowl is cooked a la minute and comprises springy instant noodles in a rich broth that’s topped with vegetables and other ingredients.\xa0Price range: $Crowd faves: The pork Koka noodles (S$3.50) are a standout, with each bowl heaped with lean pork meat, minced meat and pork liver. Opt for an egg (50 cents), which gives your soup a creamy texture. The meat is perfectly marinated and the broth is not too salty. If you prefer a kick, go for the tom yum Koka noodles (S$3.70). This is intense and not for the faint of heart.156 Yishun Street 11, 01-106\nOpen: Wednesday to Monday (8am to 7.30pm)Why visit? Well-loved by residents in the area, Coba Coba is a homely eatery that serves amazing nasi padang and nasi ambeng (sharing platter). While it’s not air-conditioned, it’s airy and spacious, with plenty of seating. Choose from the plethora of Malay-Indonesian dishes that are available in single and communal servings.Price range: $$Crowd faves: If you wish to try a bit of everything, its deluxe nasi ambeng (S$43.90 for two pax) is your best bet. The generous serving has a combination of dishes, such as udang balado hijau (spicy shrimp), ikan kering (dried fish), ayam kalio (chicken in spiced coconut gravy), sambal goreng (stir-fried tofu, tempeh and long beans), and begedil.\xa0If you want to go for individual dishes, the beef rendang, tahu telur (Indonesian tofu omelette), lemak siput sedut (sea snail) and sotong sumbat (stuffed squid) are highly lauded, too.645 Yishun Street 61, 01-320\nOpen: Saturday to Thursday (7.30am to 1pm)Why visit? Housed in a nondescript coffee shop, Pak Mandor is a hidden gem that residents rave about. Wallet-friendly and delicious, the stall is known for its fluffy and fragrant pandan-infused coconut rice that comes in an alluring shade of green, as well as its piquant and slightly sweet sambal chilli.Price range: $Crowd faves: The nasi lemak is an obvious choice. You get to pick four of your favourites — for S$3.50 — from a spread of fried dishes, or you can go with the stall’s set combos. We recommend the lightly battered crispy chicken wing, crunchy ikan bilis, begedil and fried kuning (yellowstripe scad fish) for a satisfying and complete meal.\xa0\xa0Yishun Park Hawker Centre, 01-40, 51 Yishun Avenue 11\nOpen: Wednesday to Monday (11am to 9pm)Why visit? As its name implies, Ah Tan Wings specialises in chicken — specifically, of the shrimp-paste kind, otherwise known as har cheong gai. The fried chicken here is crispy and fragrant, and when paired with rice and a fried egg, makes a satisfying meal.Price range: $Crowd faves: The Wing Wing Meal (S$5.70) is a popular choice, comprising two shrimp-paste wings with rice, egg and chilli. Otherwise, the Atas Cutlet (S$7.20) is great for big eaters, boasting a large shrimp-paste fried cutlet that will have you holding your stomach in satiation. Yishun Park Hawker Centre, 01-33, 51 Yishun Avenue 11\nOpen: Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday to Sunday (6.30am to 7pm), Thursday (7am to 7pm)Why visit? This Michelin Plate recipient’s OG stall in Yishun has been a favourite among foodies in the area. It serves a generous plate of Indonesian-style nasi lemak that’s accompanied by a large chicken leg heaped with homemade sauces.Price range: $Crowd faves: You can’t go wrong with its signature nasi lemak ayam taliwang (S$6.20). The chicken is well-marinated in its homemade taliwang sauce, with a taste that’s a wonderful mix of sweet, spicy and tangy. It combines delightfully with coconut rice, egg and ikan bilis for a textured meal. You can also try the nasi lemak ayam cabe ijo (S$6.20), which is served with green chilli mixed with ikan bilis, and is equally piquant and satisfying.171 Yishun Avenue 7, 01-01\nOpen: Thursday to Tuesday (6.30am to 1.30pm)Why visit? Huat Kee Kway Chap has been operating for more than six decades, so it stands to reason why this is the stall residents make a beeline for when they are craving a warm, comforting bowl of kway chap on a rainy day. There’s a long wait and it sells out quickly, so head there early.Price range: $Crowd faves: The kway chap set for one (S$5.50, top-ups apply for extra ingredients) comes with a plate of braised items such as egg, pork belly, intestines and tau kwa (firm tofu). Everything about this meal is delicious, from the rich, flavourful broth and the silky-smooth rice sheets swimming in it, to the generous portion of ingredients drenched in a savoury sauce. The intestines, in particular, are thick but tender. Even the slightly tangy homemade chilli accompanying the meal is a winner.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/cafe-lilac-by-whisking-bakes/:['If you’re a taro lover, we have the perfect idea for your next cafe hopping itinerary — the new Cafe Lilac at Lavender.This aesthetic cafe specialises in all things taro and is especially popular for its taro desserts.Fun fact: Cafe Lilac is actually the rebranded concept of popular pastry shop, Whisking Bakes.The home-based brand was founded during the circuit breaker by Chanel, a former flight attendant who was unable to fly due to the grounding of flights at the time.The brand quickly gained popularity on social media for its signature taro tart balls, and eventually expanded into a full-fledged cafe at Lavender in July 2022, serving taro desserts.After operating for six months, Whisking Bakes in February announced plans for a complete overhaul. Its Lavender space officially reopened at the end of March, now named Cafe Lilac.The cafe, aptly named after the food’s distinct hue, will still feature Whisking Bakes’ popular desserts.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/wild-crumbs-beng-who-cooks/:['In case you missed it, the famous “Beng Who Cooks” chef is back in the game with a brand-new concept — Wild Crumbs, opened in late March at One-North.Most people will be familiar with “Beng Who Cooks”, a term referring to the restaurant or the chef himself, Jason Chua, a former boxer who used to represent Singapore internationally.The popular social media personality got his iconic moniker from his friends — they call him “Beng” due to his loud and abrasive personality that’s accompanied by multiple tattoos that cover his upper body.Chua first came into the public eye during the pandemic when he and then-business partner, Hung Zhen Long, were running a casual lunch-only poke bowl stall, Beng Who Cooks, at Hong Lim Market and Food Centre.The duo instantly caught social media attention for their generous acts of kindness —\xa0they donated pasta or rice bowls to those in need, even though they were making losses.The pair put up their personal funds for the cause and even delivered the food themselves. For their efforts, they were named one of Time Magazine’s Heroes of 2020 and received a special commendation for the President’s Volunteerism and Philanthropy Awards 2020 Special Edition.In November 2020, the pair moved out of the hawker stall and launched a full-fledged restaurant on Neil Road complete with dinner service, also named Beng Who Cooks.However, things took an unexpected turn: Hung left the business at the start of 2022 and Chua eventually shuttered Beng Who Cooks in October 2022. He indicated that the outcome was “part of (a) learning curve” and there was “no hate” between the two. He’ll still say hi if he sees Hung, he adds.Hung launched his own cafe, Rough Guys Coffee, in October 2022 — a venture with Shawn Ho, a barista previously from popular specialty coffeehouse Kurasu Singapore.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHawker Hustlers: Hipster hawker Ray Yeo of Bei-Ing Dimsum Club on reinventing dim sum and his love for all things Japan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Feuds: Saizeriya vs Milan Shokudo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatisserie Cle brings its well-crafted pastries to new River Valley flagship for fifth anniversary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWild Crumbs marks Chua’s own return to the F&B scene.The new eatery sees Chua returning to his roots, serving as a lunch-only pit stop for those looking to score some fuss-free sandos and rice bowls.Except this time, he won’t be the one behind the stove. Chua will run the floor, while partner and chef Titus Chong will run the kitchen.So far, the sandos have been receiving a lot of love. Bestsellers include the reasonably priced egg mayo (S$9) and pork katsu (S$13)On the flip side, the more decadent pulled pork (S$15) and crab roll (S$16) options have also gained their own loyal following.Speaking about his new venture, and the closure of his previous restaurant, Chua says a hefty rent hike was one of the reasons that drove him to wind things up.He also grew to realise the importance of being present in his toddler son’s formative years. The gruelling hours spent working in the kitchen meant he missed many moments in his son’s life, he says.After a six-month break, he decided to return because he still has a passion for cooking, and for running his own business.But he has a goal: To change the industry and provide a working environment that offers work-life balance for his team. Instead of the typical 12 to 16 hours one is expected to work in the F&B industry, Wild Crumbs will operate only from Mondays to Fridays, between 10am and 4pm — so he and his staff can spend dinners and weekends with their families and on other pursuits.That said, Chua and his team also have loftier plans for the eatery. For starters, they are planning to run RSVP-only omakase dinners.While details are still up in the air, Chua says he’s considering conducting up to two such sessions in a month — one helmed by the Wild Crumbs team and the other where he borrows the space to showcase his ideas as the Beng Who Cooks. The food served will be “an outlet of speech and creativity”.He adds that the Wild Crumbs team already has plans to come together and design the first-ever session in May, so we’re looking forward to that!Book a ride to its outlet.8A Biomedical Grove, 01-17/18\nNearest MRT station: One-north\nOpen: Monday to Friday (10am to 4pm)8A Biomedical Grove, 01-17/18\nNearest MRT station: One-north\nOpen: Monday to Friday (10am to 4pm)AuthorEvan started off writing about food on Instagram, before joining outlets such as Buro and Confirm Good to pursue his passion.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/garang-grill-express/:['Imagine someone grouped together Chinese, Indian, Malay and Thai food, and just called it Asian food. That’s what makes the notion of “Western food” such a unique thing in Singapore.On the one hand, it could mean fancy European dishes and American fried chicken, and on the other, the pork and chicken chops ladled with black pepper or mushroom sauce — plus a side of baked beans or rice to match — that you’ll find in neighbourhood coffee shops everywhere.\xa0The latter’s roots lie in Singapore’s Hainanese community, and it’s this cuisine that we’re talking about in this review.Garang Grill isn’t exactly a new concept. Created by the New Ubin Seafood Group, its outlets in Tampines and Bukit Timah plated up meaty rice bowls and barbecued pork ribs for several years. Its last stall shuttered in 2022.\xa0Garang Grill Express, which opened in March 2023, takes a step away from its older brother with a more basic menu, specialising in Western fare closer to what you’d find in neighbourhood coffee shops.Garang Grill Express wouldn’t be my first (or even seventh) choice for a date night, but if you’re hanging around Lavender or Nicoll Highway, and looking for a moreish, no-frills Western meal at decent prices, what are you waiting for?\xa0Be sure to try the “Dreamshop” smoked burgers, previously available only on New Ubin Seafood’s online menu.Take me to a Western-food stall, and four out of five times, you’ll find me ordering myself some chicken chop.\xa0Better yet if there’s a black-pepper-sauce variant.\xa0The black-pepper chicken chop (S$11.50) here is delicious. Sure, the slab of meat could be bigger, but it’s the right amount of firm and tender, slicing beautifully into juicy pieces of chicken that’s well-marinated and full of flavour. The spicy sauce is loaded with aromatic peppercorn bits, and hints of garlic and onion.For sides, I chose the Mexican pasta, which features cheesy but not overly wet macaroni and bits of bell peppers. It also comes with chunky potato salad that’s not overly exciting, but creamy and tasty enough to satisfy. Did I mention the portion of the sides is huge?The lamb chop, at S$21.90, is a lot pricier than the chicken, making it the second-most-expensive item at Garang Grill Express (just behind the Australian striploin). The taste is also richer and more complex — slightly gamey, slightly grassy, and very luscious.\xa0The lamb is easy to slice and even easier to chew. It comes with a savoury brown sauce that goes great with the meat.\xa0The accompanying mashed potato is simply massive, if not a little dry. It could be great with a tad more milk and butter. The onion rings, as well, are a little on the pale side, but taste sweet and hefty.\xa0I didn’t expect a pasta to be one of my favourite dishes here, but the smoked pork and mushroom pasta (S$14), despite its plain appearance, is scrumptious. The al dente spaghetti and seasoned cream form a hearty base for the umami-laden morsels of button mushroom and smoky pork.Quality meat grilled over charcoal is the foundation for the smoked burgers here. What’s interesting is the use of potato rolls — the squarish kind you get at old-school Western-food stalls — as burger buns, perhaps for a nostalgic touch?\xa0The fluffy underside is buttered and toasted till crisp, which holds well against the myriad of flavours dreamt up by Garang Grill Express.\xa0The buah keluak smoked burger (S$17.50) has that nutty, earthy and slightly bitter flavour you’d get at a good Peranakan restaurant. Instead of the typical chicken, however, I chomp into a well-seasoned patty with a smoky depth. It’s an acquired taste that not everyone will enjoy, but I’ll have this anytime.The guacamole and lime smoked burger (S$17.50) is a tad messier and possibly healthier, too.\xa0Zinged up with a creamy mash-up of avocado, lime juice and cooked onions, it’s a southwestern citrus twist to the cheeseburger that’s delicious. I reckon some salsa and sour cream would make this a lot more fun, but it’s a yummy dish as is.There’s plenty to love about fried chicken that’s not heavily battered and dripping with oil.\xa0Garang Grill Express’s half spring chicken with fries and coleslaw (S$10.90) has crisp skin that gives way to juicy, tender flesh. Rather than salt, you taste a lot of the chicken meat’s natural essence.\xa0That being said, the accompanying fries are on the bland side, and could do with extra seasoning and perhaps a double fry. Like the onion rings from before, they are pale and not yet crispy.There are canned drinks for thirsty diners, but that’s all you’ll find here. A stronger beverage programme would be nice but not critical for a quick-service restaurant like this.\xa0The interior at Garang Grill Express is also as bare-bones as it gets — perhaps a spruce-up is in order?Is it conducive to conversation? Yes, the tables are nicely spaced out.Is a reservation necessary? Walk-ins only!How to get there? Head to the second floor of City Gate, a three-minute walk from Exit A of Nicoll Highway MRT station.HungryGoWhere paid for its meal at this restaurant for this review. Still hungry?

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/unhealthy-vegetable-hawker-dishes/:['If you’re trying to eat healthy, loading up on vegetables might seem like the right thing to do.Unfortunately, that’s not always so.Just one serving of a popular local veggie-based dish could pack nearly as much fat and calories as two cheeseburgers! Enough spoilers for now — read on to find out which vegetable items dieters should avoid at the hawker centre.Per 300g serving: 396 calories, 30.9g fat (13.2g saturated), and 2,184mg sodium.What gives the kangkong its kick also makes it a major fat bomb. Yes, I’m talking about that spicy and savoury sambal chilli sauce. It certainly doesn’t help that the leaves and stalks soak up a lot of oil from the sauce. Shockingly, sambal kangkong actually has about double the fat found in sambal sotong! To be specific, a 300g serving of sambal sotong has 15.6g of fat.A healthier vegetable dish would be stir-fried cabbage, says Jaclyn Reutens, dietitian at Aptima Nutrition and Sports Consultants. “If sambal kangkong is the only vegetable dish on the menu, I would have no more than three spoons of it.”Her advice: Let the veggies sit on some of your rice so that the grains can soak up some excess oil. Just don’t eat the greasy rice afterwards!Per 441g serving: 542 calories, 31.8g fat (25.1 saturated), and 631mg sodium.A common go-to choice at Indian stalls, vegetable kurma shockingly has more fat than two cheeseburgers, and almost the same number of calories! One cheeseburger from McDonald’s has 303 calories and 12g of fat.Coconut milk accounts for much of the saturated fat in vegetable kurma — something you want to eat in moderation if you’re concerned about your heart health. “Try to stop at half a bowl and pair it with a roti (not prata) instead of naan. Roti is comparatively lower in calories,” says Reutens.Per 140g serving (one roll): 188 calories, 11.2g fat (3.6g saturated), and 676mg sodium.Small but dangerous: A popiah couldn’t possibly cost you more calories than a scoop of vanilla ice cream, could it? Unfortunately, it does. A 100g scoop of ice cream has about 116 calories.Popiah is high in fat because the turnip has been simmering in oil for a long time, and the sweet black sauce tacks on more calories. Some stalls also add crispy bits of fried dough, garlic or lard for extra crunch, which makes the popiah even more fatty.Stick to one roll, but if you’re looking for a better snack in the hawker centre, go for a vegetable pau (bun), suggests Reutens. “One vegetable pau contains 150 calories and half the amount of fat.”Per 332g serving: 621 calories, 33.5g fat (14.4g saturated), and 1,205mg sodium.Sorry guys, a murtabak is a murtabak — stuffing it with veggies won’t make it much healthier. The dough acts like a sponge and retains grease. It’s yummy, but not good for the tummy.“Not all vegetable dishes are created healthy,” says Reutens. “I would eat only half of a vegetable murtabak and order some dhal for protein and fibre.”Per 75g serving (one piece):\xa0206 calories, 11.4g fat (5.3g saturated), and 311mg sodium.No… not the samosa too! It may be less damaging to the waistline than the curry puff, but not that much better. “You know you won’t stop at one,” says Reutens. “And one tiny piece is equivalent to almost three slices of bread. Don’t order it unless you’re about to go for a 10km run.”Per 315g serving: 518 calories, 21.5g fat (6.1g saturated), and 914mg sodium.Time to face the truth: Rojak isn’t healthy at all. Ranking among the worst salads you could possibly have, rojak has as much fat and calories as two chocolate-coated doughnuts. Sure, rojak offers some fibre, but you’re better off eating fresh pineapple on its own.Can’t shake the rojak craving? Share it with friends. “Most of the calories come from the you tiao (fried dough fritter) and sweet sauce,” says Reutens. “Eat less of the you tiao or just ask the hawker to omit it. One serving of you tiao has 285 calories!” You could request for less sauce too, and avoid mopping up every last drop of it.\xa0Nutrition data source: Health Promotion Board of Singapore\nAll values are rounded to the nearest whole number, except for fat, which is rounded to one decimal place.This is an updated version of an earlier article.\xa0Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

There’s no information so far on whether there would be a permanent location.\xa0To mark the launch, Granny Q Penang Lemak Laksa will be giving out free bowls of its hearty laksa on its opening day till the bowls run out!\xa0There’s no catch — it’s completely free for all customers who visit the brand at Rappu on the launch day.\xa0No minimum spending is required, but each customer will be entitled only to one bowl of its signature GQ laksa (U.P.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/attea-anniversary/:['If you haven’t gotten your hands on a cup of Jam Hsiao’s (萧敬腾) bestselling bubble tea, now’s a great time to do so.\xa0AtTea, the bubble tea brand that Hsiao founded, has just launched an adorable Donut Rabbit milk tea series to mark its second anniversary in Singapore.\xa0AtTea first opened its doors on our shores in 2021. The bubble tea chain is recognised for its milky drinks. Its popularity led to the expansion of five outlets across the island, with 313@somerset being its flagship store.\xa0The new line is seasonal and available for a limited time only. It comprises two flavours: Donut Rabbit milk tea (甜心兔奶茶) ($6.80) and Donut Rabbit cheese foam tea (甜心兔奶蓋) ($6.80). There’s a bundle deal promotion valid until May 7, where you can purchase two cups of the Donut Rabbit milk tea series for just S$10.88.\xa0Each cup is dressed in a pink cup sleeve featuring a cute rabbit mascot, which — you’ve guessed it — is fondly referred to as the Donut Rabbit.\xa0In fact, all drinks offered by AtTea will don the special cup sleeve during the anniversary period, which also runs until May 7.On the sleeve is a playful animal clutching a beverage in one hand and a donut in the other, which represents Hsiao’s desire for his customers to enjoy the drink and sweet treat together.\xa0A post shared by HungryGoWhere (@hungrygowhere)Much to the excitement of his fans, the Taiwanese Golden Melody Awards winner paid a visit to the outlet at 313@somerset yesterday, at about 2.20pm. We heard that his hardcore stans have been queuing from as early as 8am just to catch a glimpse of their beloved star!\xa0While introducing the exclusive Donut Rabbit series, Hsiao mentioned that the lovable bunny was an icon that inspired his new milk tea launch, for he was born in the year of the rabbit. Fans of his work would also be familiar with the name Donut Rabbit, as it was the name of a TV show Hsiao participated in. He also said that the drinks at AtTea are named after his songs.\xa0If you’re wondering what Hsiao’s go-to beverage at AtTea is, it’s presently the Donut Rabbit cheese foam tea (甜心兔奶蓋). We can see why – the concoction boasts a creamy layer of savoury cheese foam that pairs well with the aromatic tea blend. And Hsiao’s elevated rendition of the classic milk tea drink, Donut Rabbit milk tea (甜心兔奶茶), has us drooling: It’s a fragrant refreshment that’s crafted from a smooth and smoky cane-roasted black tea base.\xa0Just one sip, and you’ll be hit with the rich, buttery texture of the milk tea. It’s just the right amount of sweetness, too. But that’s not the end, for the ’gram-worthy drink also sees a special twist. The beverage comes with a mini donut that’s adorned with sprinkles.\xa0An indulgent treat that’s worth savouring, we say.\xa0\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Feuds: Saizeriya vs Milan Shokudo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course, if you’re looking to try other OG flavours, AtTea also has a repertoire of intriguing beverages to choose from.\xa0Take an intergalactic trip to Planet Sa-Hah with the Singapore-exclusive Pink Meteor 945 (粉红流星94我) (S$6.90).

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/bubble-tea-facts/:['You’ll be hard-pressed not to find bubble tea in Singapore, no matter where you are. Or in the rest of Southeast Asia, for that matter.\xa0The sweet and refreshing drink, typically topped with chewy tapioca pearls, or boba, is undoubtedly well-loved in Singapore and the region.\xa0The numbers speak for themselves. According to Grab Singapore’s 2022 Food and Grocery Trends report, milk tea was the sixth-most-ordered item on the GrabFood delivery service across 2021 and 2022. That’s right below fried chicken in 2021 and nuggets in 2022.\xa0In advance of National Bubble Tea Day this Sunday (April 30), let’s deep dive into how bubble tea has been consumed around the region through the lens of GrabFood’s data from 2022.Yes, you read that right!\xa0Based on GrabFood data, consumers ordered a cup of bubble tea every single minute in 2022.\xa0If that doesn’t show how much Southeast Asians love their boba, then let this other fact sink in — the region consumed a total of 300,000 litres of bubble tea in 2022. That works out to about one-eighth of an Olympic-sized pool! It’s no secret Thais love their milk tea, with their version of the beverage (Thai iced milk tea) featuring on most menus across the country.\xa0But we see that bubble tea has also made its way into the hearts of the Thais by appearing in other forms — the milk tea flavour is commonly seen in sweet snacks such as ice cream, cakes and puddings in Thai cafes and shops.While it is unsurprising that the classic milk tea has taken first place in Singapore’s bubble tea flavour rankings (in fact, it’s top in all regional markets, except Malaysia), taro, or yam, has also muscled its way into the palates of boba drinkers in Singapore.Interestingly, Singapore was the only country with taro in its top three flavours.\xa0If you’re looking to get your taro milk or taro milk tea fix, here are some well-loved takes on taro around Singapore:While brown sugar was also among some of Indonesians’ favourite flavours, Malaysians’ bubble tea trends differed quite a bit from those of their regional counterparts.Bubble tea of the brown sugar variety came out on top in Malaysia. The other two top flavours were classic and chocolate.The top flavours in the other countries in the region were:Despite the gamut of toppings available at most bubble tea chains, classic toppings such as tapioca pearls, grass jelly, taro and pudding still proved to be crowd favourites, appearing frequently in GrabFood orders.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/bak-kee-teochew-satay-bee-hoon/:['While we have seen the long queue at Bak Kee Teochew Satay Bee Hoon each time we dine at this food centre, we’ve never eaten the famous satay beehoon here. Finally, we decided to give the stall a try, especially since we find good satay beehoon quite hard to come by these days.Perhaps the reason is that satay beehoon needs a lot of preparation work. Bak Kee’s version (S$3) uses thin beehoon and has beansprouts, kangkong, tau kwa, cuttlefish, cockles, lean pork slices and pork liver. A generous amount of grainy and nutty satay gravy is poured over this combination.The result was a well-balanced dish that had a pleasing combination of textures and flavour. The gravy was neither too sweet nor too spicy. It was nicely warm and clung well to the various items in the dish. For example, it made the thin beehoon very filling and moreish.On the other hand, the cuttlefish was merely coated lightly with the gravy and that gave this rather bland item a tinge of spice. It was also clear that the items used were very fresh and the kangkong was especially crisp and refreshing.We also ordered the lighter and sweeter cuttlefish kangkong beehoon (S$3). This dish is made up of thin beehoon, cuttlefish, kangkong, pineapple slices, jellyfish strips and tau kwa topped with peanuts and sesame. A sweet sauce, similar to that served with yong tau foo, is ladled on this combination, and a touch of spicy chilli paste is placed on the side.This dish was definitely lighter than the satay beehoon. If the latter is taken as a main dish, the cuttlefish kangkong beehoon should be viewed as an appetiser. Unfortunately, we did not enjoy this dish as much, as we found the sauce overly sweet. It didn’t go very well with the starchy beehoon either. However, the cuttlefish kangkong on its own would make a nice salad and you can get the version sans beehoon.The satay beehoon is also available without the beehoon — it is called “satay ingredients”, if that’s what you prefer.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/toms-palette/:['We have heard so much about Tom’s Palette and its huge variety of unique ice cream flavours. So needless to say, we went with much anticipation. The homegrown ice cream parlour certainly had a lot to live up to.True enough, Tom’s Palette’s very creative ice creams were a hit, barring one or two flavours. Made from as many natural ingredients as possible, the ice creams have a full-bodied, creamy consistency and are certainly not “wimpy” or diluted.Among the flavours we tried, our favourite was the chocolate sorbet. Although a recent introduction to the menu, it quickly became a hot favourite, outselling a previous favourite, the chocolate ice cream. The latter has been taken off the regular menu and will make “guest” appearances every now and then — so make sure you check the online flavour calendar before you visit.Tom’s Palette’s sorbets do not contain milk, eggs or cream. Yet, the chocolate sorbet we tried was full of rich and dark chocolate goodness. It was smooth, creamy, yet had a lightness to it that made the sorbet refreshing. Heavy yet light at the same time — we never thought that was possible until now!We also really liked the nuts & such. It’s made from peanut butter ice cream with swirls of chocolate in it. The salty, sweet and nutty taste complemented well. Another great combination was the salted caramel cheesecake flavour. It was subtly salty, milky and cheesy all at once.Meanwhile, the melt & sizzle is a truly inspired creation. It’s an ice cream containing tempered chocolate with sizzling candy, the kind that pops in your mouth. At first, we didn’t feel anything when we stuffed a greedy spoonful past our lips, but as the ice cream and the chocolate bits melted, we felt tiny prickling sensations on our tongues. Slowly, the candy ‘erupted’. The nice contrast of the cold, creamy liquid ice cream and the sizzling candy made for a delightful and fun experience.Another interesting creation is the chocolate stout ice cream. While chocolatey, it didn’t have the deep cocoa flavour of the chocolate sorbet. Instead it had a slightly bitter but aromatic aftertaste. We attributed the latter to the stout in the ice cream. This was a bit of a miss for us, as we didn’t think the combination worked. It was neither here nor there — we would have preferred a full-bodied chocolate taste or a proper, robust stout flavour.Similarly, the rose & lychee flavour was another weak execution. We didn’t fully taste the lychee or the sweet rose component of it. Perhaps this ice cream was meant more for those with more delicate tastebuds.Overall, we were really impressed with the creativity at Tom’s Palette as well as the owners’ dedication to ensuring their ice creams are as natural as possible, without the use of any chemical stabilisers.The portions at Tom’s Palette were also very generous, as each cup was filled to the brim (S$2.80 for a small cup, S$3.70 for medium, S$4.70 for large). Two flavours were allowed for every cup.Other flavours we’d love to try on our next visit include Sarsi vanilla float, cipola (caramelised onions), red wine and tangy basil.Ah, who are we kidding? Add balsamic vanilla, curry apples, gula Melaka, ginseng and horlicks to the list too, please.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/healthy-sugars/:['We all love the taste of sugar.There is something about the delicious, syrupy sweetness of maple syrup, honey and the sweet buttery creamy richness of a cupcake frosting.Research has shown that sugar is also highly addictive, stimulating the same neurotransmitters in the same way as alcohol, cocaine and other drugs do. It doesn’t get any better: sugar and high-fructose corn syrup, which are used in most processed foods, are linked to obesity and increased risk of heart disease.When we hear of healthier alternatives, we tend to get excited and hope that we won’t need to give up our sweet indulgences. After all, sweeteners like gula Melaka (palm sugar), agave nectar, raw sugar and maple are being marketed as healthy sugar alternatives as they are natural and less processed.Just because a product is natural, it doesn’t necessarily mean that it is good for you. If that’s the case, cocaine should fall under that list as it’s derived naturally from coca leaves (not that we’re suggesting that cocaine is a healthy product).The danger with labelling anything ‘healthy’ is that most tend to substitute one sugar for another without a reduction in the amount ingested. ‘Healthier’ sugars are high in fructose, which is metabolised in the liver. Excess fructose that cannot be processed by the liver (the poor, overworked liver) is converted into fats-triglycerides. These sweeteners are also considered ‘healthy’ because they have a low glycaemic index (the rate at which glucose is released into your bloodstream) from the high levels of fructose.Here’s a sobering fact: fructose is linked to insulin resistance, problems with appetite control, obesity, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, liver disease, cancer, arthritis and other diseases. Fats-triglycerides contribute to the risk of heart disease and stroke.\xa0“So we’ll stick to fruit juices”, you say?We hate to break it to you: but fruit juices contain massive amounts of fructose without the benefits of the fibre, vitamins and minerals found in the actual fruit. A cup of apple juice has 24g of sugar and high levels of fructose. So next time you crave apples, eat it, don’t drink it.What if you’re addicted to the sugars?Cut down on your sugars gradually — no one’s telling you to go cold turkey. You will be amazed at how much tastier your food will become when you eat less sugars; your taste buds will become more sensitive and allow you to enjoy the complexities and layering of flavours in each dish. Besides being able to taste more, you will also find that you are hungry less often and might start to lose some weight. Not that you need to, or do you?\xa0Shen Tan, resident cook and beer monster at The Wok & Barrel, eats well and healthily.

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/french-toast/:['Hong Kong-style cafes — or cha chaan teng, as they are known in Hong Kong — exploded onto our local dining scene about six years ago.Reasons they are still going strong could be their affordably priced food and wide, eclectic menus. Cha chaan tengs offer both Chinese dishes as well as Western-inspired fare like French toast. Hong Kong-style French toast is different from the original version as it is deep-fried instead of pan-fried.Where should you head to for the most lip-smacking Hong Kong-style French toast in Singapore? Read our taste test to find out!\xa01. Café de Hong Kong EDITOR’S PICK!\n586 Balestier Road, #01-01\xa0\nOpening hours: Tue-Sun: 11.30am-3pm, 5.30pm-12am, closed on Mon except PH\xa0\nPrice: French toast with peanut butter (S$5.30, price inclusive of milk tea)\xa0\nRating: 4.5/5While the rest of the menu is now made up of Chinese restaurant-style dishes rather cha chaan teng fare, its popular French toast looks set to be a permanent fixture.Although the owner is a Hong Kong native, he uses thicker bread to cater to local trend. The French toast is composed of two slices of bread slightly thicker than the usual sandwich loaf. Moist and fluffy on the inside, the exterior is well coated with egg. The crust has an intense eggy aroma and doesn’t feel soggy or overly greasy.Between the two slices of bread is a decent amount of creamy peanut butter. Ratio-wise, the syrup and butter nicely match the amount of bread. This is one satisfying French toast that demonstrates much skill and thoughtfulness.\xa02. Hong Kong Kim Gary Restaurant BEST VALUE!\n1 Harbourfront Walk, ##02-128 Vivocity\xa0\nOpening hours: Daily: 11am-10pm\xa0\nPrice: French toast with peanut butter (S$3++)\xa0\nRating: 3.5/5While it won’t blow your mind away, Kim Gary’s rendition gets our thumbs up for consistency.Peanut butter is evenly spread between two slices of sandwich bread. Neither too thick nor too thin, the golden brown egg coating is nearly greaseless and carries a pleasant eggy fragrance.They could have been more generous with the peanut butter, syrup and butter, but overall, the flavours were balanced. Nicely executed, this French toast felt light and left us wanting more.\xa03. C.Nai Hong Kong Café\n378/380 East Coast Road\xa0\nOpening hours: Daily: 6pm-4am\xa0\nPrice: French toast (S$3.50+), French toast with peanut butter (S$3.80+)\xa0\nRating: 3/5This is the closest you can get to the real thing. C-Nai’s French toast stays true to the original Hong Kong version by using sandwich bread instead of thick toast.The crust has a strong eggy flavour and is delightfully crispy. On the downside, the exterior feels slightly oily and heavy. The version with peanut butter comes with a generous amount of luscious and creamy peanut butter — very satisfying indeed! It’s a shame a better grade of syrup wasn’t used.Hits and misses here and there, this French toast has the potential to be great but falls short on execution.4.

Topped with plenty of chicken floss and lightly drizzled with sticky condensed milk, this combo of sweet-salty flavours and contrasting textures is a surprise winner!As for its classic French toast, the cafe uses thick bread that’s delectably moist and pillowy. It also serves good quality syrup on the side, so we can customise the amount we prefer.While the exterior was evenly coated, we detected a faint oil taste that wasn’t too pleasant. Without this flaw, Kungfu Paradise’s French toast makes for one hearty snack.5.

The toast is topped with liberal amounts of butter and syrup, which is definitely necessary for the large proportion of bread.Although it has a mildly sweet flavour, the bread feels rather dense and filling after two bites.

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/my-must-eats-james-fong/:['My Must-Eats is a HungryGoWhere series featuring Singapore’s public figures and their favourite food haunts. This week, we speak to James Fong, chief executive officer of Jewel Changi Airport.James Fong knows Singapore Changi Airport well.\xa0After all, with more than 16 years of experience working in various departments within the Changi Airport Group, including airline development, cargo and landside concessions (which handles the daily operations of shops), it’s safe to assume that Fong knows the ins and outs of the bustling transport hub.In January 2022, he took over the reins as chief executive officer of Jewel Changi Airport, an ultra-modern, nature-themed entertainment and retail complex that’s a tourist attraction in its own right.\xa0His first few days on the job were undeniably challenging, as the nation was still in the grip of the Covid-19 pandemic.\xa0Thankfully, these days, Jewel is recording healthy footfall. Many make a beeline for the Rain Vortex, the world’s tallest indoor waterfall nestled in a magical forest setting. Retail and F&B shops are teeming with visitors at peak periods, especially during the weekends.\xa0Fong, who turns 45 at the end of the year, is often one of them himself. The father of three regularly takes his children, aged 9 to 12, to Jewel, and they especially enjoy Canopy Park, he says.\xa0“My eldest daughter and I even did a staycation at YotelAir last year (2022) to get the full Jewel experience.”\xa0As for food, Fong is a fan of Singaporean dishes, but when it comes to lunch places at work, he has quite a few favourites, too. Below, he talks about some of his favoured food spots, both during and off work.Two dishes come to mind. First, the tutu kueh — my favourites are those with coconut filling.\xa0They used to be a treat during family outings when we were young. I recall eating them at Chinatown and pasar malam (night market) stalls. Eating them now brings back sweet memories of my carefree childhood.\xa0Another would be Tip Top curry puffs. I believe my mom wanted to train my brother and me to eat spicy food. She frequently bought us curry puffs from Tip Top’s original store in Ang Mo Kio Central. I had a unique way of eating them — breaking them into halves and leaving the egg to the end, to save the best for last!Any hawker centre, coffee shop and food court. They are such a big part of Singaporeans’ lives and offer diverse cuisines. They pretty much represent our culture and identity as a nation.\xa0The variety of food offerings at these hawker centres has also evolved with the times. Japanese, Korean and Chinese food — from tonkatsu to kimchi noodles and mala xiang guo — are readily available at such places nowadays.\xa0My go-to place for kopi-O is the Rong Chun drinks stall at Mayflower Market and Food Centre. That hawker centre has very good mee siam, mee rebus, wanton mee, vegetarian bee hoon and chicken rice, too.Chicken rice and kopi-O kosong!\xa0I usually try to have a plate of chicken rice as the first meal after I touch down.\xa0Now that Wee Nam Kee is available at Jewel’s The Hainan Story outlet, that’s a convenient option for me. I have one to two cups of kopi-O kosong daily, to kickstart my day and afternoons. That would probably be Latin American cuisine.

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/lechon-singapore/:['For many Singaporeans, Filipino isn’t the most familiar of cuisines. It’s sad, but our awareness of food from the Philippines for the most part extends to famous brands such as fast food chain Jollibee.Still, if there’s one particular food item that’s been gaining popularity among foodies here, it is this — the lechon. It’s a roasted suckling pig dish that boasts shiny crackling skin and juicy flesh.Considered a national dish in the Philippines, the delicacy’s origins can be traced back to its period of colonisation under Spain, a country also known for its suckling pig.In fact, when the late Anthony Bourdain tried lechon in an episode of his documentary, No Reservations, he went on to exclaim that lechon was the “best pig, ever!”.\xa0We quite agree; after all, there’s no indulgence quite like the thundering crackle you get from this particular style of grilled or pit-roasted meat. While lechon generally refers to the suckling pig, there’s also lechon kawali, which is a deep-fried pork fat belly dish that’s more reminiscent of siew yoke.Lechon is traditionally served on special occasions and for festivities, but fortunately for us, it’s not hard to find good lechon in many of the authentic Filipino eateries around Singapore. Read on to find out where you can indulge in the popular dish!Novena Regency, 01-09, 75 Thomson Road\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (11am to 8.30pm)Why visit? When it comes to a discussion on where we can find the best lechon in Singapore, Lechon Republic at Novena Regency is always one of the first names mentioned.No arguments from us here — this is one of our favourite spots if you’re craving some authentic and delicious lechon. Best of all, this lechon specialist is located just a few minutes from Novena MRT station.Price range: $$Crowd favourites: As its name suggests, the star here is undoubtedly its crispy lechon. You have a few choices here — get it in a simple chopped lechon meal (S$12.80) to enjoy the delicacy at its fundamental best or get it in a sizzling hotplate, mixed up with other aromatics, when you order the lechon sisig meal (S$12.80).North Bridge Centre, 01-06, 420 North Bridge Road\nOpen: Sunday to Friday (12pm to 8pm)Why visit? Kuya’s Kusinang Pinoy isn’t a lechon specialist per se, it is better known as a great spot for an authentic Filipino food fix. However, its lechon kawali, Filipino-style deep fried pork belly, has garnered a strong fan base, thanks to the crispy skin paired with a savoury sauce.The inconspicuous ground floor unit along North Bridge Road is easy to miss, but go in and you’d be greeted by a warmly lit display that’s chock-full of delectable Filipino favourites.Price range: $Crowd favourites: The lechon kawali (S$9) is an affordable choice, especially if you prefer your meals with some crunch, but other traditional favourites such as the sizzling sisig (seasoned pork jowl meat scrambled and served on a hotplate, S$15) won’t disappoint either.If you prefer something more akin to Singaporean cai png, there’s also the option of mixing and matching your dishes with the daily meal set A (rice with one dish, S$7) or set B (rice with two dishes, S$10).Grandlink Square, 01-52, 511 Guillemard Road\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (12pm to 9.30pm)Why visit? Don Lechon is a bit of a hidden gem. Most locals wouldn’t know it existed and its clientele comprises foodies who specifically made their way there for a taste of its signature lechon.It is quite telling that this rustic unit is a not-so-well-kept secret, as it is able to amass a steady stream of customers based on word-of-mouth, despite being tucked away in a corner of Grandlink Square. On good weather days, its breezy alfresco dining area is also great for chilling with your friends.Price range: $$Crowd favourites: There’s a lechon dish for everyone here with its myriad of rice sets that range from the regular chopped lechon (from S$12) to the more unique tofu-mixed tokwa lechon (from S$9) and tamarind soup-based lechon sunigang (from S$15).Starhub Centre, 01-02, 51 Cuppage Road\nOpen: Tuesday to Saturday (12pm to 10.30pm), Sunday (11am to 10.30pm)Why visit? Gerry’s Grill is not just another homely eatery — it’s actually a popular franchise that hails from the Philippines. It has even opened outlets in the United States.Frequented by many Filipinos who are based in Singapore, Gerry’s Grill is a safe bet if you’re seeking a hearty, no-frills feast of Filipino flavours.Price range: $$Crowd favourites: As the name suggests, Gerry’s takes pride in its chargrilled items, with inihaw na pusit (grilled squid, S$19) and inihaw na liempo (grilled pork belly, S$15) being some of its smoky signatures.However, if you’re seeking gratuitous crunch, the crispy pata (crispy fried pork knuckles, S$29) is a great alternative to the lechon kawali (S$15) on days you want to switch things up.Lucky Plaza, 03-25, 304 Orchard Road\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (9am to 9pm)Why visit? If Golden Mile Complex was the “Little Thailand” of Singapore, there’s no doubt that Lucky Plaza is its Filipino counterpart. Hence it’s a good sign for your tummies when you find a popular, homey hole-in-the-wall eatery like Kabayan Restaurant in Lucky Plaza.The fact that it can stand out among the fierce competition in the compound is a great sign. This establishment isn’t a lechon specialist per se, but the lechon kawali, like many of its diverse array of dishes, will probably give other places a run for their money.Price range: $$Crowd favourites: This Lucky Plaza stalwart is the place to go if you’re looking for wallet-friendly but hearty classics such as the quintessential tosilog (a common brunch combo comprising fried egg, garlic rice and sweet fried pork, S$7.50).Of course, there’s the inescapable lechon kawali (S$9.50) that’s also served with egg and fragrant garlic rice here.Timbre+ One-North, 01-27, 73A Ayer Rajah Crescent\nOpen: Monday to Saturday (11.30am to 9.30pm)Why visit? This is probably one of the coolest settings to have lechon in Singapore — and probably the most true to its original spirit. Unlike the restaurants on this list, Iskina Cebu is located inside a hawker centre.Sure, Timbre+ is a more elevated hawker experience, but there’s just a uniquely Singaporean charm of pairing your lechon with the array of culturally distinct hawker favourites available there.Price range: $$Crowd favourites: Of course, most people go to Iskina Cebu for its scrumptious rendition of lechon, done Cebu-style — stuffed with a medley of aromatics to give it extra punch. But if you want some variety, you can order the sisig meal (from S$9) or the grilled pork belly meal (S$9.50) to pair with the lechon meal (from S$12).18 Teck Lim Road\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (12pm to 12am)Why visit? Granted, Alegria is a bit of an oddball within this list, but it has quite an intriguing concept. Originating from Manila, this Keong Saik joint is the Mexican-fusion brand’s first overseas foray.Not only can you satisfy your taco urges, but you can do it in style in the form of a sisig taco that comes with an ube (a type of purple yam usually used in Filipino desserts) tortilla stuffed with a glorious glut of crackling pork chunks.Price range: $$Crowd favourites: Of course, the crowd favourites have to be its wacky taco creations including the sisig (S$18) and koreana (S$20) that contains ssamjang aioli and kimchi. You can even take advantage of its taco tuesdays promotion to get 50% off all its signature tacos.If you have space left for desserts, you can also cap off your meal with a bowl of sinful champorado (sweet chocolate rice porridge, S$15).Clarke Quay, 01-07 Blk 3E, 3 River Valley Road\nOpen: Monday to Thursday (5pm to 2am), Friday and Saturday (5pm to 3am), Sunday (12pm to 2am)Why visit? Self-described as a “modern Filipino restaurant”, El Mesa is quite different from the other Filipino restaurants we typically find in Singapore. Instead of the usual fuss-free, hole-in-the-wall types, it’s found in Singapore’s party central, Clarke Quay.It might not be the most authentic of settings, but the eatery takes pride in presenting dishes with traditional flavours that will remind its Singapore-based compatriots of home.Price range: $$$Crowd favourites: As expected, its location means the prices are noticeably higher. However, you’d still find many pocket-friendly options, such as the lechon kawali (S$17) and adobong kangkong (S$16) that’s a mix of marinated pork, tofu, and stir-fried kangkong. Great dishes to go with a glass of ice-cold beer.Lechon Republic, Kuya’s Kusinang Pinoy, Gerry’s Grill, Kabayan Restaurant, Iskina Cebu and El Mesa are on the GrabFood delivery service and offer free delivery (up to S$3 off) with GrabUnlimited.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/quentins-sentosa/:['If you’re familiar with curry feng, devil’s curry and sugee cake —\xa0 all well-loved Eurasian dishes — then you must have heard of Quentin’s in Singapore.Besides trying them at the well-loved Eurasian restaurant in Singapore, you can now cook these Eurasian dishes, which are the result of a fusion of European and Asian cultures, at home.Chef Quentin Pereira and his father, Robin, launched their compilation of authentic, traditional Eurasian recipes. Robin’s Eurasian Recipes contains Robin’s personal collection of recipes handed down from his mother and other relatives.Chef Quentin — who owns Quentin’s, the only full Eurasian restaurant in Singapore — speaks to us about his passion in promoting Eurasian food and culture.Eurasian recipes are family heirlooms that will always be passed down to the children. As they are very heavily guarded, it is up to the individual whether he wants to share the recipes or not. When I was approached by Epigram and the National Heritage Board to do this project, I asked my father whether he was willing to part with his recipes. He said okay, so I compiled the book, which will be archived and serves as a reference for future generations.Yes, I simplified the recipes.Many of the recipes would refer you to another recipe but minus one ingredient. Some recipes would say to follow the same process, but remove one ingredient and add another. So, I had to go back to my Dad to figure out how these recipes should actually be followed.I also put in measurements. Some recipes called for things like “five cents turmeric”. That’s quite difficult thing to gauge, but since I’m running a restaurant, I know the rough amount in today’s terms, so I added it in.But actually, the recipes are just guides. Home cooks should modify it to their tastes.Quentin’s [restaurant] has now teamed-up with the Eurasian Association to form a cooking school to teach recipes from the book. You will be able to see exactly how we make the food featured in the book.Yes, I intend to write a second book, but it will be on my personal take on Eurasian food. It will also feature a bit of history about the food. But that project is still in its infancy.As a child, I used to watch my father when he cooked. I experimented in the kitchen too. But it was when we opened a stall selling Eurasian food at Changi Business Park in 2000 that I really learned from my Dad.At first, he did everything! I just watched.Then after that, I cut the onions. Even cutting the onions took some time because he is so particular. You cannot cut them too fat, neither can you cut them too thin. And if he wants them a certain way, and you cut them another way, he won’t use the onions!But I had no choice. I wanted to learn, so I had to follow exactly what he did.Slowly, I started cooking. It took us about six to eight months before my Dad stopped coming to the stall every day. That’s how I became independent.Yes, definitely. When I first started at Changi Business Park, I was losing money every day, but he still insisted on never cutting corners. We always had the best ingredients and the quality must always be there.That’s what I’ve learnt and practiced, up until today. At the restaurant, we may see how we can save time and innovate on certain processes but we still maintain a high standard.I first started the business with two friends. But after six months, they bailed out.The only thing that kept me going was that the restaurant was under my name. I said to myself that as much as I can, I will push on and struggle until I succeed.A lot of people don’t know about Eurasian food. But I believe I can educate people, and when they know and like Eurasian food, I will succeed. If I don’t persevere and promote Eurasian cuisine, nobody else is going to do it. The Eurasian community is growing smaller so in a way, I am doing it partly for Eurasians as well.Eurasian food is European food with Asian influences. Long ago, the Europeans like the Portuguese, travelled to Asia to look for spices, so these dishes we enjoy now are their recipes originally.Take for example, curry devil. It has the European influence of smokiness in the form of bacon bones and ham hock. The Asian influence comes from the ginger onions, chillies and mustard seeds. It is a real Eurasian dish.I’m here at the restaurant from 7am or 9am every day. In the morning, I usually reply to my emails. These days, I don’t cook as often anymore, but I still make the rempah and some pastes myself. I have a team of four in the kitchen and they have got the recipes and the cooking down to a science.I’m here till 10.30pm or 11pm and I will entertain my guests. I still cook for big events. Some guests will also insist I cook for them, and surprisingly, they know it when it wasn’t me who prepared their food!We are in the process of finalising our expansion plans. We will be opening at least one more Quentin’s restaurant by the end of the year.Personally, I am also starting filming for my own show on TV. It will be aired on Okto in July and it will be called “The Skinny Chef”.Block 14 Mess Hall, 01-08, 2 Gunner Lane\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (11.30am to 3pm, 5.30pm to 10pm)Level 1 Eurasian Heritage Gallery, 139 Ceylon Road\nOpen: Thursday to Sunday (11.30am to 2.30pm, 5.30pm to 10.30pm), Tuesday and Wednesday (11.30am to 2.30pm, 5.30pm to 9.30pm)Block 14 Mess Hall, 01-08, 2 Gunner Lane\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (11.30am to 3pm, 5.30pm to 10pm)Level 1 Eurasian Heritage Gallery, 139 Ceylon Road\nOpen: Thursday to Sunday (11.30am to 2.30pm, 5.30pm to 10.30pm), Tuesday and Wednesday (11.30am to 2.30pm, 5.30pm to 9.30pm)Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/burger-daddy/:['On a cool Sunday morning, just off Balmoral Crescent in central Singapore, a bright-pink cloth tapestry flutters delicately in the breeze, partially hidden by the dense foliage. A red basket holding a crinkly brown paper bag is carefully lowered down the condo parapet to an expectant customer. \n\nThe goods? This is the “The Smash Hit” — a smash dry-aged beef patty, with gooey American cheese, onion jam, and fresh tomatoes, encased between traditional Hainanese sweet buns and a gherkin on the side. Shoestring fries with garlic chilli and ketchup are add-ons.Upstairs, burger maestro Ulrich Chia, sporting an equally bright pink cap, cooks up a storm at the grill on his balcony, the sound of sizzling meat melding with old-school funk, rock, rhythm and blues music playing in the background. Chia is the co-founder of Burger Daddy, the latest home-based burger business to spring up in Singapore. Its unique pick-up concept brings to mind the likes of Ground Floor Coffee, which turns out fresh cups of joe from an HDB flat window and went viral on TikTok earlier this year. Started in September, Burger Daddy is the first F&B venture for Chia, a freelance architectural designer, and his partner Clara Lee, who is a writer, researcher and cultural worker. Most people would also know Chia from his musician days, when he was at (now defunct) local rock band, Cashew Chemists.The cheekily named @patyourbunbun, Burger Daddy’s Instagram page, depicts a love letter to burgers, music and vinyls, film, pop culture, design and wordplay.\n\nFor Chia, the smash-burger obsession began in 2019, when he had his first taste at Burger Joys in Hong Kong.To the uninitiated, a smash burger is pretty much exactly what it sounds like: A loosely packed ball of ground beef placed on a hot pan or grill and then pressed firmly into a thin patty with a spatula or a cast-iron press for at least 10 seconds. The goal is to get it to a proper sear till it’s nice and browned (almost slightly burnt) on both sides.In contrast, a classic burger is made with a thicker patty that has been seasoned before shaping, or seasoned just with salt and pepper. It’s also often cooked to medium-rare or medium, which results in a nice, pink and super-juicy centre. And while typically grilled, it’s not pressed down and flattened like smash burgers, and resembles a steak.“The smash burger is a totally different genre of burgers,” says Chia, 32.Back then, cult burger chains such as Shake Shack or Five Guys (known for making smash burgers) were not mainstream in Singapore yet. Sensing a gap, Chia was fired up to make his own smash burgers with the help of YouTube. He was obsessed with perfecting his own version. \n\nChia took the chance to serve smash burgers and steak when he hosted dinners and parties for friends at his family home. \n\nThe group sizes could go up to 20 people, which meant that he would be “slogging and struggling” in the kitchen, but he didn’t mind. He’s happiest in the kitchen, bringing people together through food. \n\nFast-forward to today. \n\nOn a recent visit to Chicago last December (where his partner is presently based) — the United States is the “mecca of the smash burgers” — Chia took the chance to check out as many smash-burger joints as he could. It was later in Vancouver, trying Between 2 Buns, that Chia was instantly transported to his first love, back when he had his first taste of Burger Joys. Between 2 Buns, he declared, makes the best burger he’s ever had. \n\nIn Singapore, the current burger market is extremely saturated, says Chia. He’s of the view that Shake Shack is “too mass-market” and “doesn’t quite live up to the smash burgers in America”.\n\nHe began to toy with the idea of starting something on his own — marrying both his love for smash burgers and dry-aged beef, and introducing these concepts into the everyday Singaporean’s vocabulary.\n\nThere are three components that make up Burger Daddy’s burgers.\n\nFirst off,\xa0Chia makes a patty from a blend of dry-aged beef trimmings sourced from Singapore butchery Maturo, which supplies a wide variety of cuts from 20-days-aged, all the way up to 200-days-aged cuts. During the dry-aging process, moisture loss and enzymatic action lend dry-aged beef a more intense, rich, nutty and deep beefy flavour. Then there’s the act of smashing the burger. When the meat patty gets in contact with the grill and browns, it leads to the Maillard reaction — a chemical reaction between amino acids and a type of sugar called a “reducing sugar”, located on the surface of food, in the presence of heat. This charring is what helps to create those incredibly complex and savoury flavours. Hence, maximum browning equals maximum flavour.\xa0 \n\nFinally, the bun — the crowning glory. Instead of using the typical brioche hamburger buns, Chia decided to go slightly off the beaten path. He discovered that the traditional Hainanese sweet bun was a unique alternative.\xa0Soft, pillowy, yet still able to hold structure, it also pays homage to Singapore’s roots. Upon visits to several traditional bakeries, rejecting those that were too sweet or soft, Chia tracked down one that hit the sweet spot.Early in the week, Chia releases slots for orders via Instagram, with “The Smash Hit” priced at S$17. You can add fries to make it a complete meal at S$19.50.Thursdays and Fridays are for sourcing the dry-aged beef and fresh buns, and cooking the onion jam. On weekends, between 12pm and 2pm, customers can come by to collect their orders. His partner Lee handles marketing, admin and orders as well.We arrived on a Sunday morning to watch Chia in action at his home balcony. It’s a delicate operation, as he expertly smashes the meat over a portable camping flat-top grill that he specially ordered from the States.We take one bite of the burger, and it explodes in mind-blowing goodness. It’s a messy affair, though, and Chia’s mother dashes over to give me wads of tissue to soak up the burger’s dripping juices, concerned yet amused.\xa0Says Chia: “A quintessential burger is something that’s easy, fast, not too fancy. It’s meant to be a little bit cheeky, not something you eat every day, when you’re feeling like a cheat day. For me, there’s no in-between burger. If you want to have a burger, you’ve to be prepared to put on a little bit (of weight), and maybe go for a run the next day.\n\n“That’s pretty much my philosophy and how I live my life,” adds Chia, whose favourite burger joints in Singapore include One Fattened Calf Burgers and the now-defunct Omakase Burger.While at present Burger Daddy only does pick-ups, we recommend consuming the burgers on the spot. There’s a casual outdoor seating area, but do be mindful of neighbours. \n\nThe response has been supportive so far, with the bulk of orders from friends and family.\xa0On busy days, Chia can prepare 20 to 32 burgers in a day.\n\nThe journey, however, has not been easy, as he has had to contend with challenges such as wet weather, space constraints (especially as he lives with his family), inexperience, and finding ways to make the business sustainable. Until Burger Daddy can find a way to build demand for dry-aged beef in bulk, the price of the burger will remain the same, he says.\xa0In a way, the pandemic has been a good testbed for similar home business models to pop up, says Chia. Other similar outfits include Black Goat Burgers.\n\nChia describes this project more as a “collaborative food-centric creative outlet”. Further down the road, Chia envisions expanding into designing merchandise and zines, or doing collabs with bars, event pop-ups and music festivals. Selling burgers from his own food truck is the “real dream”, he adds.“We’re not too worried about banging things out. We plan to take things as they come, to do what we love and still uphold quality,” he says.For now, Chia has a new veggie burger up his sleeves, though he’s coy about it. He plans to roll it out by the end of the month.We’re already digging it.\xa0Book a ride to Burger Daddy.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/krispy-kreme/:['Known for popularising the glazed donut, Krispy Kreme is a name that is familiar to sweet-toothed fans around the world.\xa0The donut chain, which landed in Singapore in October 2013, has operated largely as takeaway stores for your donut and coffee cravings.While its Great World City outlet had seating for 30 people when it opened in 2014, the seating area has since closed.The brand has given its Suntec City outlet an overhaul, complete with new furnishings and a seating area. Its flagship store now boasts a new cafe experience for donut aficionados. Launched on April 14, the store can seat around 16, going by our estimation.\xa0A post shared by HungryGoWhere (@hungrygowhere)Although the tables are small, each of them is accompanied by a plug, making it a work-friendly spot. Whether you’d be able to withstand long hours doing work on the small tables is another question. The chain also has a standard set of drinks available on its menu, which you can find here as well as at its other outlets. From coffee-based drinks to its Chillers (S$6.90), an ice-blended drink, there is a sizeable number of options available at the cafe.Fans of Krispy Kreme will be delighted to hear that the stall also has its iconic paper hat by the entrance, which you can take home with you as a keepsake. Aside from a new space, the world-famous brand has also introduced three flavours unique to the outlet at Suntec City: Matcha Crunch, Choco Bomb and Espress-o (S$4.20 each).The Espress-o seems to be the most interesting flavour of the three, as matcha and chocolate flavours are featured on Krispy Kreme’s permanent flavour lineup in other variations.\xa0It comprises coffee powder and a coffee drizzle that packs a punch. It’s perfect for people who prefer strong, bold flavours with a slight bitterness — much like an espresso shot.\xa0Otherwise, you can’t go wrong with the decadent Choco Bomb or Matcha Crunch.The former is a classic flavour packed with chocolate filling in the middle and topped with even more chocolate. It’s finished with chocolate shavings and mini wafer rolls atop the donut.The latter is a matcha-flavoured stuffed donut that is topped with Oreo bits for that extra bit of crunch. The matcha flavour is pleasant without being too overwhelming.\xa0\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Feuds: Saizeriya vs Milan Shokudo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn celebration of its launch, any purchase of two exclusive flavours would entitle you to a free Original Glazed donut (S$2.90).

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/seah-im-food-centre/:['Good news: Seah Im Food Centre finally reopened in March after six months of renovation! The beloved hawker centre now sees new amenities, an upgraded ventilation system and a cleaner environment for diners.\xa0It also welcomes the return of 38 cooked food and drink stalls, with familiar household favourites such as Daliman’s Korner and Aspirasi Food Galore. There’re also six non-food vendors. The remaining vacant stalls are up for bidding, so we’ll hopefully see more entrants to the hawker centre soon.\xa0Seah Im Food Centre is a popular haunt for yummy lunchtime fixes — and understandably so. One is spoilt for choice here, what with the plethora of food options available.\xa0Fret not, we’ve got you covered. This guide compiles some must-try stalls at Seah Im Food Centre that are bound to provide a satisfying meal.\xa0Seah Im Food Centre, 01-53, 2 Seah Im Road\nOpen: Monday to Saturday (9am to 3pm)Why visit: There’s something irresistible about flavourful curry gravy laden on a heap of ingredients atop a fluffy bed of rice. It’s the ultimate comfort food, for the dishes are reminiscent of homecooked meals.\xa0And at Seah Im Food Centre, Kheng Nam Lee Curry Rice is the closest you’ll get to savouring a taste of home. There’s a myriad of cai (dishes) to choose from, and the stall is famed for serving tasty goodness on a plate. The curry here is on the lighter side and the dishes are cheap and delicious – just the way we like our curry rice.\xa0Price range: $Crowd faves: You mustn’t miss the signature Assam fish, which boasts succulent flesh drenched in a tangy Assam sauce. It’s a star item that usually sells out by noon, so fastest fingers first! Seah Im Food Centre, 01-36, 2 Seah Im Road\nOpen: Monday to alternate Saturday (6am to 3pm)Why visit: This halal-certified stall is reputed for its handmade epok epok, also known as Malay-style curry puff. Bite into the crisp, buttery pastry, and it reveals a generous amount of warm filling. Ingredients include tangy, slightly spicy sardine or curried potato with egg.\xa0Each umami-filled bite will have you reaching for more, thanks to its golden brown flaky crust. Note that the epok epok is available from 11am until it sells out. Those popping by the stall can also indulge in the other grub on display. Believe us, there’s no dish that’s not a hit with the crowd.\xa0Price range: $Crowd faves: We’ll go back for the samosas (four pieces for S$2), which are sold only on occasion. It features a toothsome filling made from potatoes and spices. While the portion may be small, it makes for a great snack after meals.\xa0Seah Im Food Centre, 01-44, 2 Seah Im Road\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (10am to 9pm)Why visit: Should the word “Thaksin” ring a bell, that’s because it’s the name of Thailand’s first prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra. You guessed it – Thaksin Beef Noodle is named after the man himself!\xa0The halal-certified stall is famous among locals for its hearty and authentic Thai beef noodles, and for a good reason — the owner picked up the recipe from a Thai lady who used to sell it in Bangkok. Prepared Thai-style, each spoonful of broth is chock-full of herbaceous flavour.\xa0Why travel to the Land of Smiles when you can relish authentic Thai fare right here at Seah Im Food Centre?\xa0Price range: $Crowd faves: The beef noodles (S$8/S$12) are the highlight of the menu. Each bowl touts an aromatic broth, flat white noodles and tender beef. Alternatively, go for the beef pad thai (S$7.50), where silky-smooth noodles are stir-fried and tossed to aromatic perfection.\xa0\xa0\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Junction Westgate opening with promos; will house 23 tenants, including new halal teppanyaki\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHawker Hustlers: Hipster hawker Ray Yeo of Bei-Ing Dimsum Club on reinventing dim sum and his love for all things Japan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeah Im Food Centre, 01-52, 2 Seah Im Road\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (8am to 8pm)Why visit: We can all agree that yong tau foo (stuffed tofu) is a go-to lunch option, especially when we’re spoiled with a drool-worthy bowl comprising a heap of ingredients.\xa0For the uninitiated, yong tau foo refers to a dish that bears similar traits to mala hotpot – just without the spice. You can take your pick from a range of proteins, greens and carbs, which are served in a pool of broth or served gan (dry).\xa0At Yong Tau Fu, previously known as Tian Ji Niang Dou Fu, you don’t get the liberty of choosing your own ingredients. You can, however, pick a fixed set comprising seven different ingredients (S$4.20) or you can go for the fixed set of six pieces with your choice of noodles or rice (S$4.30). You can also add on extra ingredients at a cost.Price range: $Crowd faves: If you’re not keen on a classic soup broth, the laksa (six pieces with noodles for S$5) won’t disappoint. It’s creamy, mildly sweet and packs a spicy punch.\xa0Seah Im Food Centre, 01-47, 2 Seah Im Road\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (6am to 10pm)Why visit: Round off your meal with an array of drinks, courtesy of Az Zumar. This Muslim-owned stall is a favourite among regular patrons, often drawing long queues at lunchtime. When we arrived at the stall, we quickly joined the line, determined to find out why Az Zumar is so well-received.\xa0Turns out, there’s a vast range of beverages to choose from, spanning from Thai red milk tea (S$2 for a small cup, S$3.50 for a big cup) to iced lychee (S$1.70). Az Zumar is also reputed for its creamy teh halia (S$1.40), a slightly spicy and sweet blend of ginger tea.\xa0Price range: $Crowd faves: Craving a refreshing thirst quencher? Then, the sugarcane lemon (S$2.50) is the perfect beverage to beat the heat on a sunny afternoon. Seah Im Food Centre, 01-24, 2 Seah Im Road\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (11am to 8.30pm)Why visit: Nothing quite hits the spot on a rainy day like a comforting bowl of fish soup served in a piping-hot claypot. Teochew Fish Porridge Da Pai Dang 潮州鱼粥大排档 is the one to make a beeline for if you’re craving sliced fish soaked in a tasty broth.Seafood lovers can also swap out the standard fish protein for seafood.To complete the meal, diners may choose to add yam rice (S$1.50) or braised pork rice (S$1.50). You can add on other ingredients, too, namely the fish maw (S$2/S$4/S$6) and fish roe (S$2/S$4/S$6).\xa0Price range: $Crowd faves: Order the bestselling item, the claypot porridge soup (S$8.50/$12.50). It features tender fish slices simmered in a rich soup, made even more flavourful with the hearty porridge.\xa0 Seah Im Food Centre, 01-27, 2 Seah Im Road\nOpen: Thursday to Tuesday (8am to 8pm)Why visit: True to Singaporean belief, if there’s a line, the food must be fantastic. Zhan Yuan Pig Organ Soup certainly sees long queues, and its pork organ soup (S$5) is indeed worth the wait. The dish is served with a multitude of ingredients, such as pig offal and lean pork slices.\xa0We think the soup is the star of the show, though. The light-tasting broth is enriched by the sweetness of the pork, and there’s a gentle tanginess from the kiam chye (salted vegetables). It also has a slight peppery kick, which adds to the addictiveness of it all.Price range: $Crowd faves: The pig’s stomach soup (S$5) is another well-received item. Not only can diners savour its creamy richness, it’s also packed with a moreish, umami flavour. Seah Im Food Centre, 01-18, 2 Seah Im Road\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (11am to 9pm)Why visit: Hands up if you love fried chicken as much as we do! Look no further than G Meal to satiate your fried chicken cravings, for the stall dishes up mouthwatering chicken that’s fried to crisp perfection.\xa0The fried chicken can be paired with either fries or fragrant chicken rice. There’s a host of delights to go for; we recommend ordering the fried wing rice (S$4) or fried chicken cutlet rice (S$6.50).\xa0The stall also serves two different types of chilli, but our favourite is the Hainanese chicken rice garlic chilli. It’s definitely not for the faint-hearted, for it packs a spicy punch.\xa0Price range: $$Crowd faves: If you’re sharing with your loved ones, the super big smoked chicken rice (S$3.50 for one pax, S$9 for two pax, S$15 for three pax) can feed up to three persons. It’s a popular item, thanks to its smoky and tender chicken meat. EDITOR’S NOTE: In an earlier version of this article, MakanBoleh said that its epok epok was available from 5pm. The stall has since clarified that the epok epok is available from 11am and that its samosas are available only on occasion.\xa0For more ideas on what to eat, check out our guide on affordable economic rice stalls and food spots along the Thomson-East Coast line.\xa0All stores except for MakanBoleh, Yong Tau Fu, Zhan Yuan Pig Organ Soup 展源猪杂汤 and G Meal are on the GrabFood delivery service and offer free delivery (up to S$3 off) with GrabUnlimited.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/808-eating-house/:['808 Eating House may sound like your run-of-the-mill, void deck coffee shop, but it’s really anything but.Southeast Asian flavours take centre-stage here, with a carefully curated menu underscored by familiar flavours with a fusion twist.A post shared by HungryGoWhere (@hungrygowhere)Just think: Fresh, raw oysters (S$8 per piece) topped with pickled green papaya sauerkraut and Sichuan chilli oil, and Peanut In A Cup (S$5) — a dessert of peanut milk and muscovado syrup made in-house.Chef Eugene Chee, 30, is the young Singaporean chef behind the counter. Having trained at critically lauded restaurants such as Atelier Crenn in San Francisco and Singapore’s Cloudstreet, Chee has since struck out on his own with 808, a cosy 29-seater located in Insta-worthy Joo Chiat.The restaurant is a departure of sorts from his fine-dining roots, in the sense that it’s a chill, casual eatery with a menu built with accessibility in mind.“We wanted to create a space where people can come together, have a great time and enjoy delicious food,” he says. “I’m sharing the kind of food that I like to eat!”\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50% off at picturesque date spots, including Wildseed Cafe at The Alkaff Mansion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHawker Hustlers: Hipster hawker Ray Yeo of Bei-Ing Dimsum Club on reinventing dim sum and his love for all things Japan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd indeed, 808 feels more like somewhere you’d head to for a chill Friday evening with friends, and less so like a special-occasion-only dining spot. There are plenty of small and big plates that encourage communal dining, too.The playlist is an eclectic one as well — Chee is a music lover who drew on the cult favourite Roland TR-808 synthesiser as inspiration for the restaurant’s name. During our visit, we bopped to tunes from the 90s, but we understand that this can vary from anything from Teresa Teng to Nirvana.Nonetheless, his culinary background still shines through, such as in the Chicken and Egg (S$4) — a chicken fat chawanmushi with creme fraiche.There’s also pickled quail eggs (S$6) with black vinegar and molasses and duck fat financiers (S$10) — small cakes rendered in duck fat served with a generous serving of chicken liver mousse.We particularly enjoyed the Sweet XL Clams (S$24), fresh clams in a hua-tiao wine broth and egg floss shavings, and the barramundi (S$28) with a spice-rich garam masala pumpkin puree.This was a hosted tasting.For more new stores to check out, read our stories on Luckin’ Coffee and BHC Chicken.Book a ride to 808 Eating House.153 Joo Chiat Road\nNearest MRT station: Eunos\nOpens: Tuesday to Thursday (6pm to 11pm), Friday to Sunday (12pm to 3pm, 6pm to 11pm)153 Joo Chiat Road\nNearest MRT station: Eunos\nOpens: Tuesday to Thursday (6pm to 11pm), Friday to Sunday (12pm to 3pm, 6pm to 11pm)AuthorJia-En has worn several hats in her career — first writing TV scripts, then food and lifestyle stories at Wine & Dine.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/lunch-hour-healthy-eating/:['It’s lunch hour once again! You have just about an hour to grab a bite and get back to work. Are you wondering what to each for lunch?If you are on a quest for good nutrition or keen on eating healthy at work, here are seven effective steps to help you eat better and encourage your colleagues to do so as well.Start by picking items with less fat. Here are some tips:If you cannot “guesstimate” the nutritional content of a dish in front of you, ask the service staff how it is cooked. The exchange of information may help you determine if the dish you want to eat is high in fat, saturated fat, cholesterol or salt.You should preferably buy and eat packaged food that carries the Healthier Choice Symbol. Alternatively, you can read the Nutrition Information Panel if it is included on the food packaging. Use the figures to pick items with less fat, saturated fat, cholesterol and salt.If the product does not list the quantitative information on the label, then study the ingredient list. Beware of high-fat ingredients (for example, vegetable oils, shortening and hydrogenated oils), added sugar (sugar, honey and glucose) and added salt (sodium chloride and sea salt).Always ask for more vegetables as you need to eat enough to meet your veggie goal for the day.If you order economy rice, you can pick two different brightly coloured vegetables, including one green leafy vegetable such as spinach, chye sim or kailan. This will help you to get enough for the day and harness the nutritional benefits of variety.When you order a one-dish noodle meal, specifically ask for more vegetables. Though you may need to pay a little more, it’s worth getting the extra veggies for the sake of your health.However, you might want to steer clear of unhealthy vegetables such as sambal kangkong.A high salt intake is associated with elevated blood pressure. As you pick your foods, bear these tips in mind:Many of us like a sweet ending to every meal, so we unconsciously reach for dessert, candy or chocolate to satisfy our craving. These items are high in sugar, and sometimes, fat. If you indulge in them often, you will pile on unnecessary calories and gain weight.The most nutritious sweet ending to a meal is fresh fruit. Most workplace canteens in Singapore usually offer a variety of cut fruit, so take advantage of the nicely peeled and portioned fruit to fulfil your daily fruit recommendation and satisfy your longing for something sweet.If you have slipped into the habit of accompanying your lunch with a sweetened drink, then replace it with water. Not only will you save some money, you’ll also save plenty of calories, which would otherwise have added to your weight and your waistline.You might also enjoy sipping on hot coffee or tea through the day to stay alert. If you drink your coffee and tea neat, that is fine, but if you like adding sugar, then you may want to cut that down. These additions can contribute to extra calories.Gradually reduce the amount used and you will be surprised that your taste buds can be reconditioned to accept a less sweet taste.Alternatively, you can look for beverages such as 3-in-1 coffee with the Healthier Choice Symbol, as these have less sugar than the regular offerings.As lunch is one of the main meals of the day, try to select food items from each food group to balance your diet. Select a staple, vegetable, lean protein and fruit to nutritionally round off your meal.If there aren’t many healthier options at the workplace, why not pack lunch from home? Place it in the refrigerator at work, reheat it in the microwave, and you can eat the nutritious meal that you’ve whipped up. Your health is worth all the effort.Exercise portion control to manage your weight. Do not indulge in large portions or extra servings. You can tell the canteen staff or food vendor to serve you less, rather than accept everything they put on your plate.If you are bored or stressed at work, do not simply turn to food! Relax by talking to your colleagues, going for a short walk or working out at the gym.Select a balanced lunch meal from the offerings, including a staple, vegetable, low-fat protein, and fruit. Opt for dishes cooked healthily to make them low in fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, salt and sugar.Make an effort to include more wholegrains, fruit and vegetables to up the fibre and nutrient density of your meal. If you cannot get a healthy meal during lunch hour despite all your efforts, pack a nutritious lunch and bring it from home.Even if you are tempted, do not overeat. Have your regular portion on your plate, and avoid eating or drinking any extras.This is an updated version of an archived article.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/mister-donut-singapore/:['How long would you queue for donuts? Some people are willing to do so for hours, it seems.When popular donut chain Mister Donut held a brief stint in Singapore in 2022 as a pop-up store at Jurong Point shopping centre, it was mobbed daily by a ravenous army of sweet-toothed Singaporeans who patiently waited in line — for up to a whopping five hours.The July pop-up in Singapore was a market test for the donut brand that originated from Boston in the 1950s.\xa0The brand has since gone viral in Japan, with the headquarters of the Japanese franchise located in Osaka. It boasts 9,557 outlets in various parts of Asia, such as the Philippines and Taiwan.Given the success of the Singapore month-long pop-up, Mister Donut will be settling down in the country — permanently. It is slated to open on May 21, at Bishan’s Junction 8 shopping centre.The takeout specialty store’s first local branch will be brought in by F&B company RE&S, which is behind popular casual Japanese options such as Ichiban Boshi and Kuriya Dining.RE&S will be working closely with the brand’s Japanese operator, Duskin, both by using ingredients from Japan and sending Singapore staff for training at the Mister Donut Academy in Osaka.The donuts at Mister Donut’s Singapore outlet will be priced between S$2.30 and S$2.50 per piece. They will also be available for purchase in portions of half a dozen for S$14 or 10 pieces for S$23.Don’t miss Mister Donut’s signatures, including the Pon De Ring, a unique donut comprising eight dough balls linked together to form a ring. It’s made with tapioca flour for a lighter, mochi-like texture.Besides the classic flavours of original and strawberry, the Pon De Ring will also have a Singapore-exclusive flavour — chocolate!If you’re looking for more traditional donuts, there will also be yeast donuts available on Mister Donut’s menu. There are a myriad of options to choose from, such as the fluffy cream-filled angel cream, the honey dip, and strawberry ring.\xa0Other crowd favourites include the unique choux-based French cruller and the chocolate donuts. The latter is coated in rich, silky chocolate and is available in flavours such as golden chocolate, coconut chocolate, and a Singapore-exclusive strawberry chocolate.Mister Donut will also be giving away limited-edition merchandise with any purchase on May 21, including folders and sticker sheets.\xa0Do note that there will be a limit of 10 pieces per transaction (the Pon de Ring is capped at four pieces) for each customer. This is because there will be a limited quantity of donuts produced to ensure the best quality.Given the limited quantity for sale, the outlet will close once its donuts have sold out, so head down early if you don’t want to miss out.Book a\xa0ride to Mister Donut at Junction 8 when it opens.Junction 8, 02-27A, 9 Bishan Place\nNearest MRT station: Bishan\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (11am to 8.30pm, or until sold out)Junction 8, 02-27A, 9 Bishan Place\nNearest MRT station: Bishan\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (11am to 8.30pm, or until sold out)AuthorEvan started off writing about food on Instagram, before joining outlets such as Buro and Confirm Good to pursue his passion.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/capitaland/:['Singaporeans tend to think of our shopping malls as the perfect place to chill during weekends, but most of us have never seen them as tourist destinations. CapitaLand is hoping to get people to see our shopping malls in a whole new light by launching a series of specially curated in-mall experiences, including a food tour and an Instagram-focused photography walking trip.Branded under CapitaLand’s “Explore the City” campaign, participants can gain a “stamp” on their CapitaStar app for completing each of the four available experiences. They can get up to $150 worth of shopping and dining vouchers by collecting all four stamps.If you’re a foodie like us, you will love the “Food Thrills” experience. Each tour package costs $50 and includes five dining vouchers from various CapitaLand restaurants, worth a total of $110. Participants can choose from three different packages, which can be purchased on Klook at http://bit.ly/klookcapland. Some of the restaurants featured in the tours include\xa0Tonkotsu Kazan Ramen at Funan Mall, Muchos and\xa0Red House Seafood at Clarke Quay, Arteastiq at Plaza Singapura, and Prego at Fairmont Singapore.HungryGoWhere was invited to join a media tour last Thursday (1 April), where we got to try dishes from two restaurants – Tonkotsu Kazan Ramen and Muchos.\xa0Tonkotsu Kazan RamenWe sampled two delectable ramen dishes: their iconic Beef Sukiyaki Kazan and the Kazan Karamiso.The Beef Sukiyaki Kazan is the restaurant’s signature “volcano ramen”, served in piping hot stone bowls. The aroma of its unique tonkotsu and sukiyaki soy sauce paste blend created quite the impression right away. Sure enough, the sukiyaki brings a sweetness to the broth that is not usually found in tonkotsu ramen, and the succulent beef slices and springy noodles completed this wonderful dish.Beef Sukiyaki KazanNext up was the Kazan Karamiso, another “volcano ramen”, but this time a synthesis of tonkotsu and miso soup bases. The miso paste adds a tinge of spiciness to the soup, and goes well together with the thick, hearty tonkotsu broth, bringing out the best of both worlds from the two classic ramen soup bases. The char siu meat was thick yet tender, and was marinated to perfection.Kazan KaramisoMuchosFans of modern Mexican cuisine will find much to love with Muchos’ offerings. The first thing we tried were the Nachos\xa0chips, which in addition to the deliciously crunchy chips and tantalising sauces came mixed with spicy minced chicken.Nachos\xa0chipsMuchos Platter, which is a hearty medley of skewered prawns, calamari, potato wedges, hot wings, corn chips, quesadillas and salsa roja, filled our bellies with its myriad of exquisite tastes. To top it all off, a nice glass of margarita completed the experience.Muchos PlatterFor people keen to embark on a more touristy experience to explore the sights and sounds of Singapore, the #Instawalk Tour option may be a good choice. In this local tour experience, a guide (who is a local influencer) leads small groups on a short tour in the area surrounding several CapitaLand malls, showing them “Instagrammable” places and showing their charges how to take stylish urban snapshots.\xa0To find out more about these experiences, visit\xa0 https://www.capitaland.com/explorethecityAuthor© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/guan-hoe-soon/:['Most nyonyas (Peranakan women) will have you believe that the most wholesome Peranakan cuisine can only be churned out from their own kitchens.No doubt about that.But the truth is that Peranakan food preparation is both tedious and time consuming. And with most modern nyonyas shying away from the kitchen these days, rempah- (Peranakan spice paste) making or the hands-on preparation of nyonya food in Singapore is fast becoming a dying art.Needless to say, the local Peranakan community has been booking tables at Peranakan restaurants in droves.One Peranakan restaurant that has benefited immensely from this trend is Guan Hoe Soon. Since year 1953, the oldest Peranakan restaurant in Singapore has been dishing out no-frills Peranakan cuisine from a pre-war shop house unit in Joo Chiat Road.But since October 2009, it has ‘upgraded’ to a bigger and brighter unit at a renovated shophouse along Joo Chiat Place.Gone are the dreary tables covered with dated pink table cloths and accompanying metallic chairs; and in their place are marble-topped wooden tables in a brightly-lit dining room overhung with Oriental red lanterns. The only sign of the restaurant’s maturity is a weary-looking business plaque bearing the eatery’s Chinese name, hung proudly next to an altar.It is reassuring to know that the enterprising third generation owner, Jenny Yap, has expanded her Peranakan restaurant empire, with openings further afield from the Eastern strip.But despite the hubbub of changes, Guan Hoe Soon continues to be a draw with its lush Peranakan cuisine and wallet-friendly prices.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

He also made headlines when he retired just four years later and returned all of his stars. Fun fact: He once made a young Gordon Ramsay cry during service, when the now-renowned chef had worked under White.The English House is a local concept opened by White in 2018 that features classic English flavours as well as a variety of Asian-inspired dishes.As a way of giving back to the community, the restaurant announced the launch of a special “inflation menu” priced at just S$9.99 to help lighten the burden amid rising inflation.For context, an average main dish at the restaurant would normally set you back around S$30 to S$50. \n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50% off at picturesque date spots, including Wildseed Cafe at The Alkaff Mansion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe menu was launched on May 1 and is available from Monday to Sunday, for both lunch and dinner.Some examples of dishes on The English House’s inflation menu include an ox cheek pie, an upcoming kung pao chicken linguine and the debut item of slow braised Stoddart’s scotch shin of beef ragu, calamarata pasta.There are also dishes with a stronger Asian influence, such as the honey glazed BBQ pork belly fried rice, Hong Kong soya chicken wing with braised egg and rice, and Buddha’s delight vermicelli for vegetarians.There is no mention of an end date for the inflation menu, so if you’re looking for an affordable meal at a restaurant with all the vibes, this is it.Book a ride to The English House by Marco Pierre White.EDITOR’S NOTE: This article has been updated to correct the price of the Inflation menu.28 Mohamed Sultan Road\nNearest MRT station: Fort Canning\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (11.30am to 3pm, 5.30pm to 11pm)28 Mohamed Sultan Road\nNearest MRT station: Fort Canning\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (11.30am to 3pm, 5.30pm to 11pm)AuthorEvan started off writing about food on Instagram, before joining outlets such as Buro and Confirm Good to pursue his passion.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/cronuts-singapore/:['Singapore just got their first few batches of ‘cronuts’ and they are proving so popular their retailers have to count their cronuts before they are baked.Part croissant, part donut, this hybrid buttery, sugary phenomenon has taken New York City by storm, drawing snaking lines outside its birthplace, The Dominique Ansel bakery. Queues begin forming at 6.30am daily, an hour and a half before the store opens. The cronuts sell out within minutes, and each customer is allowed to buy a maximum of two.The cronut craze came to Singapore at the end of June 2013 with local bakeries making their own versions of this famed flaky pastry. However, to stay within licensing laws, Singapore’s versions of the cronuts go by other names: Da Paolo calls their’s ‘crodos’, while Patisserie G calls theirs ‘Gnuts’.Da Paolo’s cronuts come in two variations — one type filled with créme patisserie and another type glazed with bittersweet chocolate (available at\xa0Da Paolo Gastronomia\xa0outlets island wide, $4.90 each).Patisserie G\xa0at Millenia Walk began selling the ‘Gnut’ on 15 July. Their croissant-donuts come filled with salted caramel, lemon or chocolate and are sold at $5 a piece.Cronut-inspired confections are also available at the\xa0Sugarloaf Cafe\xa0at Temasek Polytechnic’s Culinary Academy, but only on Thursdays and Fridays between 10.30am-2.30pm. The demand for these is so high that each customer is allowed only a maximum of three pieces.Fuelled by the cronut craze, creator Ansel has already worked on a new dessert — the frozen s’more. This is custard-like whipped vanilla ice-cream, held together by chocolate\xa0feuilletin, covered in marshmallow and\xa0skewered on smoked applewood sticks. Ansel’s latest dessert is said to be inspired by a trip to Istanbul, where he tried\xa0dondurma, a traditional Turkish ice cream he describes as “chewy.”On the first day the frozen s’mores went on sale at Ansel’s bakery, they sold out by 2pm.However, we probably will not see the frozen s’more on our shores soon.Unlike the cronut, the s’more cannot be packed away and neither does it travel well. The frozen s’more has to be torched on order and has a softened ice-cream centre that needs to be eaten immediately.There is therefore little chance of even getting friends holidaying in New York to bring back a box of these goodies. We will just have to wait for patisseries in Singapore to get into a frozen s’more frenzy.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

You can enjoy their must-haves at this new 68-seater restaurant at Orchard Central.Some of the dishes on the menu include their signature Tendon – a donburi bowl of lightly battered, crispy seafood, meat and/or vegetable tempura layered over a good portion of steaming Japanese Aomori rice with an umami tare glazing sauce drizzled over.Other favourites that they are well known for are their Japanese soba and udon noodles that complement an array of tempura in a combination of textures and flavours.\xa0We managed to try their different dishes such as the Tempura, Chawanmushi, Cold Udon, Tenya Tendon.All their dishes feature ingredients sourced from Japan. Their tempura flour, tare sauce and togarashi chilli are customised blends that use secret ingredients unique to Tenya.During our tasting, the Tempura went down smoothly and had a good crunch to it. But, it was not too oily and was light on our palette. The batter had the right consistency.You could taste the freshness of the prawn and the ingredients used for the batter, making sure that it did not have an artificial taste to it.\xa0For us, the Chawanmushi which contains Steamed Egg with Special Dashy, Prawn, Chicken, Kani Kama (crabsticks) and Shiitake Mushrooms.It had a tasty flavour to it while the consistency of it was not too watery or thick, making it on point.\xa0The Cold Udon had a bouncy and chewy texture to it that bodes well with the sauce that comes with it.We particularly enjoyed Tenya Tendon, which is priced at $8.50 as it was a good bowl of various ingredients such as the Tempura Prawn, Red Fish, Squid Pumpkin and French Beans.The different ingredients provided a blend of different textures and flavours for us.When the restaurant launches, you can try out their other dishes such as Seafood Tempura Cold Soba (for $17.30)- containing Tempura Prawn, fresh Anago Scallop, Red Fish, Pumpkin and French Beans or the Kakiage Tendon (priced at $8.90)- peeled shrimp, Squid, Kani Kama, Onion and French Beans.There are no meat options available as well such as- The Mushroom Vegetables Tendon ($7.90) which contains Shiitake Mushrooms, Shimeji Mushrooms, Enoki, Sweet Potato, Lotus Root, Pumpkin and French Beans.For $11.90 you could get the Mushroom Vegetables Tempura Cold Soba which contains the same ingredients as the Rice Set but with Soba instead.At just $2, you can score the Hokkaido soft-serve. Though others have described it to have a familiar White Rabbit sweet flavour, we felt that it was not the case. But, the soft-serve was indeed rather sweet and creamy so do try it out if you have a sweet tooth.You can enjoy all these dishes comfortably as your dishes will be served by the restaurant’s sensor-navigated robot waiters.\xa0Try all the above dishes and bask in the ambience of this digitally advanced restaurant, by visiting 181 Orchard Rd, #B1-01 Orchard Central, Singapore 238896.For more information, visit https://www.tenya.com.sg/Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

Foodwise, a bigger portion of the menu is devoted to seafood but the usual staples are all there.\xa0We know grandma and the rest of the clan will give their stamp of approval, still, here’s what to order:1. Dim SumGreen siew mai, anyone? You can probably only find it at Swatow Seafood Teochew Restaurant. This Teochew style steamed dumpling, unlike its yellow-skinned Cantonese style contemporaries, consists of just minced meat (no prawn) and is served with punchy black vinegar ($4 for 2 pieces). Another Teochew specialty, the plump crystal dumplings are offered in both savoury and sweet options, $3.20 for 2 pieces. The sticky mochi-like skin goves way to the textural crunch of vegetables for the former, and soft inviting red bean paste for the latter.2. Steamed Pomfret Fish\nYou cannot visit a Teochew restaurant and not order the steamed pomfret (seasonal price).\xa0If there’s a hallmark of the cuisine, this is it. At Swatow, they only use meatier pomfrets that weigh at least 800g and it’s served\xa0savoury broth-like sauce, preserved salted veggies, and mushrooms.3. Imperial Fried Egg with Duck Meat ($12)\nAnother dish that you will only find at the Serangoon outlet. A take on the orh luak (oyster omelet), the simplicity of this humble fried egg belies the high-level skill it takes to achieve the golden brown, puffy texture and slightly crispy edges — the key is down to the high heat and a big fire when frying. With a higher egg to tapioca starch ratio, the egg is custardy inside and studded with duck meat and a verdant of scallions.\xa04. Swatow Signature Crayfish\xa0\nSeafood is definitely one of the main attractions at Swatow Seafood Teochew Restaurant, with a bigger part of its menu devoted to crustaceans and other swimmers, compared to its sister outlet. Besides a galore of options that include the classic Teochew Cold Crab (seasonal price), the Swatow Signature Crayfish is a must-order for its wok-hei and chye poh (preserved radish) flavour — it’s kind of like\xa0local fried carrot cake meets Hong Kong fried noodles. Unhinge the succulent flesh of the crayfish from its shell, and eat it with scrambled eggs, onions, sprouts, and chye poh.5. Sugar-coated Yam Cubes\nAhhh…. the sweet and sticky orh nee (yam paste with gingko nut), the go-to dessert at every Teochew restaurant.\xa0Instead of the quintessential pudding,\xa0why not go against the grain and have the sugar-coated yam cubes ($16)? These bite-sized, sugar-crusted fried snack cubes contain warm soft yam, the consistency of mashed sweet potatoes.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/fai-kee-fish-head-bee-hoon/:['Fai Kee Fish Head Bee HoonZi Char makes up a huge part of Singapore’s food culture, serving warm and hearty dishes reminiscent of home-cooked meals. The best part? It is always good value for money – bringing togetherness amongst family and friends over great food. We went on a food hunt to discover the best delicacies from Fai Kee Fish Head Bee Hoon to try out their top five best-selling dishes.The stall is nestled amongst blocks of flats in sleepy (though quaint!) neighbourhood of Commonwealth. Fai Kee Fish Head Bee Hoon is a hidden gem serving a wide variety of Zi Char dishes at economical prices. Located at about a 5-minute walk from Commonwealth MRT station; definitely a great place to drop-by if you happen to be in that area.If you are undecided what to order, we highly recommend sampling their hor fun. For those who prefer settling for a dry dish or something less savoury and have something lighter, definitely order their Sam Lou (Sliced Fish) Hor Fun. Albeit it being plain-looking, the dish is actually incredibly fragrant and addictive – once you start on it, you can’t stop. The Chef here is not only very generous with their fish slices and tau gei (beansprouts) but also allow customers to enjoy the taste of a smoky wok hei.If you are one who prefers their hor fun wet and soaked in gravy, we suggest ordering their seafood hor fun. This stall is not only generous with the portion size but also includes ingredients like snakehead fish slices, pork, sotong and prawns. Enjoy slurping on the delicious hor fun!A comforting dish for many, having a soup dish is almost essential for the Chinese during meal times. The Fish Head Soup, known to be their signature dish, is packed with loads of nutritional goodness. Albeit it being slightly rich, the dish is rather flavourful with huge chunks of thick snakehead fish pieces added generously. You could also choose to have it with Bee Hoon if you feel exceptionally hungry on that day.A\xa0 staple for all Zi Char lovers, it is definitely on my top must-order dishes. This intensely flavorful dish first gained the attention of diners when popular Cantonese hawker stall\xa0 Hong Kong Street Chun Kee started promoting it and has since become a perennial favourite. The familiar smell of fermented prawn paste and the crispy crunch of the juicy, tender drumlets will surely leave you wanting for more. The Prawn Paste Chicken is one of the best-selling dishes from Fai Kee Fish Head Beehoon as it is freshly fried upon order and served piping hot. Be careful, not to scald your tongue and fingers while enjoying this delicious goodness!The classic Beef with Bittergourd is stir-fried in black pepper sauce, which brings out the fragrance of the two main ingredients. Unlike the usual varieties, the dish here is cooked to contain more sauce which prevents the meat from drying out. The sweetness from the Beef slices also complemented well with a hint of bitterness from the Bittergourd.Sweet and Sour Pork, also known as “goo lou yok” is a nostalgic childhood dish to many. Many would know it to be their go-to side dish at a typical Cai Png (Mixed Vegetable Rice) stall. The deep-fried pork pieces here are made to be both crunchy and chewy, unlike the more common variant. The sauce is not too overpowering and complemented well with sweetness and saltiness from the use of ketchup as well as rice vinegar. Definitely a twist from the conventional and a dish that is ‘safe’ for the not-so-adventurous.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/mutiara-seafood/:['Typically a big communal feast, a visit to a seafood restaurant tearing into crab legs is the quintessential tourist experience in Singapore. And few do that better than the Jumbo Group.We paid two visits to Mutiara Seafood (Mutiara means “pearl” in Malay), the group’s first Muslim-friendly seafood restaurant. The first visit was on a hot afternoon during the holy fasting month of Ramadan and the second one three weeks later for dinner.The two experiences were vastly different.\xa0With the restaurant fairly empty in the day (understandable given that it was during the holy fasting month), the service staff were unhurried. Conversely, dinner service, with five other groups present, felt lively. The staff were also chirpy and attentive, refilling our cups and replacing our plates before we could ask. Mutiara takes after the tried-and-tested format of Jumbo Seafood restaurants — a large al fresco dining space, banquet-style dining tables that come with wet wipes, and of course, those fish tanks.According to the introduction in the menu, the restaurant takes inspiration from when Singapore was a fishing village in the Malay Peninsula when most made a living from the sea.Catered to a Malay clientele, the Muslim-friendly menu is predominantly written in Malay, with English and Chinese translations.\xa0While the menu is smaller than that at Jumbo Seafood, it includes a handful of appetisers it shares with its sister outlets, such as the dragonfruit lobster salad with lumpfish caviar (S$20).\xa0Some dishes, however, have been substituted with other proteins, such as the mocha fried chicken (S$16/S$24/S$32) and sweet-and-sour chicken (S$16/S$24/S$32). Mutiara’s menu is a combination of kampung-inspired offerings and mainstays of a regular seafood restaurant.The Jumbo Group certainly gets points for inclusivity. There were two groups having a business meal when we were there for dinner, and it was nice to see a gathering of different ethnicities.\xa0My dinner companion noted that the ambience was more relaxed than that of Jumbo outlets and a good substitute to get your seafood fix without struggling to get a booking.\xa0On the whole, all of Jumbo’s signatures are recreated faultlessly at Mutiara.The scallops dibalut dalam keladi cincin or scallops wrapped in yam ring (S$20 for small) arrived as six parcels of mid-sized, succulent scallops wrapped in a thick jacket of yam paste fried in a light batter.\xa0Its signature black pepper mud crab (S$88.20 for 900g) was coated in a piquant butter and black pepper stir-fry. The crabmeat was naturally sweet and, with skill, could be released from its shell entirely.We also got the tilapia deep-fried and served with a Nonya sauce (S$40.60 for 700g) and mee goreng gaya ‘Melayu’ (S$20 for small).\xa0The mee goreng, a sizeable portion of yellow noodles fried with an assortment of squid, prawns, vegetables and eggs, hit the spot and was one of the better-tasting versions I’ve had.You’ll want to take out your camera for the tilapia when it is brought to the table. Cut down the middle, then deep-fried along with its head, this sculptural piece de resistance is crispy on the outside and tender-white on the inside.\xa0The Nonya sauce it is in is a delightfully aromatic sweet-and-savoury gravy made of more than 20 ingredients. Our friendly wait staff wouldn’t reveal the entire recipe, but after some persuasion, said that assam, galangal (a spice), shallots, tomato and shrimp paste were in the mix.An appetiser available at Jumbo Seafood restaurants as well, the cumi goreng garing or crispy fried baby squid (S$16) was as advertised. Fried till crunchy with a sweet-savoury glaze, it would make a good snack on its own. We had it with spoonfuls of steaming white rice.\xa0From the new grilled section of the Mutiara menu, we tried the udang bakar Jimbaran, or Jimbaran grilled prawns (S$28 for four), which are named after the Jimbaran beach in Bali that’s known for its casual seafood eateries by the sea.\xa0The large prawns were butterflied and topped with a sweet sambal, then grilled till the shells were slightly charred.\xa0Essentially chilli crab on a budget, the sos daging ketam chilli dengan roti goreng irisan (S$18) comes with four slices of fried mantou and a small bowl of chilli-crab sauce with chunks of crab. \nMantous are typically fried whole, so that the outside would be a crispy brown, and the insides soft and fluffy.\xa0While Mutiara was generous with the shredded pieces of crabmeat, we were slightly bewildered that the restaurant had chosen to slice up the mantou for this dish.The rest of the dishes were middling.\xa0The baby “kai lan” (S$14) with garlic arrived a tad undercooked.\xa0And our dessert — a bowl of bubur keladi dengan kacang ginko dan labu or sweet yam paste with pumpkin and ginkgo nuts (S$5) — wasn’t particularly memorable either. The tablespoon of thick yam paste was covered by a thin pumpkin rectangle that didn’t add much flavour to the dessert. All the components projected differing degrees of sweetness, resulting in a dish that tasted monotonous. Is it conducive to conversation? When crowded, you might have to speak a few decibels louder, as with most bustling seafood restaurants.Is a reservation necessary? Not for lunch, but if you’re coming with a big group, it’s best to make a booking, especially if you intend to tuck into lots of fresh seafood.How to get there? It’s located at the Geylang Serai Community Club, which is beside the Geylang Serai Market and Food Centre.Things to note:\xa0HungryGoWhere paid for its meal at this restaurant for this review.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/casa-vostra-singapore/:['If you’re a pizza addict, chances are you’d probably have heard of the highly raved-about La Bottega at Joo Chiat.The popular Italian restaurant is opened by chef-owner Antonio Miscellaneo, a Singapore permanent resident who was born and raised in the north of Italy.\xa0But did you know that you can now get his famous pizzas delivered to your doorstep with his new brand, Casa Vostra (Italian for “your home”) in Singapore?The name is a play on Miscellaneo’s now-defunct private dining project named Casa Nostra. A precursor to his Joo Chiat pizzeria, the concept was known for its fluffy, woodfired oven-baked pizzas and long waitlist.Like most authentic Italian food, artisanal pizza can cost you a pretty penny in Singapore, especially when you dine out at a snazzy Italian restaurant.Miscellaneo decided to join hands with local F&B group Ebb & Flow, which is behind brands such as Tigerlily Patisserie and Michelin-starred Sommer, to create Casa Vostra.The delivery-only concept represents an evolution from Miscellaneo’s roots of serving guests in the privacy of his own home, as his pizzas are now accessible to everyone in the comfort of their own home.“We believe that there are plenty of people out there who are discerning in quality and would love to enjoy this kind of experience at home, instead of having to sit through a whole meal at a restaurant,” the team told HungryGoWhere.Thus, the collaboration is envisioned to become the go-to choice for convenient ready-to-heat pizza kits at home. The pizzas are already available for purchase on its website and on GrabMart. GrabMart will be the only major food delivery platform carrying Casa Vostra’s offerings.\xa0\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrabFood teatime deals: 8 stores with up to S$6 off your afternoon snacks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTreat yourself to a hearty, no-stress office lunch from A-One Signature, Ishiro Fusion Bowl & Hua Zai Roasted Duck with up to 60% off\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssemble the ultimate cheat-day feast with up to 60% off Burger King, Canadian Pizza & Wingstop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the team noted that “even though comparisons are inevitable, Casa\xa0Vostra is separate from La Bottega and will be focused on its own range of products that have been designed specifically for an at-home dining experience”.While La Bottega focuses on an elevated style of Italian dining, complete with pasta and antipasti, Casa Vostra aims only to deliver no-frills, restaurant-quality pizza. This means a product range that is distinguished from La Bottega’s offerings.“La Bottega cannot replicate an Amalfi Coast experience in Singapore, no matter how hard we try… Similarly, reproducing the experience of La Bottega at someone’s home would be unachievable,” they added.The pizza kits come with sauce and toppings separated from the dough to ensure it doesn’t turn soggy during delivery.All customers have to do is to toss the components onto the ready-made base and pop it into the oven for three to four minutes to achieve that delectably crisp yet airy texture.Casa Vostra’s pizza bases are similar to that of La Bottega’s signature “Newpolitan” pizza dough, which is based on traditional Neapolitan recipes but improved through modern techniques by Miscellaneo.According to the brand, Casa Vostra’s dough has been designed to withstand double cooking and refrigeration, after significant R&D was done to create a recipe for ready-to-heat gourmet pizzas.Pizza kits start from S$28 on GrabMart while half a “Newpolitan” Pizza at La Bottega is priced from S$20 for lunch and S$32 for dinner.The bases are made fresh daily using specially selected Italian flours and fermented over 48 hours, before being shaped by the master pizzaiolos in the central kitchen. They are then baked in a wood-fired oven at 500℃.The majority of the menu comprises rustic and traditional flavours, including the timeless margherita and cheese-laden quattro formaggi.\xa0But you’d also find many options focused on luxe produce sourced from Italy, such as the prosciutto e funghi, filled with earthy mushrooms and premium Italian prosciutto cotto, and mortadella that’s adorned with silky Italian mortadella and aromatic pistachios.\xa0Casa Vostra even has something for lovers of anchovies in the acciughe, a flavour bomb loaded with top-quality anchovies.Casa Vostra will be on the GrabMart delivery service in May, offering free delivery (up to S$3 off) with GrabUnlimited.

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/sando-with-a-twist/:['Most times, we look for the simple things in life. Other times, we’re looking for sandos. Not a simple sandwich with bread and jam. But a plump and juicy sando, with slabs of meats and flavourful condiments sandwiched in between.\xa0\xa0A sando is a type of Japanese sandwich. It’s characterised by fluffy shokupan (traditional Japanese milk bread) that is pillowy soft and sweet. Typically, it is filled with katsu (a deep-fried cutlet) or egg mayo.As sandos grow to be one of the most popular food trends of 2022, cafes have to work harder to keep things interesting for its patrons. From quirky names to peculiar combinations of ingredients, here are five places for sando in Singapore that are unique, and Instagram-worthy.\xa02 Everton Park, 01-61\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (8am to 5pm or until sold out)A funky crowd favourite that needs no introduction, 46 Mittsu recently relaunched to much fanfare as fans swooped in to reunite with their sandos after a five-month separation.\xa0Though its sando menu has been revamped, its wacky names (and flavours) are here to stay. The Firebird (S$15) is a unique combination of gochujang grilled chicken, purple slaw and sunny side up egg. Meanwhile, its Piggyback (S$15) features starfruit achar, a pickled starfruit.\xa0Aside from unusual ingredients, 46 Mittsu uses ciabatta bread in its sando instead of the usual shokupan bread. It gives a nicer texture and better mouthfeel overall with every bite.\xa0What to order: Firebird (S$15), Chamwitch (S$15), BEC (S$14)227 Upper Thomson Road and 314 Joo Chiat Road\nOpen: Operating hours vary across storesAs its name suggests, Hello Arigato is a cafe serving Japanese-inspired dishes. While we had no complaints when it came to its Japanese sandos in Singapore, its locally flavoured sandos are what make it stand out.\xa0The Joo Chiat outlet-exclusive HCG\xa0sando (har cheong gai sando, S$16) features a slab of deep-fried\xa0shrimp paste chicken sandwiched between shokupan and cucumber.\xa0Those visiting its original Upper Thomson Road outlet can try its otah sando (S$20) instead. The otah (fish cake paste) is breaded and deep-fried before being served with cucumber and a generous dollop of kaffir lime sambal and coconut mayo.\xa0What to order: HCG\xa0sando (S$16), otah sando (S$20), Ah Kun shibuya toast (S$15), tamago sando (S$14)\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Feuds: Saizeriya vs Milan Shokudo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa087 Upper East Coast Road\nOpen: Monday, Wednesday to Friday (8am to 6pm), Saturday and Sunday (9am to 6pm)\xa0Bloom Coffee is a treat for those living in the east. Not only does this specialty coffee house roast and serve its own coffee beans, it also does a good brunch menu.\xa0Instead of a sando, you get sangas at Bloom Coffee. Those looking for a novel experience for their taste buds can opt for the PB and strawberry basil sanga (S$15), a peanut butter and house-made strawberry basil jam combination.The tamagoyaki avocado bacon sanga (S$18) also puts a small twist on the typical breakfast combo by using Japanese rolled eggs. It lends the sando a fluffier texture overall.What to order: Iced white with oat milk (S$6), Sloppy Bob (S$17), PB and strawberry basil (S$15), tamagoyaki avocado bacon (S$18)200 South Bridge Road\nOpen: Daily (8am to 6pm)A popular work-friendly cafe with ample space and Wi-Fi, Grids Coffee & Bar has a fairly extensive menu to accompany you while you’re on your daily grind.\xa0With an entire section dedicated to sandos, you’ll find the greatest variety of flavours here. If you’re looking to try a unique beef sando in Singapore, try its thoughtfully named Moo-na-lisa (S$24). It combines striploin, caramelised onion, roasted garlic, wholegrain mustard seeds and greens.\xa0The result? A filling meal sandwiched between two slices of toasted bread, eaten entirely with your hands.\xa0The Pigasso (S$16) is an artfully crafted sando featuring panko-crusted pork loin with karashi rancher, namsui pear, shibazuke (pickled vegetables), torched parmesan and greens.\xa0What to order: Butter scones (S$4), Kyoto spring shaken iced tea (S$8), Moo-na-lisa (S$24)14 Lorong Telok\nOpen: Monday to Saturday (10am to 12am)If you’ve been to any hip events recently, you might have heard of Naga House. The dual concept cafe and bar offers a Japanese-inspired menu that includes sandos available for order until 9pm.\xa0For a classic flavour, opt for its triple tamago sando (S$12), which combines three different eggs: A roasted garlic egg mayo, a ramen egg and a fried egg. To give it an added touch of umami, the sando is topped with furikake, a Japanese rice seasoning.\xa0The DTF-Kinda Pork Chop sando (S$14) is a heftier option with fried pork chop and shredded cabbage paired with a smokey plum sauce.\xa0Unlike most other sando places in Singapore, Naga House uses a brioche bun with roasted garlic butter that lends the sando a soft and fluffy bite. The sando is served with sweet tapioca chips, which makes it quite a steal.\xa0What to order: DTF-Kinda Pork Chop (S$14), triple tamago (S$12), house-fried chicken with tamago kake gohan (S$14)\xa0All eateries mentioned above are on the GrabFood delivery service.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/uglyfood-singapore/:['If you loved and mourned UglyFood as much as we did when it announced its closure earlier this year, you’d be pleased as punch to know that UglyFood Singapore is making a comeback.According to Augustine Tan, founder of UglyFood, the new iteration of the business sees a complete overhaul of its logistics and delivery system, procurement process and even a new Pasir Panjang facility.“We’re back, and we’re here to stay for a while,” says Tan.“We took everything that worked about the old UglyFood — marketing and procurement — and those that didn’t work that well have been improved.” The initial closure was necessary for the business to move forward and revamp itself, says Tan. The media interest and the groundswell of public support that arose were instrumental in finding new partners and reassessing the business. “Without the closure, we wouldn’t have gotten this far. In some sense, the closure was a blessing and a curse at the same time.”On Jan 4, UglyFood made a shocking announcement that it was winding down operations, citing a lack of funds as one of the reasons for its closure in a social media post.At that time, the startup had been in operation for seven years, with a mission to reduce food waste in Singapore. It had its origins as a school project but took on a life of its own, selling surplus or blemished yet edible — “ugly but good” — produce to consumers.A post shared by UglyFood | Grocery Store 🌱| 🇸🇬 (@uglyfoodco)It also sought to educate the public about the value of blemished produce through web comics on its website and social media pages.Tan cited logistics as one of the main challenges for UglyFood 1.0. “Generally speaking, it was the warehousing, logistics, storage of food and last-mile delivery — these were the main factors.”The fact that it took quality checks very seriously also posed challenges. “We take in produce that may not be so pretty, so the logistics and quality checks have to be better than most — to be able to identify what is edible or not. We take QC very seriously — that is also a factor when it comes to cost.”\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5 must-have ingredients for a hearty steamboat meal this CNY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA driver’s guide to grabbing last-minute CNY goodies, while enjoying Esso savings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSurrey Hills Grocer opens 2nd outlet in Ion Orchard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn subsequent social media posts, the team remained hopeful that UglyFood would return. This sentiment was bolstered by pledges from supporters to aid crowdfunding efforts.After its January announcement, the startup held a closing-down sale at its Gambas Crescent warehouse to clear stock.The atmosphere was sombre, recalls Tan, who cashed out purchases during the company’s closing-down sale. “I think we built a very strong community base,” adds Tan. “Rather than ‘Oh, you’re closing down? Let’s go and grab as many things as we can!’, (the mood) felt more like a funeral.”Four months on, the company returns under new management, according to marketing collaterals and the new website interface that HungryGoWhere has seen.While Tan will be continuing as UglyFood’s founder, it’ll be a “new company, new team, new systems”.A post shared by UglyFood | Grocery Store 🌱| 🇸🇬 (@uglyfoodco)“More strategic partners have stepped in to solve issues that we were facing beforehand,” adds Tan, citing strong expertise in importing goods as one such value-add.He declined to name the partners in question.“Some (blemished) items will have less spoilage, for sure,” says Tan. The item descriptions on the platform will also be better updated to reflect the true condition of what customers are likely to receive.And the results are already showing. The company has been running limited trials to a small group of customers to test the system. “Our fulfilment rate is pretty much 100%,” says Tan. “Previously, almost every order had an issue.”With the improved backend and logistics system, UglyFood is also able to shave off costs and pass on the savings to consumers, he says.For orders placed before 5pm, customers can choose to get next-day delivery, too. Do note that the business will no longer be accepting walk-in customers at its new Pasir Panjang facility. In its current iteration, UglyFood 2.0 will be focusing on its roots — ugly fruits and vegetables — for the time being, but other produce such as seafood, meat and dry goods will eventually make a return.With the relaunch come better cold room facilities and refrigerated delivery trucks, so customers can be more confident that the goods they receive are of higher quality. By contrast, UglyFood 1.0 used ice boxes during delivery — while good, this had a shelf life of four hours.Milk, dairy and cheese products, which were previously difficult and costly to procure and deliver in their peak, chilled condition, will now be a cinch and will likely be added at a later stage.“For some things, we are still definitely working out the kinks.”UglyFood’s iconic web comics and characters will also continue to stay. Says Tan: “We’re trying to integrate (these) a lot more into the shopping experience itself, rather than just having comics.”\xa0He hopes that fans who previously rallied behind UglyFood in Singapore would return to show their support on the new site. “To support us, please just come to our website and buy something — it’s technically crowdfunding, but you’ll also get items.”Feeling hungry?

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/black-sesame-snacks/:['It’s out with the new and in with the old.\xa0In the past few months, you may have seen an explosion in popularity for traditional foods and flavours such as black sesame.\xa0There’s something about that distinctive nutty and toasty flavour that evokes a sense of nostalgia. It helps that the ingredient is so versatile.\xa0\xa0While we used to encounter it in traditional desserts such as black sesame paste and tang yuan, of late, eateries across Singapore have been creating innovative dishes that incorporate this classic flavour. We’re seeing trendy and unique black sesame snacks emerging, from black sesame mochi to black sesame latte.For those who are dedicated black sesame fans, we’ve rounded up some of our favourite interpretations of the flavour below.\xa0\xa05 Simon Road\nOpen: Tuesday to Friday (10am to 10pm), Saturday and Sunday (9am to 10pm)48 Lorong Mambong\nOpen: \xa0Tuesday to Friday (10am to 9.30pm), Saturday and Sunday (9am to 9.30pm)Why visit? One of the OG brunch powerhouses, Lola’s Cafe hardly comes to mind when you think about places to get black sesame desserts. But the cafe is good for more than just its honey paprika crispy wings (S$13) or its spicy tomato crab rigatoni (S$20) — its desserts are exquisite creations that are too often overlooked.\xa0Price range: $$Crowd favourites: Lola’s black sesame tart (S$7) is a must-try, even if you aren’t a die hard black sesame snacks fan. It features a black sesame white chocolate ganache encased in a buttery tart base that’s topped with crumbled matcha cookies for a contrasting mouth feel. This unassuming dessert has been on its menu for years now, but has yet to receive the hype it deserves.\xa0Jurong Point, 01-K8/9, 1 Jurong West Central 2\xa0\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (9am to 10pm)Changi City Point, B1-22, 5 Changi Business Park Central 1\xa0\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (8am to 9pm)\xa0Northpoint City, B2-158/159, 1 Northpoint Drive\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (8am to 10pm)Why visit? Fans of black sesame and mochi are sure to have come across MuYoo before. Known for its mochi and QQ bread series, the mochi used in MuYoo’s breads is unlike any other. It’s soft and sweet with a slighty milky taste.\xa0Price range: $Crowd favourites: The mochi is paired perfectly with its popular black sesame mochi (S$3) bread that is filled with a satisfying proportion of black sesame paste. Most patrons swear by microwaving the bread before consumption to get the bread warm and chewy with a satisfying mochi pull. 53 Tras Street, 01-01\xa0\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (12pm to 10pm) Why visit? Nesuto is a Japanese-inspired patisserie that prides itself on offering quality bakes and authentic ingredients. Its cakes have one characteristic in common: An impossibly light and airy chiffon sponge cake layer.\xa0Price range: $$Crowd favourites: Some may say it’s impossible to pick a favourite cake from Nesuto, but we are partial to its Japanese goma (S$11.90 per slice). After vanishing from Nesuto’s menu in 2021 (and made available only as a limited seasonal release), fans will be relieved to know that this goma cake is here to stay permanently. It features black sesame creme diplomat (a silky pastry cream) sandwiched in between a black sesame chiffon sponge cake and topped with Japanese sesame streusel.\xa0It sounds a tad overwhelming, but Nesuto has found the perfect balance between the savoury, nutty black sesame and the subtle sweetness of cream cakes. Perfect for fans of black sesame snacks.258 South Bridge Road, 01-01\nOpen: Tuesday to Thursday (11.30am to 8.30pm), Friday and Saturday (11.30am to 9pm), Sunday (11.30am to 5pm)A post shared by September Coffee (@septembercoffeesg)Why visit? This Korean-inspired cafe in Chinatown has drummed up much hype on TikTok last year due to its aesthetic, minimalist design. Aside from serving unique drink concoctions, the cafe also serves brunch and dinner fare such as fried chicken French toast (S$19) and honey butter udon (S$20), making it a great catch-up spot.\xa0Price range: $$Crowd Favourites: September Coffee’s iced black sesame latte (S$8) is highly raved about. It’s a creamy drink infused with a rich sesame flavour and the deep, robust flavour of espresso. It doesn’t hurt that the drink is in a pretty grey colour with flecks of black sesame powder on top. 779 North Bridge Road\xa0\nOpen: Sunday to Thursday (12.30pm to 10.30pm), Friday and Saturday (12.30pm to 11pm)Why visit? Inside Scoop is a popular ice cream cafe from Malaysia, so you know it’s got buzz to back it up. Patrons have praised its unique flavours, such as the soy sauce caramel (S$4.80) and 𝗨𝗻𝗶𝗰𝗼𝗿𝗻 (raspberry yoghurt and blue peaflower-stained milk ice cream, S$4.80), as well as its generous scoops of ice cream.\xa0Price range: $Crowd Favourites: While there are tons of ice cream places doing black sesame ice cream, Inside Scoop takes it a step further with its marbled sesame (S$4.80) flavour. As much as we love black sesame, the flavour can occasionally fall flat or, conversely, get overwhelmingly rich. Inside Scoop’s rendition is a blend of black sesame and peanut ice cream, which gives it a balanced flavour. The inclusion of peanut brittle also adds a welcome crunch to the dessert.\xa0\xa0\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Feuds: Saizeriya vs Milan Shokudo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVarious outlets across Singapore\nOpen: Operating hours vary across outletsWhy visit?

The eatery specialises in Chongqing grilled fish that is served with a tantalising broth and other side dishes.\xa0Price range: $$$Crowd Favourites: Since this is an article on all things black sesame, the focus of our recommendation is on Tanyu’s black sesame snack – the Double Taste Rice Cake (S$7.80). This deep-fried sticky rice cake with black sesame is crispy on the outside, but chewy with a mochi-like texture inside. It’s served with a drizzle of brown sugar syrup and is best eaten hot as an appetiser. 127 Bukit Merah Lane 1, 01-222\nOpen: Tuesday to Saturday (8am to 6pm or until sold out) Why visit? Founded in 1985, Poh Cheu Soon Kueh and Ang Ku Kueh is an icon in its own right. The ang ku kueh stall, known for its handmade creations, is always attracting long queues during lunch time for its soft and chewy ang ku kuehs. It has over 10 different flavours to choose from, including more modern flavour profiles.\xa0Price range: $Crowd favourites: When lined up on display in all its colourful glory, the ang ku kueh (S$1.40 each) from Poh Cheu looks irresistible. From the bright yellow hue of the durian flavour to the pastel green of the green tea flavour, you’d be tempted to buy one of everything.\xa0The good news is that you will probably find more hits than misses. We particularly recommend its black sesame flavour. The bouncy and soft skin encases a thick black sesame paste that’s just slightly sweet.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/sukiya/:['People who love gyudon will be glad to know that Sukiya’s beef-and-rice bowls have just gotten meatier, with the Japanese store launching a new XM size serving that boasts a higher meat-to-rice ratio than their regular beef bowls.HungryGoWhere stopped by Sukiya’s Suntec City store recently to find out for ourselves how much meatier the new XM beef bowls are:The XM size beef bowls, which start from $6.70 for the no-frills Gyudon (main photo), contains 165% more beef than the regular M sized bowls, but just 75% as much rice. Essentially, this means you’re getting way more of Sukiya’s signature simmered beef with slightly less rice for a hearty meal that’s more protein and less carbs.When it comes to taste, Sukiya is certainly one of the best gyudon in Singapore. We love how the thinly-sliced beef is so well infused in the simmering sauce, that the flavours have blended together into a delicious harmony of umami goodness.If you want something a little heartier, get the Half Boiled Egg Gyudon. The Japanese way of eating this beef bowl is to thoroughly mix the egg with the other ingredients, such that it coats both the beef and the rice.\xa0The gyudon flavour we loved most is also Sukiya’s best-seller in Japan: the Melted Cheese Gyudon (above, from $6.80 for the S sized bowl). This beef bowl contains a serving of beef, topped with a trio of Mozzarella, Cheddar, and Monterey Jack cheese, and doused with a generous helping of melted cheese.Initially, we thought that this combination of beef, cheese and rice would not work, and were more than pleasantly surprised that it did. It was delicious. Even though the bowl contained a generous lot of cheese, it did not feel overly rich or cloying. The sweet and umami flavours of the beef and simmering sauce complemented the cheese very well, making each bite one of beefy, chessy goodness.A special mention also needs to be given to the rice that is used in Sukiya’s beef bowls. The store uses 100% Koshihikari rice, a premium variety known for its lovely texture and aroma. A bowl of gyudon would taste very different depending on the type of rice used, and we are really glad that Sukiya decided to go with Koshihikari. The rice was tasty, had a satisfying not-too-firm bite, and a beautiful texture with just the right amount of stickiness to each grain.\xa0However, during the times when you are craving more meat than rice, the new XM serving size does come to the rescue. We liked how we get to eat more beef with each spoonful of rice. In fact, there is so much more beef in the XM bowl that we had some meat left over after we finished all the rice.\xa0Even though Sukiya specialises in beef bowls, the store does serve non-beef and non-rice options as well. One highlight is the Low Carb Yakitori Bowl (above, $6.50). Part of the store’s Low Carb series, this rice-free bowl contains bite-sized chunks of grilled chicken yakitori, plus a generous helping of shredded cabbage, and tofu as a replacement for the rice. A sesame sauce is drizzled over the bowl, turning it into a hearty salad that can serve as full meal.We love how the yakitori tasted like the real deal. Traditional Japanese yakitori is served freshly-grilled on skewers. While Sukiya’s yakitori is presented as part of a non-rice bowl, the grilled chicken chunks still boast the delicious charred flavour that makes yakitori so delicious. The tofu, which sports a clean, aromatic taste, was also a nice departure from the heavy rice dishes for days when you want something that is lighter on the palate.\xa0SukiyaSuntec City Tower 4,\xa001-647, 3 Temasek Boulevardhttps://www.sukiya.com.sg/Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/waffles-singapore/:['There’s no better way to beat the humidity in this unforgiving tropical heat than with a chilly scoop of ice cream and some waffles in Singapore. After all, cold treats and baked goods are always a welcome combination.\xa0Unfortunately, we’re creatures of habit, and when it comes to desserts, it entails turning to the same ol’ ice-cream parlours for the usual (and boring) plain buttermilk waffles.\xa0No hate for these OG waffles, but perhaps it’s time we stray away from the predictability of it all. How about stepping out of your comfort zone and going for lesser-known, atypical waffle creations?\xa0Picture fluffy kuehffles (kueh and waffles, say what?), a prata-waffle hybrid, and a dish inspired by the old-school chendol dessert – they’re delicious and fantastic for the ’gram, too.\xa0If you’re craving something a little out of the ordinary, be sure to check out these 10 spots for unusual and unique waffles in Singapore.\xa024 Sago Street\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (12pm to 10pm)Why visit: Number one on the list is certainly tea-specialty cafe, Ri Ri Cha (日日茶). Founded by the same folks behind popular ice-cream shop, The Better Scoop, Ri Ri Cha (日日茶) is their newest artisanal concept that prides itself on serving all things tea-based.Think tea-infused gelato flavours, which span the likes of matcha butterfly pea soy (S$5.50 for a single scoop) and duck shit oolong (S$5.50 for a single scoop).\xa0You may have also caught foodies touting its pi pa gao (loquat) mint ice cream on Instagram, which is another exceptional flavour that should not be missed.\xa0The establishment is conveniently located near Maxwell MRT station, which makes it a prime spot for diners in the vicinity.\xa0Price range: $Crowd faves: The signature nian gao waffles (S$6.80) are a standout. You’ll enjoy the chewy, sticky rice cake that’s embedded in the hefty waffles. The rice cake is also prepared with brown sugar, which lends a subtle sweetness to the dessert. 41 Holland Drive, 01-07\nOpen: Sunday to Thursday (12pm to 5.30pm, 6.30pm to 10pm), Friday and Saturday (12pm to 5.30pm, 6.30pm to 11pm)Why visit: 2nd Serving: Artisan Gelato & Tea isn’t just your run-of-the-mill ice-cream cafe. It’s inconspicuously hidden behind a vending machine, which certainly adds a fun element of surprise. Set foot into the store, and you’ll be wowed by its pretty-in-pink interior.\xa0Take your pick from a myriad of ice-cream flavours, such as banana honey roasted nuts (S$5.80 for a premium single scoop) and summer berries (S$4.80 for a classic single scoop).\xa0Drinks wise, we recommend going for beverages under the 2nd Serving Specials, which include the fizzy Sparkling Galaxy ($7) and Waterfall matcha latte (S$7 for hot, S$7.50 for iced).\xa0Price range: $Crowd faves: The seasonal waffles are the highlight of its menu. Pandan mochi waffles (S$8) are served from Sunday to Thursday, while the fudgy chocolate waffles (S$8) are available on Friday and Saturday.

Then, you may just fall in love with the churro waffles (S$8). Made from churros (a type of fried dough), the dessert is decorated with toasted marshmallows and dark cocoa sprinkles. Chocolate fans, you won’t want to sleep on this. 36 Kim Keat Road\nOpen: Tuesday to Saturday (10am to 5pm)Why visit: When it comes to one-of-a-kind waffles in Singapore, the kuehffles by The Ang Ku Kueh Hut certainly take the cake. The folks behind the eatery have spun their own bold twist to the usual waffle creations by baking traditional ang ku kueh in a waffle machine.\xa0The result is a kuehffle – a kueh-waffle hybrid. This innovative dish is a harmonious (and tasty) combination of the old and new, its flavour profile further elevated by the ice cream. It’s no wonder it’s a hit with diners!Choose from a plethora of ang ku kueh fillings, such as the classic peanut (S$3.50) and yam (S$2.50). Those who prefer modern flavours can opt for the hazelnut (S$3.50) or pistachio (S$2.50)Price range: $Crowd faves: Savour the treat to your heart’s content with The Merry Bowl (S$7), which comprises your choice of kuehffles, ice cream and sauce.20 Craig Road, 01-03\nOpen: Monday to Saturday (12pm to 2.30pm, 5.30pm to 10.30pm) and Saturday (5.30pm to 10.30pm)Why visit: Searching for awfully good waffles in Singapore? The prata waffles (S$24) at Firangi Superstar are the chef’s ingenious, scrumptious rendition of the classic American chicken-and-waffles combination. Opt for either Madras fried chicken or Madras fried tempeh to go with the dish.\xa0We recommend the former, as the fried chicken is prepared Madras-style (with a fairly hot curry sauce) and garnished with curry leaves and garlic. The fragrant waffle-pressed prata is also served with a delicious butter chicken sauce and jaggery syrup.\xa0Price range: $$Crowd faves: The crispy prata waffles are incredibly addictive, and you’ll find yourself ordering a second platter in no time.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/mustard-singapore-flavours-of-bengal-punjab/:['Using the name Mustard in Singapore is not an anomaly for this Punjabi and Bengali restaurant.Mustard oil is the traditional cooking medium here, and mustard spice is one of the seasonings extensively used in both cuisines.But I was interested in the restaurant less for its food history and more for the fact that its food reminded me of a long-gone Punjabi restaurant in Singapore — Ujagar Singh, located at the old Saint Gregory’s Place. It used to serve kebabs and deep-fried spiced lamb chops, and was so well-loved that till today, people reminisce about it.Despite being housed in a pokey space up some rickety stairs, people used to line up for a table just to eat its grilled meats that was served simply, unadorned with a fresh mint chutney.Well, the good news is that this Punjabi restaurant, Mustard in Little India, also serves lamb chops. While it is not the same, it was as delicious, for the grilled chops masale waliyan chaampan (S$15.90) were fork tender and came smothered with a\xa0 rich, spicy sauce. I would come back for it.Its platter of mixed kebabs (S$16.90) was also unusual. Mostly chicken kebabs, the seasoning for each version was different.Unusually, fish kebabs were also part of this offering.By the way, kebabs and food cooked in a tandoor or clay oven are all part of Punjabi cuisine, unlike the food of Bengal, which focuses on fish and vegetable cookery.Both can be found here at Mustard Singapore.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/cheeky-beehoon/:['There’ve been several new additions to the Katong neighbourhood in recent months, but an eatery dedicated to bee hoon? That’s different.Don’t take the traditional Chinese sign outside to mean that Cheeky BeeHoon is your run-of-the-mill eatery either. I made that mistake the first time I strolled past and still regret every bit of it, because it’s a seriously delicious find.It was days later that I found out it’s run by Chef Darwin Wong, an F&B veteran who’s worked in the kitchen of two-Michelin-starred Jaan and helmed the kitchens of butter-focused restaurant Beurre as well as the French-inspired izakaya, Jidai. In other words, he has some serious chops.His latest venture is cosy and inviting, decked in a style that oozes with ’70s nostalgia: Rustic wooden tables, vintage photographs and posters, and the kicker: A charming orange payphone next to the counter.Cheeky BeeHoon doesn’t try to reinvent the wheel, and instead, excels at taking a classic dish — bee hoon — and making it taste extraordinary with quality ingredients and flawless execution.\xa0Plus, service is brisk and efficient, and the staff is quick to introduce the menu to you — not that it needs much explaining. The menu is as fuss-free as it gets with just three variations of bee hoon (priced from S$8.80).I’m quite certain that this spot will become very popular in no time. In fact, the eatery filled up by 12pm during my visit — perhaps the proximity to the bus stop had something to do with it?There’s a reason why the signature cheeky bee hoon soup (S$11.80) is, well, the signature dish. The handmade bee hoon, which comes from Malaysia, soaks in the rich broth yet retains its firm, springy texture.\xa0The clams are fresh and meaty, the pork meatballs firm and well-packed, and the goji berries and fried shallots added a soft bite with sweetness that only accentuates the soup even further. Now, each sip is laden with umami, sweetness, a hint of pepper, and an evident wok hei kick. Overall, a very different bee hoon dish that got us raving.The noodle used in the dry cheeky bee hoon with braised pork (S$8.80) is the strangest thing. It tastes like thick rice vermicelli, has the chewy, bouncy “QQ-ness” of Taiwanese noodles, but is curly and soaks up the spicy-savoury sauce like instant noodles. Regardless, I am all for it.The accompanying braised pork belly is stewed so soft you can hardly pick it up without the meat falling apart, but that’s what makes this so special. The tasty fats meld with the sauce and noodles for quite the sensorial experience.\xa0At this point, the Cheeky BeeHoon staff suggests throwing in a spoonful of coriander garlic sauce (there are several sauces on the side of our table). It’s tangy and nutty, like fish sauce meets pesto — try it for yourself.Opt for a side of mala crispy pork (S$3.80) — a popular Sichuan dish that’s also known as xiao su rou or little crispy pork — to share around the table.\xa0Slices of marinated fatty pork (I’m getting hints of garlic and five spice) are deep-fried and studded with a mala powder that’s salty, slightly tangy, and more numbing than spicy. I could eat this as a meal, but I probably shouldn’t.Chef Darwin personally recommended the crab dumpling soup (S$4.80), with three medium-sized wontons filled with succulent real crabmeat and crunchy water chestnut bits. The skin is just thin enough to hold the fillings, and the texture of its bite is great. A must-have with the punchy chilli sauce on the side.All right, how novel is the charcoal youtiao with otah (S$4.80)? Don’t get turned off by the colour (it’s just activated charcoal mixed into the batter) because it’s some of the crispiest ones I’ve had.\xa0You’ll hear a crunch as you bite through the pastry into the comparatively soft otah, which is fishy, mildly spicy, and very, very flavourful. Cheeky BeeHoon also sells the charcoal youtiao on its own, which I imagine would taste fantastic dipped in soup.If you like your old-school drinks as much as I do, you’ll love the water chestnut longan drink (S$3) at Cheeky BeeHoon, served with bits of nutty pulp still inside. There’s a faint sweetness from rock sugar, and the several pieces of pitted longan inside are deliciously tangy.\xa0Give the pink guava sour plum drink (S$3) a try for the classic and charming pairing of guava and sour plum to tingle the taste buds. It’s refreshing and helps beat the sweltering heat. While I love the idea of stir-fried cabbage (S$3.80) with deep-fried shallots and lard, it lacks enough flavour to justify how oily the dish tastes. The glistening cabbage slices are a tad on the tough side and taste less sweet than I had hoped.\xa0Not a healthy dish for sure, but improve on the flavour of the cabbage and I’d be down to try this again.Otherwise, it’s safe to say that Cheeky BeeHoon dishes up solid comfort food that’d bring people back multiple times for a quick lunch or dinner. With the obvious meticulous attention to detail for most of its dishes, the eatery deserves that much.Is it conducive to conversation? Not so much — the small eatery was bustling with chatter during lunchtime.Is a reservation necessary? First come, first served!How to get there? Cheeky BeeHoon sits at the start of East Coast Road closer to Marine Parade, five bus stops from Dakota MRT Station’s Exit A.HungryGoWhere paid for its meal at this restaurant for this review.

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/vegan-food-singapore/:['Vegan food in Singapore is gaining ground. But do you know which vegan eateries will fill your body with nutrients and minerals that lead to optimal health?As someone recovering from cancer surgery, I had gone vegan practically overnight. When I began seeking out vegan eateries, too often, I would find that vegan options serve fried options such as tempura or fries (these are high in fat and sodium). Or they rely on dishing out plates with refined grains such as white bread, pasta and rice. These are often stripped of their fibre and nutrients, and can contribute to blood sugar imbalances.As a home cook, I know that vegan food can be fascinating — filled with flavour, colour and texture. So, when I eat out, I need whole foods that excite the palate in the most natural way — no diner grub or fake meats for me, thanks. Most of all, I want to be inspired by the joy of natural foods, ingredients and cooking techniques.Here are five vegan places in Singapore that are making the mark for me lately.Tanglin Mall, 03-122, 163 Tanglin Road\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (11.30am to 3pm, 5.30pm to 10.30pm)Think white tablecloths, impeccable service and high-end Thai food that bursts with flavour. Sarai’s meat-free menu — which showcases oft unexplored Thai flavours and ingredients — has plenty of options. I love small bites, so I enjoy ordering from the starters menu.The result: A bounty of fresh flavours from northern Thailand. ‘Best ofs’ include the mieng mak (lime and wild ginger wrapped in betel leaves, S$16), and the Thai sweet fern salad (S$22) with tamarind palm sugar dressing.\xa0If you’re not fussy as I am about fried foods, try the deep-fried corn fritters and Thai-style taco with stir-fried tofu, mushrooms and bean sprouts. Thai favourites such as a vegan pomelo salad, the Pad Thai and the vegetarian green curry are excellent choices as well, and taste clean and fresh rather than heavy as some Thai dishes can be.\xa0Go for Sarai’s Experience lunch menu ($78) or Experience dinner menu ($98) for the best value. It includes an amuse bouche, starter, main, and a dessert such as a pandan coconut pudding or mango sticky rice.Email anne@deliceasan.com for detailsOne of the best new finds in the vegan community has to be Delice Asan, a botanical gastronomy run by the gentle Anne Schot, who trained at Le Cordon Bleu in London. The UK outpost of the famous French cooking school (Julia Child, anyone?) is the first to offer an intensive plant-based training course, which Anne braved before opening up her home as a private-dining space for lunches and dinners.\xa0Prices start at S$115 for lunch and S$150 for dinner. Expect a carefully crafted multiple-course whole foods, plant-based tasting menu that can be Western or Asian in nature, served up in an intimate home setting.\xa0Besides delicacies such as seed cups with cashew nut cheese and mushroom dukkah, spicy heart of palm or ajo blanco, Schot is also adept at creating vegan sushi, Thai cuisines and more. Leave room for dessert, which can be a plate of vegan ice cream with fresh fruit and vegan truffle balls.24 Keong Saik Road\nOpen: Monday to Saturday (12pm to 10pm)Afterglow is a perennial go-to for vegan food in Singapore, thanks to its fully vegan menu with many raw food items. Raw foods are great for gut health and for helping to boost the immune system.\xa0A crowd fave is the vegan lasagne (S$24) — zucchini sheets filled with crispy dehydrated cherry tomatoes, marinated baby spinach, shiitake mushrooms, walnut ‘minced meat’, cashew cream cheese and pesto.\xa0Definitely order the Afterglow kimchi avo rolls (S$15) comprising almond sushi “rice” and housemade vegan kimchi (no fish sauce here!) topped with avocado. If you’re missing fries, check out the salted “egg”-less sweet potato fries (S$11) with baked (not fried!) sweet potatoes and seasonal vegetables topped with a homemade salted ‘egg’-less sauce that’s truly moreish.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHawker Hustlers: Hipster hawker Ray Yeo of Bei-Ing Dimsum Club on reinventing dim sum and his love for all things Japan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpress your interest in a form on its websiteLoaded Gun Kitchen, the popular dips company that got its start in the throes of Covid-19, has expanded into operating a plant-based event space. Its latest offering is its Disco Diner, a communal dining, bookings-only weekend party that serves up a whole foods, plant-based menu to groups of four.\xa0While you’ll see options with cheese on the menu, DM owner Lynn to talk about turning your own menu into a full vegan experience. Dishes are fun and funky, and meant for whole-table sharing.\xa0Right now, she’s offering Vietnamese sandwiches made with her popular Midnight Gospel shiitake mushroom burger patties and featuring a homemade portobello and king oyster pad grapow (mushrooms contain powerful anticancer compounds, by the way) served with housemade pickles (great for gut health). Also expect Lynn to serve up her take on Szechuan mapo tofu.Wanna share with people you love in a truly private setting? You can book out owner Lynn’s entire space for girls’ nights out, birthday gatherings, networking events and more. You take care of the invite list, and she’ll take care of the rest. All you and your posse have to do is rock up, eat and flip the party switch ‘on’. You can grab a space for S$117 per person.\xa0Oh, and be sure to take home a set of signature dips that can include faves such as the Umami Bomb Cashew Cream or the Sexy Green Goddess (S$16 and up), an avocado and cilantro concoction of pure deliciousness that can be eaten with tortilla chips, and even on cold pasta or a fresh paratha!Thomson Plaza, 01-109, 301 Upper Thomson Road\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (11.30am to 9.30pm)i12 Katong, 02-20, 112 East Coast Road\nOpen: Monday to Thursday (12pm to 9pm), Friday (12pm to 9.30pm), Saturday (11.30am to 9.30pm), Sunday (11.30am to 9pm)As someone recovering from cancer, I have to be super stringent on the nutrition factor. This no-frills eatery serving vegan food in Singapore has impressed, thanks to being truly health-focused while not busting the wallet.\xa0Here, expect plant-based healthily prepared food — meaning low salt, oil and sugar, and no hint of MSG, even in the most umami dishes such as the mala veggie medley (S$7.90 and up). Although some refined sugar (meaning, brown sugar; and yes, that’s a refined sugar) is used, this is indicated on the menu and is limited.\xa0Many of the condiments — such as the mala sauce and BBQ sauce, which features in items such as the excellent crispy veg maki (S$5.90 for four pieces) — are housemade and taste properly wholesome. You can have the sushi rolls, by the way, with brown rice, and grain-based sides include quinoa.\xa0The menu is extensive and includes Asian-style tofu and vegetable dishes as well as Western options such as a delicious beetroot hummus (S$9.90), a housemade black bean burger (S$13.90), a very yummy portobello steak (S$16.90) and pasta (S$8.90 and up).

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/what-to-try-at-bhc-chicken/:['This is a public service announcement for all Korean fried chicken lovers: BHC Chicken, the maestros of fried chicken in South Korea, has officially opened its doors in Singapore.\xa0This is the brand’s fourth overseas outpost, with two located in Hong Kong and another in Malaysia.BHC Chicken is best known for its variety – it has eight different types of chicken flavours on its menu, and a huge range of Korean snacks and mains to accompany its signature item.\xa0We never knew we’d need such an extensive list of options for our chicken till we went to BHC Chicken Singapore, but apparently we do. Of the eight, we managed to try three flavours: Bburinkle, Macho King and Hot Retro.Bburinkle is BHC Chicken’s signature dish that is available boneless (S$27.90), as wings (S$23.90), or as a whole chicken (S$31.90). It’s generously coated with a cheese and vegetable seasoning, but if that isn’t enough, the order comes with a yoghurt-based Bburing dip that features the same cheese and vegetable flavours.\xa0Impressively, the chicken skin remained crisp even after a prolonged photography session, trapping the seasoning in every crevice to deliver a rich and robust flavour.\xa0As someone with a weakness for savoury foods, the Macho King was a personal favourite. Similar to the Bburinkle, it comes boneless (S$27.90), as wings (S$23.90), or as a whole chicken (S$31.90). The difference lies in the sauce — the Macho King is drenched in a soy and honey-based oriental sauce, giving it a more intricate sweet-and-sour flavour.\xa0Of course, don’t expect it to have the crunch of its lighter-dressed counterparts.\xa0Similar to the classic fried chicken, the Hot Retro is also available in the form of boneless (S$25.90), wings (S$21.90) or as a whole chicken (S$29.90). Of the three varieties we tried, this chicken had the crispiest skin.\xa0True to its name, Hot Retro was fiery. The spiciness of the chicken stood out clearly, given that we didn’t have anything else to distract us from it. Our only gripe with the chicken was that it could be a tad juicier.What sets BHC Chicken apart from more widely known Korean fried chicken brands is its selection of sides and mains. Think spicy rabokki (a combination of ramen noodles and rice cakes; S$12.90) or Red King sotteok (a sausage and rice cake skewer; S$5.90).\xa0If you’re a fan of any chewy, spicy or carb-heavy foods, you won’t be disappointed by these items.For those who enjoyed the salty and creamy taste of BHC Chicken’s Bburinkle seasoning, try the Bburing Corndog (S$6.90). It’s a finger-sized appetiser, with the seasoned bread and cheese hugging the smoked sausage snugly.\xa0Don’t expect a cheese pull because the cheese-to-smoked-sausage ratio was disproportionate. But that’s the genius of BHC Chicken’s Bburing Corndog — it wasn’t too overwhelming.\xa0There are also more unique items on the menu, such as the fish congee (S$12.90), which the brand claims is a nutritious dish that’s packed with vitamins.\xa0\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50% off at picturesque date spots, including Wildseed Cafe at The Alkaff Mansion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall, the 108-seat space at BHC Chicken Singapore gets a thumbs up from us, as we feel it’s a great option for big groups. You get to make merry with friends over fried chicken and alcohol — what’s not to like?For its opening, BHC Chicken Singapore is giving away its original (S$5.90) or Bburing cheese ball (S$6.90) for every purchase from its chicken menu. This is limited to two redemptions per bill and runs until May 7. From April 28 to May 1, you also get a chance to spin the wheel for every dine-in receipt. Prizes include exclusive BHC merchandise, free sides such as cheese balls, cheese sticks or fries, and BHC vouchers for your next visit. It is limited to one spin per dine-in receipt, so send your luckiest friend.\xa0Adding to the festivities, BHC Chicken will have a photobooth running on April 29 and 30. You can snap an unlimited number of photos with your friends there. It will also be giving away free balloons from April 29 to May 1, if that is your jam.\xa0This was a hosted tasting by BHC Chicken Singapore.For more ideas on what to eat, read our stories on budget romantic restaurants and Granny Q Lemak Laksa.You can book a ride to BHC Chicken Singapore.

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/ramadan/:['With Ramadan starting on March 23 in Singapore this year, you may be on the lookout for places to break your fast after a long day at work. Or perhaps you simply want to gather with your friends and family to bond over some good food.\xa0While our island has no shortage of places where you can break fast, affordability may not always be on the cards. Especially with rising food costs and general inflation.That’s where we’re here to help. We’ve scoured the island for some wallet-friendly iftar eats during Ramadan that’ll satiate all taste buds and stomach sizes.\xa0214 Jurong East Street 21\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (10am to 8pm, or 4pm to 8pm for Ramadan hours)If you’re a fervent prawn noodle fan, then Deanna’s Kitchen should most definitely be on your radar. Owners Asri and Denise have been serving sizeable portions of its halal umami-packed prawn noodles at extremely affordable prices.\xa0Its latest dish, seafood fish soup (available only during Ramadan and limited to 30 bowls a day), is jam-packed with flavour and seafood such as fish, prawns and clams at just S$9.50.\xa0Beyond sharing their love for good food, the couple is big on giving back to society and previously gave away bowls of regular prawn mee to customers who might be struggling to afford a meal, no questions asked.\xa0If you are also struggling to afford a meal to break your fast this year, Deanna’s Kitchen is offering free bowls of its regular prawn mee (worth S$4) during Ramadan. You can request for a bowl at its Jurong stall from March 23 to April 20 and it will be served, no questions asked, as it has done since 2017.\xa0While the stall still charges a takeaway fee of S$0.30, it suggests bringing your own container to circumvent this. Seah Im Food Centre, 01-44, 2 Seah Im Road\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (10am to 9pm)If Thaksin Beef Noodle rings a bell, it’s because the place is named after former Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra and features hearty halal Thai-styled beef noodles. In fact, the former dignitary even visited this humble hawker store back in 2018.\xa0Thaksin’s beef noodles (the store’s, not the former prime minister’s) come with a flavourful beef broth and are topped with generous portions of beef imported from Australia and Brazil. Its owner Jaesen Ng had picked up the recipe from a Thai lady who used to sell beef noodles at the popular shopping outlet MBK in Bangkok.\xa0Choose from a variety of size options, but if you’re feeling it, definitely get the biggest bowl (S$10) for the greatest bang for your buck. With the former prime minister himself giving a thumbs up to these beef noodles, why not try a bowl for yourself if you’re in the area? 05-93/4, Far East Plaza, 14 Scotts Road\nOpen: Monday, Wednesday to Friday and Sunday (11.30am to 8.45pm), Saturday (11.30am to 9.15pm)Every true-blue foodie knows that in the middle of the most seemingly expensive locations, there would be at least one or two hidden places that serve up the best food at the most unimaginable prices. Puncak Best Noodles is one of those tucked-away gems, still serving up wholesome portions of Chinese-Muslim zi-char-style food at very accessible prices.Helmed by a team of Hong Kong zi-char-trained chefs, you can be sure of Puncak’s dedication to quality.\xa0Go for the signature wanton noodles (S$6.30) but have it with its special sticky, thick honeydew sauce (mostly honey, not so much honeydew) that is satiating and full of umami. If you’re particularly famished, you can add a side of fried wantons (S$7.30) to make your meal even more satisfying. Stall 11, Adam Road Food Centre, 2 Adam Road\nOpen: Monday to Friday (9.30am to 9pm)If you’re looking for one of the most value-for-money food places, then Adam’s Delight at Adam Road Food Centre has to be its poster child. For less than S$10, indulge in a huge portion of halal mee hoon/mee/kway tiao or maggi goreng, fries, fried egg and mutton that promises flavour, fullness and a satisfying iftar meal.\xa0Having fries with carbs might be quite full-on, but trust us – the sweet and salty mutton gravy, combined with the cheese and mayo drizzle on the fries is well-worth every calorie. It’s so good, you’ll make space — even if there isn’t quite any left! 01-28, Bukit Merah View Market & Hawker Centre, 115 Bukit Merah View\nOpen: Saturday to Thursday (12pm to 8pm)Despite having opened for a few years now, 786 Char Kway Teow, owned by a Muslim convert, is still commanding strong crowds. If you’re in need of a quick iftar meal, its long queues might deter you. But if you’ve got time to spare and a very strong craving for some wok-hei-heavy char kway teow, then 786 Char Kway Teow will be worth the wait.Owner Anis was a former banquet chef so he is well acquainted with what it takes to create the charred and savoury flavours commonly found in char kway teow, even without the use of pork or lard.\xa0For S$6.50, indulge in a large portion of halal char kway teow that comes with the usual – beansprouts, fishcake and cockles. You can even add cockles for an extra S$2 and still stay well below the S$10 budget. Stall 68, Ayer Rajah Food Centre, 503 West Coast Drive\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (11am to 10pm), closed on alternate MondaysHabib’s Rojak is helmed by owner Habib Mohamed who took over the business from his father. The store is so named because his father had named it after him when he was born.Established for more than three decades, it is well-known among the community for serving up the best and most authentic handmade Indian rojak.\xa0Prices of items start from 70 cents, so depending on your final selection, you can easily have a filling meal for S$7 or even less. Just make sure you keep count as you pick the items, if you want to stay within budget!\xa0The crowd favourites include its coconut fritters and crispy prawn fritters. And whatever you do, do not forget to enjoy your picks with its sweet and savoury dipping sauce. It comes with a smattering of chopped peanuts, and isn’t spicy. 17 Bussorah Street\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (8am to 2am)Stuck somewhere central and looking for a cheap, affordable bite that’ll keep you satiated till you reach home? Kampong Glam Cafe, situated right in the middle of the busy Bussorah Street, has some of the most affordable dishes in the area despite it being a touristy district.Its gado gado and tahu goreng (both S$4) are simple, delicious and filling enough for its price point. If you prefer more carbs for your iftar meal, it also has a selection of more substantial mains, such as mee goreng, roti john and nasi lemak.\xa0The only downside is that with the crowds it attracts, you could find yourself in quite a long queue during peak hours or seated back-to-back with adjacent tables.01-14, Bedok Corner Food Centre, 1 Bedok Road\nOpen: Friday to Wednesday (12pm to 9pm)Green Sky’s signature item may be its cockles char kway teow but its fried carrot cake also has its fans. The stall got its halal certification as it believes that good food should be shared with all, and its wallet-friendly price points are also a testament to that.\xa0\xa0While there is a clear consensus on the flavour and quality of its dishes, there are mixed opinions on its service standards.\xa0We say, if you’re the type of foodie that can look past anything in pursuit of good food and happen to be in the Bedok vicinity, then just dive right in and place your (correct) order. You’ll forget everything once you dig into its plates of oily, floury goodness. For more ideas on muslim-friendly options, check out our guide on Muslim-friendly Japanese restaurants or our review on Meokja by Jungga.\n\xa0All the eateries except Green Sky Fried Kway Teow are on the GrabFood delivery service and are offering free delivery (up to S$3 off) with GrabUnlimited.

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/affordable-burgers-singapore/:['Between the GST hike and inflation, dining out might feel like a luxury these days.But what’s one to do when cooking may not be a feasible option for those busy work days, or when you just have an insatiable craving for, say, a good freshly made-from-scratch burger?\xa0While rising costs of ingredients may have pushed some menu prices up, there are still some burger places in Singapore that are bent on keeping their prices wallet-friendly.\xa0We look at some of the best burger places in Singapore that serve burgers below S$10 to help you satisfy those meat and bun cravings without placing too much pressure on your budget.Sides and drinks are excluded, but some of these burgers are hearty enough alone to make a meal of it. And if you have a little loose change, we wouldn’t say no to the addition of fries.Multiple stores islandwide.\nOpen: Operating hours vary across outlets.Ordinary Burgers is a local burger brand that started out quite recently in 2019 and wants to bring gourmet burgers to the masses at affordable prices.\xa0Despite its name, Ordinary Burgers’s offerings are anything but ordinary. Its beef burger is a classic but we really liked the buttermilk chicken burger (S$6.80) which was deep-fried to crispy perfection yet still retained its juiciness.\xa0Multiple stores islandwide.\nOpen: Operating hours vary across outlets.Started by a group of trained restaurant chefs, Burgs by Project Warung has sold close to a million burgers across its current seven outlets since it opened in 2017.\xa0Burgs strives to keep its gourmet-style burgers priced low, and quality high. Some rave about the flavour and juiciness of its burgers, but we really loved how delightfully soft yet toasted its buns were.\xa0Its classic burger (S$7.90 at VivoCity, Causeway Point, 313@Somerset and Lot One) is the one to try, comprising a handcrafted patty, onion jam, garlic chips and cheese.Orchard Central, 04-23, 181 Orchard Road\nOpen: Daily (11.30am to 9.30pm)Katong I12, 01-17, 112 East Coast Road\nOpen: Daily (11.30am to 9.30pm)NBCB (also known as Nothing But Cheese Burger) has but one aim — for its diners to spout words of pure delight when they sink their teeth into its burgers.\xa0If you’re curious about the origins of its name, it’s because the former home-based business started during Singapore’s circuit breaker (CB) period in the pandemic, when owner Tommy had to whip up these burgers for his hungry, pregnant wife.Pregnant customer or not, we’re sure NBCB’s perfectly cooked burgers would satiate any craving. The place is known for its beef burgers but if you want to stay under budget, its chicken burger or CCB (S$8.90) also promises the same kick.

Your tummy will thank you for it.\xa0Midpoint Orchard, B1-04/05, 220 Orchard Road\nNearest MRT station: Somerset \nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (12pm to 8pm)For those in the know, Jtown Cafe is where all the great Indonesian street food is. Located across the road from 313@Somerset mall, it’s been consistently serving affordable food since 2009 at Midpoint Orchard, a well-known old shopping mall in Singapore.\xa0It’s love at first slurp with the bakmie ayam, consisting of springy handmade noodles topped with tender chicken chunks and bihun bakso (bee hoon with aromatic beef ball soup).\xa0And when you’ve had your fix of all the spicy goodness, indulge in its signature martabak. A traditional sweet, thick pancake paired with chocolate, cheese or peanuts, of which every bite promises sinful sweetness. It’s no wonder that the place is perpetually packed. \n\nWhat to order: Bakmie ayam cabe ijo — chicken with noodles and a spicy green chilli sauce (S$6.90), chocolate martabak (from S$3.20)Orchard Towers, 03-44, 400 Orchard Road\nNearest MRT station: Orchard \nOpen: Monday to Saturday (11.30am to 10.30pm)Hidden in the sleazy recesses of Orchard Towers is a gem that serves up consistently solid Thai fare.\xa0At Thai Tantric Singapore, the secluded no-frills eatery has an extensive menu of 40 dishes that are reasonably priced, between S$8 and S$14.\xa0Think: Deep-fried chicken wings that taste wickedly addictive, an impossibly fluffy Thai omelette with minced pork, and a thick and robust spicy tom yum soup. We don’t know where to get started. But the real star is the steamed sea bass in chilli and Thai sauce, a mix of sweet, spicy and sour that hits all the right spots.\xa0It’s best to come with a group of foodie-loving friends so you can feast on as many Thai staples as possible, against the backdrop of the thumping beats of the nightclubs.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/fun-facts-on-kopi/:['To get into the rhythm of healthy living, it is not hard to start rethinking your dietary options. If you’ve been having problems keeping your weight down, or you’ve noticed a growing belly, the sugars in your drinks may just be the culprit. To tackle this, one can start with everyone’s favourite local drink — the kopi or teh.Let’s break down what goes into your favourite drink by looking at some fun facts on kopi and teh.The well-loved drinks may be ordered in multiple ways in local lingo: Kopi/teh gao (extra-strong coffee or tea with sugar and condensed milk); kopi-C siu dai\xa0(coffee with evaporated milk, less sugar) or teh-C siu dai; kopi-O kosong (coffee without milk or sugar) or teh-C kosong; and so on.But did you know a typical cup of kopi (coffee with sugar and condensed milk) can have as many as 145 calories and up to four teaspoons of sugar? As for teh (tea with sugar and condensed milk), it has about 153 calories. What does this mean for you?Here are five fun facts on kopi to take into account every time you are tempted to reach for a cup.In running terms, breaking down the amount of sugar found in a small cup of kopi takes about 14 minutes and 10 seconds — yes, just a small cup. If you can complete a 2.4km run in 10 minutes, then you will need to run 3km, which is the distance from the Singapore Flyer to Marina Barrage, to burn it off.The amount of calories in a small cup of kopi and teh can easily equate to a bowl of minestrone soup, a hearty meat-based soup that’s filled with a variety of vegetables and tomatoes.This is because the sugar in your kopi and teh — four and five teaspoons respectively — adds to the total calories.We understand you need your daily cup of joe. Consider kopi-C siu dai instead — it reduces the sugar and milk added into the drink and cuts down about five minutes of running time.You can eventually work your way towards loving kopi-C kosong, which has no sugar and little evaporated milk, and has less than half the amount of calories. The aroma of the coffee beans comes through more strongly this way as well.Same for tea lovers: Switch to a cup of teh-C kosong, which comes with less evaporated milk and no sugar, and tastes similar to the famed Hong Kong milk tea.If you are ready to go much healthier, skip the evaporated milk and go for teh-O kosong (tea without milk or sugar), which has only five calories and requires a mere 38 seconds to burn off.Let’s put this into perspective: A cup of teh-C siu dai has 68 calories and contains two teaspoons of sugar, which would require around 1,500 steps to burn off. In comparison, an ice-blended green tea has 245 calories and contains three teaspoons of sugar. You’d need around 5,400 steps to burn it off.As for coffee drinkers, a kopi-C, which has 113 calories and four teaspoons of sugar, would require some 2,500 steps to burn off. A latte, which has 155 calories and three teaspoons of sugar, would require around 3,400 steps to burn off.On top of the carbohydrates you already take with your regular meals, your cup of teh adds another serving’s worth, equivalent to one-and-a-half slices of bread or half a bowl of rice.Next time you feel sluggish after lunch, you know the culprit is in the extra sugar from your drink.Don’t fret, you don’t have to give up your favourite food or drink just yet. Drink in moderation and adjust certain ingredients or portions to achieve a healthier lifestyle.Want to eat more healthily after reading about these fun facts on kopi?

It’s just like having desserts for breakfast. Reservations are recommended, but if you forget, then expect a short wait — the space is huge but diners also tend to linger because of its extensive menu and immaculate vibes.\xa0What to order: Granola (NZ$18), chitarra, scampi, tomato and chilli — egg dough pasta (NZ$44)Commercial Bay, Shop 22, Lower Albert Street, Auckland\nOpen: Monday to Friday (7am to 3pm), Saturday and Sunday (8am to 3pm)It’s not New York, but we promise you Best Ugly Bagels doesn’t disappoint with its Montreal-style handmade wood-fired bagels. In fact, the co-founder of one of Singapore’s most prominent bagel shops considers this the best restaurant he’s been to.Founded by celebrity Kiwi chef Al Brown, Best Ugly Bagels is so named because it concedes that after putting its dough through punching, rolling, boiling and wood-firing, it’s just that — an ugly bagel. But it’s also this manhandling that makes it one of the best out there. Compared with its New York counterpart, the Montreal bagel is crispier on the outside but chewier on the inside, and also has an airier texture.\xa0If you want the true NZ experience, try its marmite version (NZ$7.90), which comes with a light spread and a lick of butter.

But the restaurant remains a favourite of mine for those leisurely weekday lunches, especially with its prime location over the water right at the Auckland Viaduct.\xa0It’s also located right by the ferry building, making it one of the best waterfront restaurants in Auckland. If you’re popping out of the city on a sail to one of the nearby islands such as Rangitoto or Waiheke Island, definitely swing by Lula Inn for a small plate or two, and a tipple.\xa0What to order: Auckland’s original bottomless brunch (NZ$47.50), Paua and kumara croquettes — abalone and sweet potato croquettes (NZ$22)\xa0\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Feuds: Saizeriya vs Milan Shokudo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatisserie Cle brings its well-crafted pastries to new River Valley flagship for fifth anniversary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15 best Holland Village cafes for the ’gram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor coffee32 Lorne Street, Auckland\nOpen: Monday to Friday (7.30am to 3pm), Saturday (8am to 3pm) If you need a little caffeine as a perk-up after a whole afternoon of sightseeing and feasting but have no time to waste, then Receptionist Coffee is the perfect no-frills stop for a robust brew. The cafe is a literal hole in the wall and is staffed only by one barista — the receptionist — so be prepared to wait a little if there’s a queue.\xa0Despite being a one-man operation, the receptionist on duty is always friendly and impeccably dressed in a shirt and tie.

The bar is one of my go-tos for cool places to eat in Auckland, serving up a substantial menu and an extensive wine list.\xa0Determined to dish up the best of each season, the restaurant changes its menu relatively frequently. If you’re not quite sure what to have, opt for the Carte Blanche menu, which puts your dining experience in the chef’s hands.\xa0What to order: Carte blanche menu (NZ$75 or NZ$99, including oysters and dessert)\xa0For supper and drinksDownstairs, 40 Customs Street, Britomart Place, Auckland\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (5pm to 3pm)Seeking out Caretaker, an underground speakeasy with strong New York vibes can be quite tricky, but just keep a lookout for a green door emblazoned with a C and you’ll be on the right track.

These are said to belong to the fictitious caretaker that the bar is named after.\xa0With such an interesting backstory, location and premise, Caretaker is a bar for the books if you have a night in Auckland to spare.\xa0What to order: Just talk to the bartender and you’ll know what to have161 Ponsonby Road, Ponsonby, Auckland \nOpen: Tuesday to Thursday (5pm to 12am), Friday and Saturday (12pm to 1am), Sunday (12pm to 12am) If your travel wallet is feeling the pinch going around places to eat in Auckland CBD, then Lucky 8 is the place to go for your final nightcap and a tick in the box for a cool restaurant in Auckland. Everything — and we really mean everything — goes for NZ$8 at Lucky 8, so you can double down on cocktails and canapes all night without worrying about the final bill.The place serves up Asian-inspired tapas such as dumplings and pork belly fries that pair well with similarly Asian-influenced cocktails.

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/affordable-mala-xiang-guo/:['Any mala xiang guo (stir-fried spicy hotpot in English) fan worth their salt has a go-to stall for when the craving strikes.But such bowls can rack up quite the bill, especially when you go with friends and order a big portion for sharing.Some places have a minimum number of ingredients or spend per bowl, which means most bowls can cost you upwards of S$15 per person. That’s why it often makes the most sense to go in groups of two or more.We worked out eight cheap mala xiang guo Singapore places where you can get a pretty decent bowl of mala xiang guo for under S$10 per person, even as a solo diner.This will be the list to pull up the next time you’re think to yourself: I’m craving for some good, affordable mala xiang guo near me.For this article, we are estimating a minimum of two vegetables or mushrooms, one meat, and a carbohydrate for each bowl. Of course, if you have a bigger stomach, more ingredients can be added, albeit at a higher price.Some places charge by weight, so in these cases, we advise avoiding heavier items that retain water — tofu, fishcakes and the like. Do also expect some variations in the prices, which can fluctuate depending on the size and weight of your chosen food item.Beef and seafood items tend to be pricier, too, so chicken or pork is a more affordable alternative.Here’s where you can go if you’re looking for a satisfying and reasonably priced bowl of mala xiang guo in Singapore.Aperia Mall, 02-16 Stall R2, 12 Kallang Avenue\nNearest MRT station: Lavender\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (12pm to 9pm)Why visit?

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/virtual-restaurant-phat-fingers-opens-first-physical-store/:['Good news for fans of Korean fried chicken brand Phat Fingers! You can now order and indulge in its addictive crispy fried chicken on the spot, as it has opened its first physical store at Telok Ayer.Launched by TiffinLabs in 2021, Phat Fingers was available here only as a virtual restaurant. A virtual restaurant is an F&B store that does not have a dine-in venue and only delivers food to customers via a central kitchen.\xa0Known for its authentic fried chicken flavours and spice blends that are native to Korea, Phat Fingers opened the doors to its physical outlet on Oct 28.\xa0The physical outlet was made possible by Felix Tan, formerly a cabin crew member from Cathay Pacific Airways. He has roped in some of his former cabin crew colleagues to help him run the store. All of them were displaced at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 and they had been taking on other jobs to supplement their incomes.Tan has always dreamt of starting his own restaurant. He stumbled on TiffinLabs while surfing the web earlier this year and was intrigued by the unique operating model offered by the food tech company.Besides being a dine-in and takeaway store for Phat Fingers, the Telok Ayer outlet doubles up as a cloud kitchen serving other virtual brands in TiffinLab’s portfolio, such as Southern Soul, PotatoLab and Bap Bap Korean Rice Bowl.\xa0This model allows Tan to maximise his revenue per square foot and optimise his kitchen efficiency.TiffinLabs’ brands are also designed such that they can be operated with simple preparation steps. This means F&B operators such as Tan can pick up recipes and start operations quickly.For Tan, it took just 45 days to launch Phat Fingers, which he said was a “dream come true”. With this model, “we can minimise our rental costs and diversify our revenue streams”, he said.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50% off at picturesque date spots, including Wildseed Cafe at The Alkaff Mansion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe added that he was looking at starting more small-footprint F&B outlets that can function as cloud kitchens, as he hopes to provide consumers with more fried chicken options, anywhere and anytime.A must-have from Phat Fingers’ menu is the K-fried chicken. Choose from the three types of chicken parts available: Chicken poppers (S$7.99), six-piece tenders (S$9.99) or six-piece wings (S$11.99).\xa0Your selection of fried chicken will then be glazed with the sauce of your choice. If you prefer something on the sweeter side, you can try the honey butter or Psy’s soy garlic sauce. For spice-loving foodies, you can opt for the classic yangnyeom or nuclear spicy, which is made from the potent ghost pepper.Phat Fingers will also be selling its juicy burgers in the Telok Ayer store. The crowd favourite is Psy’s famous chicken burger (S$8.99). The tender chicken patty is served with a mildly sweet and garlicky sauce, wrapped between warm, soft buns.Hungry? Top up S$2 for a double-patty option.For sides, diners can munch on Phat Fingers’ addictive shaker fries (S$4.50).

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/tanglin-food/:['Tanglin has long held the reputation of being that “ulu” place that nobody really ventures to. Located on the outskirts of Orchard Road, Tanglin is just off the bustling shopping belt, and is often deemed its more subdued cousin.But this has changed in recent times. The once-quiet neighbourhood is seeing an injection of trendy new restaurants, in part because it’s more accessible now, thanks to the new Orchard Boulevard MRT station.As a nation of gluttons, new areas to explore also mean one thing — new food to discover! We sifted out some under-the-radar Tanglin food spots\xa0 — both old and new — that will get food lovers going.Tanglin Post Office, B1-02, 56 Tanglin Road\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (12pm to 10pm)Lad & Co is a quaint outpost of Lad & Dad, a British gastropub-inspired eatery that started as a humble hawker stall in Serangoon Gardens Food Centre before it moved to Maxwell Food Centre. Started by a father-son duo, it has gone on to make quite a splash in the food scene.\xa0It upgraded to a cosy bistro at Tanjong Pagar Plaza, before launching its new concept, Lad & Co, in December 2021. Lad & Co sells more casual British food, including an authentic English-style fish & chips (S$19) — a gratuitously crispy beer-battered Atlantic Haddock, served with a side of chips and mushy peas.\xa0Other decadent bar grub on its menu include the classic bangers & mash (S$16) and scotch eggs (S$12) with a golden molten centre, if seafood doesn’t tickle your fancy.With a breezy alfresco setting surrounded by fairy lights and greenery, Lad & Co makes for a wonderful spot to wind down during the evening with a pint in hand.Tanglin Shopping Centre, B1-01/02, 19 Tanglin Road\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (11am to 9.30pm)Bari-Uma is a hidden gem specialising in hearty bowls of tonkotsu ramen that boast a creamy and rich broth.It has served ramen at Tanglin home long before the recent deluge of trendy new food offerings. For a place that has operated for close to a decade, this authentic ramen joint is possibly one of the most under-the-radar finds in Singapore.As a testament to its authenticity, you’d often find many Japanese-speaking groups slurping on its signature ajitama-uma (pork flavored shoyu broth with thick cut grilled chashu and flavoured egg, S$14.90) or the nori-tama-uma (the ajitama-uma dish with additional slices of seaweed, S$16.80).If you prefer your ramen with a kick, Bari-Uma has spicy options, too. Get the kara-tama uma (S$16.90), a pork-flavoured spicy shoyu broth with thick cut grilled chashu and flavoured egg, or the tori kara-uma (grilled chicken spicy soup, $14.90), which adds a fiery intensity to the lighter chicken-based broth.365 Tanglin Road\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (9pm to 10pm)Unlike the rest on this list, Lucky Saigon Cafe is a little off the radar — literally. This spot serving Vietnamese food in Tanglin can be found at the tail-end of Tanglin Road, closer to Margaret Drive.This Tanglin Vietnamese restaurant has a spacious outdoor patio, lush greenery and rustic setting, complete with a small waterfall, lends it an ethereal, out-of-city vibe. Decorated with draping plants and light bulbs, you’d immediately feel like you stepped into a beer garden abroad.Like many popular Vietnamese eateries in Singapore, Lucky Saigon Cafe specialises in authentic Vietnamese classics. Its extensive menu contains many familiar choices, such as summer rolls (rice paper rolls comprising rice noodles, vegetables, herbs, and shrimp or pork, S$6.50) and traditional Vietnamese slice beef pho (S$12.50).\xa0There are also bigger sharing plates for bigger party sizes, including the bbq seafood platter (S$68) comprising grilled prawn, squid, fish and vegetables.Tanglin Mall, 03-128, 63 Tanglin Road\nOpen: Wednesday to Monday (9am to 3pm)La Veranda, which is nestled within level three of furniture shop House of AnLi, is a hidden gem that offers a one-of-a-kind experience.Its capacious and sun-drenched space, along with the striking pastel tones and botanical theme, make it a gorgeous spot for a mid-day sojourn among friends looking for an intimate space to catch up.Besides its tasteful decor, La Veranda also offers a menu that will leave you spoiled for choice. Its selection ranges from wholesome sandwiches, such as the naked ricotta & burrata mousse tartine (S$28), to an array of fresh bakes, including French croissants (S$6)Early birds who are there to enjoy the ambience for breakfast and lunch can also tuck into the hearty all-day breakfast selection.\xa0You can get iconic brunch classics, such as the smashed seasoned avocado on sourdough toast (S$20), or the classic organic poached eggs “royale” with Scottish salmon & hollandaise sauce (S$32), which you can wash down with slow pressed fresh juices or specialty coffee from Allpress EspressoTanglin Place, 01-01, 91 Tanglin Road\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (8am to 5pm)Most people should already be familiar with Nassim Hill Bakery in Tanglin — it’s a stalwart in the Singapore cafe scene. What you might not know, is that another pioneer in the scene, Necessary Provisions, also moved into the area, serving food at Tanglin.\xa0Fans were dismayed when Necessary Provisions shuttered its Upper Bukit Timah location in 2018. In 2020, it reopened in Tanglin, and is now tucked within the SmartFit Pilates Studio.The chic hideout in Tanglin Place makes for a great brunch spot. Warm lights, wooden rustic decor and an understated palette give it a cosy vibe that’s perfect for anyone looking to kick back and enjoy a mid-day cuppa.Coffee options are one of the cafe’s strong suits as it runs its own roastery. Customers can have their pick from classic options, including americano (S$5/hot, S$6/iced), caffe latte (S$6/hot, S$6.50/iced), and mocha (S$7/hot, S$8/iced).Besides coffee, Necessary Provisions also provides some light bites, such as french toast (S$17) and freshly baked cake (S$4), in case you’re feeling peckish. All eateries mentioned in this article are on the GrabFood delivery service. You can also book a ride to these Tanglin food spots.

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/kaya-toasts/:['There is something about the aromatic scent and taste of kaya\xa0toast in Singapore, that sends Singaporeans into a frenzy.\xa0Not only does kaya (a type of coconut jam) smell good, it also tastes heavenly when paired with a thick cube of butter and crispy toast. It is the perfect balance of sweet and savoury, so it’s not a wonder why it’s so beloved by all.\xa0We know how easily accessible kaya toast is these days, with established places such as Ya Kun Kaya Toast or Killiney Kopitiam serving consistently delicious renditions islandwide. Still, if you’re looking for humble, underrated options, or eateries that deliver a different variation, we’re here to help.To reignite your appreciation and love for this classic Singaporean breakfast dish, we’ve compiled a list of small, independent coffee stalls making kaya toast in Singapore, in traditional or unique ways.Bukit Merah View Hawker Centre, 01-23 ,115 Bukit Merah View\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (4am to 9pm)Why visit? Aside from a very enticing burnt top, the toast at Heng Heng Coffee Stall comes with thick, generous slabs of butter that has us salivating. The kaya has a pastel-green appearance and is touted to be less sweet.\xa0On top of that, the drinks at Heng Heng Coffee Stall has earned itself a steady stream of patrons. We thoroughly enjoyed the homemade ice lemon tea (S$1.50) that’s shaken in a cocktail shaker and the iced kopi (S$1.50).\xa0Price range: $Crowd faves: Our pick goes to the bun with kaya butter spread (S$1.60). The yellow tinged bun was sweet, giving the kaya and butter combination a unique flavour. Heng Heng Coffee Stall gave so much butter that the mild kaya flavour was slightly overpowered. An easy fix, as you could kindly request more kaya.\xa0\xa0Tzu Chi Humanistic Youth Centre, 30A Yishun Central 1\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (7am to 2pm)Why visit? Unwind at the scenic Slow Bakes with its panoramic views overlooking the waterfront. The bakery-cafe is perfect for those who enjoy variety because of its wide selection of toast and spreads that can be paired together. Though it’s a little pricier than the other options on our list, the views are well worth the price.\xa0Price range: $Crowd faves: It’s definitely interesting to see how a modern cafe selling naturally leavened bakes interprets traditional items such as the kaya spread. The kaya here is homemade and on the sweeter side. The toast (S$2.80) can be concocted by pairing sourdough slices, brioche buns, matcha loaves or more with its available spreads. Add on an additional S$4.50 for soft-boiled eggs and a drink.\xa010 North Bridge Road, 01-5109\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (5am to 4pm)Why visit? With its marble-topped tables and colourful plastic chairs, Heap Seng Leong brings you a step back into the 80s for that traditional breakfast in Singapore. This rustic coffee shop is a fan favourite for many things aside from kaya toast in Singapore, for good reason. It is one of the few stalls in Singapore that still serves Kopi Butter (S$1.30), or Kopi Gu You — local coffee served with a dollop of cold butter.\xa0Price range: $Crowd faves: Unlike more popular household names, the kaya toast (S$1.40) at Heap Seng Leong is made with thick chunks of fluffy white bread. The result is a lightly-grilled, pillow-soft toast that’s slathered in Hainanese kaya and topped with cold butter. Block 16 Bedok South Market & Food Centre, 01-49, 16 Bedok South Road\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (5am to 8.30pm)Why visit? If you’re a fan of kaya toast in Singapore, in all its shapes and forms, you ought to pay You & Me Coffee a visit. The eatery serves the kaya-butter concoction in the form of a biscuit-sandwich (S$1.20), a traditional toasted bread (S$1.60), an open-faced toast (S$1.60), a sandwich (S$1.60), a stout and fluffy bread (S$1.60) and in a french baguette (S$2.20). That’s a lot of ways.\xa0Price range: $Crowd faves: The traditional bread set (S$3.60) with its two toasts, two half-boiled eggs and a hot drink would make a satisfying breakfast. If you prefer the softness of a thick bun but can’t resist the crisp exterior either, you may find yourself leaning towards the kaya butter bun set (S$3.60). It consists of a cute mini loaf-like bread sliced into two with a dollop of kaya and butter on top.\xa0\xa0\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHawker Hustlers: Hipster hawker Ray Yeo of Bei-Ing Dimsum Club on reinventing dim sum and his love for all things Japan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmoy Street Food Centre, 02-95, 7 Maxwell Road\nOpen: Saturday to Wednesday (5.30am to 3pm)Why visit? Being a Michelin-recommended coffee stall, Ah Seng (Hai Nam) Coffee predictably draws long queues for being one of the best kaya toast in Singapore. After all, who can resist the fresh green hue and silky texture of the Nyonya kaya served at Ah Seng (Hai Nam) coffee?\xa0Price range: $Crowd faves: While many stand by the traditional charcoal-grilled bread toast (S$2.40) and egg (S$1.60) combo, we recommend going for the french toast (S$4) that’s served alongside a big helping of its signature homemade kaya. The slightly charred bread alongside the vibrant green paste will have you drooling at the sight of it. 204 East Coast Road\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (8am to 4pm)Why visit? Chin Mee Chin has history dating back to the 1920s and is routinely patronised by Singaporeans for its vibrant, old-school aesthetic. It is also easily one of those eateries that are top of mind when you think of where to eat kaya toast in Singapore.With its sole focus on pastries and breads, the toast is expectedly the star of the show. Unlike most places, the kaya toast here is served on discs of toasted buns.\xa0Price range: $Crowd faves: The kaya toast set (S$5.20) and other traditional items such as the luncheon meat bun (S$2.20) or hae bee hiam bun (S$2.40) are must-tries at this charming little shop. Jin Fa Kopitiam, 01-51, 24 Sin Ming Road\xa0\nOpen: Monday to Friday (7am to 9pm), Saturday and Sunday (5.30am to 5pm) Why visit? As alluded to by its name, Sen Yen Charcoal Traditional Toast in Singapore takes great pride in its use of charcoal grilling to give its toast a unique char. This traditional method is hardly seen these days and certainly evokes a sense of poignant nostalgia in Singaporean diners. As a bonus, the stall is extremely generous with its thick slabs of butter.\xa0Price range: $Crowd faves: Most people prefer the French toast (S$1.40) because of the denser bread texture — it lends a softness that contrasts with the toast’s crisp edges. This tends to get sold out quickly though, so you can always go for its kaya butter toast (S$1.40) to get a taste of its sweet and fragrant kaya.\xa081 Telok Blangah Road\xa0\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (5am to 5pm)84 Marine Parade Central, 01-11\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (6.45am to 6pm)Why visit? If you’re someone who pays equal attention to your kaya toast, half-boiled eggs and drink of choice, you wouldn’t be disappointed with the offerings at Coffee Queen. While it’s most well known for its drinks, especially its rich and thick coffee, the set meal is a very affordable S$3.40.\xa0Price range: $Crowd faves: The toast here is rectangular with a crispy exterior. If you get the set meal, its filling can be customised to whatever you prefer, be it kaya and butter, peanut and kaya, or others.\xa0For more ideas on what to eat, read our stories on food spots in Clarke Quay and BHC Chicken.You can book a ride to all kaya toast in Singapore stores mentioned above.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/pang-pang-western-food/:['It’s always a pleasure to indulge in a fancy meal at a steakhouse, but sometimes, we just crave fuss-free and comforting Western food from an old-school coffee shop.If you’re looking for a close-enough option to satisfy your craving, consider the new Pang Pang Western Food at Marine Parade Central Market and Food Centre.Run by two brothers, Lucas and Bernard Pang, the name of the stall is a play on their family name.Both siblings have worked at Astons and iSteaks, among other establishments. They started as cooks at the former, before rising through the ranks to become restaurant managers.In correspondence with HungryGoWhere, Lucas said that the stall’s concept was born from the siblings’ love of Western food as well as a desire to let more people taste their food.\xa0You can expect the stall to serve up familiar local-style Western classics. The team initially wanted to present their offerings in hotplates, after being inspired by Taiwanese hotplate dishes. Sadly, logistical issues caused the team to abandon the hotplate service.There are four mains on Pang Pang Western Food’s menu — the grilled chicken (S$7.50), pork chop (S$8), NZ prime sirloin (S$13.50), and NZ prime ribeye (S$14.50).Each main dish comes with a side, the default being pasta with broccoli and egg, but it can be swapped out for either rice or French fries without extra cost.You are also given a choice between brown and black pepper sauce.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Junction Westgate opening with promos; will house 23 tenants, including new halal teppanyaki\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHawker Hustlers: Hipster hawker Ray Yeo of Bei-Ing Dimsum Club on reinventing dim sum and his love for all things Japan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best part about Pang Pang Western Food, however, comes in the form of its super-value meals.\xa0Similar to Astons’ double-up chicken concept, Pang Pang’s version involves throwing in an additional protein with just a top-up of between S$2.50 and S$3. This gives you more variety as you get a choice of a different meat.For example, you can get a plate of pork and chicken with pasta for S$10.50, steak and chicken for S$16, or steak and pork for S$16.50 without burning a hole in your pocket.Besides the mains, there are also a handful of sides under the “handhelds” section of the menu at Pang Pang Western Food, including onion rings (S$3) and crispy chicken wings with fries (S$4) if you’re feeling peckish.At present, Pang Pang Western Food has just one outlet. The siblings said they are keen on expanding in the future so more people can enjoy their hearty Western food outside Marine Parade.Pang Pang Western Food is on the GrabFood delivery service and offers free delivery (up to S$3 off) with GrabUnlimited.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/um-yong-baek-singapore/:['My earliest memory of having authentic Busan dwaeji gukbab (pork-and-rice soup) was when my then-teammates and I finished race day at the Korea Open Busan International Dragon Boat Festival in 2016. It was cold and rainy, and we were craving warm soup.We heard Busan was famous for dwaeji gukbab and stumbled into a homely restaurant. Since then, dwaeji gukbab has been a distant memory because restaurants in Singapore hardly serve it.That was until I got wind of Um Yong Baek in Singapore, a new eatery along Boon Tat Street in Telok Ayer that’s taken TikTok by storm.Um Yong Baek is a dwaeji gukbab restaurant that originated in Busan. It also has branches in South Korea’s capital Seoul.While it has always been popular in Busan — which is dotted with dwaeji gukbab restaurants — interest in Um Yong Baek was rekindled after Korean superstar Rain name-dropped it on his Netflix show The Hungry and the Hairy.But we digress.Um Yong Baek opened officially in Singapore on July 1. Unlike its soft-launch phase when it took reservations only, the restaurant now accepts walk-ins for lunch and dinner. Be warned, though: The wait is considerable.Its famous gukbab is available only for lunch. The broth takes more than 24 hours to prepare and the restaurant sells just up to 80 bowls of its two gukbab varieties each day.\xa0The vibe at Um Yong Baek is unmistakably Korean.Once seated, you get a standard set of four side dishes: Fresh kimchi; chives kimchi; a green pickled dish we’re told is watercress; and a small dish of raw garlic, ssamjang (spicy dipping sauce) and green chilli. As with any respectable gukbab restaurant, there are salted shrimp condiments and salt on the table.Right off the bat, the kimchi — the mark of any good Korean restaurant — impressed us. Unlike what some diners might be used to, Um Yong Baek serves geotjeori kimchi (fresh kimchi). It’s more savoury, crunchy and, well, fresh — the perfect complement to anything soupy.When we dropped by late last month, the restaurant had only four dishes on its lunch menu. We ordered all of them.The Busan-style dwaeji gukbab (S$21) has a clear pork broth base, comes with a serving of short-grain rice, and is topped with pork front leg, stomach, cheek meat and jowl.The other variety, the Milyang-style dwaeji gukbab (S$21), has a thicker broth made from pork bones, is topped with pork neck, stomach and cheek, and garnished with chives.\xa0Placed cheek by jowl, the Milyang bowl is milkier. It’s supposed to be richer and heavier in taste, and similar to the Japanese tonkotsu broth you’d find paired with ramen.Despite the description, my dining party found the Busan-style bowl tastier. We enjoyed it so much that we ordered a second helping.If you find the flavours a smidge too mild, you can add salt or salted shrimp to your bowl.The ohsorigamtoo sooyuk (S$13) — boiled pork maw — resembles a Singapore favourite: Kway chap.Yet, amazingly, the pressure-cooked maw didn’t smell or taste strongly of pork and was delightfully soft and chewy, going well with the tangy chilli-and-vinegar sauce that came with it.We also got the ohgyeopsal sooyuk (S$45) — boiled pork belly with skin — which arrived after a short wait.Few tables ordered this, likely on account of its price tag, which is on the pricey side if you’re looking for a quick, inexpensive bowl of rice and soup for lunch.Similarly prepared in a pressure cooker after being boiled in a special broth, the ohgyeopsal sooyuk was extremely tender. The meat’s sweet enough on its own, but you can also pair it with any of the three options on the table — salt, steamed chives and garlic, and salted cutlassfish sauce.\xa0Overall, the food at Um Yong Baek is authentic and hearty, and its portions offer bang for your buck. This is despite gukbab costing way less, at S$10 to S$15, in South Korea.But Um Yong Baek was evidently struggling with its newfound popularity.Its wait staff were generally terse and uncertain about the four lunch dishes it served.When we asked about the sauce for the ohgyeopsal sooyuk, and what cuts of pork were in our respective gukbabs, two members of staff gave us halfhearted answers at best. They made no effort to check and come back with a more detailed answer.The crew also hovered over our table as soon as we sat down, which made us feel rushed, though there was no mention of a time limit on dining in.It may have just been the lunch-hour crunch; my dining companions had dinner there a few days before our visit, with no major gripes. But this does raise questions about inconsistent service standards.With these teething problems, I’d most likely return only after the crowds have thinned a few months from now.We also noticed some differences between the gukbabs in South Korea and Um Yong Baek’s.Unlike typical gukbabs, Um Yong Baek’s version doesn’t come with dadaegi, a chilli paste usually served alongside soup and noodle dishes. It also combines the rice with the soup, though some people are accustomed to having them served separately.Inconsistencies aside, Um Yong Baek in Singapore dishes up good, wholesome gukbab that’s worth a trip if you can excuse the service shortfalls.\xa0Is it conducive to conversation? Yes, the tables are spaced quite far apart, so conversation is easy. There’s a traditional Korean seating area out front that’s more private, but given the restaurant’s popularity, requesting specific seats may be a challenge.Is a reservation necessary? A reservation is encouraged because waits can range from an hour to two for walk-ins, based on our observations.

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/healthy-desserts-singapore/:['Let’s face it — as much as we love desserts, excessive consumption of sweet treats can add inches to our waistlines and cause us to pack on the pounds.And although science has shown that having a “second stomach” for dessert is real, it doesn’t help us cut down the calories.\xa0Still, some desserts, when taken in moderation, can be healthy. But if you have a major sweet tooth and want to have your cake and eat it every day, don’t fret. Singapore has no shortage of healthy dessert places or options if you can’t resist the temptation.Health is wealth, after all. From keto-optimised cakes and diabetic-friendly treats to plant-based ice cream and superfood desserts, these healthy alternatives taste just as good while delivering a ton of benefits.If you’re on the lookout for guilt-free options, then check out our list of the best places to treat yourself to some healthy desserts in Singapore.\xa0High Street Plaza, 01-07, 77 High Street\nOpen: Monday to Friday (11am to 5pm), Saturday (11am to 6pm)Why visit? Ange Bakes Keto is a bakery that is passionate about promoting a ketogenic diet (low carb, moderate protein and high fat) to reap its many benefits.\xa0As such, it uses only natural sweeteners and low-carb, grain-free flours to produce a selection of healthy desserts that are friendly to those who are gluten-intolerant and diabetic, and even those who just want to eat cleaner.Originally located at The Adelphi, it recently moved to a cosy new space at High Street Plaza.Price range: $$Crowd favourites: Chocolate lovers will adore Ange Bakes’ luxuriously glazed keto all-chocolate cake (from S$8.80 per slice), which is sugar-free and only comes with a net carb value of 0.57g per slice. Talk about the perfect dessert fix!Apart from sweets, Ange Bakes also has a great selection of pastries and meals that have an Asian influence, including the low-carbs fried kway teow (S$12.80) and the ugly keto curry puff (S$4.30) that comes stuffed with low-carb homemade chicken curry.Multiple stores islandwide\xa0\nOpen: \xa0Operating hours vary across outletsWhy visit? Ice cream is undoubtedly a popular dessert option among diners here — it’s evident in the number of gelato cafes we have around the island. However, as it is high in calories and added sugar while low in nutrients, an ice cream a day is not going to keep the doctor away. Still, if you have a craving, consider Kind Kones, which serves an all-natural and plant-based alternative to the sweet treat.\xa0The established brand, which has three outlets in Singapore, is known for scooping a healthy version of the dessert that’s free from dairy, egg and other artificial additives. Expect alternative milk options such as cashew milk and coconut milk serving as the base components, and mostly gluten-free ingredients.Price range: $Crowd favourites: Needless to say, Kind Kones’ core range of ice cream (from S$8.80 per scoop) is what draws people in. Popular flavours include the chocolate sorbet that’s plant-based and free of any milk (even plant milk) and its gluten-free almond brittle fudge.Multiple stores islandwide\xa0\nOpen: \xa0Operating hours vary across outletsWhy visit? There’s not much that needs to be said about acai. Purportedly rich in antioxidants and vitamins, the trendy berry is a superfood and the go-to healthy food in Singapore for many discerning diners.\xa0You can’t go wrong with An Acai Affair, one of the biggest brands in the local scene. With 15 outlets scattered throughout Singapore, it’s a really accessible spot to get your healthy dessert fix. Best of all, according to its website, a small acai bowl contains as little as 100 calories!Price range: $Crowd favourites: Besides its healthy properties, one of the reasons behind the refreshing fruit’s popularity is its customisability. So if you’re not keen on signatures such as the Triple A (acai with fresh fruits, granola, nuts & superfoods, from S$6.70) and Nutty Party (acaí with banana, granola, nuts & cacao nibs, from S$6.70), you can opt to make your own bowl (from S$7.20) where you can pick your favourite fruits, superfood toppings and drizzle to finish.24 Keong Saik Road\nOpen: Monday to Saturday (12pm to 10pm)Why visit? Afterglow is a popular plant-based restaurant located along the bustling Keong Saik Road.

Go for the chocolate salted “caramel” fudge (S$14), a decadent mouuse that swaps out caramel for salted tahini. Or try any of its raw “cheese”cake slices (S$15), which feature a creamy batter made from cashew nuts and a crust made out of mejdool date, coconut oil and walnuts. Flavours include pandan ondeh and pistachio cranberry.Multiple stores islandwide\xa0\nOpen: Operating hours vary across outletsWhy visit? Before acai took over the cafe scene as the superfood of choice, there was the avocado, a nutrient-rich fruit that’s packed with all the desirable monounsaturated fats you need. Hence, it’s little wonder that we have a cafe brand in Singapore that’s dedicated to crafting healthy desserts out of its creamy goodness.All The Batter focuses on making healthier avocado products, including vegan-friendly gelato, dairy-free avocado milk, and a signature line of cakes that replaces butter in the recipe with avocado.Price range: $$Crowd favourites: You can find plenty of classic pastries here, but reimagined with creamy avocado fillings.

Mrs Plump’s is one of the more unique ice-cream brands in Singapore. Australian-born founder Mia Kusen first started out making nutritious ice cream to feed her boys when they were hit with Hand, Foot and Mouth disease and were unable to ingest anything else for a week, due to mouth ulcers.As she could not find nutritious alternatives at the time, she decided to make her own by incorporating a variety of superfoods into her products.

Eventually, she launched The Clean Addicts in 2017 to share her creations with the like-minded.Price range: $$$$Crowd favourites: The Clean Addicts takes a lot of pride in its signature whole vegan fudge cakes,\xa0many of which are dairy-free.

Be warned – the crispiness of the prata does come at a price – it may come across as a tad oily, but hey, who’s counting those calories, right?\xa0The crew at New Mahamoodiya are incredibly attentive and if its extensive menu leaves you a little lost, feel free to ask for recommendations. We love that they serve sambal alongside their prata dishes, but if you’re keen on the usual curries, they still have them, don’t worry! What to order: Prata egg (S$1.60)\xa0Tin Yeang restaurant, 300 Joo Chiat Road\xa0\nNearest MRT station: Eunos\nOpen: Thursday to Tuesday (6.30am to 1.30pm) When a place has ‘super crispy’ in its shop name, you know without a doubt that what you’ll be served is nothing less. Sitting within a busy coffee shop in Joo Chiat, Mr and Mrs Mohgan’s draws crowds at all times of the day with its fresh and consistently crispy prata.\xa0Your prata is made-to-order, so when coupled with the crowds, you should be prepared to wait a little when you’re there.What to order: Coin prata – five pieces (S$5)\xa0136, 138 Casaurina Road\nNearest MRT station: Lentor\xa0\nOpen: Sunday to Thursday (7am to 11pm), Friday to Saturday (7am to 11.30pm)\xa0Casuarina Curry needs no introduction.

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/healthy-hawker-food-in-singapore/:['Is there such a thing as healthy hawker food in Singapore or is it just an urban myth?I’m sure we’ve all been there — it’s lunchtime and you just want to eat something more wholesome, but your colleagues want lunch at the same old hawker centre instead of a salad bar.You could ditch for your bowl of raw veggies, but you could learn to make smarter choices at the hawker centre, such as opting for low-calorie hawker food or looking for healthy hawker food options.Don’t worry, you don’t have to be stuck with boring ol’ fish soup.Consider these other healthy hawker dishes — they pack fewer than 600 calories per serving, and rank among the most nutritious options available at hawker centres.We get Jaclyn Reutens, dietitian at Aptima Nutrition and Sports Consultants, to weigh in on these surprisingly healthier hawker foods in Singapore.Who knew? The tastier of the two is also more nutritious. Mushroom and minced pork noodles (bak chor mee) make a more balanced meal than fishball noodles, which are higher in carbohydrates but lower in other nutrients.Dietitian Jaclyn Reutens says: Factory-made fishballs are mainly flour-based and have very little protein. On the other hand, minced pork provides protein and zinc, nutrients that are essential for our body.Mushrooms, which give the dish its umami punch, also pack plenty of good-for-you nutrients. These include B vitamins, which help you release energy from food, potassium, which lowers blood pressure, and selenium, an antioxidant that gets rid of harmful free radicals.Nutrition score of mushroom and minced pork noodles in soup (594g):\n381 calories, 17g protein, 12.2g fat (4.7g saturated), 8g fibre, 50g carbohydrates, 37mg cholesterol, 1732mg sodiumWhen you’re at the roast meat stall, pass on the char siew\xa0(barbecued pork) and sio bak (crispy roast pork belly)\xa0in favour of roast duck. Duck has more of the good stuff, such as protein and minerals, and less of the bad, such as sugar and fat. Remember to remove the skin if you’re watching your diet.Dietitian Jaclyn Reutens says: Compared with roast pork, duck meat is lower in fat but higher in iron. A mineral needed by both men and women alike, iron helps the body generate red blood cells. It also improves concentration levels.Moreover, duck is packed with good-quality protein that assists in daily cell renewal. Roast duck is actually better than the braised version because the braising process retains more fat.Nutrition score of duck rice, with skin removed (350g):\n530 calories, 24g protein, 11g fat (3.6g saturated), 3g fibre, 84g carbohydrates, 80mg cholesterol, 326mg sodiumStir-fried beef with ginger, a popular zi char dish, is in fact one of the leanest and most protein-rich options on the menu, if you’re looking for healthy Singapore hawker food.The star protein, beef, is also a great source of essential minerals such as iron and zinc, which makes it an ideal candidate when searching for healthy meals in Singapore.Dietitian Jaclyn Reutens says: This savoury beef dish is better than sweet and sour pork, which is coated in flour, deep-fried and then tossed in a sugary sauce.It is also healthier than gong bao ji (Szechuan chicken), which can be fatty as it typically features thigh meat with skin. Eating beef after a workout helps with muscle repair, too, so this makes great post-gym nosh.Nutrition score of stir-fried beef with ginger (196g):\n298 calories, 27g protein, 19g fat (8.2g saturated), 4g fibre, 4g carbohydrates, 49mg cholesterol, 1494mg sodium\xa0Move over, fish head curry.Wise folks will pick assam fish over curry because it’s prepared in a healthier way — with an array of piquant spices — and doesn’t lose out on flavour.Dietitian Jaclyn Reutens says: Fish is brain food; it’s high in omega-3 fatty acids and keeps your mood up, too! Unlike curry fish, assam fish does not contain fatty coconut milk, which is bad for your arteries.Another plus — ikan assam pedas is often cooked with loads of vegetables, such as eggplant, lady’s finger, tomato and onions. Ask the hawker for more veggies to up your fibre intake.Nutrition score of assam fish (184g): 123 calories, 21g protein, 3.7g fat (2.2g saturated), 2g fibre, 2g carbohydrates, 61mg cholesterol, 532mg sodiumFeel like slurping something belly-warming?Your choices aren’t confined to fish soup and yong tau foo. Soto ayam is a light yet satisfying healthy hawker food you can get at most Malay stalls.Dietitian Jaclyn Reutens says: There are not many low-calorie Malay dishes, but soto ayam is one of them. It has fewer than 300 calories per serving. In contrast, other popular Malay dishes, such as mee rebus and mee siam, have more than 500 calories each. Soto ayam is a well-balanced dish as it provides carbohydrates from the ketupat (rice cubes), protein from the chicken, and fibre from the beansprouts. Sedap! (Malay for tasty)Nutrition score of soto ayam (569g): 219 calories, 19 protein, 8g fat (2.9g saturated), 8g fibre, 18g carbohydrates, 17mg cholesterol, 2418mg sodiumComfort food doesn’t have to be cloying and fattening.Wanton soup checks the right boxes for many of us; it’s hot, soupy, meaty and delicious! Top it off with extra chye sim (mustard greens) — most stalls offer the option at an extra dollar — and you get an added dose of vitamins and fibre!Dietitian Jaclyn Reutens says: It may not look like a complete dish, but it is, even without the noodles. You get carbs from the wanton skin, while the minced meat filling provides you with zinc, protein and B vitamins.Chye sim is not only rich in fibre, but potassium, too. This dish is way better than pan-fried gyoza and deep-fried wanton.Nutrition score of wanton soup with chye sim (436g):\n258 calories, 13g protein, 14g fat (5.7g saturated), 2g fibre, 20g carbohydrates, 39mg cholesterol, 1783mg sodiumNutrition data source: Health Promotion Board of Singapore\nAll values are rounded to the nearest whole number, except for fat, which is rounded to one decimal place.This is an updated version of an archived article.

Prices for the more premium Black Gold durian now range from S$18 to S$20 per kg, based on media reports.The fall in prices is due to increased supply from durian plantations in Malaysia this December.

Order your favourite durian from the comfort of your home and get it delivered to you. \xa0There are plenty of options.Located in Toa Payoh, Durian Superman delivers freshly frozen Mao Shan Wang at S$40 for a 400g pack. A more premium variation, the Old Tree Mao Shan Wang, is selling at S$54 for a pack of the same weight.If you’re unfamiliar, the heftier price tag of the Old Tree Mao Shan Wang is due to its scarcity, as it is picked only from trees that are more than 40 years old.

They range from smoked Scottish salmon with roma tomatoes on wheat bread and parma ham and olive pate on milk bread to chicken ham with avocado, eggs, bacon and mayonnaise on panini. The sandwich sets are S$11.50 each and come with a side salad and two mini pastries or a slice of cake.We ordered the salmon and chicken ham sandwiches. Some thought has obviously been given to the overall packaging to make eating the lunch sets as fuss-free as possible — the sandwiches were neatly cut up and came individually packed in a very presentable lunchbox, while the side salad was served in a cup. But if you’re truly concerned about getting your hands dirty, go for the salmon one as it comes in two neat and very manageable triangles.We also liked that they were generous with the filling, which was fresh, tasty and not too dry. As for the sides, the desserts were surprisingly good and light. The salad, on the other hand, was slightly wilted as it came pre-dressed. It would be better if the cafe packed the dressing separately. Overall, the portions were filling without making you feel stuffed.Prices and delivery timing are as below:Price of sandwich set: S$11.50+ per box (minimum order of 10 boxes)\nOrdering time: 9am to 5pm (orders must be made four hours in advance)\nDelivery time: 11am to 6pm\xa0\nDelivery charges: S$25+ per location (anywhere in Singapore)\n*Free delivery with S$200 spent or if location is within Paragon Shopping CentreAuthor© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/is-hotpot-healthy/:['While dunking sliced meat in boiling pots of soup and slurping up delicious and flavourful bowls of broth, you’ve probably wondered to yourself: Is eating hotpot healthy?Theoretically speaking, it’s just boiled food. No sin in having an extra serving or two, right?\xa0“Hotpot can be a healthy meal, but it depends on the soup, the ingredients chosen, how much is eaten, and what it’s accompanied with,” said Anna Lim, the lead clinical dietitian at Pulse TCM. It can easily become a meal heavy on calories, fat and sodium if you aren’t careful. Read on to find out what are some of the ingredients to avoid if you want to have a healthy hotpot experience.\xa0\xa0Per 100g serving: 205 calories, 13.4g fat (3.6g saturated), and 595mg sodiumThe fish ball roe typically claims a well-deserved spot on any list of best hotpot ingredients. These delicate spheres are a winning combination of soft and chewy fish balls with juicy and savoury fish roe within.Even though fish roe is a healthy ingredient packed with minerals and nutrients, the Department of Endocrinology\u200b in Singapore General Hospital (SGH) has advised that processed foods are typically higher in sodium, saturated fats and chemical preservatives. Hence, it should be eaten in moderation.While there is no healthier alternative for such an indulgence, Lim recommends controlling your portions as a mindful approach. By savouring each morsel at a leisurely pace, you can relish in its flavours while balancing your consumption.Per 100g serving: 236 calories, 18g fat (6g saturated), and 650mg sodiumHow could plain ol’ boiled meat be unhealthy? Pork collar shabu shabu tends to be higher in fat and have high levels of sodium — it’s a fact that doesn’t change, no matter how the meat is cooked.\xa0Lim recommends chicken breast strips or fish as lower fat options instead.“It may not be realistic to abstain completely but it’s important… to exercise some restraint, for example, by switching to healthier options after having a few pieces,” she added.Per 110g serving: 348 calories, 1.8g fat (1.2g saturated), and 7779mg sodiumInstant soup bases and their high amounts of sodium might cause you to question whether hotpot is healthy at all. Sodium, when consumed excessively, can lead to elevated blood pressure, and even pose risks of heart attacks and strokes.\xa0Once meat and vegetables have been cooked in the soup, the resulting concoction can also be harmful to the body in other ways.“Hotpot soup can contain large amounts of oil, usually seen floating on top. This is normally vegetable or animal fat, which is saturated and can clog arteries,” said Lim.\xa0It can be tempting, but again, moderation is key: Avoid drinking multiple bowls of soup or dowsing your rice in spoonfuls of it. Per 100g serving (around three slices): 241 calories, 19g fat (7g saturated), and 734mg sodium.On almost every Singaporeans’ hotpot essentials list, luncheon meat is a type of processed meat that is typically boiled in the broth.\xa0Although relatively low in calories (if you stick to one serving), a single slice is laden with over 200mg of sodium. Occasionally, it is also served fried as a side, which can translate to more calories and fats due to the additional amount of oil.\xa0A healthy hotpot alternative, said Lim, is to choose lean cut meats such as chicken, fish and pork. Per 12g serving (one piece): 100 calories, 10g fat (4g saturated), and 1mg sodium.The fried beancurd skin roll is the perfect vehicle for the savoury hotpot soup. It soaks up the broth and adds a softness to the originally crispy roll. However, at 100 calories per serving and 10g of fat, the ingredient has little nutritional value.\xa0“A healthier option could be simply switching to non-fried beancurd skin. Alternatively, tau kwa (extra firm tofu) may contain up to 10g protein, 6g unsaturated fat and 110 calories, but for a much larger portion of 100g,” Lim recommends. Per 40g serving (two pieces): 70 calories, 4g fat (2g saturated), and 135mg sodiumLooking at the calories per serving, cheese tofu may not appear all that harmful. But considering the fact that it is often consumed in larger quantities than two, you’ll realise that high levels of calories, sodium and fat can sneak its way into your diet.A better alternative could be plain tofu, which is a good source of protein and other nutrients such as calcium and iron.Per one serving: 50 calories, 2.5g fat (1g saturated), and 200mg sodiumSure, you could convince yourself that meatballs are a protein-packed option, especially when boiled. But the truth is that meatballs have a concerning amount of sodium in them.\xa0A single serving can contain as much as 200mg of sodium, and with the World Health Organisation recommending a daily intake of 2,000mg of sodium, it’s quite easy to bust this if you have one too many meatballs.The situation escalates when we add processed cheese to the equation, as it contributes additional sodium and unhealthy fats to your meal.As the main concerns behind the question ‘is hotpot healthy’ are excess calories and sodium, there are ways to enjoy the communal meal in a healthier fashion.\xa0“Limit the amount of soup you drink and fill up on vegetables. When it comes to meat, choose fresh instead of processed to reduce sodium intake, and lean instead of fatty options,” Lim said.\xa0However, Lim added that it isn’t always realistic to avoid certain ingredients. Instead of fixating on what to eat and what not to eat, limit the portions consumed.“All of the above options are concentrated sources of either sodium or fat. In the portions in which they are usually consumed at a hotpot, it can easily add three to four times the daily sodium allowance and hundreds of calories to just that one meal,” she said.\xa0Instead of devouring your hotpot ingredients at your next hotpot session, try taking multiple small bites of each ingredient and limit the amount of servings you reach for.\xa0Your health will thank you for it.\xa0Nutrition data source: The Nutrition Information Panel found on each item or MyFitnessPal.com.\xa0\nAdditional health information from HealthXchange.sg and HealthHub.\xa0For more ideas on what to eat, read our stories on exotic food in Singapore and Bulgogi Syo.You can find hotpot items on GrabMart, which is offering free delivery (up to S$3 off) with GrabUnlimited.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/salt-and-palm-joo-chiat/:['Our visit to Salt & Palm in Joo Chiat began with a scallop resting on curried soil.\xa0Dainty. Gritty. A contrast of textures between the peanut sauce and sliced scallop. Each slice rested its end on the sauce’s edge, as if on a dare.\xa0My fork sank in — a firm bite of sweetness toying with lapping waves of chilli lime.\xa0Behind, puddled mounds of kecap manis shot down any remnants of heat, while crisp shards of tempeh chips surprised with their uncommon pairing — scallops and chips. Playful yet refined.\xa0This is a dish that isn’t afraid.Meet Natasya Soetantyo, the executive chef at Salt & Palm with an appetite to put lesser-known Indonesian flavours, such as gohu, on the world map. Think Indonesian ceviche, but with a spiced basil and pandan marinade.\xa0This inventive spirit is also borne out by her R&D experiments on Instagram by way of shrimp-paste oysters with asinan and grapefruit, vegan martabak mesir “pancakes” with curried mushrooms, and mie celor tortellini.But her strength does not lie only in invention. Street food such as rice platters features on the menu at the original (and only other) Salt & Palm, in Sydney, Australia. Her catering arm Nasiku serves simpler dishes such as nasi jinggo — steamed rice, fried noodles and side dishes wrapped in banana leaves.\xa0It’s her art in both the traditional and modern that makes her food delightful.The new Salt & Palm in Singapore offers a taste of Indonesia in the 21st century.\xa0Using techniques and ingredients less commonly found in the cuisine, Soetantyo showcases its flavours, textures and personality — offering an experience unlike any other in traditional Indonesian cooking.Beyond the food, the cosy atmosphere and eclectic art pieces offer an inviting experience for a night out with friends or a date. Joo Chiat’s five-foot ways and colourful shophouses also make for a relaxing post-dinner walk.The balance Soetantyo weaves into the Hokkaido scallop (S$22), amid the contrasting flavours and textures, shows her attention to detail and a style of Indonesian cooking that’s not stifled by tradition.\xa0Also, the decision to use the torching method with the scallop is a good one, as it enhances the sweetness without making it rubbery, like pan-searing might (particularly for this variety).The river prawns (S$35) were also a standout. The light ocean brine was perfumed with lemon basil, and the spices permeated the prawn evenly.\xa0When cut, the shell separated cleanly from the flesh. The prawns were also fresh — the texture was succulent with a slight firmness, and not mushy or tough. But the unique factor was the woku sauce. Its thick paste and blackened bits reminded me of a dry rub.Another knockout was the prawn bisque pasta (S$32), which presented the taste of the sea from the first spoonful. The colour and sheen on the sauce offered a luxurious feel, which complemented the thickness of the pasta that was cooked to al dente perfection.Some other highlights were the fragrant lemongrass salsa, which came with kerupuk (S$12), as well as the corn fritters (S$15), though I desperately needed a lot more of the tomato salsa to cut through the grease for the fritters.For dessert, I enjoyed the pandan coconut creme brulee (S$15).\xa0Visually, the caramelised crust appeared as a floating island, as if to celebrate the colour of the cream. The crust’s small surface area worked to better reveal the star ingredient — instead of masking it in sugar.\xa0The paper-thin crust gave way gently to the floral and grassy pandan, revealing an essence akin to pandan hydrosol — something I struggle to taste in many pandan desserts.It was so good I did not want the pieces of jackfruit and coconut at the bottom to interfere with the texture of the cream. Remind me to ask if those could be omitted next time, though this is personal preference.The bread & dip (S$12) was enjoyable. I liked the tang and structure of the bread’s insides, which went well with the chilli and garlic.\xa0But the other half of the dish was weaker. The chickpea dip was served as a clump of grainy paste, which affected the taste, and prevented me from holding the tempeh crumbs and chives with the dip. Moreover, it masked the spices on the bread.\xa0After a while, I was craving smooth hummus from the grocer next door and had no desire to finish the dip.One of the dishes I was excited to try was the mushroom rendang (S$20).\xa0The rendang was delicious. It had a sweet touch and a strong flavour of cinnamon, which I love. But the mushrooms were bitter and their textures ranged from tender to not-so-pleasant chewy.\xa0The potatoes, though, were cooked separately and had almost crisp ends. If anyone can do a crispy rendang while respecting the slow-cooking tradition, it would be Soetantyo.The fishcakes (S$12) were my least favourite dish.\xa0Balinese fishcakes are not as springy as Thai or Japanese ones such as isoage and chikuwa.\xa0This is not a dealbreaker, but I miss the smoky burst of lemongrass I would get if they were skewered and grilled with the herb, like other Balinese renditions of this dish.\xa0Also, the chicken skin tuiles that accompanied the cakes did little to elevate the dish beyond presentation. They were soggy like crepe-paper, and did not offer a contrast or complement to the cakes.The pavlova (S$18) had a delicate sweetness, which allowed the fruit to shine.\xa0This created a well-balanced dessert that was light, though the mangoes and blueberries were not at their best.Overall, despite some misses, dining at Salt & Palm was more than just handsome plates.It was a vibrant, sensory adventure through modern Indonesian cuisine. Each dish, carefully conceived by Soetantyo, showed a playful yet respectful nod to tradition, articulated in full flavour with a contemporary twist.With that, I look forward to the upcoming brunch menu to see what else Soetantyo cooks up.Is it conducive to conversation? Yes.Is a reservation necessary? Yes, though you can try walking in at 5pm.How to get there? The nearest MRT station is Eunos, from which it is a 25-minute walk to Salt & Palm.

He was also one of the pioneers behind the digital payment system of the Grab superapp.\xa0Like you and me, Van loves his hawker food and, as we found out in this interview, has a penchant for good ol’ hawker dishes.\xa0Having been born and raised in Hong Kong has also diversified his palate.\xa0Van was later educated in the United States and spent several years in investment banking.\xa0So who better than Van to give us some sound financial advice by way of cheap and good food haunts in Singapore?\xa0Char siew fan (barbecued pork with rice).I spent my early childhood in Hong Kong, and char siew fan was something that I would often request to have at select specialty places and restaurants. There was a char siew fan shop a five-minute walk from my primary school in Hong Kong, and friends used to head down with whatever pocket money we had to get a plate after school. Probably not the “snack” our parents wanted us to be eating at 3pm.\xa0The diversity in styles is enormous, and since moving to Singapore in 2011, I’ve really grown to appreciate the Singaporean or Malaysian take on this dish.\xa0Back when the Endowus office was in a shophouse along Neil Road, we used to eat at Foong Kee on Keong Saik Road (I heard that it has reopened at Commonwealth) three to four times a week. I want to make a special call-out to their chilli sauce, which had a tangy, orange-peel kick. I can credit a lot of great memories and team bonding from lining up for and devouring those lunches.\xa0I would always take my kids there, too, whenever they visited me in the office. Now six and four years old, they are well on their way to developing the same obsession.\xa0To satisfy my cravings these days, I go to 88 Hong Kong Roast Meat Specialist in Lavender.\xa0It is so difficult to choose just one. My go-to really depends on how convenient it is to get to the eatery from where I am, and the time that I have to spare. For local food, I love the big prawns hor fun from Kok Sen Restaurant, also on Keong Saik Road. When we had more time than a quick plate of char siew fan, the founding team would fuel up over lunch and supper, as we ground for months to prepare Endowus’s cash savings, Central Provident Fund and Supplementary Retirement Scheme investment solutions for launch in late 2019.\xa0The Endowus office is now on Cecil Street, which is near the Amoy Street Food Centre. So, for lunch these days, I will get either curry rice from Yuguo Curry Rice or fishball noodles from Ah Ter Teochew Fishball Noodle. The CBD crowd typically starts flowing in at noon, so whenever I head down later than that, I will just grab my lunch from any stall with the shortest and fastest-moving queue.\xa0When I have more time for a sit-down meal, or when friends from overseas are visiting, I always go for Naked Finn, where the quality of produce and care for the chefs by the owner Ken Loon are unmatched. He had also launched Magic Square, which developed ambitious chefs to really innovate.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Junction Westgate opening with promos; will house 23 tenants, including new halal teppanyaki\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHawker Hustlers: Hipster hawker Ray Yeo of Bei-Ing Dimsum Club on reinventing dim sum and his love for all things Japan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am a big noodle fan.\xa0When I am overseas, the dish I always miss is bak chor mee. The combination of the different condiments — (lots of) vinegar, soy sauce, lard oil and chilli — is just perfect. You really can’t get this taste in other noodle dishes, or any other dish for that matter anywhere else in the world. The original Tai Hwa still hits the spot. I have heard good reviews of Claudine restaurant from friends and family, and hope to find time to head down soon.\xa0During the weekends, I would usually dabao (take away) from Sarawak Delicacy Laksa & Kolo Mee in the Bedok area. The queue is usually fairly long, but it moves quickly.\xa0I highly recommend anyone to give it a try. The aromatic laksa broth alone is worth the wait.For more ideas on what to eat, read our articles on Elijah Pies and black sesame desserts and snacks.88 Hong Kong Roast Meat Specialist, Kok Sen Restaurant, Ah Ter Teochew Fishball Noodle, Yuguo Curry Rice, and Sarawak Delicacy Laksa & Kolo Mee are on the GrabFood delivery service and offer free delivery (up to S$3 off) with GrabUnlimited.

This was in part due to a rent increase of 50% and a drop in footfall within the Central Business District after the Covid-19 pandemic, says owner Yuzhong Tan.Keong Saik Bakery has relocated to a more spacious new location at Bendemeer that will cater to growing dine-in needs. The new store opened its doors on May 27.According to Tan, he “felt the market is looking for more dine-in spaces rather than takeaway, so we needed to increase our dining space”.Located at the Luzerne Building and beside minimalist brunch spot SYIP, the new location is not just bigger, but also comes with a gallery concept that showcases its history and beloved creations.Each piece on display is real and you can think of them as pieces of art on display: Look and don’t touch (or taste).Fans can still expect Keong Saik Bakery’s tried-and-tested signatures at the new store, such as the chendol delight cake (S$8.40), which loosely emulates the iconic local dessert.While it retains the same comforting blend of ingredients — which include gula melaka custard and pandan jelly — the classic dessert also has a new look that makes it more an entremet than sliced cake.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHawker Hustlers: Hipster hawker Ray Yeo of Bei-Ing Dimsum Club on reinventing dim sum and his love for all things Japan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTalad Thai Banana opens at AMK Hub with S$2 opening promotion for the first 100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Feuds: Saizeriya vs Milan Shokudo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course, a trip to Keong Saik Bakery isn’t complete without indulging in its viennoiseries, such as the aromatic pistachio croissant (S$8) and the all-time classic of sor hei (S$5) — an original creation that sports striking black accents on its exterior while hiding a glut of chocolate chips in its core.Besides that, Keong Saik Bakery was also one of the most popular cafe destinations in Singapore for burnt cheesecakes (from S$8.20) during the height of its popularity.Some fans will also remember the photogenic Seashore 2.0 (S$8.50), a unique fusion of earl grey cheesecake, butterfly pea mousse and an earl grey shortbread base.There will also be a slew of new menu items such as the breakfast granola (S$12.90), truffle mac and cheese (S$15.90) and local-inspired otah mac and cheese (S$15.90).\xa0These new items aren’t yet available at Holland Village yet, but will likely make an appearance in the future.However, while not new, Keong Saik Bakery will spotlight two exclusive pastry series at the Bendemeer outlet: Croissant flans (S$6) and croissant eclairs (S$6.90).\xa0Riffing on the classic desserts of flan and eclair, viennoiserie pastry is fashioned into whimsical shapes and loaded with fillings that range from black sesame to lemon pistachio.Keong Saik Bakery is on the GrabFood delivery service and offers free delivery (up to S$3 off) with GrabUnlimited.

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/traditional-eats-chinatown/:['If you’re looking for what to eat in Chinatown, the area is a haven for foodies looking for various cuisines from the Chinese diaspora.Chinatown has dozens of glorious culinary gems amid its historic temples and street hawkers.Hit the town for a day of feasting on traditional bites ranging from dim sum delicacies to luscious egg tarts to sizzling claypot rice. You’ll be spoilt for choice.\nHere’s our list on 10 places to go for traditional eats if you’re looking for what to eat in Chinatown.\xa0285 South Bridge Road\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (9am to 6pm)\nIt’s a fierce fight among various well-loved contenders here in Singapore, but local heritage brand Tong Heng is the indisputable grand dame of Cantonese egg tarts.\xa0Founded in 1935, the family-run bakery set out on a mission to share its love for traditional pastries. Its bestseller: Dairy-free, diamond-shaped egg tarts. The original egg tart is just the right amount of crumbly and buttery, with a luscious egg custard filling.\xa0In 2018, the store underwent a brand revamp to cater to the younger generation and now boasts two terrazzo counters and gold accents.\xa0\nWhat to order: Egg tart (S$2), coconut egg tart (S$2.20)Chinatown Complex Food Centre, 02-198/199, 335 Smith Street \nOpen: Monday to Wednesday, and Friday to Sunday (4pm to 9pm)Reputed for its long waits, Lian He Ben Ji Claypot, in the blue zone at Chinatown Complex Food Centre, doesn’t believe in shortcuts. Every order is made from scratch here.\xa0Through a tried-and-tested cooking method, rows of rice in claypots sizzle and cook over blazing charcoal fire stoves, rather than being pre-steamed. This dedication to the craft earned it a place on the 2018 Michelin Bib Gourmand list.\xa0Generous chunks of juicy chicken, sausage slices, duck liver sausage, pork belly, salted fish, and lup cheong (Chinese sausage) pack a sharp punch with every mouthful of wok hei (smoky) fragrance. Our hack: Give Lian He Ben Ji Claypot a call in advance, so it can start cooking your portion 30 minutes before you arrive. \n\nWhat to order: Bowls range from S$5 to S$20, depending on size63-67 Temple Street\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (12pm to 9.30pm)Escape the crowds and sweltering heat in Chinatown at this trusty Chinese dessert institution, which boasts a selection of 40 desserts.\xa0Mei Heong Yuen Dessert’s collection of more than 20 flavours of snow ice desserts includes the milk tea snow ice, mango snow ice and sesame snow ice — all of which come in a mini mountain of ultra-thin sheets reminiscent of fine powdered snow.\xa0Its traditional Cantonese paste desserts made from various nuts are also bestsellers. Flavours run the gamut from almond and walnut to sesame and peanut.The pastes are fragrant and silky smooth without being too cloying.\n\nWhat to order: Mango lychee snow ice (S$8.50), peanut paste (S$4.50)Chinatown Complex Food Centre, 02-135, 335 Smith Street\nOpen: Wednesday to Sunday (11.30am to 3pm, 5pm to 8.30pm)Fat and bursting with flavour, the xiao long bao at this humble Michelin-recommended hawker stall gives its upscale counterparts a run for their money.The handmade xiao long baos at Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao are stuffed with tender and well-seasoned minced pork filling, swimming in a steamy, savoury broth that’s boiled for more than 12 hours.Its addictive chilli oil dumplings, soaked in a gravy of black vinegar and numbing Szechuan red chilli oil are a guaranteed hit with dumpling fanatics. It also sells la mian (hand-pulled noodles) in various iterations, such as sour-and-spicy noodles, beef noodles and dumpling noodles that are equally slurp-worthy. \n\nWhat to order: Steamed xiao long bao (S$7 for 10 pieces), Szechuan spicy wantons (S$5 for 10 pieces)30-32 Keong Saik Road\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (12pm to 2.15pm, 5pm to 9.30pm) Mention zi char (stir-fried dishes) along Keong Saik Road and Kok Sen Restaurant — a long-running Cantonese restaurant with a loyal following — immediately comes to mind if you’re looking for what to eat in Chinatown.\xa0It’s hard to choose from its extensive menu, but the bestsellers include its big prawns hor fun that comes in a blanket of thick gravy, which is deceptively spicy. Another dish is the prawn paste chicken that’s deep-fried till crispy and best eaten with a drizzle of freshly squeezed calamansi.Other must-try dishes include the signature claypot yong tau foo and the bittergourd braised pork ribs with rich black bean sauce. Note that it gets perpetually packed during peak dining hours, but there’s always the option of takeaways.\n\nWhat to order: Big prawns hor fun (from S$22.20), prawn paste chicken (from S$15.30)Chinatown Complex Food Centre, 02-126, 335 Smith Street \nOpen: Monday to Saturday (10.30am to 3.30pm)Having made history for being the world’s first Michelin-starred street food stall (and also the cheapest), Hawker Chan is a soya sauce chicken specialist you should try if you haven’t already.\xa0The star of the show is, of course, the soya sauce chicken. One bite into its slippery skin gives way to tender and succulent meat. It’s typically served alongside a bed of rice laden with dark savoury sauce and aromatic oil, or springy yellow noodles.\xa0It’s a testament to chef Chan Hon Meng’s tireless dedication to perfecting his craft. He was taught the soya sauce chicken recipe under a Hong Kong chef in his early years of apprenticeship. If that’s not enough, you can top it up with nicely caramelised char siew slices.\xa0What to order: Soya sauce chicken rice (S$7.20), char siew rice (S$7.70)People’s Park Centre, 01-042/052, 32 New Market Road\nOpen: Monday to Saturday (10am to 9.30pm), Sunday (10.30am to 9.30pm)Mala xiang guo (spicy stir-fried hotpot) has only grown in popularity since it exploded onto Singapore’s food scene, but Ri Ri Hong Ma La Hotpot in People’s Park Food Centre eclipses the myriad of other mala xiang guo vendors out there in terms of value for money.\xa0Similar to yong tau foo stalls, customers take their pick of ingredients, spiciness levels and mala sauces. Its generous selection can be categorised into vegetables, meats and seafood. The ingredients include luncheon meat, king oyster mushrooms, shrimps, beansprouts, and instant noodles.\xa0The sauce is loaded with Sichuan peppercorns, dried chilli, ginger, and garlic pieces. Get ready to brave the snaking queues and heat for bowls that will give you an addictive, tongue-numbingly spicy fix.What to order: Prices vary depending on what vegetables (S$1), meats (S$2) and seafood (S$3) you choose\n20 Trengganu Street, 02-01\nOpen: Tuesday to Friday (10.30am to 8.30pm), Saturday and Sunday (9am to 8.30pm)There’s nothing quite like the experience of choosing dim sum delicacies from old-school traditional pushcarts that move from table to table in a tea house. Complete with marble tables and wooden chairs, dining at Yum Cha Restaurant is a full throwback experience.\xa0Famed for its whopping variety of dim sum and side dishes, you’ll be spoilt for choice if you’re looking for what to eat in Chinatown.\xa0We’d recommend saving your stomach for the weekday dim sum high-tea buffet from 3pm to 6pm. Classic dishes include the truffle mushroom bao (bun), scallop pea-shoot dumpling, fish roe siew mai (a type of dumpling), and pork ribs with garlic.What to order: Pork ribs with garlic (S$6.80), scallop pea-shoot dumpling (S$5.20)Chinatown Complex Food Centre, 02-112 (Red Section), 335 Smith Street\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (8am to 7pm)Lim Kam Chwee, who brought the unique skill of handmaking popiah skin from Fujian to Singapore in the 1940s, founded heritage brand Ann Chin Popiah in 1958.At its main outlet at Chinatown Complex Food Centre, you can watch the staff members make popiah on the spot. It takes skill to make a thin, chewy skin that manages to contain a generous filling of cooked turnip, sliced carrots, garlic, chilli padi paste, crispy bits, peanuts, green shredded lettuce, eggs, chilli sweet sauce, and sweet sauce.\xa0Only at S$2.20 a popiah, these wraps make a great snack. Alternatively, go for the DIY popiah party set and get a few friends over for a popiah party at home. \n\nWhat to order: Spicy popiah (S$2.20 a piece), kueh pie tee — thin and crispy pastry tart shell often filled with shredded Chinese turnips and a mixture of thinly sliced vegetables and prawns (S$4 for four pieces)Chinatown Complex Food Centre, 02-008, 335 Smith Street\nOpen: Monday to Saturday (10.30am to 8pm)A place that has some of the most artisanal chendol you can find in Singapore, Old Amoy Chendol was founded in the 1950s. It started from a humble pushcart along Amoy Street.\xa0Now in the hands of the third generation, no effort is spared to ensure each bowl of this traditional dessert is made as fresh as possible using freshly squeezed coconut milk. Fresh coconuts are cold-pressed to get the creamiest and most fragrant yield from the drupe.\xa0Additionally, the aromatic gula melaka (palm sugar) is hand-carried from Sarawak in Malaysia and charcoal-processed, while all the pandan flavour in the chendol jelly is extracted directly from pandan leaves. Last but not least, it’s topped with Japanese azuki beans that are sweetened with palm sugar.\xa0\xa0What to order: Chendol (S$3.50)\nAll the places on this list — except Tong Heng and Lian He Ben Ji Claypot — are on the GrabFood delivery service.

Three years later, it will finally be opening its own physical cafe!In an Instagram post on May 18, the brand announced that its first bakery-cafe is slated to open sometime in July. It will be located at 38 Margaret Drive.Dessert aficionados are in for a treat.\xa0The Homme Baker is known for its range of Insta-worthy bakes. These are meticulously crafted by founder Pond Lim, a Bangkok-born pastry chef who had majored in the culinary arts while at university.Lim makes his pastries from scratch using fresh and quality ingredients, while injecting his creative flair into classic recipes.The Homme Baker’s menu boasts a diverse selection of sweets that include artisanal nama chocolates (chocolate ganache), Basque burnt cheesecakes, and whole cakes.\xa0But it is perhaps most renowned for its photogenic T&J collection — said to be Lim’s signature and piece de resistance. Moulded into the shape of Swiss cheese, these cakes are inspired by the iconic cartoon duo Tom & Jerry.It is a series of whimsical chocolate-shelled cakes that contain layers of cake, cream, fruit, and other goodies.They are available in flavours including original (from S$24), dark chocolate banoffee (from S$24), and even a locally inspired ondeh (from S$24).If these aren’t quite your beat, the fabulous Be Proud & Gorgeous chocolate cake (S$55) is another one of The Homme Baker’s top crowd-pleasers.Originally created in support of Pride Month in 2022, the gorgeous whole cake is smothered in decadent buttery chocolate sauce, then finished with a vibrant medley of fruits, herbs and crunchy treats.We’re still a while away from the official opening, but we are already excited to indulge in its signature pastries — and hopefully new creations — when The Homme Baker’s cafe opens its doors come July.Interested in online bakers?

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/my-must-eats-jamus-lim/:['My Must-Eats is a HungryGoWhere series featuring Singapore’s public figures and their favourite food haunts. This week, we speak to Member of Parliament Jamus Lim.If you were to ask any Singaporean what food item they’d associate with Jamus Lim of the Workers’ Party, it’d probably be “hum” (cockles). He famously used the phrase “warms the cockles of my heart” during a debate ahead of the 2020 General Election, and hasn’t managed to shake off that link ever since.But as we find out through the course of this interview, Lim’s tastes in food are wide, varied and geographically diverse.Having lived, studied and worked abroad in many countries, the 46-year-old economist and politician is quite the cook as well. If you follow him on Instagram, you’ll occasionally see his recipes, musings on food, and recommendations.Besides being a Member of Parliament for Sengkang group representation constituency, Lim is an associate professor of economics at Essec Business School in Singapore as well as a council member of the Economic Society of Singapore.As a young child, it was either Nonya dishes — such as babi pongteh, or pork braised in fermented soybean sauce — or nasi lemak sold by a purveyor that wandered the corridors of our HDB block every weekday morning.\xa0As I got older, I developed a taste for spicier fare, partially through coercion by Dad, who insisted that Peranakans need to develop a palate for spicy food. So my favourites now include laksa and curry.And of course, we all have our favourite brekkie foods. For me, it’s chai tow kway — the white kind — or mee pok tah.\xa0Where do I get these? Well, usually, convenience rules; most local hawkers are able to ensure pretty high quality for these staples.\xa0But I’m not beyond travelling to places famous for one dish or another. These are usually those you find in foodie recommendations.In Sengkang, I love the Indonesian nasi padang at the 182A coffee shop, the big prawn mee and rojak at the 205D coffee shop, the char kway teow at the 303 coffee shop, and the mee rebus at the 350 coffee shop.Home-cooked Peranakan is always my favourite; if you pointed a gun at me and made me choose my last meal, it’ll likely be Peranakan.\xa0But if we were to go to a restaurant for a special occasion, we have enjoyed food from Chilli Padi as well as Blue Ginger. For ambience, True Blue can’t be beat.All of them! When I lived abroad, we would return once or twice a year, and when we did, it would be week-long gluttony — with no repeats.\xa0But to be fair, we would start with what I mentioned — laksa, chai tow kway — as well as, of course, sambal belachan.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy Must-Eats with the Korean oppa from SG, Eric Youn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEat 3 Bowls opens at Compass One after closing Crawford Lane outlet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy Must-Eats with actress Jae Liew\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have yet to experience the full range of Iranian, Peruvian or Sri Lankan food, so I would say those are the ones I would like to get to try more of.When I lived in DC, there was a massive Ethiopian diaspora, and I quickly developed a taste for Ethiopian food, which remains one of my favourite cuisines in the world — other than local, of course.After we recently got back from our grassroots outreach trip to Korea, we headed to the Violet Oon at Jewel Changi Airport for tea.

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/jeju-cafes/:['The volcanic island of Jeju is often dubbed the ‘Hawaii of Korea’, and it is best known for its scenic natural wonders, from waterfalls and craters to underground tubes and volcanic rock formations.These days, the enchanting island of Jeju has also built a reputation for being the go-to spot for romantic getaways and cafe hopping. The island even has a street dedicated to cafes, dubbed the Aewol cafe street.\xa0It can be difficult deciding which Jeju cafe\xa0to visit, but we’ve collated a list of different cafes, each with its own unique charm.\xa0From villa-like seaside cafes overlooking the surrounding waters of Jeju island to cosy old warehouses with straw-thatched roofs, we’ve rounded up some of the best cafes in Jeju that will impress even the most discerning cafe aficionados.\xa0These are the eleven cafes you have to hit when you’re there.South Korea, Jeju-do, Jeju-si, Aewol-eup, 애월북서길 52\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (9am to 9pm)Why visit? Haejigae Cafe, which is Korean for “place where the sun goes down”, has a glass wall facing the seaside that guarantees patrons a breathtaking view – especially at sunset in clear weather.It is located right in front of Handam Beach, with an outdoor seating area that stretches out into the beach.\xa0And while Jeju has no shortage of sea-facing cafes, Haejigae Cafe stands out with its adorable and delicious pastries, as well as its Hanok-inspired (traditional Korean house) interior.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/ought-coffee/:['There’s a wonderful aroma of coffee and freshly ground beans in the lobby of the YMCA headquarters on Orchard Road.In the corner, you’ll spy Ought Coffee, a small cart tucked behind a pillar.\xa0On the menu: Gourmet coffee brewed on the spot by an experienced barista. But unlike your usual cafe hangout, paper cups are the norm here — take your drink to-go or have a seat on one of the many comfy lounge chairs in the building’s lobby.And when it comes to paying for your cuppa, it’s not a simple tap-and-go. There’s a glass jar for cash, and a recently added QR code for PayNow.Its owners, Jared Tan, 34, and Glen Ho, 35, invite customers to pay as they wish. That means you contribute what you believe your cup of coffee is worth.\xa0You can also pay it forward, anonymously putting extra funds towards a cuppa for someone else who’s unable to afford it — a practice known in Western countries as a “suspended coffee”.A post shared by HungryGoWhere (@hungrygowhere)Tan and Ho — who also own Prodigal Roasters, and cafes Lowercase and Gather the Misfits — worked with some friends at the YMCA to set up the cart.The original idea was to serve coffee to YMCA’s stream of visitors — tourists staying at the hotel on its premises, those using its event facilities and churchgoers on Sundays.Says Tan: “The pay-as-you-wish concept was something we wanted to try, because we wanted to change certain mindsets.”It’s common for Singaporeans to hunt for the best deals around, especially in the F&B space.\xa0But Ought hopes to encourage more people to pay the full amount if they can, or more important, to pass it on to those who may not be able to afford it.They previously trialled the concept at Lowercase cafe, on the grounds of Lasalle College of the Arts.“Our machine just stopped working for the day, so we decided to say ‘okay, why don’t we try this pay-as-you-wish thing? You can pay by cash or PayNow’,” he recalls.\xa0“Surprisingly, we had a lot of students come in on that day. It was quite interesting, because even though we didn’t set a price, people willingly paid.”Many students paid S$1 to S$3, while others paid more, around S$10.\xa0(The usual price for a coffee at Lowercase — and many other cafes like it — ranges from S$5 to S$7.)“The (extra money comes) from people who can afford it, or usually those who aren’t from Singapore — tourists or lecturers, especially from countries like Australia, the UK and America.”\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Feuds: Saizeriya vs Milan Shokudo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith this payment style now permanently in place at Ought, how has the public responded?“People think it’s very weird that we’re doing this, like it doesn’t make sense. A lot of them ask us: ‘Do you earn money from this?’”\xa0“I just say ‘I don’t know!’,” says Tan. “Nothing makes sense, but we just want to give. That’s the theme around this cart.”It’s also been a social experiment of sorts.The very action of carrying cash and putting it into a jar has been quite novel for Ought’s customers. Singaporeans are used to cashless payments and the tipping culture is not common here.\xa0“The highest we’ve gotten is S$20. There was this guy who stood here for a really long time talking to us — he put in that amount for a cup of tea.”Some customers don’t carry cash at all. “We usually say: ‘You can grab your coffee, no worries. If you’re back another day, you can drop it in if you have it’,” says Tan.Ought has since added a QR code for PayNow payments.“A few regulars that we see are willing to pay, because they know the value. If they have extra, they don’t mind putting in extra. So I guess we are effecting change a little bit,” says Tan.\xa0By contrast, Ought also sees customers who compare the cuppas to kopi at a kopitiam, and think a dollar or two would suffice.\xa0Despite Ought’s laissez-faire payment model, there are costs to cover.\xa0Tan says this varies from day to day, depending on the number of cups sold. Naturally, more cups sold mean lower costs. The cart serves about 30 cups each day, with more on Sundays, but traffic is generally light.For now, the takings don’t cover the costs, says Tan. But he and Ho consider it part of their tithe — the Christian practice of giving back a portion of one’s income to the church or community.The set-up is what it is — a mobile coffee cart on wheels and, admittedly, no-frills — which means that it doesn’t have the full works you’d usually see in a standard cafe.Ought makes its ice in a small chest freezer behind it, and the wooden cart conceals troughs for the espresso machine’s water source and drainage.“We start everything from scratch every day. We need to get water — enough to run for the whole day,” says Tan, a former engineer.The machine is a portable one that makes a good cup of coffee but is limited by the number of cups it can produce in a short time. “It will heat up and we just need to wait for it to cool down,” he adds.Nonetheless, the coffee is solid, with beans roasted in-house by Prodigal Roasters — also owned by Tan and Ho. Hot white coffee is Ought’s bestseller, and there are iced and oat-milk options available, too.Ought Coffee will be at the YMCA at least until June — for now.Book a ride to Ought Coffee.For more on eateries with a mission, check out our stories on Dignity Kitchen and Crossings Cafe.YMCA, Level 1 lobby, 1 Orchard Road\nNearest MRT station: Dhoby Ghaut\nOpens: Tuesdays to Sundays (8.30am to 4.30pm)YMCA, Level 1 lobby, 1 Orchard Road\nNearest MRT station: Dhoby Ghaut\nOpens: Tuesdays to Sundays (8.30am to 4.30pm)AuthorJia-En has worn several hats in her career — first writing TV scripts, then food and lifestyle stories at Wine & Dine.

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/affordable-buffets/:['Yes, the masks are finally off, but if there was another thing we missed more than those maskless days, it’s all-you-can-eat buffet spreads.\xa0For nearly two years, self-service buffets were suspended as part of Covid-19 restrictions in Singapore.\xa0With these measures well behind us, and rising menu prices all around, there isn’t a better time to head straight for an affordable buffet restaurant to get the greatest bang for your buck.\xa0We’ve scoured every corner of Singapore to bring you 10 cheap buffet spreads in Singapore under S$21 (before GST and service charge) that won’t break the bank.70 Desker Road\nOpen: Tuesday to Friday (11am to 3.30 pm, 5.30pm to 10pm), Saturday and Sunday (11am to 3.30pm, 4pm to 10pm)\xa0Located in Little India, Swaad serves up vegetarian North Indian and Gujarati cuisine at wallet-friendly prices. If you love Indian food, then you’ll love Swaad’s Sunday weekend unlimited dine-in buffet.\xa0Priced at S$17.50, the spread includes a starter, four types of vegetables or paneer, Gujarati daal or kadhi (thick gravy), daal, raita (yoghurt sauce), roti, puri (Indian fried bread), rice, dessert and chaas (North Indian buttermilk).\xa0Its dishes are homely, hearty and filling without being too cloying. If you’ve never had North Indian or Gujarati cuisine, Swaad is a great, authentic place to start. 1 Zubir Said Drive, 01-04\nOpen: Monday to Friday (11.30am to 4pm, 5.30pm to 10pm), Saturday and Sunday (11.30am to 10.30pm)Been watching those K-dramas and craving some Korean barbeque? Situated centrally in Dhoby Ghaut at the School of The Arts Singapore (SOTA), I’m Kim Korean BBQ has fuelled the stomachs of many budget-conscious students from SOTA and the neighbouring Singapore Management University (SMU).\xa0Its weekday lunch buffet goes for a very reasonable S$16.90, which is even less than the full price you’d pay for a single serving of meat in a regular Korean restaurant along Telok Ayer or Tanjong Pagar.\xa0If marinated meats aren’t your thing, the restaurant also serves up free-flow veggies, fried items (we hear its signature chicken wings are a must-try), seafood and Korean soups. Just make sure you get your fill within the restaurant’s dining duration cap of 90 minutes. The Centrepoint, 03-43, 176 Orchard Road\nOpen: Monday to Thursday (11.30am to 3.30pm, 5.30pm to 10pm), Friday to Sunday (11.30am to 3.30pm, 5.30pm to 10.30pm)Prefer a steamboat buffet instead of the grill? Owned by the same group behind I’m Kim Korean BBQ, GoroGoro Steamboat & Korean Buffet dishes out a steamboat buffet with no less than seven soup bases for you to choose from.The restaurant’s name GoroGoro is a play on the sound made by one’s rumbling tummy as well as the bubbling that comes from a boiling steamboat. Satisfy your steamboat and Korean food craving from S$18.90 on weekdays during lunch. The restaurant is open daily and also serves dinner if you’re willing to splurge a little.With a wide spread of raw food items to complement its seven soup bases and a selection of local and Korean dishes, your stomach most certainly won’t go ‘goro goro’ for long! 131 Killiney Road\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (6am to 9.30pm)With the recent spate of rainy days and cold weather, a heart and stomach-warming porridge buffet might just be what you need. Orchard Grand Court, a serviced apartment in Somerset, houses a traditional-style all-day-dining restaurant called Crystal Cafe. It’s well known for its affordable Taiwanese porridge buffet, starting from S$18.80 on weekdays.\xa0If you love a good Teochew porridge meal, then this cheap Chinese buffet spread promises nothing less. While the dishes change regularly, expect to see favourites such as braised pig trotters, braised chicken feet, kiam chye (preserved vegetables) and hae bee hiam (sambal dried shrimp).The best bit is that it’s not just porridge and side dishes. If you’ve still got room, Crystal Cafe’s got an entire spread of desserts and cakes for your afters.Rendezvous Hotel, 01-01, 9 Bras Basah Road\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (10.30am to 11pm)You know this place means business when its name is the duration of your buffet meal. But 90 Minutes is really all you need to get your fill and money’s worth (S$16.90 to be exact) at this Korean tteokbokki (rice cake) hotpot place with its cheap buffet pricing.\xa0Reminiscent of the Korean street food culture where you can easily purchase a plate of spicy, piping hot rice cakes with some fried fritters known as dwigim, 90 Minutes promises you that and more. Its interior also resembles the streets of Seoul with its bold, neon and cutesy signs.Its buffet spread follows this order: Fishcake skewers (eomuk), tteokbokki, ramyeon (instant noodles), and lastly fried rice. You can choose from a broad selection of raw food such as vegetables, meats, and seafood to add to your hot pot, or snack on its fried finger food while you wait for your food to cook. 476-478 MacPherson Road\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (4pm to 11pm)Craving authentic Thai mookata but in a bit of a penny-pinching mode? Aroy Mak Mookata’s affordable Thai mookata buffet, which starts from S$20.80 nett on weekdays, promises you a wide selection of classic Thai marinated meats and premium ingredients like salmon, oysters and crayfish.\xa0If you want to up the authenticity ante a little more, you can also get its Thai milk tea tower (charged separately). Aroy Mak also provides the option of a la carte mookata if you prefer not to over-indulge. Prices start from a very affordable S$1.80 a plate.\xa0The restaurant is a bit of a hidden gem, tucked away in the MacPherson area, but while you’re likely to get a seat quite easily, make sure you secure a reservation before heading down to avoid disappointment! Ngee Ann City, 05-05A, 391B Orchard Road\nOpen: Sunday to Thursday (11am to 9.30pm), Friday to Saturday (11am to 10pm)Kroffles have taken Korea by storm recently, and salon-cafe You Are My Sunshine has kindly brought these yummy croissant-waffle snacks to our sunny shores. Not only that, it is giving you an unlimited serving of these, all-day, every day.\xa0The cafe takes pride in its buttery soft waffles that promise the airy layers you’d usually find in a croissant. Have these delectable pastries with any of its four ice cream flavours – peanut butter mud-pie, Mexican vanilla pod, earl grey lavender and chocolate.\xa0The cafe doesn’t have a time limit for its kroffle buffet, so if you’re game for it and have all the time, eat your heart out. The only catch is that you’ll only be able to order one serving at a time to prevent wastage. If you’d like to try something different during your buffet, dig into Korean-Western-style dishes like its classic bulgogi salad (S$27) or spicy seafood tteokbokki pasta (S$28).\xa0Sun Plaza, 02-14, 30 Sembawang Drive\nOpen: Monday to Thursday (11.30am to 3.30pm, 5pm to 10pm), Friday (11.30am to 3.30pm, 5pm to 10.30pm), Saturday (11.30am to 10.30pm), Sunday (11.30am to 10pm)If you’re addicted to hotpots and aren’t quite prepared to splurge on a meal at one of the bigger names, Pot Addiction could be your next, well, addiction. With 80 items on its buffet menu and a choice between hotpot and Korean BBQ, Pot Addiction delivers extreme value, with its weekday lunch buffet prices starting at S$18.90, making it an ideal budget buffet option.\xa0Like many hotpot spots, Pot Addiction allows you to mix and match condiments to create your own signature sauce.\xa0Take note that while you’ve got a wide selection of dishes, soup bases and sauces, you’ll only get 90 minutes to dine at this affordable hotpot spot. So whether you’re choosing to do both the Korean BBQ and hotpot or just one, make sure you make every minute count.459 Changi Road\nOpen: 24 hoursAl Jasra feels like every prata lover’s dream – it’s open 24/7 with an unlimited flow of prata and a very breezy price of S$7.90. If you think you’re going to choose from stacks of cold, rubbery prata, good news – everything is cooked fresh to order.\xa0The prata buffet includes 16 different types of prata and you’re entitled to as many prata as you’d like from these 16 varieties. Choose from the conventional plain or egg prata or if you’re game, there’s even ikan bilis prata and pineapple prata.Need something to wash all that down? You can opt for the prata and drinks option at just S$9.90, still well within a budget if you had one. Be sure to only order what you can consume as every additional prata leftover will cost you S$1 each. 259 Outram Road\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (5pm to 1am)\xa0Instead of taking the drive up to Johor Bahru for some lok lok, head to AK Zai Lok Lok for its unlimited lok lok buffet at S$19.90. For the uninitiated, lok lok typically refers to skewers dipped into a piping pot of hot soup. The term ‘lok’ is Cantonese and it means “to dip”.Honestly, while I love my hotpot meals, sometimes it gets frustrating when your food gets lost in the depths of the bubbling soup base. And for that, lok lok gets my vote for fuss-free hotpot-style dining.Choose from more than 40 types of dishes during a two-hour duration. It might sound like a short time, but honestly, there’s plenty you can get within these 120 minutes. Grab crowd favourites such as shishamo and enoki with bacon.\xa0The affordable buffet of lok lok items goes for the base price of S$19.90, but if you’d like a soup base to go with them, it’ll be an additional S$10. Swaad, I’m Kim Korean BBQ, GoroGoro Steamboat & Korean Buffet, Aroy Mak Mookata, Pot Addiction Korean BBQ & Hotpot Buffet, Al Jasra and AK Zai Lok Lok are on the GrabFood delivery service and offer free delivery (up to S$3 off) with GrabUnlimited.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/food-safety-and-hygiene/:['Think food poisoning and bacteria won’t happen in your kitchen? Think again. We delve deep into food safety and hygiene, and explain why eating at home can be dangerous if you don’t keep your kitchen clean.Remisier Kenneth Kan never thought he would fall so ill from a home-cooked meal. After all, recent local news about food contamination and even deaths from eating popular hawker fare were limited to meals outside the home. Who would have thought that his sister’s fried noodle dish during last year’s family Christmas party would land him in the Accident & Emergency ward?“I was hooked up on an IV tube because I was losing so much fluid from vomiting and diarrhoea,” he says. “It was a terrible feeling spending Christmas Day in hospital.” Several other family members came down with diarrhoea as well, but Kenneth’s case was most severe.It was a long process for the Kans to figure out which dish caused the food poisoning. They went through an elimination process on who ate which dish and who did not. Finally, the fried noodle dish was deemed the culprit. At the same time, his sister discovered that her chopping board had a funny smell; it was also a well-used one.“I bought her a new set of chopping boards as an additional Christmas gift after that!” Kenneth says.Experts we spoke to all agree that the chopping board ranks high on the list of kitchen hazards. This basic kitchen tool is often assumed to be clean after a quick rinse. In fact, frequent washing with hot soapy water is needed.Are you wary about other dangers lurking in your kitchen? Grab this list and do a walkabout in your kitchen now.\xa0You probably have cut fruit and uncovered leftovers chucked haphazardly on random shelves in the fridge. And did you really place that bag of two-day-old defrosted meat next to the cut watermelon?The Agri-Food & Veterinary Authority (AVA) says it’s important to keep raw food in tightly-wrapped plastic bags or covered containers to prevent raw food juices from dripping onto other food. This will prevent food-borne bacteria like salmonella and E. coli from breeding.Throw out expired food and organise your fridge contents by food types: Jam jars and butter tubs should be placed together, and meat that is to be defrosted for tonight’s dinner should be placed in the chilled compartment away from other raw or cooked foods.While you’re at it, clean your fridge door handle with a disinfectant spray. Almost every family member will touch the fridge door at least once a day, so the handle becomes a playground for everyone’s germs.Hands up if you can’t remember the last time you replaced your chopping board — you’re not alone. Most people don’t regard that as a priority since they assume any food bacteria from the board will be killed during cooking.The truth is that crevices from repeated slicing and chopping house 200% more faecal matter than your toilet bowl. According to Dr Charles Gerba, a professor of microbiology at the University of Arizona, these grooves provide plenty of space for bacteria to breed. They tend to multiply faster in our humid climate too, so use separate chopping boards for handling raw and cooked food. This means one board for chopping those chicken thighs, and another board for slicing tomatoes for salad. The AVA says that if you only have one chopping board, always wash it thoroughly with soap and hot water between uses.A lot of people swirl their chopsticks in hot steamboat soup after dunking raw meat slices with the same pair, thinking the heat will kill any bacteria.In fact, that is one of the biggest mistakes Chef Mervyn Phan observes of his students. Phan, who runs local cooking school Cookyn-with-Mervyn, says that knives, forks and other utensils used on raw food must not be used again on cooked food without thorough washing. So swirling your chopsticks for a few seconds in piping hot soup will not do the trick. Use a separate pair of chopsticks or tongs instead.Wiping down with your dish towel isn’t enough. You need to spray down with an anti-bacterial disinfectant, says Wilton Method baking instructor Tang Meng Choo. She handles raw ingredients such as egg yolks in her baking process, and cautions that some materials may inadvertently end up on the counter top.Germs exist even if you can’t see them. So keep your table and counter tops clean if you don’t want to share your meal with the ever-present salmonella and streptococcus, which can lead to serious cases of stomach flu.How old is your dishcloth anyway?AVA’s advice is to disinfect dishcloths and tea towels in chlorine solution, or heat for two minutes in the microwave oven — the ultraviolet radiation will zap the germs dead. Change them frequently since they come into contact with both cooked and raw food. The same applies to sponges used to wash utensils, plates and frying pans.Housewife Cecilia Teh goes one step further. She washes her dishcloths with hot water everyday, and places them out to air-dry instead of hanging them indoors. She has been practising this for the last 30 years. “The strong rays from the sun will kill any germs left after washing, plus you get a pleasant smelling cloth,” she says.Every two to three weeks, she replaces her dish towels and uses them as floor rags instead. AVA approves of her practice, and adds that drying kitchen towels quickly will prevent germs from breeding.Remember: Moisture is bacteria’s best friend!Just as you handle raw meat in a hygienic manner to prevent the spreading of food-borne illnesses, you should do the same with vegetables as well. Nevertheless, there is no need to go to the other extreme of dousing your veggies in special rinses. Salad-lover and vegetarian Goh Ting-An recalls the advice given to her by a vegetable stallholder in the wet market a few years back. “He told me that you don’t need to use special soaps to clean off pesticides or bugs on veggies,” she says. “Just soak in tap water for 15 minutes or so.”AVA adds that soiled portions of vegetables should be removed as they can contain harmful bacteria. The base should also be cut off and any residual soil should be washed away with tap water. If you eat raw vegetables frequently, always wash them thoroughly.Do you have a runny nose or a cough? Get someone else to handle the cooking duties, and keep clear of the kitchen. You wouldn’t want to eat food prepared by a restaurant chef who is down with flu, so why practise that double standard on yourself?AVA says it is advisable to avoid preparing food for yourself or others if you’re ill, especially if your symptoms include vomiting and diarrhoea. You may minimise the spread of germs by washing your hands thoroughly, but you are still contagious.Always use the freshest ingredients, says Chef Phan who once came down with a bad case of food poisoning after having roasted seabass at a restaurant, which was touted as the “special of the day”. “I’m quite sure the fish wasn’t fresh,” he recalls. “Now, I’m very wary of “specials of the day”. Some restaurants use this as a ploy to clear out older stocks.”Likewise, ensure you’re using the freshest ingredients possible when cooking at home. Check the expiry dates of perishables such as milk, ham, bread and eggs. Throw them out even before the expiry date if you detect an unpleasant odour, mould growing or odd colour.Your apron can do more than prevent sauce from splashing over your clothes — it works the other way too. Bacteria, dust and other harmful micro-organisms from your street clothes can be passed onto your food during the preparation and cooking stages.Your best bet is to ensure you change your clothes before cooking, if you’ve been out before that. Otherwise, donning on your apron will do the trick too. Make sure you keep your hair away from your face, too.Both Chef Phan and baking instructor Meng Choo keep a watch for students who don’t wash their hands before class — with good reason. \xa0A study by the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America discovered that the average human hand houses 150 species of bacteria.Hence, these chefs are fastidious in making their students wash their hands thoroughly. “Most bacteria are killed during this step, so it’s very important that students wash their hands before and after they prepare food,” says Chef Phan.Since Meng Choo’s students regularly handle edible decorations by hand, she makes available equipment such as pincers to pick up small decorations. “Think of the pincer as a communal serving spoon, so everyone can take their pick of decorations in a hygienic way,” she says.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

Why? Not only does it have a dizzying amount of shops in its sprawling premises, the stores are also a good mix of dining, shopping and entertainment, which means your day is sorted.Suntec City is also a great spot to use as a home base while you explore attractions and sites in the civic district. And when you’re peckish, you can head back to the mall and take your pick from all manner of cuisines, then enjoy your food in air-conditioned comfort.With more than a hundred F&B options, you’ll be sure to find a restaurant that meets your cravings and budget at Suntec City. Don’t know where to start? Here are eight of its latest eateries that you can explore within a day!Tower 3, 02-600\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (9am to 9pm) Everyone knows Delifrance, and how could we not, given the cafe’s established three-decade-long history in Singapore, with outlets in key heartland locations? Long before the many different types of cafes in Singapore even started, Delifrance was reliably serving up soft, fluffy croissants and delectable tarts, and providing a space for those little tete-a-tete sessions.\xa0This outlet at Suntec City Mall is relatively new, having opened in December 2022. It is the perfect spot for anyone looking for a fuss-free, quick and quiet breakfast. Indulge in its all-day breakfast options such as a hearty platter (S$13.20), which comes with a croissant, eggs, chicken ham and sausages, or fluffy pancakes (S$9.20), both of which come with complimentary freshly-brewed coffee or tea.\xa0Keep an eye out for its many promotions, too, like its four daily fresh bakes for S$12 or S$9.80 tea time promotion that comes with a cake and coffee or tea. Now, who says cafe food has to be pricey?Tower 3, 02-606/607\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (11am to 9pm) You may know Big Fish Small Fish Cafe for its fish, but did you know the cafe also serves up a sizeable brunch menu on weekends? Originating from the ‘ulu’ Punggol East as a container shop, Big Fish Small Fish has now gone big, branching into several high-traffic malls locally, Suntec City included.\xa0Its Suntec City store is particularly special, as it is the brand’s first café concept in Singapore.Its brunch menu was recently introduced in February and provides diners with food options beyond its signature fish and crisps.\xa0There are brunch options for everyone, including the Big Breakfast Small Breakfast (S$19.40) with pancakes, breaded fish, chicken sausage and turkey bacon, and The Union Jack (S$16.40) with toasted brioche, chicken bratwurst, mushroom, turkey bacon and sunny-side-up eggs. There’s even a Singaporean-style breakfast called Taste of Singapore (S$13.90) with toasted brioche, kaya and butter, kueh bahulu and soft-boiled eggs.\xa0Tower 3, 02-615A\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (11am to 10pm) Modern Japanese cafe Cafe Usagi Tokyo has been capturing hearts and stomachs with its yummy and ’gram-worthy mochi ice cream, made in-house. Its Suntec City outlet, which opened only at the start of this year, is its first outpost in Singapore.\xa0The cafe’s name means ‘rabbit’ in Japanese and was so-named as the animal is a symbol of good fortune. If you’re a fan of Japanese desserts, matcha and hojicha, then you should definitely stop by Cafe Usagi Tokyo post-meal. Its matcha items have already garnered it some fans, but if you prefer something simpler, try its signature mochi ice cream (S$6).\xa0Tower 3, 02-605\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (11am to 10pm)\xa0If matcha doesn’t quite catch your fancy, how about Japanese-style fruit tarts at Fruit Paradise? You may have walked past this chain restaurant before and spotted its rows and rows of brightly-coloured fruit tarts that are brimming with the freshest and juiciest fruits.\xa0Despite its fruity nature, its tarts and cakes aren’t as cloyingly sweet as you’d imagine, as Fruit Paradise just uses lightly sweetened cream for its tarts and relies mainly on the fruits themselves to provide flavour to its desserts.\xa0They also have a daily lunch promotion from Monday to Friday, where fulfilling portions of Japanese dishes such as the beef curry rice and Oyako chicken udon go for S$10.90 — a steal with rising food costs all around. If I were you, I’d save on the food so I can splurge more on desserts. Or just have desserts for lunch. Whichever catches your fancy.\xa0\xa0\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHawker Hustlers: Hipster hawker Ray Yeo of Bei-Ing Dimsum Club on reinventing dim sum and his love for all things Japan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTower 3, 02-616\nOpen: Monday to Thursday (12pm to 9pm), Friday to Sunday (12pm to 9.30pm) If you’re wondering just what makes Hollin’s bubble tea so good, it’s probably its handmade pearls, crafted fresh daily, and the fresh milk it uses in its signature drinks such as its rock salt macchiatos. The bubble tea store was started by a group of young Taiwanese tea specialists, so you can be sure of its quali-tea, if you catch my drift.\xa0Because Hollin switches up its handmade pearls daily, you’ll never be bored even if you drink bubble tea every day. Some crowd favourites include rock salt (served on Fridays) and honey pearls (offered every day). Despite the quality of its ingredients, Hollin’s teas remain relatively affordable, priced between S$3 to S$5.20 excluding toppings. Tower 3, 02-616A\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (10am to 10pm)\xa0Every chocolate lover in Singapore probably knows about Chocolate Origin by now – the homegrown brand has been serving up cocoa treats for more than a decade, since 2011. This store features a unique collaboration with the CacaoCat brand, which serves up premium Hokkaido chocolate. What this means is you’d get chocolate treats galore, bonbons and a staggering 12 gelato flavours.\xa0As a chocolate lover, we love that Chocolate Origin has chocolate desserts in almost every permutation – truffles, bonbons, cakes, ice cream, tarts, cakes, and even as a drinking version. The fact that its Suntec City outlet also comes with a small but much-needed seating area also means you can while the whole afternoon away having your fill of every chocolate dessert imaginable.\xa0Tower 3, 02-603\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (11am to 10pm)\xa0Yakiniku Like, a Japanese restaurant specialising in Yakiniku, first captured eyeballs when it opened in Singapore in 2020 for its solo-dining concept, where solo diners can have their individual grills for an indulgent experience.\xa0Beyond that, we also love that Yakiniku Like is fast on service (three minutes is its promise) and prioritises a fuss-free, smell-free experience with its smokeless grills. I don’t know about you, but it sounds perfect for those days when you might be craving a quick barbeque lunch before heading back into the office.\xa0If you’re feeling like you need a pick-me-up, here’s a bonus: Yakiniku Like is having an ongoing promotion that’s not-to-be-missed. You get 50% off every second Sapporo beer from 3pm onwards on weekdays (excluding public holidays)!\xa0Tower 3, 02-601A\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (11am to 10pm) \xa0First established in 2009, Dessert First has developed a steady stream of fans who love its fresh, yet affordable, desserts. It has a highly extensive menu that runs the gamut from traditional local desserts such as cheng tng (S$5.80) to snow ice and even waffles.\xa0If you don’t wish to wait in the heat at its Liang Seah Street store, head to its new one at Suntec City.

You can get mains for S$30 and below.Save this cheap date restaurants list for your next dating-app escapade:\xa066 Kampong Bugis, 01-01\nOpen: Thursday and Friday (5.30pm to 11pm), Saturday and Sunday (11.30am to 11pm)Why visit? This idyllic al fresco-only hideout is enveloped by lush greens and tasteful bohemian-chic fittings, complete with fairy lights. That’s why it’s one of our top picks for affordable romantic restaurants when we’re searching for an appropriate spot that provides a tasteful setting for a reasonable price.Located in a little cul-de-sac off the main road at Lavender, the space makes you feel like you’ve been spirited overseas to a Balinese villa. It’s the kind of quaint and charming restaurant that will quickly dazzle your companion if you’re on a first date.Price range: $$$Crowd favourites: Raw Kitchen Bar’s culinary style can be vaguely described as Balinese-fusion, with familiar Asian flavours pervading the menu. Signatures include the black mamba (S$25), an intoxicating smoke-laden squid ink fried rice. The warung pork ribs (from S$28) dish is a solid option if you don’t have time for a weekend sojourn to Bali.123 Tyrwhitt Road\nOpen: Tuesday and Wednesday (6pm to 10.30pm), Thursday and Sunday (12pm to 3pm, 6pm to 10.30pm), Friday and Saturday (12pm to 3pm, 6pm to 11.30pm)Why visit? Thai food doesn’t usually come up when you’re thinking of a romantic restaurant to bring someone on a date. Yes, Thai eateries are usually hole-in-the-wall types that focus more on the food than on the ambience (in fact, we’re of the opinion that the more dingy it is, the more authentic it is!), but don’t be too quick to write this off. Hue at Bendemeer is too gorgeous not to give it a chance.Hue’s space is elegantly minimalist. The marble tabletops, hues of neon lights, and whimsical overhanging floral arrangements help set the mood for a romantic date.Price range: $$$Crowd favourites: Hue’s style of contemporary Thai cuisine adds an elevating touch to classic comfort dishes, Inspired twists include the Not a Tom Yum (S$21), a hot and spicy soup with charred seafood paired with crispy omelette, and the Niu Yolk (S$28), a Thai-style beef tartare paired with toasted baguette.15 Duxton Hill\nOpen: Monday (5pm to 11pm), Tuesday to Thursday (11.30am to 11pm), Friday and Saturday (11.30am to 12.30am)Why visit? Nobody else in Singapore does convivial Mexican dining quite like the Super Loco Group, known for its stable of popular Mexican joints that also include Lucha Loco and Chico Loco. Its Duxton Hill outfit Lucha Loco in particular is a vibe in itself, and a great place for a romantic meal for two.Its vibrantly decorated al fresco area — made even more festive with its lines of fairy lights and techni-coloured banners — will make you feel like you’ve been thrown into a Mexican backyard fiesta. If you’re a fan of waterfront views, both Super Loco restaurants are equally stunning spots for a romantic date!Price range: $$Crowd favourites: Though messy tacos and burritos do not exactly scream “romantic first date restaurant”, we argue that the food is great for a memorable third or fourth date after you’re more comfortable with each other.\xa0It helps that it has a diverse range of tacos — get a little bit of everything to share, from the signature baja fish (S$11) to the luscious chorizo and beef brisket (S$10)61 Tanjong Pagar Road\nOpen: Monday and Tuesday (6pm to 10.30pm), Wednesday (6pm to 12am), Thursday to Saturday (11.45am to 2.30pm, 6pm to 12am), Sunday (11.45am to 2.30pm, 6pm to 10.30pm)Why visit? What else says “romantic date night” than a delightful night at a steakhouse? While The Feather Blade isn’t your traditional white-linen-covered steakhouse, the sleek modern decor more than makes up for it.It’s one of the rare places in Singapore where you can get a decently executed steak without breaking the bank, making for a affordable date night restaurant, unless you decide to cook at home — if you have the culinary nous, that is.Price range: $$Crowd favourites: Heavily inspired by the world-famous Flat Iron steakhouse in London, The Feather Blade utilises the feather blade or flat iron cut, increasingly seen as a good alternative to more expensive cuts. It’s nicely marbled with lots of beefy flavours. The result? A succulent and juicy steak for just S$24, only a tad steeper than what some casual dining spots are offering. If you wish, there are also burgers and rice bowls here.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50% off at picturesque date spots, including Wildseed Cafe at The Alkaff Mansion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHawker Hustlers: Hipster hawker Ray Yeo of Bei-Ing Dimsum Club on reinventing dim sum and his love for all things Japan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiple outlets islandwide\xa0\nOpen: Operating hours vary across storesWhy visit? This might already be on your list of your date night ideas, but not everyone knows that the popular Drunken Farmer concept has recently rebranded into a new concept with a new menu. It’s now known as the Common Man Night Shift.Don’t worry, there’s no change in management — this has always been Common Man Coffee Roasters’ after-hours alter ego, the rebrand just makes it more official now. Fans can still expect the same iconic neon lights and whimsical ambience when you reserve a table at this natural-wine-focused restaurant for your next romantic date night.Price range: $$Crowd favourites: The revamp sees the introduction of certain new specials on the menu. Popular newcomers include the one-of-a-kind cacio e pepe udon pasta (S$24).\xa0Still, those who’d been to Drunken Farmer will know it’s sacrilege to leave without trying its delectably airy sourdough pizzas (from S$18) and addictive fried chicken karaage (S$22), served with a side of kimchi mayo.Palais Renaissance, 01-03, 390 Orchard Road\nOpen: Tuesday to Saturday (8am to 12am), Sunday and Monday (8am to 11pm)Why visit? Most cafe hoppers in Singapore would have visited Merci Marcel at least once. The brand, known for its rustic French-inspired fare, has multiple outlets that offer some of the most picturesque brunch options in Singapore.However, one outlet in particular stands out, for it’s a spot conducive both for a romantic date night and a lazy brunch — the chic Palais Renaissance store. It presents you with a great view of the bustling Orchard Road as you tuck into its delightful dishes, making it a romantic yet affordable date night restaurant.\xa0Price range: $$$Crowd favourites: There is no lack of hearty French classics on Merci Marcel’s menu, but an imperative order is the unique ravioles de royans (from S$20) — tiny dumplings that are stuffed with silky cheese and bathed in a deluge of cream sauce.7 Binjai Park\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (12pm to 2.30pm, 5.30pm to 10pm)Why visit? Opened by the prolific Les Amis group, Lino is one of the best spots for a no-frills Italian meal on a budget.Besides its solid slew of contemporary Italian dishes, the quiet Binjai Park shophouse is also enveloped in a cosy, serene atmosphere — we imagine this restaurant will be a pristine date spot for you to get to know your romantic interest well.Price range: $$$Crowd favourites: A safe choice for any date would be the burrata pizza (S$30) that’s adorned with a burrata in its centre, which can then be split open to reveal a glut of velvety cheese. If you’re craving for pasta instead, Lino also fires up some decent pasta dishes, such as the beef short rib fettuccine (S$29).Oasis Terraces, 01-04, 681 Punggol Drive\xa0\nOpen: Sunday to Thursday (8.30am to 9.30pm), Friday and Saturday (8.30am to 10pm)Why visit?

Pro tip: Anna’s is halal-certified, too.Price range: $$Crowd favourites: Anna’s may be a sourdough specialist, but that doesn’t mean it offers solely bread and pastries. In fact, what makes Anna’s so unique is its selection of handmade sourdough pasta and pizza.We can’t imagine a better way to spend time with your romantic partner than slurping up some restaurant-quality margherita pizza (S$24) or umami carbonara pasta (S$22).All restaurants mentioned in this article are on the GrabFood delivery service and offer free delivery (up to S$3 off) with GrabUnlimited.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/bulgogi-syo-woodleigh/:['If you live in the Woodleigh or Bidadari estate, chances are you would have come across the new neighbourhood mall and its hot new entrant, Bulgogi Syo at The Woodleigh Mall.For those familiar with Korean cuisine, you might associate the term bulgogi with the marinated Korean barbecued beef dish, often served up in a large pan.\xa0In Bulgogi Syo’s case, it’s more than just marinated Korean barbecued meats.Bulgogi Syo gets its name from the Korean words for fire (bul), meat (gogi), and show or experience (syo). As you would expect, it promises you a literal fiery barbecued meat experience.A post shared by HungryGoWhere (@hungrygowhere)A special three-step process — sear, torch and flambe — is used to cook its quality cuts of meat. This elevates the dishes beyond the usual smokey, slightly charred flavours you get at most Korean barbecue restaurants.\xa0The brainchild of chef Chul Park of Korean brand Seorae, Bulgogi Syo made its debut in Singapore on April 9 at Bugis Junction.\xa0Building off the warm reception at Bulgogi Syo in Bugis, its second outlet opened exactly a month later on May 9 at The Woodleigh Mall. And it’s conveniently connected to Woodleigh MRT station, too.Perhaps it has something to do with Bulgogi Syo’s affordable four-course lunch deals starting from S$12.90, or that everyone is just curious about this new fiery concept.\xa0Despite being open for barely two weeks, Bulgogi Syo at The Woodleigh Mall was already drawing a long line when HungryGoWhere visited before its doors opened for lunch at 11.30am.\xa0So, if you’re at Bulgogi Syo for the show or syo, here are two things to take note of.\xa0First, the first two steps — searing the meat on its hot stone pans and torching it with impressive-looking blowtorch guns — happen solely in the kitchen. Only the flambe step takes place tableside.But its open-concept kitchen means you can sneak a peek at the action any time from within the restaurant or even outside the store.Second, only the Syo specials on Bulgogi Syo’s menu, such as its Angus beef tenderloin (S$35.90) and duroc pork belly (S$20.90), come with a flambe show, so make sure you order the right ones when you’re there.Beyond barbecued meats, you will spot noodle dishes on its menu, such as seafood jjampong (S$18.90, spicy Korean seafood noodle soup) and jjajangmyeon (S$14.90, noodles in black bean sauce). We hear it’s because they’re favourites of the Bulgogi Syo team.Be warned: The seafood jjampong is quite spicy, so you may want to order its Bong Bong beer set (S$9.90), to quench your thirst.This is a unique combination of two Korean beverages: Terra beer and Grape Bong Bong, a canned drink. The staff will even mix it at your table a la K-drama drinking style.\xa0If you’re looking for more unique Korean items, Bulgogi Syo also has a bacon kongnamul pancake or bacon bean sprout pancake (S$15.90) on its menu — a combination we haven’t quite seen in Korean pancakes, but it somehow works.\xa0If you’re saving that visit to Bulgogi Syo at The Woodleigh Mall for a special occasion or a birthday celebration, the restaurant also provides a free non-alcoholic tiramisu cake, complete with a sparkling candle.Now, combine all of these fiery elements and it’s guaranteed to make any celebration or meal at Bulgogi Syo pretty lit, quite literally.\xa0This was a hosted tasting.\xa0If you’re looking for more exciting Korean food concepts in Singapore, why not read more about Singapore’s first chicken-only Korean barbecue restaurant or Korea’s first BHC chicken outlet in Singapore?Book a ride to the new Bulgogi Syo at The Woodleigh Mall.\xa0The Woodleigh Mall, 01-33, 11 Bidadari Park Drive\nNearest MRT station: Woodleigh\nOpens: Monday to Sunday (11.30am to 10pm) The Woodleigh Mall, 01-33, 11 Bidadari Park Drive\nNearest MRT station: Woodleigh\nOpens: Monday to Sunday (11.30am to 10pm) AuthorSarah is constantly seeking out new coffee spots and cocktail bars around the world, and should probably drink more water while at it.© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/the-hainan-story-milo-menu/:['If we had to pick a national drink for Singapore, there’s no doubt that Milo would be neck and neck with other iconic classics such as kopi or teh. Singaporeans absolutely adore the rich and malty drink.If you’re one of its loyal fanatics, then The Hainan Story’s Made with Milo collaboration is just the sweet treat you need.Known for its nostalgic dishes that range from curry rice to swiss rolls, The Hainan Story is a concept that celebrates Hainanese cuisine while adding in its own modern twists.Teaming up with Nestle Professional, the restaurant has lined up a series of indulgent Milo items that are made even more nostalgic with the distinct taste of everybody’s favourite childhood drink.This collaboration will be the debut of the drink brand’s Made with Milo series, with future partnerships planned with other local restaurants.There will be four items featured in the limited-time collaboration with The Hainan Story, which will showcase a versatile range of items ranging from mains to desserts.Out of the bunch on The Hainan Story’s menu, the outlandish Made with Milo Hainanese crispy chicken cutlet (S$9.90) has to be the most intriguing. This one-of-a-kind dish stars The Hainan Story’s signature boneless chicken leg cutlet with a twist — it’s blanketed by a layer of Milo powder.We’re not sure how the sweet-savoury combination will turn out, but it’ll be interesting to see how the caramelised Milo powder can elevate the crispy cutlet, as well as its accompanying Hainanese barbecue sauce and French fries.According to a spokesperson, the team wanted to explore something “wild and more innovative” and they found that “the sweet richness of Milo powder surprisingly complements the tender and juicy savoury chicken cutlet”.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Junction Westgate opening with promos; will house 23 tenants, including new halal teppanyaki\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50% off at picturesque date spots, including Wildseed Cafe at The Alkaff Mansion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rest of The Hainan Story’s Made with Milo collection focuses on the sweeter side of the flavour spectrum.Sweet-toothed folks will definitely want to dive into the Made with Milo toast (S$2.20), where a slab of fluffy toast is slathered in condensed milk and Milo powder, or the indulgently malty Made with Milo swiss roll (S$3.70 per slice)But if you’re more of a fan of Milo as a beverage, The Hainan Story has also incorporated it into a Made with Milo Hainan Three Treasures (S$4.50), a mixed drink of coffee, tea and of course, Milo.All these items will be available from June 15 at all four The Hainan Story stores in Singapore.Hungry?

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/cat-in-the-hat-bakes/:['It’s 10am at the Golden Mile Food Centre and a small stall exudes a warm, inviting glow from its half-raised shutters.There’s a delicious smell of butter and fresh bakes in the air.\xa0Many stop by to take a peek and enquire about the pretty bakes in its glass display — still half-filled but slowly growing in quantity.But they have to wait.\xa0As the clock strikes half-past 10, Ellis Ng, 34, and her mother lift the shutters and push them all the way home.Cat in the Hat is open for business.The display case at this small hawker bakery, a viral sensation on TikTok since it opened in mid-March, shows off a myriad of upmarket bakes — scones, meringue tarts, financiers and more.On the weekend, if you’re lucky, you might get your hands on some caneles, too.Be warned — the Cat in the Hat’s desserts sell out fast, especially on weekends. After lunch, these treats are all but gone, and the shutters back down for the day.Ng started her career as a nurse at the Singapore General Hospital before making a career switch after five years, in 2012.She cut her teeth in the kitchens of hotels such as Shangri-La, Pan Pacific and the former Mandarin Orchard before leaving the industry last year.“I thought I would just give (F&B work) a shot, and it turns out it kind of suits me. I like the environment and being in the kitchen,” she recalls.A post shared by HungryGoWhere (@hungrygowhere)She then joined the National Environment Agency’s Incubation Stall Programme, which gives aspiring hawkers an opportunity to run incubation stalls and start a business.“I saw the programme and thought ‘why not?’ They subsidised the equipment upfront — they provided everything that you see here (in the stall), except the oven and the mixer. And they have rental subsidies, too, which I think is quite a good deal.”The agency even helped her to get the stall, she says.Ng roped in her mother, Selley Tan, 65.“She came out of retirement — she was bored at home,” Ng says. “She does the front-of-house, miscellaneous things, the finishing touches.”Which is why customers are greeted by a cheery aunty dishing up fresh bakes and boxing treats.What makes Ng’s bakes stand out? “They’re baked fresh every day, so they’re not kept overnight or anything. I would suggest you consume everything on the day itself,” she says.Each day, she rolls out nine types of bakes — and a tenth on weekends, the caneles. \n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Junction Westgate opening with promos; will house 23 tenants, including new halal teppanyaki\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHawker Hustlers: Hipster hawker Ray Yeo of Bei-Ing Dimsum Club on reinventing dim sum and his love for all things Japan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNg draws on her culinary experience, putting out tried-and-true flavour combinations that Singaporeans love. Most recently, she served a special carrot bundt cake for Easter.But the stall has a “production limit”, she says, laughing. “I’m the only one who’s doing the baking.”“Singaporeans like tarts, so we just decided to venture out to do tarts, and sell it at an affordable price.”Her favourites? The lemon meringue (S$3), chocolate ganache (S$2.50) and roasted pecan tarts (S$2.80).”I know most cafes sell (lemon meringue tarts) for S$8, S$9, but my tarts are smaller.“I wanted to keep them bite-sized, so you don’t get too jelak (sick of eating), and then you don’t feel like eating anymore. I think this size is reasonable — two, three bites.”Thus far, Cat in the Hat counts among its customers younger patrons who hear about it via social media and word of mouth, as well as older folk who are curious about the queue and its offerings.“We get the normal reviews (for our bakes) — some people say it’s not sour enough, some say it’s too sweet, some say it’s too expensive, others too cheap. This is very subjective,” she says. “You can’t please everyone.”Despite Cat in the Hat’s popularity, don’t pin your hopes on Ng extending its operating hours.“It’s the nature of the hawker centre,” she says.\xa0The Golden Mile Food Centre sees more of a lunch crowd, which disappears after the office-goers have had their fill. “It’s not exactly a morning market — maybe a lunch and brunch crowd. The crowd dies out around 2, 2.30pm.”But that means that Ng has work-life balance — working out in the gym and doing R&D for a new menu after hours.\xa0“The hours are not long — six to seven hours (a day), at most,” she adds.Book a ride to Cat in the Hat Bakes.For more stories on young hawkers, check out The Flying Pan and Nyonya Pok Pok Kay.Golden Mile Food Centre, 01-106, 505 Beach Road\nNearest MRT station: Nicoll Highway\nOpens: Tuesdays to Sundays (10.30am to 2.30pm, or until sold out)Golden Mile Food Centre, 01-106, 505 Beach Road\nNearest MRT station: Nicoll Highway\nOpens: Tuesdays to Sundays (10.30am to 2.30pm, or until sold out)AuthorJia-En has worn several hats in her career — first writing TV scripts, then food and lifestyle stories at Wine & Dine.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/le-matin-patisserie-ion-orchard/:["Nestled in a corner of Ion Orchard, Le Matin Patisserie offers a good selection of sweet and savoury creations by Chef Mohamed Al-Matin of Noma fame.\xa0The warm lighting in the patisserie creates a relaxing and welcoming ambiance. The pastries are beautifully displayed at the counter, beckoning to be savoured.There are three Le Matin Patisserie\xa0menus available — dine-in only brunch (available from Wednesdays to Sundays, 11am to 2.30pm), pastries (available all day), and desserts (available from Wednesdays to Sundays, 6pm to 9pm).A sweet memory of receiving my first box of Le Matin pastries as a gift during the circuit breaker still lingers in my mind. The exquisite kouign-amanns and irresistible cruffins left a lasting impression.\xa0Witnessing the progression of Le Matin (French for “the morning”) from its humble beginnings as an online bakery to a physical shop in the heart of the city makes me really happy.Chef Matin’s journey did not come easy. In the early days, fuelled by his passion for sweets and determination to own his own pastry shop, he enrolled in Le Cordon Bleu in Sydney. While studying, he sent out countless resumes to the best places, hoping they would hire him.It paid off: He worked alongside renowned chefs, including Adriano Zumbo (Adriano Zumbo Patisserie), Christopher The (Black Star Pastry), Andre Chiang (Restaurant Andre) and of course, René Redzepi from the top-rated Noma, before deciding to take the plunge and open his own shop.\xa0At the start, he worked out of his friends’ kitchens, and after two pop-up locations, he finally opened Le Matin Patisserie at Ion Orchard in February.It’s undeniable that Chef Matin’s stints have helped inspire the unique niche of pastries at Le Matin Patisserie. While his training is in fine-dining, he hopes his bistro can deliver a cosy and quintessential French experience to diners.Love it! I am delighted to find that the pastries at Le Matin evoked the fond memories of my first encounter and even surpassed them.The savoury pastries stood out, in particular. They showcased the creativity and thoughtfulness in ingredient combination, resulting in some unique and interesting creations.Although they come at a higher price point, the quality and experience make them worth every cent. I find myself looking forward to returning and trying other dishes that I did not have space in my stomach for, such as the wagyu brioche feuilletée, and the wagyu and bone marrow roll. I would also love to try the items on its desserts menu, which were unavailable during my visit.At first glance, the seafood pot pie (S$24), with its bird’s nest-like appearance, looked peculiar. Little did I know that it was holding a captivating nest of seafood wonders.Nestled beneath a delicate puff pastry crust, the curated selection of seafood was a perfect medley of flavours. It’s not too “seafoody”, and each element contributed harmoniously to the ensemble.\xa0Surprisingly, the simple addition of fresh dill elevated this creation to new heights. It acted as a refreshing palate cleanser, enhancing the overall dining experience. This was definitely a “do not judge a book by its cover” moment. Chef Matin’s signature bake, the kouign-amann (S$7.50), has earned its place as one of the bakery’s bestsellers.\xa0It certainly did not disappoint — the flaky pastry was sweet and crispy with a caramelised finish, and the interior revealed a soft and fluffy texture accompanied by a satisfyingly chewy sensation. It is undoubtedly one of the better kouign-amanns Singapore has to offer.The smoked cruffin (S$10), too, stood out in the crowd. Aside from its visual appeal, I ordered it as I was curious to find out how the combination of applewood-smoked vanilla custard and eucalyptus meringue would work.The eucalyptus aroma and flavour were surprisingly delicate, pairing well with the subtle hint of\xa0 perfectly cooked bacon within the smokiness of the custard. The creation revealed the depth of Chef Matin’s creativity.The signature summer truffle scrambled eggs croissant (S$32) is a dish I was dying to try. What is there not to like about a round croissant that resembles a burger that’s lavishly paired with 8g of truffle, buttery scrambled eggs and truffle paste?While the components were executed well — the eggs well-cooked, the pastry warm and flaky — I found myself expecting more. The truffle did not really come through, and overall the dish tasted mild. Regrettably, the amalgamation of flavours fell short of the visual promise.As I understand, a previous version involved black truffle instead of summer truffle. Perhaps the black truffle was a better choice in bringing together all the flavours more cohesively.The kombu tart (S$9) came with a kombu shortcrust, kombu white chocolate, cardamom toffee and brulee, candied ginger, and lemongrass curd.It was unlike any other tarts I have ever tasted before. There was an intriguing fusion of tastes with a robust presence of cardamom and ginger, which might not appeal to all palates. I am uncertain whether I will order it again.Sidetrack: I was a little surprised at the one-hour dining limit. Although the staff did not chase us away at the hour mark, they were standing close to our table, making us feel the subtle pressure to finish up and go.Is it conducive to conversation? Yes.Is a reservation necessary? Recommended, especially on weekends.How to get there?

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/atas-butter/:['There’s a small space among the shophouses of South Bridge Road where you’ll find Daryl Yeo.\xa0The 36-year-old former developer and computer science graduate now spends his days making atas butter. It’s not the run-of-the-mill type you’d find in your kaya toast, but rather, cultured butter that’s more at home among the French Alps than it is in sunny Singapore. More along the lines of Bordier instead of SCS, if you get our drift. Atas Butter, as Yeo’s business is called, encapsulates it perfectly — elevated yet distinctively Singaporean.The surroundings are equally fitting. The Singapore heat of late has been humid and enervating, with curious passers-by peeking through the glass window to watch Yeo mix his wares by hand. All this happens amid the rush and heave of Chinatown’s streets.Yeo’s workspace is kept especially cold — it feels more like a walk-in freezer than a shop — to keep his ingredients and butter at their optimal temperatures in our sweltering heat.It’s an intensive process that takes him pretty much the whole week to put out Atas Butter’s seven signature flavours — salted, unsalted, kombu, mala, gula melaka, smoked and yuzu — for an expanding group of regulars.Says Yeo: “Cultured butter is European or French butter — like Bordier butter. When we eat it, it’s a bit tangy, like sourdough. Whereas American and SCS butter — these are not cultured butter — it’s sweet.”Yeo studied at the Carnegie Mellon University in the United States, thanks to a Singapore government scholarship. He says: “I did the whole computer science thing before it was cool. I worked in San Francisco before coming back to Singapore to serve my bond with a telecommunications company called Hoiio.”\n\nFor 15 years, he jumped around a few startups — first as a developer, then as a product manager.“Over time, it just got to a point where I became burnt out and tired of the space,” recalls Yeo. “Plus, with Covid-19, working from home was not very good for my mental health as well.“So I decided maybe it was time to try something new.”After discussions with his wife, a doctor, he left his startup job in February 2022 to try his hand at starting a business.Butter wasn’t his first venture, though.\xa0“I tried some tech stuff initially, which didn’t work. I was getting a bit frustrated at the time,” he recalls.It took a trip to Tasmania in mid-2022 to strike buttery gold. “I was very inspired by the farmers and producers there — they had the best produce.”Adds Yeo: “We went to oyster farms, truffle farms, and just ate the freshest food. It was an amazing experience to meet people who are proud of what they do and happy with the value they bring into the world.”“I thought: ‘What can I bring back from this trip? Maybe I can do something with my hands’.”Artisanal butter in Singapore is a rarity.There are restaurants here that make their own butter as part of their menu and sell it on the side, but they don’t do it full-time, says Yeo.Upon his return, he started experimenting and making his own with the help of YouTube videos.\xa0But this was no cinch, he says. A lot of the advice he received online had their origins in temperate countries, where butter does not melt easily. When he tried it here, he found that the heat sped up the fermentation process and he had to figure out what worked by trial and error.He started to sell his artisanal butter at pop-up markets in October 2022 and quickly found fans.“Frankly, I didn’t know what I was doing, but it sold out,” says Yeo. “I was doing markets every week. It was very intense because I was making the butter during the week and selling it on weekends.”At the time, Atas Butter was a home-based business and Yeo wasn’t sure where the business would go. \n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Feuds: Saizeriya vs Milan Shokudo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“It wasn’t enough to make me really consider doing this as a thing,” Yeo continues. “My home was packed with cream. I couldn’t cook and my fridge was full.”His sojourn at the three-day Boutique Fairs market in November 2022 was the tipping point. “It blew us away. It was super crowded and very good for us.” A post shared by Atas Butter (@atasbutter)Heartened by the reception, Yeo took a leap of faith and leased the space on South Bridge Road. “Rent was affordable. The space is small but enough for a one-man operation. We moved in February, and here we are.”Yeo counts his wife among his strongest supporters. “She helps me ideate and keeps me in check when I’m tired. She also helps me with my spreadsheets (for planning and orders).”Besides that, he’s grateful for the warmth towards his atas butter.“In a way, I feel like this business has been crowdfunded by everyone, because I won’t be here (on South Bridge Road) if they didn’t pre-order the butter and provide cashflow for the renovations,” he says.\xa0“Every dollar — it’s not mine, it’s almost like a donation.”At present, Yeo makes 250 slabs of butter — 50g each — to fulfil his weekly pre-orders.He first cultures cream — imported from the United Kingdom — into creme fraiche, a process that takes 24 to 48 hours, before churning it to separate butter from buttermilk.Cold water is used to wash the butter thoroughly to remove excess buttermilk. Yeo then paddles it by hand to remove air, water and excess buttermilk; this also enhances its flavour.He mixes in the flavours at this stage, before hand-wrapping each slab in brown paper.The entire process takes several days and is incredibly labour-intensive.As someone who knows the butter inside out, how is it best eaten? “A nice, warm, white sourdough loaf. But not too sour,” he says.Bread and crackers are a good bet, but he recommends pairing the yuzu butter with some nice shokupan (Japanese milk bread).\xa0It’s also great for cooking. The kombu butter and mala butter go well with seafood, while the smoked butter pairs well with steak. If ever in doubt, Yeo has a set of handy recipes on his Instagram page for inspiration.Yeo finds himself having to turn away many walk-in customers who are intrigued by his offerings.Scaling up is, indeed, a challenge. Yeo simply does not have the capacity to make large amounts of butter right now, but he hopes to do so in the future.He also has his eye on a new coffee butter recipe.He has also worked with Prepped, a homegrown company that creates fuss-free meal-preparation kits, on a special series ahead of Mother’s Day.A post shared by Atas Butter (@atasbutter)If you’re hoping to get your hands on some Atas Butter, the waitlist is a month long.Book a ride to Atas Butter, but note it is by appointment only.227 South Bridge Road, 01-02\nNearest MRT station: Telok Ayer\nOpening hours: By appointment only227 South Bridge Road, 01-02\nNearest MRT station: Telok Ayer\nOpening hours: By appointment onlyAuthorJia-En has worn several hats in her career — first writing TV scripts, then food and lifestyle stories at Wine & Dine.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/synthesis-bar/:['Suntec City’s newest tenant has attracted many confused gazes from passers-by. Its storefront is reminiscent of a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) shop and medical hall, with vintage adornments (think dark oak cabinets and shelves filled with apothecary glass jars) and rustic wooden finishing, complete with an oriental signboard.\xa0There’s even the musky aroma of Chinese herbs, thanks to the motley of herbs on display.If you’ve been bewildered by the sight of this old-school addition to a modern shopping mall, you’re not alone. Surprise — it’s not actually a TCM hall, as realistic as it looks (and smells).The shop’s lifelike medicine drawers are not, in fact, all drawers either. One segment serves as a door — it slides open to reveal a secret neon-lit passageway that leads you into the swanky main area of a speakeasy, Synthesis.Recently opened in February, Synthesis is a creative new concept by Sebastian Ang, also the brains behind the wildly viral Mama Diam — a whimsical gastrobar that pays homage to the mama shops that many of us grew up with.Like the tenets of TCM, Synthesis hopes to strike a balance between Singapore’s time-honoured traditions and modernity, while providing a sensorial experience.Take the secret entrance, which welcomes diners with a flourish through its breathtaking shophouse alleyway that’s lit with a captivating array of neon lights and lanterns.Once you enter the main dining area, it’s a whole other ambience altogether. The space is posh and intimate, exuding chic modernity with just slight touches of tradition. You can spot elements of metal, wood, water, fire and earth through striking fixtures, such as its shiny ripple-textured roof.A post shared by HungryGoWhere (@hungrygowhere)\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50% off at picturesque date spots, including Wildseed Cafe at The Alkaff Mansion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe menu at Synthesis focuses mostly on reimagining local classics or incorporating head chef Ezekiel Tan’s favourite nostalgic flavours into elevated spins.A good example of that is the “Xia Hua” charcoal youtiao (S$18), a prawn-paste-stuffed youtiao (Chinese fried dough) that reminds one of the beloved rojak dish, as well as the snow crab chawanmushi (S$22) that playfully riffs on the three-egg formula, combining custardy steamed egg with ikura and salted egg.One of the more audacious reimaginings has to be the laksa prawn tartare (S$22) that features prawn tartare, Pringles potato chips, and a housemade laksa gelato that boasts intoxicating laksa aromatics.Besides that, there’s also the flavourful pani puri with cold assam curry (S$22), a crispy hollow Indian street snack that’s filled with a robust mix of lemongrass cream and cured Atlantic salmon.Synthesis also has pasta aficionados covered, with an array of creatively tweaked pasta classics including the glazed pork satay bee hoon (S$28) and “suan pan zi” truffle carbonara (S$30).Gnocchi lovers would enjoy the latter, as the chewy and bouncy Hakka abacus seeds mimics the texture of pan-fried gnocchi. This was a standout dish, showcasing complex textures and a moreishly creamy truffle carbonara sauce.The nourishment that people typically associate with TCM can also be peeped through certain dishes such as the sakura chicken herbal “pao fan” poached rice (S$24).Instead of the usual seafood broth, this dish features wholesome herbal pork collagen soup that sublimely accentuates the components of grilled chicken, umami rice, puffed rice, herbal fritters, and egg floss — a comforting dish that’ll help with those hangovers.Sometimes, the simplest childhood treats make the best desserts. Synthesis tugs on the heartstrings here with its quirky “ice-cream sandwich” that was another highlight of the meal.The rainbow bread sandwich (S$6) is simple. Diners are given a choice between the flavours of herbal peppermint or honey osmanthus, which are rested upon toasted rainbow bread that remains gratifyingly crunchy throughout.The food is the main focus here, but the gastrobar also provides an array of unique cocktails for anyone in need of a drink.\xa0There’s the refreshing roselle gin highball (S$22) and sweet basilicious kaya (S$24) for those who aren’t extremely keen on liquor, while those who prefer something punchier can go for the unique goji-roni (S$24) that injects a touch of goji sweetness into the classic negroni.While such an ambitious concept runs the risk of becoming a gimmicky, style-over-substance experience, Synthesis is as smoothly and tastefully executed as they come.Book a ride to this cool hidden bar.Suntec City Tower 4, 01-643, 6 Temasek Boulevard\nNearest MRT station: Promenade\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (4pm to 11pm)Suntec City Tower 4, 01-643, 6 Temasek Boulevard\nNearest MRT station: Promenade\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (4pm to 11pm)AuthorEvan started off writing about food on Instagram, before joining outlets such as Buro and Confirm Good to pursue his passion.

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/best-kopi-singapore/:['For many of us, coffee serves an essential role in our lives. Some need the caffeine to survive the midday slump, while others just enjoy the unrivalled comfort of a warm cuppa to start the day.While fancy lattes and flat whites are nice, the fierce kick from a cup of kopi (traditional Singapore coffee) is just what you need sometimes.\xa0What makes kopi in Singapore\xa0different is the roasting process, which sees robusta beans — instead of the more nuanced arabica beans usually used in Western coffee — roasted in margarine or butter for that extra caramelisation.The coffee grounds are then traditionally filtered through a sock — quite unlike Western cuppas that go through espresso machines or coffee drippers.If you need a perk-me-up, your best bet is a slightly acidic and full-bodied cuppa (kopi c gah dai, anyone?) from the nearby hawker centre or coffee shop.But with the proliferation of specialty coffee places and fancy cafes in Singapore, the bar for coffee, local or otherwise, has never been higher. We’re now seeing a slew of young hawkers and cafe owners venturing out of the box and putting their own elevated spin on the beloved classic.\xa0Curious what a cup of “atas kopi” would taste like? Read on to find out where you can go for the best kopi in Singapore your next coffee session.\xa0Amoy Street Food Centre, 02-78, 7 Maxwell Road\xa0\nOpen: Monday to Friday (7.30am to 2.30pm)Hong Lim Food Centre, 02-41, 531A Upper Cross Street\nOpen: Monday to Friday (7.30am to 2.30pm)Market Street Food Centre, 02-21, 50 Market Street\nOpen: Monday to Friday (7.30am to 2.30pm)Why visit? Coffee Break is one of the more well-known “new-age” kopi stalls in Singapore. It’s a third-generation business run by a group of young siblings who have decided to add an unusual modern twist to their menu — a move that has made the brand a social media sensation.While it started off at Amoy Street Food Centre, Coffee Break has since expanded to a outlets at Hong Lim Food Centre and Market Street Food Centre.Price range: $Crowd favourites: What’s the best companion for kopi? Kaya toast, of course. Coffee Break serves up a crunchy traditional toast (S$3), but also offers an array of flavoured toasts (S$3.50), such as earl grey creme toast and black sesame butter toast.\xa0Beverage-wise, the simple kopi (S$1.60) won’t go wrong, but you can also opt for the more quirky flavoured kopi (choose from flavours such as almond and hazelnut, S$3.20). If you’re feeling more bougie, get the flavoured lattes (S$4), with unique options such as pumpkin spice and pistachio.Various outlets across Singapore\nOpen: Operating hours vary across outletsWhy visit? With eight outlets scattered throughout Singapore, you’d probably have noticed Kopifellas at many different hawker centres and shopping centres, each with its own long queue.Not only is it a dependable spot for hearty cups of traditional Nanyang coffee, the popular franchise has also become a beloved spot for trendy drinks such as milk tea. Fun fact: It is one of the vendors that set up shop at the swanky Urban Hawker concept in New York City.Price range: $Crowd favourites: The menu varies across stores, but popular staples include non-coffee favourites such as Thai green milk tea (from S$3.10) and yuzu green tea (from S$3.30). Of course, if you’re looking for simplicity, then get the signature kopi (from S$1.60).Golden Mile Food Centre, B1-49, 505 Beach Road\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (10.30am to 4pm)Why visit? Found in the basement of Golden Mile Food Centre, Kopi More is one of those #iykyk hidden gems that have amassed quite a cult following. It often boasts long queues, fequently made up of regulars.The hawker stall started in 2016 and has since become known for its punchy blend of robusta and arabica beans, which are made into cups of fragrant kopi using a modern espresso machine for a truly elevated cuppa.Price range: $Crowd favourites: This stall keeps its menu lean and simple, you won’t find newfangled concoctions such as pumpkin spice lattes here — just pick between the hot coffee (S$2.40) and iced coffee (S$2.70), depending on your preference or mood.Raffles Hotel Arcade, 01-13, 328 North Bridge Road\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (9am to 6pm)Why visit? Kopi served in a fancy cafe at Raffles Hotel? That’s not something most people would expect, but Singapore Coffee is a rather unique establishment that prides itself on sourcing the finest coffee beans from around the region, roasting them in Singapore, and then creating one-of-a-kind beverages.Some might call it a tourist attraction, but there are few places where you can indulge in a cup of kopi while munching on luxe croissant sandwiches and desserts such as tiramisu.Price range: $$Crowd favourites: This hotel cafe endeavours to elevate and bring forward the best local coffee in Singapore. The result of these efforts are original creations such as the creamy kopi shake (S$14) served in a coupe glass, and the refreshing frozen kopi (S$16), an ice-blended drink that’s topped with whipped cream and gula melaka caramel.Online delivery serviceWhy visit? We’ve all seen the slew of online cold brew delivery services pop up during the pandemic. But what about cold brew kopi? Kopiboy makes its signature cold brew from robusta beans instead.The drink is completed with condensed milk and evaporated milk so you are ensured authenticity, but better yet, you can have it siew dai by selecting the “less sweet” option. Kopi peng from the fridge whenever you’re craving it?

Generation Coffee, a charming hawker concept run by ex-baristas, offers the best of both worlds to all coffee lovers.\xa0As its name suggests, it bridges the gap between different generations, serving up both old-school kopi and trendy specialty coffee at the same location, and at an affordable price.Price range: $Crowd favourites: Priced from S$1.40, the kopi options here are pretty worth their while. There’s even a nifty bubble tea-style sugar level meter — just in case you need to verify what “siew dai” (less sweet) or “gah dai” (more sweet) mean.The selection is equally affordable even if specialty coffee is more your beat.

The storied Russo-Hainanese restaurant is unquestionably one of Orchard Road’s most iconic fixtures, having been in operation for over 30 years.Its Hainanese ties also means Shashlik puts emphasis on its coffee — you can expect it to brew up rustic cups of Hainanese kopi while also incorporating pyrotechnics into its flaming coffee cocktails.Price range: $$Crowd favourites: There are plenty of legendary dishes on Shashlik’s food menu, such as the majestic bombe alaska. However, if you’re a coffee aficionado, the Shashlik kopi (S$4) or signature coffee-based flaming cocktails (S$22) might have more allure.Available in Russian or Irish, you’d be treated to a flamboyant performance where the coffee cocktails will be flambeed with either vodka or Irish whisky, depending on your choice of poison.Various outlets across Singapore\nOpen: Operating hours vary across outletsWhy visit?

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/level33-smoked-beer/:['It was a welcome accident that led to whisky being distilled from leftover beer malts in the 13th century. And true to its medieval times, most of the malts were dried over an open wood flame. However, in the turn of the 18th century, kilning malt over wood was replaced with indirect heat that the industrialist of that era and beer drinkers of today have indulged.LeVel 33’s brewmaster, Mr Christian Knoch has chosen to time travel back to that era with the release of the 33.8 smoked beer \xa0– \xa0a homage to the traditions that many believed to have ceased to exist.Only a few breweries in the world practice the same fiery method.\xa0 Brewpubs in Bamberg, Germany: Schlenkerla and Spezial – which still operates today – and others such as Moku Moku brewery in Honshu, Japan and the De Molen brewery in the Netherlands offer their blend of smoky flavoured brews.The 33.8 smoked beer, priced from S$9.88 to S$18.33, encapsulates all the flavours that come from a flame-dried malt. 30% of the recipe comprises smoked malt roasted over beech wood, and offers honey notes from the choice of malt and hops, and of course, the smoky nose.With its sweetness and an ABV of 4.8, LeVel 33’s latest brew pairs ideally with its Jamon iberico — Spanish baby back ribs marinated with 33.3 stout and maple glaze.Knoch will also be participating in the World Gourmet Summit on April 29 at LeVel 33.

While the restaurant offers air-conditioned seating indoors, we found the al fresco area hard to resist. We didn’t regret our choice; dining right next to the Singapore River and getting to people-watch at the same time was a nice experience.More importantly, of course, we’d go back to Octapas because we like the food there. Located at Clarke Quay, the restaurant specialises in cold and hot bite-size finger food (or tapas).Of the dishes we tried, our favourites are the toasted bread topped with aubergine, peppers and cheese (S$9), pan-fried snapper with romesco sauce (S$15.50) and minced chicken stuffed in roasted piquillo peppers (S$14). The secret to the moreish snapper dish was the fresh fish and a mouthwatering sauce made from a blend of ground almonds, pine nuts, roasted garlic and red bell peppers, with just the right amount of red wine to lift the flavour.01-08, River Valley Road\nNearest MRT station: Clarke Quay\nOpen:\xa0Monday to Thursday (4pm to 2am), Friday (4pm to 3am), Saturday (12pm to 3am), Sunday (12pm to 2am)01-08, River Valley Road\nNearest MRT station: Clarke Quay\nOpen:\xa0Monday to Thursday (4pm to 2am), Friday (4pm to 3am), Saturday (12pm to 3am), Sunday (12pm to 2am)Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/food-little-india-singapore/:['French food, modern vegetarian cuisine and Spanish tapas would have been unheard of in Little India a few years ago.But fast forward to end-2008, and you’ll find an influx of such seemingly out-of-place cafes, restaurants and pubs infiltrating the Little India enclave.The appearance of non-traditional businesses in the area started with the many backpacker hostels, such as Prince of Wales and The InnCrowd Backpacker’s Hostel. Then, the bars, Western-styled cafes and even restaurants started following. And two years on, many of these outlets are not only surviving, they’re flourishing.French diner The Black Sheep Cafe and Spanish tapas bar Zsofi Tapas Bar now operate among well known Indian restaurants such as vegetarian outlet Komala Vilas and Banana Leaf Apolo, which is famed for its fish head curry.Together, the food and beverage outlets attract an eclectic mix of ethnic Indians — the traditional clientele of the area — and an increasing flow of tourists and other locals keen to discover more of the enclave.The area’s proximity to the city centre helps to bring more visitors, according to the owner of The Black Sheep Cafe, Chef R Rathakrishnan.“We were in Seletar previously and many of my customers came from places such as Holland Village or the East, so it was better for me to move to somewhere more central.“Fortunately, good word of mouth has created a natural flow of clients comprising a good mix of both expatriates and locals,” he said.The manager of modern vegetarian cafe 7 Sensations agreed: “Little India is a vibrant and interesting place. Many Indians are vegetarian, and although there are many vegetarian restaurants around, we want to offer a different interpretation.”Other business owners in Little India and its vicinity welcome the minor transformation.Chong Ruo Yun, owner of Drop Inn backpacker’s hostel on Lavender Street said: “Personally, I think the addition of these outlets add to the vibrancy of the area. Little India is not at risk of losing its charm because there are still many very authentic Indian shops and businesses around.“Setting up in the Little India area has been a huge plus point for my hostel as backpackers generally like to explore areas with a lot of culture and character.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/friends-kitchen-hk/:['Frequent travellers to Hong Kong will know: A walk along its busy streets is not complete without the tantalising smells of food assailing you from all sides. We’re talking about everything from fried meat to French toast and Hong Kong egg tarts.\xa0Well, congrats, if your nose caught a whiff of these aromas, you’ve probably found Hong Kong’s ubiquitous eatery, the cha chaan teng.You could say these small teahouses encompass the culinary history and culture of Hong Kong.\xa0Hungry locals, expats, and tourists alike patronise them for a cheap and quick fusion meal, which uses ingredients and techniques inspired by both the East and the West. It’s a meal that fills both bellies and hearts.Friends Kitchen HK is the second outlet of another Hong Kong-inspired eatery, Friends Cafe HK, in Nee Soon’s Springside Walk.\xa0Like its older brother, the place looks like a replica of a casual Hong Kong eatery, from the tiled walls and wooden booth seats to the old-school clocks and glass soft drink bottles, complete with old Cantonese songs playing in the background.This is a great place to dine at if you want to get a taste of Hong Kong’s unique culinary culture, whether you’ve actually been to the neon city or not.\xa0The staff are helpful and friendly, and the food is above average, with a sizeable menu of snacks, rice sets, toasts, and noodles.Granted, prices are a little higher than average, but you’re paying for quality and, ahem, the rent in this pricey neighbourhood.Melted cheese, pork chop, and fried rice — the baked pork chop rice (S$14) is pure comfort, coated in a sweet tangy tomato sauce and cheese that’s gooey and almost bubbling when served.\xa0The sauce seeps into the rice as it bakes and the bone-in pork chop, while slightly difficult to eat because of the bone, is savoury and tender. There are chunks of pineapple in this, making the whole thing incredibly delicious. There’s a beef brisket beef ball hor fun (S$14) with a big beefy soup to rival the best pho or Thai beef noodle soup. Expect silky-smooth rice noodles and succulent beef balls that are springy to the bite.\xa0The brisket is extremely tender and — I don’t say this often — quite literally melts in your mouth. The dish is divine.\xa0The char siew and egg rice (S$12) is hardly the most pretty thing on Friends Kitchen HK’s menu, but it’s easy to forget all that with my first bite. This simple fare of scrambled eggs, roasted pork and rice has long been served to low wage earners and well-off entrepreneurs alike, because it’s quick, filling and simply scrumptious.\xa0The soy-seasoned runny and fluffy layered eggs are the focal point, accompanied with juicy pieces of honeyed barbecued pork. It’s so rich in texture and flavour that you might just find yourself on the verge of tears.If you’ve ever tried authentic curry fish balls (S$5.60), you’ll know that Hong Kong curry is different from the Chinese curry we’re used to in Singapore. It’s bold, fragrant, fiery, and plain addictive. The balls themselves are fried with a bouncy texture that hugs the curry extra tight.The weather’s been terrible lately, so the urge to cool down with a sweet, icy beverage was real. The red bean ice with milk (S$4.60) is actually a drink commonly found at cha chaan tengs — a refreshing combination of sweetened adzuki beans, evaporated milk and ice.\xa0Granted, the ones in Hong Kong typically use crushed ice, but this is still a cold, creamy, and most importantly, tasty drink. There’s also an option to add a big scoop of vanilla ice cream. Are bolo buns the lifeblood of every cha chaan teng? The ones here are… okay. It checks off the right boxes of being lightly sweet and buttery, but falls short with the characteristic cookie cracked crust, which could be crispier and crumblier.The insides are also a tad dense, and I expected better from a bun that costs S$5.60.With more than 70 dishes at Friends Kitchen HK, it’s quite impossible to try them all without coming back with an army. I’ll be back for its zi-char-style dishes (think fried clams with black bean sauce and salt and pepper pork chop) and good ol’ toasts, but judging from what I’ve sampled, all of us are in good hands.Is it conducive to conversation? Not if you have secrets to share. In true Hong Kong fashion, tables are packed tightly together.Is a reservation necessary? First come, first served!How to get there? Friends Kitchen HK is right opposite Exit 3 of Maxwell MRT station. Look out for the sign that says “78” along the row of heritage shophouses.HungryGoWhere paid for its meal at this restaurant for this review. Still hungry?

Senbei is a crispy cracker made from roasted rice, and it reminds me of my favourite childhood snack — kerupuk from Indonesia!Unlike kerupuk, senbei comes in both sweet and savoury flavours. Zarame senbei is the sweet version — it’s covered with coarse sugar crystals. It’s sweet, but still retains a hint of soy saltiness similar to other senbeis, so it’s a nice balance.There is a stall along Ninenzaka in Higashiyama district in Kyoto that sells it for 120 yen (S$1.20).\xa045 Saga Tenryuji Susukinobaba-cho, Ukyo Ward, Kyoto, 616-8385, JapanYudofu is one of the specialties in Kyoto, and a must-try if you’re a tofu lover like me.\xa0Conveniently located near Arashiyama bamboo forest, Yudofu Sagano is one of the best places to have it!

I know there are plenty of other good foods in Japan, but onigiri is my first love and I’ll never get over it.\xa0It is also really easy to get because konbinis are everywhere in Japan.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/tastiest-healthy-oat-milk/:['Dairy alternatives in the form of plant milk have been sprouting up quickly in recent years — in particular oat milk.\xa0Swedish-based oat milk brand Oatly raised US$200 million (S$279 million) in equity investments in 2020 (including from celebrities such as Oprah Winfrey) while homegrown brand Oatside, which launched only early this year, raised a cool S$22 million pre-launch.As someone who loves her lattes but has a stomach that doesn’t agree with dairy or soy, the introduction of almond milk and oat milk to our cafe scene has been a welcome reprieve.\xa0I’ve grown to love oat milk for its fuller body, maltier taste and creamier texture so much that I’d rather forgo my coffee than switch to an alternative at this point.\xa0Head roaster at Bread & Butter by XY, Muhd Nabihan, 26, agrees. He prefers to use oat milk for his coffee, since it produces a more wholesome taste. His oat milk brand of choice for his current set of coffee beans at the cafe is Oatly, for its rich creamy texture. I’ve yet to arrive at a favourite oat milk brand. Yet. But it does raise the question — with so many oat milk brands in the market, which is the tastiest, and perhaps more important to some, is it healthy?\xa0\xa0For the uninitiated, oat milk is a type of plant milk made by first soaking oats in water, blending the mixture and straining the liquid to get rid of the oat pulp.\xa0As it’s plant-based, oat milk is dairy-free and has been touted not only as a dairy alternative for the lactose-intolerant, but as a more environmentally friendly option as it uses a lot less water to produce, compared with dairy, soy and almond milk.Walk into any supermarket and you’ll easily find at least two or three different oat milk brands on display. Online retailers also stock a good variety.\xa0\xa0\xa0Former Singapore General Hospital dietitian Anna Lim, 29, says that while oats are not a naturally rich source of calcium, oat milk can be a part of a healthy diet. This is because most brands (such as those selected for this story) fortify their milk with calcium and sometimes vitamins.There are also fats added during processing from unsaturated plant oils, which do not adversely affect cholesterol levels.“However, it doesn’t necessarily mean it is healthier than dairy or other alternatives, as much of this depends on what other ingredients manufacturers add to their oat milk,” cautions Lim, who’s now the lead clinical dietitian at Pulse TCM.Those looking to add oat milk to your post-workout protein shake for the gains may do well to note that it tends to have significantly less protein per serving — less than 30 per cent, Lim notes — than cow’s milk, which typically has about 7g per 200ml serving.\xa0Also, despite being easier on the stomach for the lactose-intolerant, consuming too much oat milk may still cause bloating or discomfort, if you’re sensitive to the soluble fibre in the beta-glucan in the oats.\xa0While we’d love to try all the oat milk out there, we narrowed it down to the six most common brands in supermarkets or online retailers. Our final contenders were Minor Figures, Oatly, Oatside, Otis, Pacific, and UFC.\xa0We first drank the oat milk on their own, and then had each of them with a Nespresso Inspirazione Venezia pod, which is generally aromatic, light on acidity and has a hint of bitterness.\xa0In true HungryGoWhere critics’ review style, we give you the low-down on what we loved and what we didn’t for each oat milk brand.\xa0Arguably the most “famous” of all oat milks we tried, we had high hopes for Minor Figures, given that we often see it stocked on the shelves of trendy cafes.Unfortunately, it didn’t work well with us on all fronts — on its own, when frothed, and in coffee. Its taste was unremarkable and the consistency felt more like oat water than oat milk. It also produced the least microfoam out of all six brands.Try Minor Figures if… you need a dairy alternative but prefer one with a milder, understated taste.\xa0Next to Minor Figures, Oatly is the next most common oat milk brand we see in Singapore cafes — and we can see why.\xa0On its own, Oatly definitely had an oaty albeit grainy taste. Its microfoam was thick and stood well. When taken with coffee, you could still taste the oats, though the coffee definitely features more prominently.\xa0Try Oatly if… you like your coffee with a hint of oat and a good amount of foam.\xa0\xa0I’ve friends who swear by Oatside and stock up on dozens of it at a time, so I had high expectations for this one.We loved the creamy texture of Oatside and the unmistakable malty taste of the brand’s Australian oats. If anything, we found the milk a tad sweet but figured cow’s milk also has a tinge of sweetness to it at times. It also frothed beautifully, similar to Oatly, which was to be expected given the creaminess of the milk.Try Oatside if… you enjoy some creaminess to your coffee and don’t mind additional mild sweetness.\xa0\xa0The true underdog and the unanimous favourite for our team, Otis tasted incredibly full and malty on its own — perhaps on account of the fresh Kiwi oats in its milk.It was also evident when we poured the milk in a glass — Otis had a clear golden-brown hue that was more apparent than the others. There was some froth, too, though not very much.\xa0Taken with coffee, it made a wholesome drink that was an instant pick-me-up. Both the oat milk and coffee were prominent, and neither overshadowed the other.Try Otis if… you like your oat milk and coffee malty, but still want to be able to taste the coffee beans.\xa0\xa0\xa0While we don’t see this used much in cafes, we thought to give Pacific Foods’ oat milk a go, as we saw it stocked across several supermarkets we frequented.Surprisingly, this didn’t fare too badly. On its own, it had a decent consistency and hints of oat — though there was a slightly chalky taste. It foamed well, though the microfoam had larger air bubbles than the others. Taste-wise, it wasn’t particularly memorable, but we didn’t hate it either.Try Pacific Foods if… you need a quick oat milk fix and aren’t too fussed about the fullness of the milk.\xa0\xa0Another brand we commonly saw online and didn’t have much expectation for was UFC’s oat milk. The milk tasted a tad too sweet, slightly medicinal and lacked oatiness.If it’s any consolation, it foamed decently, though when taken with coffee, it had a strange aftertaste that somewhat reminded us of almond milk, rather than oat milk.Try UFC if… you’ve no other oat milk options and really need some to tide you through the day.\xa0You can order oat milk on GrabMart.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/bkk-bistro-bar/:['Yishun is a much-maligned area of Singapore that’s dubbed by many as “the crazy hood”, as the internet became rife with memes and stories of its outlandish happenings.While some reports are indeed questionable, there’s one thing that’s indisputable — the endless queues that regularly form outside Orto’s BKK Bistro & Bar are veritably insane.Orto, which opened in 2014, is one of Singapore’s most popular hangout spots. It drew in crowds of residents who looked to indulge themselves in a multitude of activities that ranged from prawning, trampolines and, of course, 80-cent Thai boat noodles.But if you haven’t heard the sad news yet, the beloved leisure park will be vacating its Yishun premises at the end of June.\xa0The lights at the famous BKK Bistro & Bar will stay on until June 25 so loyal customers can head down for one last hurrah.While several other tenants have already moved into Orto’s new home at the West Coast, BKK Bistro & Bar will not be following its brethren.Instead, the popular supper spot has recently opened a new outlet near Bendemeer, ahead of its flagship’s impending closure.\xa0Operation hours are tweaked here. It closes earlier but also — finally — opens for lunch at 12pm.Thai food lovers can rest easy: BKK Bistro & Bar is keeping the legendary 80-cent Orto boat noodles alive — although it will no longer be associated with the leisure park.The noodles are served in small bowls as per tradition, where the delicacy is served on boats and portions are kept small to prevent spillage on choppy waters.Each bowl can be customised to your liking, with choices between glass or rice noodles and red tom yum or herb boat noodle soup, along with a myriad of toppings that include prawn, beef ball, pork liver and more.If you don’t feel like waiting for multiple orders of small bowls to hit the table, there are also more sizable alternatives such as the medium (S$7.80) and supersize (S$20.80), which includes all toppings.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50% off at picturesque date spots, including Wildseed Cafe at The Alkaff Mansion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHawker Hustlers: Hipster hawker Ray Yeo of Bei-Ing Dimsum Club on reinventing dim sum and his love for all things Japan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBesides its signature item, BKK Bistro & Bar also serves up an array of homely and authentic Thai dishes including a slew of brand-new exclusives to the Kallang outlet.This includes the familiar Thai street chicken rice (S$9.80), rich braised pork rice (S$9.80) and saucy green curry pork collar rice (S$10.80).BKK Bistro & Bar’s menu also boasts a motley of hearty sides to complement the carb-loaded mains, such as Thai fish cake (S$8.80), grilled cheese skewers (S$10.80 for four) and piquant Thai papaya salad (S$8.80).As with any Thai restaurant, BKK Bistro & Bar offers a diverse selection of sweet treats, with various classic desserts including rainbow sticky rice ball with fresh mango slices (S$9.80) and red ruby with coconut ice cream (S$7.80)\xa0Diners can quench their thirst there with delectable Thai beverages such as iced milk tea (from S$4.80), green iced milk tea (S$4.80) and iced milk coffee (from S$4.80).BKK Bistro & Bar is also working on a new outlet in Woodlands, so those living in the north of Singapore don’t have to worry about missing out on their favourite boat noodles for too long.For more ideas on what to eat, read our articles on the most hyped-up and photogenic seaside restaurant and places for authentic Hong Kong cha chaan teng vibes.BKK Bistro & Bar is on the GrabFood delivery service and offers free delivery (up to S$3 off) with GrabUnlimited.\xa0Book a ride to the BKK Bistro & Bar Orto outlet before its last day on June 25, or to the new BKK Bistro & Bar Kallang Bahru outlet thereafter.Orto, 01-09A, 81 Lorong Chencharu\nNearest MRT station: Khatib\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (5pm to 2am) — last day on June 25Spaze, 01-05, 202 Kallang Bahru\xa0\nNearest MRT stations: Bendemeer and Boon Keng\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (12pm to 11pm)Orto, 01-09A, 81 Lorong Chencharu\nNearest MRT station: Khatib\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (5pm to 2am) — last day on June 25Spaze, 01-05, 202 Kallang Bahru\xa0\nNearest MRT stations: Bendemeer and Boon Keng\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (12pm to 11pm)AuthorEvan started off writing about food on Instagram, before joining outlets such as Buro and Confirm Good to pursue his passion.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/house-of-bao/:['The soft, pillowy bao (or bun) found itself at the centre of a resurgence in the late 2000s when David Chang put one on the menu at Momofuku.\xa0A derivative of the kong bak pau from Fujian in China, where the bun is filled with a thick cut of braised pork belly, the bao was catapulted into Western consciousness and hasn’t left it ever since.\xa0While a tad late to the game, House of Bao is a hole-in-the-wall cafe at the sleepy Alexandra Central mall in Singapore offering its versions of savoury and sweet buns with a touch of local flavour.\xa0 Opened in January, House of Bao has a surprisingly long history.\xa0\xa0The brand is an attempt by the third generation of bao makers to introduce their soft bao to a younger audience.\xa0Inspired by East-meets-West and Singapore flavours, House of Bao operates both as an online and brick-and-mortar business.\xa0The family business began in 1970 in Perak, Malaysia, selling a smaller range of — and more traditional — types of buns, such as plain mantou and red bean bao.\xa0As the business grew, it expanded into a wholesaler called Taiping Bao, which, at present, functions as the umbrella company for the brand. Conceptually, House of Bao’s bao-gers are a decent attempt at modernising the traditional with its take on Singaporean favourites, such as chilli crab or nasi lemak (the latter, a promotional item when we visited).While the brick-and-mortar store affords diners plated dishes that are best eaten on the spot, not much has been done in terms of decor to enliven the place.\xa0There is a bit of a disconnect between the contemporary cafe-style food and drinks offered and the ascetic interior furnished with wobbly tables and wooden stools. \xa0True to its claim, the buns are particularly soft and fluffy. We opted for the breakfast set, which comes with two traditional baos with coffee or tea (S$5.90).We could choose from any of the five flavours — red bean, pandan, white lotus, sweet peanut and plain mantou — and decided on pandan as well as sweet peanut. The latter, we’re told, is a crowd favourite. The same traditional baos are also sold frozen via its online store.\xa0While the pandan bao had an equally soft pandan-flavoured lotus paste in its centre, the sweet peanut filling was dry and not as palatable.Another item worth trying is its ice cream bao (S$7.90), a tie-up with local independent ice-cream makers JuzScooop.During our visit, House of Bao had a one-for-one promotion, so we went for the sea salt caramel almond and earl grey & fig ice-cream flavours.\xa0Sandwiched between two halves of a mini fried mantou, the crisp, deep-fried bread lent a nice textural contrast to the ice cream.\xa0We did, however, wish the ice cream had a stronger taste, as both the sea salt caramel almond and earl grey & fig were so subtle in flavour that neither stood out.\xa0 On the savoury front, the crab krab bao (S$14.90) is House of Bao’s interpretation of the Singaporean chilli-crab dish with a fried soft-shell crab, chilli-crab sauce and lettuce.\xa0The soft-shell crab was rather flattened and greasy. The crustacean’s soft shell tasted as it should but lacked the crisp I was looking forward to, and the chilli sauce could have been more piquant.\xa0As with all orders of bao-gers, it came with a side of criss-cut fries that were nothing to shout about either.We also got the chicken bao (S$9.90) as a set with a cup of ice choco (for an extra S$3).\xa0The chicken, although tender, had a darker-than-usual outer layer, a sign that it might’ve been left in the oil for too long. It also tasted overly spiced.\xa0Our ice choco was mildly sweetened and tasted more milky than chocolatey — not the rich chocolate beverage we were expecting. We also got a Gryphon osmanthus sencha (S$4.50), which helped wash down all the fried food.\xa0The bao-gers are made to order, which meant a 10-minute wait. While we were waiting, my dining companion mentioned that it would’ve been a better idea to serve us our drinks first. Is it conducive to conversation? There’s no loud music, but given that space is really tight, you may want to save private conversation for elsewhere.Is a reservation necessary? Walk-ins only! Do note that there isn’t a lot of seating space, so groups bigger than four may prefer to take away.\xa0\xa0How to get there? Take bus services 33 or 120 from Redhill MRT station.\xa0Things to note:\xa0HungryGoWhere paid for its meal at this eatery for this review. Still hungry?

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/food-for-thought/:['Much like the original outlet on North Bridge Road, the Food for Thought at Queen Street still retains the same signature personal touch that has won the hearts of many.inSing.com talks to executive chef David Heng about his venture and why he took the road less travelled.My mum and grandmother have always been big on food and they were my inspiration. Food has always been homecooked, fresh from the market and prepared simply, traditionally, and at times, tediously. I grew up watching them in the kitchen, though I was usually chased out for making a mess or for pinching the food before dinner was served.I studied information communication and technology at Ngee Ann Polytechnic and was offered a place at NTU. The plan was to finish up National Service, where I was already doing programming, and walk the safe route of going to university.Just before entering university, I had some time on my hands and thought of giving cooking a try. I wrote to chef Julien Bompard at one of the top French restaurants, St Julien, asking for an apprenticeship. Chef Julien graciously took me in and that was when it hit me that I wanted to become a chef. Compared with staring at computer screens and reading programming codes, I much preferred filleting fish and shucking oysters (the French way).My parents, however, didn’t take it too well. Dad sat me down and advised me to consider it carefully. Mum, on the other hand, gave me the cold shoulder for almost three months! I have always had a pretty close relationship with Mum, and it was pretty bad not being able to talk to her.During this time, I researched on the pros and cons of the F&B industry, as well as its pitfalls and sacrifices. When my parents realised I was truly committed, they gave me their blessings and the opportunity to study at Le Cordon Bleu in Sydney. Mum even bought me a Chinese cleaver to send me on my way!After graduating and working in Sydney, I came back determined to prove my worth. Seeking out the best restaurants to work my way up, I was in constant pursuit of culinary perfection. After a while, that drive just didn’t seem right. The satisfaction didn’t last, and it felt rather empty. I realised then I didn’t have the desire to cook a perfect dish, but rather to feed good food to people.It was at that time that I was introduced to a few like-minded teachers who were planning on setting up a cafe just below the school they were running. All of us had the desire to give back to the community as we have received so much from many people throughout the years. We wanted a cafe that would run just like any sustainable business but have 10% of our profits given back to the community, much like tithing.Food for Thought made me rethink my position as a cook and as a person, and I realised it all boils down to people and relationships. People remember good experiences and times shared with loved ones. It’s really encouraging to see how many of our guests end up becoming our close friends. Some even work for us now! I think this is how things should be. We should naturally be nice to each other, to give what we have, when we can.Think of the original branch as a casual, home-style cafe and the new outlet at Queen Street more like a bistro with more cooking abilities. The atmosphere at the cafe is as it has always been — cosy, quaint and very intimate. The bistro at 8Q is much bigger, yet still feels comfortable even when it is packed on a cool evening.There are quite a bit of differences in the menu. We wanted to keep the cafe unique, with its own style of rustic sandwiches, pizzas and mains. The dishes stayed the way they are — wholesome and generous. The bistro moved up a notch and we’ve got a team of chefs here, so we have the chance to prepare all our cakes, desserts, breads and food. It’s a little more refined, with a wider spread of food, but still a no-frills kind of approach. There’s also a range of beer and wine available.Our menus are designed with the local palate in mind. We use fresh local produce to evoke a familiarity in taste and approach it with European techniques. We serve brunch daily from 9am to 5.30pm. Pancakes are one of the must-tries even though they take a good 10-15-minute wait as they are cooked to order. There are various fillings to select from as well, topped with our homemade gula melaka syrup (a local twist to maple syrup) and a dollop of freshly whipped cream.I could go on and on about every single dish, but I would strongly urge you to try them yourself.In a nutshell, it was a little community project that Food for Thought, together with its sister company School of Thought, collaborated to feed a couple of orphanages over Christmas lunch. If you were to look carefully, there are little notes in a number of the jars. We asked the kids to write down their dreams and wishes for Christmas and did a lucky draw to fulfil some of their wishes as Christmas gifts. The rest were placed in the jars as a form of reminder of what we do here at Food for Thought.Food for Thought is primarily run as a sustainable business, with 10% of our profits given back to the society. We also strive to bring about awareness as money will never be enough, but it is through the education of people that we can make a difference. We actively hold events for each of our causes and try to build a like-minded community.We contribute mainly to World Vision.Go for it! Live the dream and be prepared for a lot of hard work. Do your calculations carefully, know the sacrifices you have to make and what your purpose is. If it is for the money, don’t do restaurants. If it is for serving people, go for it. Stay humble. No man is an island, so ask for help when you need it.There are so many of them! There was one comment, though, that a Caucasian guest said to me that I will never forget. He had the creamy sausage potato chowder that I had cooked as the soup of the week and said it tasted just like how his mum used to cook it back home.It’s my desire to cook personally for my guests — to evoke an emotion or a memory. In this case, it was of a very dear person to him, his mother, and it reminded him of home when he travelled to Singapore. That was the biggest moment for me as a cook.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/my-korean-moms-kimchi-restaurant-west-coast/:['If you were one of those who thrived on side dishes and kimbap (rice rolls) from My Korean Mom’s Kimchi during the depths of the pandemic, you’d get to enjoy these dishes and more at its first restaurant at NEWest Mall along West Coast Drive from Sept 30.\xa0The home-based business started in November 2020 by pure happenstance.\xa0Mother and son Mrs Kim, 64, and SJ, 33, had just moved into their Tampines condominium and wanted to do something for the community during the tough Covid times.\xa0They asked HungryGoWhere not to use their full names for privacy reasons.\xa0\xa0The Kim family enjoyed making kimchi. So they whipped up 100 servings of kimchi and kimbap, and gave them to their neighbours for free.\xa0The response was overwhelmingly positive, with their neighbours urging them to start a home-based business.My Korean Mom’s Kimchi was thus born.\xa0\xa0As we sit down with mother and son over a hearty lunch at their brand-new store (“our dream place”, they tell us), the duo are visibly excited about bringing affordable and authentic Korean food to the masses through their new restaurant.Mrs Kim, who had about two decades of F&B experience in Singapore before starting My Korean Mom’s Kimchi, says: “We wanted to introduce more Korean dishes to (our customers), but due to the limitations of a home kitchen, we were unable to do so effectively and that really made us sad. We knew in order to present more Korean dishes, we needed to expand.”Based on its present online menu, a roll of kimbap starts from S$8.90 for its regular or vegetarian option, and the costliest item is a four-cheese army stew, which is priced at an affordable S$30 and feeds two to three.SJ, who ran his own businesses before starting the brand with his mother, assures us that prices at the restaurant will be exactly the same as what you’d pay online, with the exception of service charge.Customers will order via a self-service ordering kiosk before they are ushered to a seat, where food will be served to them.On why it opted to keep prices low despite moving into a brick-and-mortar store, SJ said: “We want to provide authentic, real Korean food, similar to the price and quality found in Korea. (Despite inflation), our response is not to increase prices but to value-add to our customers… and be there for them when they’ve a K-food craving.” In the same vein of keeping costs low, its first store is simple and quaint albeit inviting, with an Instagrammable neon-pink MKMK sign and a floor-to-ceiling backdrop of Seoul’s famous Bukchon Hanok village, with Namsan Tower peeking out in the background.\xa0\xa0My Korean Mom’s Kimchi prides itself on serving food with “omma sonmat”, which in Korean refers to the unique taste of food from someone’s touch, care and experience. In this case, it is a mother’s, or Mrs Kim’s, loving hands that have given its dishes their edge.Having lived in eastern Singapore, my dining companion and I are no strangers to the brand and have tried its kimbap and other dishes through group buys in our respective estates.Getting to savour the dishes in person, however, with the Korean Mom herself, was different. We could feel the duo’s sincerity and generosity in every bite. The kimbap rolls (from S$8.90) were so full of ingredients that the rice formed just a thin layer around the ingredients.\xa0Even its stews such as sundubu jjigae or spicy soft tofu stew (S$12.90) and four-cheese army stew (S$30) were laden with ingredients. We’re sure it wasn’t just because HungryGoWhere was there on a visit, as we received similar portions when we were anonymous group buyers.Both of us loved the dakgangjeong – sweet-and-sour fried chicken (S$12), commonly found as a street snack in Korea but not as often seen in Singapore.\xa0The chicken chunks were juicy, crispy and well-coated with My Korean Mom’s Kimchi’s version of soy garlic sauce. The eatery also tops the dish with sunflower seeds — a first for us — adding extra crunch to each mouthful.\xa0Having our lunch in the middle of a hot day, the mul naengmyeon with beef (S$12.50) — cold noodles — was also a welcome relief. The soup was flavourful, the beef well-seasoned, and the dish was topped with lots of cucumber and radish, so you get a bit of everything. SJ tells us every sauce that goes into its dishes is handmade.As a result, you’ll find the stews, for example, are a little sweeter and less spicy than what you might find in Korea. That’s because the taste is tailored to Singaporeans’ preferences and feedback. But despite the difference, my companion and I felt that the dishes were by no means any less authentic.For now, SJ and his mother want to keep up with My Korean Mom’s Kimchi’s online orders while getting the new restaurant running. That’s good news for its fans living in other parts of Singapore, who might find the trek to NEWest mall arduous.Mother and son are also ready to continue sharing their love of Korean food with more people. “We’ve plans to open another one in the east if we find a suitable location,” says Mrs Kim.\xa0But from Sept 30, if your Korean food craving hits, you can swing by its restaurant at NEWest mall (01-71) for a dose of authentic and affordable Korean food or order some online.\xa0EDITOR’S NOTE: This article has been updated to reflect the restaurant’s new opening date.\xa0Book a ride to My Korean Mom’s Kimchi (opens on Sept 30, 2022).NEWest mall, 01-71, 1 West Coast Drive\nNearest MRT station: Clementi\xa0\nOpen (from Sept 30, 2022): Tuesday to Sunday (11.30am to 2.30pm, 5.30pm to 9pm — last order at 8pm)NEWest mall, 01-71, 1 West Coast Drive\nNearest MRT station: Clementi\xa0\nOpen (from Sept 30, 2022): Tuesday to Sunday (11.30am to 2.30pm, 5.30pm to 9pm — last order at 8pm)AuthorSarah is constantly seeking out new coffee spots and cocktail bars around the world, and should probably drink more water while at it.© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/marmalade-pantry-anchorpoint/:['If you’re popping by Ikea Alexandra to check out its anniversary sales, make a pit stop at Anchorpoint, a small shopping mall nearby that’s quietly becoming the next big foodie enclave.(If you check out Anchorpoint’s Instagram page, it has cheekily described itself as “that mall across Ikea” in its bio.)The mall has been undergoing some redevelopment of late, and has gained several trendy new occupants such as Overbrod, Tiong Bahru Bakery, Acai Brothers and Anagram Coffee.Joining the fray this May is the Marmalade Pantry’s Anchorpoint outpost, the brand’s latest.To mark the occasion, diners can treat themselves to floral afternoon tea sets (U.P. S$78 for two) — now part of a one-for-one promotion — so that a party of four can be comfortably fed. This applies until the end of May, excluding May 13 and 14.There are also other gifts up for grabs until Aug 6, depending on your minimum spending. These include a scones-and-jam gift set — comprising four buttermilk scones and two housemade jams — with a minimum spending of S$50, while higher spends of S$80 and S$120 can net you chic bags of various designs and sizes.To be eligible for these offers, diners have to pay with Mastercard.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTalad Thai Banana opens at AMK Hub with S$2 opening promotion for the first 100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by HungryGoWhere (@hungrygowhere)Promos and gifts aside, there’s plenty to enjoy about the new Anchorpoint bistro.Diners have a choice of sitting within the 28-seat cafe area, or its “al fresco” — named as such because it resides within the mall’s airy central atrium rather than outdoors.New outlet exclusives have also been crafted for the occasion, and will be available until Aug 31.One such dish is the tortilla with mesclun salad (S$16), a moreish, eggy dish. Instead of the more common Mexican version that’s often used as a wrap or flatbread, The Marmalade Pantry’s rendition is cooked in the Spanish style. Thick and moist, the tortilla is filled with potato chunks, chorizo and caramelised onions, and is more akin to an omelette.For sharing, try the duck ragu pappardelle (S$30), which was enjoyable as well — a generously portioned dish with thick, carby ribbons of pasta and tender chunks of duck meat.Drinks-wise, be sure to get the Shimmering Gold Moscato — made with a special blend of Monogram Tea and sprinkles of edible gold dust — that is not only an excellent thirst-quencher, but also makes for quite the pretty picture.This was a hosted tasting.Check out the hottest tables around town with our updated list of new openings.The Marmalade Pantry (Anchorpoint) is on the GrabFood delivery service and offers free delivery (up to S$3 off) with GrabUnlimited.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/burger-king-plant-based-whopper/:['Regardless your dietary preferences, there’s a trending ingredient that’s probably worth a try — plant-based meat.The name often intrigues many people, especially those who wonder how “meat” made from plant sources can compare to meat from animals or cultivated from animal cells.\xa0Yet the response in Singapore has been good and we’ve seen plant-based protein make it onto several restaurants’ menus in recent years.The list of local adopters include a slew of artisanal burger joints and even Gordon Ramsay’s Bread Street Kitchen, as well as popular fast-food chain Burger King, which joined in with a plant-based twist on its signature Whopper burger in 2021.The plant-based Whopper burger is also the first plant-based burger offered by Burger King Singapore.\xa0Since it contains no beef, it is made to be suited for vegetarians and flexitarians, but will not be fit for vegan dietary restrictions, as the burger will contain mayonnaise.The Burger King plant-based burger comes with an alluring one-for-one promotion, exclusive to food delivery service GrabFood.From now until June 30, diners can grab two plant-based Whopper burgers at a promotional price of two for S$10.30 (U.P. two for $20.60).It promises the same iconic flame-grilled taste of the signature Whopper — but made with 0% meat and 100% real ingredients with no artificial colouring, flavouring or preservatives.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50% off at picturesque date spots, including Wildseed Cafe at The Alkaff Mansion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMcDonald’s x New Jeans: Limited-time sweet & spicy McCrispy, Korean fried chicken style\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrabFood teatime deals: 8 stores with up to S$6 off your afternoon snacks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA patty made from plants and sourced from The Vegetarian Butcher is used. It’s a well-known Dutch company focusing on animal-free “meat” — widely regarded as a more sustainable food source.But it still retains its irresistible smoky flavour, a result of Burger King flame-grilling it with the same method and grills.The recipe also remains the same, meaning that diners will be treated to the same iconic Whopper taste.That makes this dish a great option for people who are looking to reduce their meat consumption but still hoping to indulge in their iconic burgers.In true Burger King fashion, the plant-based Whopper patty is topped with freshly sliced onions, tomatoes and lettuce.It is then finished with creamy mayonnaise, ketchup and crunchy pickles before being smothered between two toasted sesame buns.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/koh-brother-pigs-organ-soup-tampines/:['Eastside fans of Koh Brother Pig’s Organ Soup will be glad to know that the well-loved, decades-old hawker stall — which was recognised yet again on the Michelin Bib Gourmand Singapore 2023 list just yesterday — has opened at a second location at Tampines Street 81.The store, which started as a pushcart in 1955, has been serving up wholesome portions of pig’s organ soup at Tiong Bahru Market. It has consistently been awarded the Michelin Bib Gourmand since 2019.\xa0Read about the full list of Michelin Bib Gourmand Singapore 2023 awardees.\xa0Third-generation owner Thomas Koh, 35, who is a former graphic designer, started helping out at the store in 2014 and took over from his parents in 2017.\xa0Keen to bring the delicacy to a wider audience, Koh opened a standalone stall called The Pig Organ Soup at Maxwell Food Centre in 2022 with two business partners.\xa0A post shared by The Pig Organ Soup 猪朋什友猪什汤 (@thepigorgansoup)Unfortunately, Koh’s modern take on his family’s decades-old recipe didn’t quite fly with the Maxwell crowd and the store shuttered on March 19.\xa0\xa0“It was in the heat of the moment when I wanted to do this with my friends,” Koh said. “A lot of homework wasn’t being done.”\xa0For example, while Maxwell was a good location, the trio had failed to factor in a dearth of parking lots in the area around the hawker centre. The stall also saw less footfall when it rained and on weekends, too. This was especially due to its location in the Central Business District.\xa0Learning quickly from what worked and didn’t, Koh took those lessons and immediately shifted his focus onto his next step: Opening Koh Brother Pig’s Organ’s second store in Tampines on June 1.\xa0When asked why he selected Tampines, Koh said: “I realised that since there’s a lot of F&B establishments now, people don’t travel so far for food. Unlike during my grandparents’ time, where there were only seven hawker centres.”He started asking long-time customers where they lived, and realised a lot of them stayed in the east side of Singapore. It turned out that quite a few of them would make the trek all the way to Tiong Bahru for his wares, only to find popular items sold out.\xa0Koh regales an anecdote of a customer who was so excited that Koh Brother had opened in his Tampines neighbourhood that he visited three days in a row.\xa0With all this hype, we had to see what the buzz was about.First up, there’s the mainstay pig’s organ soup, comprising an assortment of liver, tripe, heart, intestines, meatballs, and lean meat served in a well-but-lightly-seasoned clear broth with salted vegetables (S$4.80 for small, S$6.80 for large).\xa0The soup had an extremely clean and light taste, and its organ parts similarly mild-tasting.\xa0For someone who loves organ soup for its texture rather than its notoriously gamey flavours, I couldn’t help but notice how well-cleaned the organs were. (They’re cleaned thrice and imported from Europe, Koh adds).\xa0Koh is also serving up new braised dishes at the Tampines spot. He hopes to appeal to a younger audience and differentiate the new outpost from its maiden Tiong Bahru outlet.\xa0Take your pick of braised innards – there’s big intestines (S$5), big intestine head (S$6), and powdery small intestines (S$5). Those who prefer the more standard offerings can choose from pig trotters (S$6), braised egg (S$1 each) and braised beancurd (from S$1).\xa0Unlike most traditional versions of pig trotter dishes, we appreciated that Koh’s version had the same gelatinous goodness with less fat. This is thanks to his meticulous selection of leaner parts.\xa0\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Junction Westgate opening with promos; will house 23 tenants, including new halal teppanyaki\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHawker Hustlers: Hipster hawker Ray Yeo of Bei-Ing Dimsum Club on reinventing dim sum and his love for all things Japan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCall us old souls but personally, we preferred the pig’s organ soup (with lots of fluffy white rice, no less) for its light taste. It made for a very satisfying lunch without being too cloying.\xa0But we can see how the braised dishes would appeal to a bigger dining group or those looking for something heartier and savoury.\xa0Koh says he wants to get the next generation to try pig’s organ soup and “to keep the heritage going”.\xa0He added: “Growing up as a millennial, you see a lot of things disappearing… A lot of young hawkers are not taking over traditional recipes. You see a lot of traditional dishes that require more hard work disappearing. Since I am given the recipe, I want to keep it (alive) as long as possible.”\xa0All in all, we’re glad that Koh’s Maxwell closure didn’t mark an end to his expansion efforts, but instead spurred him to double down on maintaining the heritage of this age-old traditional dish.\xa0Oh, and having a new Michelin Bib Gourmand option in the east is a nice benefit, too.This was a hosted tasting.For more food options, check out our guide on unique rice dumpling flavours to order and Hong Kong-style cafes in Singapore.\xa0Koh Brother Pig’s Organ Soup is on the GrabFood delivery service and offers free delivery (up to S$3 off) with GrabUnlimited.\xa0Book a ride to Koh Brother Pig’s Organ Soup’s Tampines and Tiong Bahru outlets now.\xa0824 Tampines Street 81, 01-38\nNearest MRT station: Tampines West\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (10am to 8.30pm)824 Tampines Street 81, 01-38\nNearest MRT station: Tampines West\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (10am to 8.30pm)AuthorSarah is constantly seeking out new coffee spots and cocktail bars around the world, and should probably drink more water while at it.© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/cinnabon-singapore/:['Move aside Shake Shack, Eggslut, and Mister Donut, the hottest new kid in town has just landed! We’re talking about famed American cinnamon roll chain, Cinnabon — its first Singapore outpost officially opened on Feb 9.The international chain was first established in Seattle in December 1985, and later went on to expand all over the US. Today, it has more than 1,200 locations in some 48 countries across the globe.Cinnabon’s foray into Singapore sees it taking up a cosy spot in the basement of Raffles City. It’s an intimate space with wood furnishings that can seat up to 20 customers.While its official opening is Feb 9, it had a soft launch on Feb 7.There’s just something about international brands that whips Singaporeans into a frenzy; many willingly queue for hours just to get their hands on the next trendy thing. And this famous brand is no exception.The first day saw lines starting from as early as 9am, two hours before the slated opening time.\xa0When HungryGoWhere visited the store during lunchtime on Feb 9, the queue situation was hectic. While the line outside the B1 shopfront looked manageable, it extended all the way to B2, where it stretched on into the distance.A post shared by HungryGoWhere (@hungrygowhere)That said, cinnamon roll fiends might be willing to brave the crowd just to get their hands on an iconic Tiffany-blue box of decadent buns, especially with the tantalising options available.If it’s your first time and you want to know what to order at Cinnabon in Singapore, the Cinnabon classic (S$6.80 for original size, S$4.20 for mini) would be a good choice — who doesn’t like soft, chewy dough with a glorious slathering of cream cheese frosting?There are also variations with a little more pizzazz, such as the caramel-and-nut-encrusted caramel Pecanbon (S$7.60 for original size, S$4.80 for mini) and the chocolate-laden mini Chocobon (S$4.50).To make your queuing more fruitful, you can also choose to grab more at one go with the signature Cinnabon 4 (from S$26.80 for regular rolls) or the Minibon 4 (from S$16.30 for mini rolls). You can even mix and match your desired flavours if you wish.But, due to high demand, each customer will be allowed to buy only three boxes each, until further notice. All products are available while stocks last.For those who prefer more moderate portions, Cinnabon has also introduced two bite-sized snacks for handy on-the-go munching — Roll-On-The-Go (S$4) and the crunchy Cinnachips (S$4), which make use of excess odd ends.To cap it off, there is an assortment of drinks to wash everything down. The most interesting of the bunch is its signature “Chillattas”(S$6.50) — essentially frozen blended beverages available in flavours such as mango, Oreo\xa0and cinnamon caramel.Besides the “Chillattas”, the Singapore outlet will also offer an exclusive Sweetheart Lemonberry (S$4.50), a refreshing strawberry lemonade.On whether Cinnabon Singapore is halal-certified, it mentioned in a reply to an Instagram comment that it is in the process of obtaining halal certification. However, all the ingredients currently used at Cinnabon do not contain pork, lard or alcohol. The buns are also made from scratch at the outlet.Cinnabon is on the GrabMart delivery service.

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/coconut-shakes/:['Light, refreshing and cool – there’s a lot to love about coconut shakes.\xa0Perhaps that’s how coconut shakes dethroned the legendary bubble tea drink as the preferred beverage. Who could resist the reprieve it provides us against the sweltering Singapore heat?\xa0While some may think that coconut shakes in Singapore are all the same, that might not be so. Some of us prefer our coconut shakes creamier and smoother, while others prefer it to be icy with a chunky bite.\xa0Whatever your tastes are, there’s a coconut shake in Singapore for everyone. You already know the bigger players, which are delicious and often fairly crowded, so we’ve come up with a list of five underrated coconut shake brands you might not know about.\xa0\xa0645 Yishun Street 61, 01-322\nOpening hours:\xa0Monday to Thursday and Sunday (12pm to 12am), Friday and Saturday (12pm to 2am)Coconuto is a breath of fresh air to the Yishun neighbourhood. Its neon blue signs and bright blue tables bring a pop of colour into an otherwise typical HDB block.\xa0Despite offering a larger space and a dine-in option, the coconut-themed cafe remains affordable. Its coconut shake starts from S$4.60 for a medium – a reasonable amount for that size.If you’re looking for something to jazz up your usual coconut shake order, try Coconuto’s flavoured coconut shakes such as the black sesame or lotus biscoff (from S$5.30) coconut shakes.Coconuto also offers waffles (from S4.50) and gelato (from S$3.80), with flavours such as Nuto’s favourite (a coconut ice cream mixed with roasted coconut flakes) and mango sticky rice.What to order: Coconut shake (from S$4.60), black sesame (from S$5.30)Various outlets across Singapore\nOpening hours:\xa0Operating hours vary across storesCoconutnut, apart from having a catchy name, also has a refreshingly good coconut gelato shake (from S$4.50).\xa0The coconut gelato shake has a creamy texture with a strong fragrance. Even at the lowest sugar level, the drink has a natural sweetness to it.While we argue that the original coconut shake is always superior, Coconutnut recommends its coconut avocado shake (from S$5.90), too.\xa0If you’re in the mood for munching on something, try some of its more interesting toppings, such as its rainbow mini ball (additional S$0.50) or yoghurt raindrop ball (S$0.60).\xa0What to order: Coconut gelato shake (from S$4.50), fresh coconut juice (S$4.60)Pasir Ris Bus Interchange, 01-05, 501 Pasir Ris Drive 3\nOpening hours:  Monday to Sunday (10.30am to 9pm)It’s easy to miss Coconut Island’s compact space and simple exterior, since it’s tucked within the bustling Pasir Ris bus interchange.\xa0The stall’s location and its simplistic logo with the coconut and palm tree is reminiscent of old-school bubble tea shops one would patronise after school. What’s better is that the prices at Coconut Island are comparable, too.Its original coconut shake (from S$3.50) is one of the cheapest coconut shake options you can find. Fans of the brand recommend its pearls (additional S$0.50) and, if you’re feeling adventurous, the cream cheese (additional S$1) topping.Those who don’t take dairy can also opt for its dairy-free coconut shake (from S$3).What to order: Original coconut shake (S$3.50), coconut gula melaka shake (S$4)\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHawker Hustlers: Hipster hawker Ray Yeo of Bei-Ing Dimsum Club on reinventing dim sum and his love for all things Japan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18 Jalan Membina, 01-17\nOpening hours: Monday to Thursday and Sunday(10.30 am to 10pm), Friday and Saturday (10.30am to 1am)Coconut On Me is a true hidden gem for coconut shakes.

Unless you know the area well, you’d never think to look for it there.\xa0\xa0Its original coconut shake (from S$4.70) has the mild fragrance of fresh coconuts and a sweet flavour profile. By default, the shake leans toward the chunkier side with bits of coconut flesh to chew on. If you prefer it smoother, just let its friendly staff know.Although the original coconut shake flavour cannot be replaced, there are glowing reviews for Coconut On Me’s taro coconut shake (from S$5) and its avocado coconut shake (S$5.80).

Those who prefer more popular flavours, such as cookies and cream or matcha, can opt for something under its Pleasures section. For example, it’s matcha mama (from S$5.90) is a coconut shake blended with green tea matcha.\xa0Drinks from the Super Coco Tonics range comprise coconut water blended with fruits.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/ssada-gimbab-singapore/:['When Netflix’s Extraordinary Attorney Woo first aired last year, I found myself searching high and low for kimbap in Singapore as the titular character had this homely dish almost every episode.What I found was that most places selling kimbap in Singapore were either home-based or they had limited kimbap varieties.These shops also didn’t have the whole experience of seeing your kimbap rolled by hand right in front of you.Enter Ssada Gimbab, the newest Korean bunsik restaurant (everyday Korean food) on the Bukit Timah block, an area that has gained a reputation for being a mini Koreatown.\xa0Now, Ssada Gimbab doesn’t have an ajumma rolling kimbap at the window.\xa0But it comes close, with a true-blue Korean ajumma making your kimbaps to order right next to the till, instead of back in the kitchen.\xa0If you find that the name Ssada Gimbab rings a bell, Ssada Gimbab in Singapore takes inspiration from the Ssada Gimbab stores in Korea, but has customised its menu to fit local tastes.The shop is the brainchild of Jerlin Toh, a 30-year-old Singaporean who is married to a Korean. Ssada Gimbab Singapore opened on June 1 at Bukit Timah Shopping Centre.Backed by her in-laws’ extensive Korean F&B experience, numbering in the decades, Toh hopes that she can bring affordable, authentic Korean bunsik to the Singapore crowd through Ssada Gimbab.Toh is a beautician by profession and left her job to devote her time towards running Ssada Gimbab together with her in-laws.\xa0The multilingual speaks fluent English, Chinese and Korean and you can see her seamlessly switch between languages, depending on the clientele, with much ease.\xa0\xa0The kitchen is run by her brother-in-law, Song Ji Young, 33, who has worked in restaurants in Korea and Singapore. Song also used to run a bunsik restaurant, pre-Covid, in Seoul.\xa0Since its opening at the start of the month, Ssada Gimbab in Singapore has seen a steady stream of customers — both locals and Koreans — despite its relatively quiet location in an old mall.\xa0Toh attributes the traffic to word-of-mouth recommendations and its differentiated bunsik menu offerings as opposed to its neighbours, which lean more towards Korean barbecue.\xa0\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Junction Westgate opening with promos; will house 23 tenants, including new halal teppanyaki\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50% off at picturesque date spots, including Wildseed Cafe at The Alkaff Mansion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOff the bat, we knew we had to try the more unique Ssada Gimbab menu items and dove into its Salad Gimbab (S$9) and Mala Pork Gimbab (S$11).\xa0The Salad Gimbab comes with the usual kimbap ingredients — ham, cucumber, radish, carrot, egg and fish cake — but also has a slaw-like mix within the roll. The sweet yet tangy dressing on the slaw went well with the other savoury ingredients, including the sesame-oil-seasoned rice.\xa0Another healthy-ish option would be its Korean dumpling salad (S$12), which has the usual fresh vegetable assortment found in bibimbap (Korean mixed rice), sans rice. It is topped with mini Korean dumplings or mandu for crunch and protein — think of it as croutons, Korean style.\xa0\xa0As for the Mala Gimbab, Toh tells us: “It’s a flavour we created to suit the taste of Singaporeans. I don’t think you can find any mala kimbap elsewhere.”\xa0It’s ma (numbing) and la (spicy) enough for this mala fan here — with enough leeway on the spice for you to still taste the other kimbap ingredients.\xa0If you have space for another roll, don’t leave without trying its Tonkatsu Gimbab ($11), which contains a thick slab of tonkatsu cutlet. Despite the thickness of the pork cutlet, it was extremely tender and went down easily.\xa0After all that rice, if you’re looking for a comforting stew to wash everything down, have a taste of its bestselling soft tofu stew (S$13) or kimchi stew (S$13).\xa0The shop steers away from using instant stew mixes, and makes everything from scratch with its own recipes. “Our stew is richer and more flavourful, compared to other Korean restaurants,” Toh adds.\xa0Toh tells us that they intend to add more side dishes — such as fried items — to the menu as it goes along.\xa0On whether there’ll be more Ssada Gimbab stores around the island to provide more kimbap choices to a wider audience, Toh is cautiously optimistic: “We would like to stabilise this first stall, and if we can (expand) we will definitely do so.”For more places in Singapore to satisfy your Korean food cravings, check out our series on authentic Korean places in Singapore or visit the newly opened Bulgogi Syo at The Woodleigh Mall.\xa0Book a ride to the new Ssada Gimbab restaurant at Bukit Timah.\xa0Bukit Timah Shopping Centre, B1-14, 170 Upper Bukit Timah Road\nNearest MRT station: Beauty World\nOpen: Monday, Wednesday to Sunday (10am to 9pm)Bukit Timah Shopping Centre, B1-14, 170 Upper Bukit Timah Road\nNearest MRT station: Beauty World\nOpen: Monday, Wednesday to Sunday (10am to 9pm)AuthorSarah is constantly seeking out new coffee spots and cocktail bars around the world, and should probably drink more water while at it.© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

We’re even told the head chef, Eric Seow, used to lead the kitchen at Sofitel Singapore City Centre — as if I wasn’t already excited enough.Hashtag #3’s menu here (mains start from S$18) is far from typical and primarily European — particularly French — with Asian influences thrown into the mix: Iberico pork jowl kong bak bao, anyone?\xa0There’s no shortage of booze here either, from wine, bubbly and beer to signature cocktails (from S$16) and a charming martini list.Dinner here with my partner was a wonderful experience, and the food, drinks, and even service exceeded initial expectations. The use of nice crockery and glassware only added to the warm ambience. If you stay in the north-east area, you’ll definitely want to check out this hot new spot.\xa0I say hot, but the vibes here are cool and relaxed, with chillhop, acid jazz, and deep house spilling from the speakers. Did I mention I saw a no service charge and GST?We started with the prawn tacos (S$8), which turned out to be a single large flat taco. The fusion elements play out well, with springy prawns buried under a heap of vierge (a light French sauce with chopped tomatoes, basil, lemon juice, and olive oil) and a savoury mayo-type sauce, rounded off with ikura and sprigs of deliciously fresh dill.\xa0Get in with your hands and bite into this tasty appetiser. Alright, just look at this plate of gorgeous potato gnocchi (S$22). The handmade gnocchi is soft and fluffy (but with a firm bite), its grooves licking up the fragrant chilli crab sauce as well as a mantou.\xa0The sauce, while not quite spicy, is bright and tangy, accentuated by the chef’s egg espuma — an egg white foam that replaces the usual egg curdles at your typical chilli crab spot — and dill.There’s a generous amount of real crab chunks plus ikura for little bursts of umami, as well as crispy crouton squares that soak up even more sauce. Try to get a spoonful of everything in one bite — you’ll love it.Another beauty is the soy confit pork belly (S$18), a sizeable slab of equal parts fat and lean pork that makes up 100% deliciousness. The meat is cooked in its own fat till soft and tender, with a soy glaze that pairs wonderfully with roasted apples.\xa0The chef’s flair for creating harmonious flavour combinations is clear: The accompanying slaw of cabbage, mandolin carrots, and salad leaves cut away from the pork’s fattiness.It’s not every day you find quality cocktails under a HDB block. Moscow mules are usually made with vodka and lime juice, but the variation here (hashtag mule, S$18) is sweeter and darker with cognac, Campari and Angostura bitters mixed in. The ginger beer on top makes the concoction extra refreshing.My partner’s homemade chrysanthemum martini (S$16) is a tad more complex: Vodka, chrysanthemum, and a simple syrup with lime and lemon juice. It’s floral, crisp, slightly spicy, sweet and sour all at once. You have to try this.It’s rare that I have nothing to gripe about at a restaurant, but here we are. If I really had to nitpick, it’d be the lack of craft beer options, just because I think the food here would go well with beer. Only Tiger Crystal and Guinness on tap are available for now.\xa0That is, however, just a personal preference. Hashtag #3 is leagues beyond the usual neighbourhood gastrobar, and most certainly worth making a trip down for.Is it conducive to conversation? It gets a bit loud inside when it’s a full house, but you can choose to sit outside.Is a reservation necessary? Only if you’re coming in a big group.How to get there? Hashtag #3 is a six-minute walk from Kovan MRT station Exit C.HungryGoWhere paid for its meal at this restaurant for this review. Still hungry?

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/jurong-east-food-spots/:['When it comes to the age-old debate of the east side versus the west side, two specific neighbourhoods in Singapore always pop up in conversation — Jurong East’s food options and Tampines’.In particular, the former is a hotspot frequented by many in the west, due to its pivotal location as the intersection between the more secluded western regions and the rest of Singapore. It’s no wonder that Jurong East has been built up over the years as a “second CBD in the west”. It’s basically the de-facto capital of the West — you’ll find countless hawker stalls and a dense concentration of shopping centres serving Jurong East.But with such a staggering number of establishments available, it can be hard to decide on a dinner spot when you’re in the area.\xa0That’s why we’ve curated a list of Jurong East’s best food in case you need some tips on where to find the best Korean food in Jurong East or just a nice chillout spot for after-work drinks.242 Jurong East Street 24, 01-627\xa0\nOpen: Tuesday to Friday (11am to 9pm), Saturday and Sunday (9.45am to 9pm)Why visit?

Don’t sleep on it, though — the highly rated Western grill not only provides quality bites at affordable prices, but is also not stingy with its portions.Where else can you find a place that serves up generous portions of mushroom risotto and angus ribeye steak at such wallet-friendly prices?

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/my-must-eats-dru-chen-slower-life/:['My Must-Eats is a HungryGoWhere series featuring Singapore’s public figures and their favourite food haunts. This week, singer Dru Chen spills all about his foodie recommendations in Singapore and in Melbourne.For Dru Chen, 33, music has been a mainstay in his life since the ripe old age of four.“I was one of those kids who would sit at a keyboard for hours by myself, just figuring out sounds,” he recalls.And it shows, too. Chen has worked with Universal Music Publishing, Warner Music, Citibank, even multiplayer online battle arena League of Legends, as a recording artist, producer, and composer.Chen’s sophomore album Slow Life has clocked in well over one million streams on Spotify — his most popular release, Summertime, has 1.6 million plays alone.\xa0On June 30, his third and follow-up album, Slower Life, went live and features collaborations with the likes of Rangga Jones, Charlie Lim and Gentle Bones.Besides his music career though, the Singapore-based Chen keeps busy as a lecturer at Republic Polytechnic’s School of Technology for the Arts.The pop singer-songwriter, who moved to Singapore in 1998 with his family, spent his formative years in Melbourne.In a chat with HungryGoWhere, he talks about how food is indelibly tied with his childhood and love for music.Fish and chips reminds me of my childhood. There were many chip shops in the suburban areas of Melbourne, Australia, where I grew up, alongside street-corner pubs serving chicken parmigiana. These dishes always bring back memories.\xa0My parents are originally from Malaysia, so we grew up with an abundance of greasy char kway teow, laksa, nasi lemak, teh tarik, and thosai.I love going to Casuarina Curry in Upper Thomson for its prata or Blooie’s Roadhouse at The Rail Mall for its fish and chips.\xa0Another go-to — and slightly healthier choice — would be the amazing Peranakan nyonya cuisine at Peranakan Inn on East Coast Road or Daisy’s Dream Kitchen in Temasek Club, which was founded by actress Selena Tan’s mother, Daisy.For date-nights or celebrations, I’ll scrub up and head over to Etna or Al Forno for Italian, and definitely celebrating the launch of my new album Slower Life at any of the GrooveTop events run by my friend Sophie Wee — amazing funk, soul, and disco parties at different venues all across Singapore!For Singaporean food, I always crave a big plate of nasi goreng ikan bilis from Spize when I get home.\xa0If I’ve been away from Australia for too long, I’ll have to find an Australian or British or Irish-themed pub like Molly Malone’s in Boat Quay, and order a good meat pie or fish and chips. I would like to spend more time with New Orleans and Creole cuisines.\xa0Also, I can’t get enough of African-American soul food, and would love to try every signature dish when I get the chance.I’m fascinated by these cuisines because of my love for their music and culture.I was really impressed by Tenderfresh, to be honest! My wife orders it all the time for a quick and easy Western meal. We get our protein from its traditional roast chicken. One late night, we had chanced upon its flagship outlet on Cheong Chin Nam Road. It has such a history of providing great affordable meals for the past 42 years, starting from its first hawker stall in Whitley Road Hawker Centre. Another place that really stuck in my mind recently is when I wrote the lyrics to Summertime at Sofitel Singapore Sentosa while we were celebrating my wife’s birthday! This was right after downing the breakfast buffet at Kwee Zeen.But I also wrote the music to that while on the bus on my way to my first Covid jab haha. I’ll never forget that.Have a craving for nasi lemak? Check out So Lemak and its signature har cheong gai wings.All restaurants mentioned here, with the exception of Etna Italian, Molly Malone’s and Kwee Zeen, are on the GrabFood delivery service and offer free delivery (up to S$3 off) with GrabUnlimited.\xa0They can also be found on GrabFood Dine-in.You can also book a ride to the stores mentioned in the article.\xa0 AuthorJia-En has worn several hats in her career — first writing TV scripts, then food and lifestyle stories at Wine & Dine. But some things will never change: Her love of words, cats and caffeine.© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/overbrod/:['The first time I heard about smorrebrod — the iconic Danish open-faced sandwich — was at a little cafe on Keong Saik Road called Leckerbaer. That was where slices of salty smoked salmon and pickled onions sat atop fluffy slices of lightly toasted rye bread with a hefty layer of cream cheese.\xa0That place still exists, but as its Instagram page would tell you, its focus is now on small, sugary Danish pastries.\xa0The smorrebrod at Overbrod, a recently opened deli at Anchorpoint Shopping Centre, is an ode to the classic dish — with a twist.Gordon Tan started Overbrod after being inspired by his honeymoon in Denmark.\xa0The young chef, who most recently worked at the hip Middle Eastern-Japanese izakaya Habibi-san, handles the food. His business partners Benjamin Tan and Daniel Chia look after the coffee programme, which also includes some tasty bakes.\xa0Overbrod started as a home-based business in March last year before launching at its brick-and-mortar space in December of the same year.Love it! Overbrod is a promising cafe with great attention to detail, down to its dishware and playlist — from Yamazaki Masayoshi’s iconic One More Time, One More Chance to the soulful crooning of Blood Orange.\xa0The food is clearly well thought out, put together with plenty of finesse.\xa0It’s worth noting that authentic Scandinavian food is often light on flavour, relying instead on the freshness and simplicity of its ingredients.\xa0This is not unlike Japanese cuisine, which chef Gordon has experience with from his time at an izakaya. It shows in his use of ingredients such as ikura and mentaiko — the food here is adjusted for the Singaporean palate.An easy favourite is the Toast Skagen (S$18). Think Norwegian coldwater shrimps and sliced boiled eggs sitting atop buttered rye bread. Throw on a big scoop of tobiko and mentaiko mayonnaise, and the sandwich oozes with umami.\xa0The chilled shrimp has a nice crunch and natural briny sweetness, and of course, it’s not a Scandi dish without the refreshing undertone of dill.The bread is toasted just enough to prevent the sauce from making it soggy, retaining a nice, fluffy nuttiness with each bite.\xa0I topped up S$4 for a fantastic soup of the day. The tomato soup was so tangy, smooth and creamy that the bowl was empty in a minute.The most expensive smorrebrod on the menu is the Shooting Star (S$26), or stjerneskud.\xa0It’s the grand whopper of Danish smorrebrods, with a history that goes back to 1962, when it was created to celebrate the achievements of the first man in space. It comes with cured salmon (gravlax), butter-fried halibut, charred asparagus, and a tangy remoulade (a cold sauce). The version here takes in sliced hardboiled eggs and ikura (because why not?) to amp up the creaminess and savoriness, brightening the dish.You’ve tried the meatballs from a certain furniture retailer and maybe even love them.\xa0But the Frikadeller (S$18) from Overbrod? Trust me, it’s better. These are six large handfuls of minced beef and pork expertly packed together, so each mouthful is tender and soft. A smooth potato mash, brown beef jus and housemade lingonberry jam add rich flavour and some bright, fruity tanginess.The Leverpostej (S$12) is not for everyone, but if you like the taste of liver, then this Danish pate platter offers very good value.\xa0Made with chicken and pork liver, and some lard, egg and flour, this baked spread is incredibly delicious with the accompanying pickled beets, bacon and dark toasted rye. It’s a winning combination of saltiness and sweetness, with the buttery smoothness of the liver.Frangipane, not to be confused with the frangipani flower, is a decadent almond paste used in many Danish pastries, including this Ben&Berry tart (S$7). The paste, baked into the crumbly pie dough, has a nutty, sweet taste that goes swimmingly with fruit, which, in this case, are sweet blueberries with a hint of acidity.On the beverage front, Overbrod has some craft beers on rotation as well as a variety of aquavit (a herbaceous Scandinavian spirit distilled from grain or potatoes).\xa0But it’s early on a Sunday morning, so I order a glass of seasonal batch brew coffee (S$5). The current selection is a dry-processed heirloom variety from Ethiopia with a profile of ripe banana and stone fruits. It’s perfect with the crispy almond florentine cookie.Believe me, I’ve tried to find something to nitpick on, but there isn’t a single dish I tried that I dislike in any way.\xa0Overbrod is not quite traditionally Scandinavian, but chef Gordon executes his dishes with a careful sensibility that pays homage to their food. Combine that with great service and quality vibes, and it’s truly a spectacular place to kick back at.Is it conducive to conversation? Both indoor and outdoor seating are fairly quiet — let’s hope it stays that way!Is a reservation necessary? No reservations needed.How to get there? Head to the new wing outside Anchorpoint, a few bus stops from Queenstown MRT station.\xa0Things to note:\xa0HungryGoWhere paid for its meal at this restaurant for this review. Still hungry?

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/pies-and-pints-singapore/:['Mention pies to any Singaporean and it’s likely to conjure up images of desserts, such as the apple pie and other types of sweet, crusty confectioneries. Or, well, a curry puff.Talk to a Brit or Aussie, however, and you’ll be pelted with treasured childhood memories of their favourite meaty and saucy pies — which is exactly the sort that the new Pies & Pints prides itself on.It can be pretty challenging to score yourself an authentic Western-style pie in Singapore that’s made fresh, and with love, too.That’s what led to the creation of Pies & Pint, a passion project by a group of Brits, Americans and locals — all of whom are serious pie lovers.Here, customers are treated to the entire gamut of pies. In particular, the shop focuses more on traditional flavours, based on classic combinations more commonly found in Sydney and parts of England.The pies are handmade from premium ingredients — including free-range meats, organic vegetables and wild fish — and freshly baked in-house daily.All pies on Pies & Pints’ menu are priced at S$10.90 with a diverse range of flavours available, ranging from timeless classics to quirkier creations inspired by Asian cuisine.The focus on nostalgic Western favourites means you can expect fillings such as Cornish pasty (a baked English classic with pastry skin folded over a beef-and-vegetable filling, akin to a curry puff), chicken leek & cider, spinach & ricotta, English pork pie, and Aussie meat pie, among others.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTalad Thai Banana opens at AMK Hub with S$2 opening promotion for the first 100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to a spokesperson though, the bestseller is its signature steak & ale, loaded up with a filling that’s painstakingly cooked for over eight hours to achieve the desired “melting texture”.More interesting fusion options include beef rendang, Japanese beef & wasabi and Thai green chicken curry for those who prefer a more spice-forward zing to their pies.An iconic Irish staple is also given a little plant-based twist in the guise of its plant-based wagyu beef & Guinness stout pie.Pie-lovers will also be thrilled to hear that Pies & Pints has a weekly rotation of specials on its menu, so you can look forward to indulgences such as the mac & cheese pie.Besides the plethora of pies, the store offers a slew of snacks, such as mega pork sausage rolls (S$9) and cheese puff-pastry straws (S$6).Desserts (S$8.50) are available, too, and you can expect the usual suspects such as tiramisu and apple crumble tart.Local influences have also found their way onto the dessert menu, with a rather intriguing peanut & kaya cheesecake in the mix.All these sweet treats can be washed down with a variety of thirst quenchers, including thick milkshakes (S$8.50) that come in three variations: Vanilla, chocolate and salted caramel.A shot of bourbon (+S$8) can be added in to make the creamy milkshakes boozy, in case you’re in need of a warm buzz.Of course, it’s not polite to chow down on traditional pies without an icy pint — and that is why Pies & Pints also offers draft beers starting from S$10, with an emphasis on British beers.There’s no better time to visit than the present: The pie shop is running an opening promo until July 21, where all pies are available at S$8 (U.P. S$10.90), desserts at S$6 (U.P. S$8.50) and canned beers at S$12 (U.P.

The flat rice noodles used here are of the thin variety, and are about half the width of the hor fun typically used in zi char stalls. The dish came bathed in light brown gravy. Surprisingly, the dish wasn’t too starchy and the hor fun had a pleasant bite. It was tasty and moreish, yet light at the same time. We also detected the sweet taste of the seafood stock.The chef, who is Aunty’s husband, wielded an excellent cooking technique, which was evident in the seafood that topped the dish. We had one-and-a-half giant prawns and a generously sized crayfish. The latter was absolutely the best crayfish we’ve ever had. The meat was fresh, tender and smooth. Usually, crayfish is either so soft that you know it’s terribly stale or overdone that it’s almost crunchy and hard. Clearly, with more than 30 years in the business, he has mastered the art of cooking crayfish. The prawns were equally fresh and well done.Chicken or prawn hor fun is also available and they come with marinated mushrooms and prawn, and prawn-only variations.However, the dumplings were not as exciting. They were simply made up of wanton skin and a single small prawn. Although the soup was quite delicious, and we appreciated the green veggies that came with it, the shui jiao was a disappointment. Thankfully, the dish didn’t cost too much.When you visit, just stick to the sah hor fun.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/20-questions-johanne-siy/:['20 Questions is a HungryGoWhere interview series with the who’s who of the F&B sector.Lolla’s head chef Johanne Siy recalls the glorious summers she spent on foraging trips in Europe.\xa0She and her colleagues would drive out to the surrounding Danish countryside, traipse into the forest, and comb windswept beaches in search of berries, ants and beach herbs. They would return to the restaurant, bearing a bountiful harvest, which they would incorporate into the food they serve or as finishing touches.Through such expeditions, Siy, 41, developed a profound appreciation and deep respect for producers and their unwavering commitment to quality and the provenance of ingredients.\xa0Produce became the centre of her craft. Through her cooking, she preferred to let the ingredients speak for themselves, captivating diners through flavour.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0It thus came as no surprise that last month, the talented Filipina was crowned Asia’s Best Female Chef 2023, making her the first Singapore-based chef to win the title.\xa0\xa0It was a reflection of the many years spent and intentional experiences sought in honing her craft.Siy’s life reads dramatically — it’s filled with a number of adventures and detours before she arrived at where she is today.Hailing from Dagupan City in the Philippines, Siy had formative memories of gatherings where her whole family pitched in to dish up delicious meals. While Siy enjoyed dabbling in the kitchen, it was not something she had considered seriously.Taking the more conventional path, she moved from her home country to Singapore to work for multinational manufacturing giant Procter & Gamble, where she climbed the corporate ladder for six years. Yet she had the nagging feeling that she was destined to be somewhere else.\xa0\xa0She left her job to pursue her passion for food, an industry notoriously known for its long hours and unpredictability.Hungry and ambitious, she headed straight to New York to enrol in the renowned Culinary Institute of America. Since then, her resume has been nothing short of star-studded. \n\nShe went on to work at the acclaimed Cafe Boulud and Le Bernardin in New York.\xa0When she returned to Singapore in 2014, she worked at Restaurant Andre, which was then the top restaurant in the country for four years. When it shuttered, she went travelling around Europe, working on farms and foraging, followed by a stint at heavyweight restaurants such as Faviken in Sweden, and Copenhagen’s Relae and five-time winner of The World’s Best Restaurant title, Noma.In 2020, she came back to Singapore with plans to open a small space of her own.\xa0But the pandemic happened and that venture was too risky. So she took up a position at Lolla, which was in a precarious position at the time, having lost almost its entire kitchen team.\xa0Siy pressed on despite the challenges of a new menu format — a la carte service was not something she was very familiar with, having worked mostly in tasting-menu restaurants — and the fact that the kitchen team had just been reduced to two chefs.She put a unique spin on the menu. Inspired by her time in America and Europe, she steered the restaurant away from Spanish tapas fare to a fresh direction of sustainably minded, produce-driven modern European plates, with touches of Asian ingredients she had grown up with.Watching Siy work in the open kitchen is an experience in itself. She moves efficiently and operates meticulously, with an air of quiet intensity. The result is delicately assembled and elevated avocado and crab dishes that had our team drooling over the burst-in-your-mouth umami goodness.Away from the kitchen, Siy is warm and effortlessly charming. She confides that she would love to forage in our own backyard, if given the chance. She waxes lyrical about a heart-shaped leaf that grows in wild abundance across Singapore and near her apartment. She’d love to incorporate more of nature’s wonders into her cuisine.\xa0\xa0She tells us: “Nature never ceases to amaze me. No matter how many times I’ve worked with an ingredient, every encounter always presents something new — a new texture, a new flavour nuance, a blush of colour, a new dimension when combined with something else. It never gets boring. I feel so lucky to be doing what I do.”Here’s a lightly edited excerpt of our interview:Every first for me was quite memorable. I remember going to a lot of family gatherings.\xa0My aunt cooks really well and she would always prepare these local delicacies and no one can do it as well as her.\xa0So we looked forward to these gatherings because we got to try her cooking. For example, a goat stew or a dessert called leche flan, which is very similar to a creme brulee.\xa0When I was old enough to experiment in the kitchen, I always tried to copy and make sure the dish tasted as good as hers.\xa0Of course, I remember the summers where my brothers and I would play around with rice cakes, because we didn’t have play dough. Rice cakes are a malleable product, so my younger brother would make robots out of them. It actually looked like a Michelin Man rather than a robot.\n\nMy aunt lived some distance away from us, but somewhere they can grow things. So some of the goats that they would serve, they slaughtered themselves. Even chickens. That was interesting for me to see growing up.\nWhen I first moved here, I never thought about being a chef. It was a hobby, but it was not my focus.\xa0Being young, moving to a new country, new job, corporate, you just want to focus on your career. But after a while, I got the hang of that, so I started cooking for friends.\xa0We were all young people, in our early 20s, relocated to a new country. We didn’t have family here, so we were each other’s family.\xa0On weekends, we would get together and I would cook for them. I could experiment with different cuisines, whatever struck my fancy.\xa0Sometimes, I would do Indian food because Mustafa Centre was open 24 hours, and at 3am, I would be there with my friend and we would comb the shelves, looking for ingredients. So that, and a bit of Italian and French. \n\nAt my Procter & Gamble job, it was of course very demanding. It’s a company that expects a high level of excellence and performance from everyone.\xa0They usually hire from the best schools and you have to be of a certain grade to make the cut, so the expectation was really high. And then you work with a multinational team from all over the region, so everyone is at the top of their game.\xa0So that was a lot of pressure. Cooking was a bit more relaxing for me during the weekends, and gratifying. And cooking for people, everyone will say nice things, even if it’s not really so nice! So you get a lot of positive reinforcement from them.\xa0It was gradual and something I started considering at some point in time. I thought this is something I might enjoy doing.\xa0And being in Singapore helped me think a bit differently, to take risks. If you’re back home, it’s difficult to do something out of the ordinary. The tendency is to stick with how you’ve always done things. But being in a new environment kind of stimulates that.\xa0I talked to a few people first, especially the ones whom I consider my mentors. They were like: “Why is it so extreme? Why do you want to be a chef? Why don’t you look at becoming a general manager for a hotel chain?”\n\nFor example, the service career path, like front of house, which is a bit more similar to what I was doing, like the management aspect, but I was like: “No, I want to cook.” \n\nOne of my mentors, who also promoted me back then, was the one who wrote my recommendation letter for the Culinary Institute of America. So he was quite supportive. Even now, he comes in and brings the entire leadership team here.\nYes, definitely. Because it was a stable job and well regarded. And you get to work with a lot of interesting people who are very good at what they do. So sometimes you miss that.Because, of course, F&B is made up of people from diverse backgrounds. Which is fun, something that’s quite exciting. But at the same time, you never know what kind of people they are, what their motivations are, or is it just a job for them at the end of the day? Or are they someone who’s very passionate about cooking? It’s not a given.It’s more of “you get what you give”. Like what you put in, what you take from that school.\xa0Because everyone is paying the same amount, and culinary school is not cheap. So it really depends on the individual. If you put in a lot of yourself and the time, you will really get so much out of it. Versus someone who’s just there and unsure, like: “Oh, I’m just doing this because my mum paid for it.”\n\nThe thing with culinary school is you get people also from different age groups. Some of my classmates were fresh out of high school. And some couldn’t even drink yet.\n\nI didn’t have the luxury of time to waste. So it was always about maximising the time there.The good thing about the industry is that the skills are transferable. It doesn’t matter the geography, and once you have the basics, you can work anywhere.And of course, it always helps to have previous mentors or chefs who put in a good word. There’s always a network. Because Andre would know some people…Different places taught me different things. For instance, at Faviken, I’m thinking outside the box and trying to be resourceful because the weather is so extreme. Trying to make the most of what you have.\xa0And from Noma, it’s more of rethinking the way we’ve always done F&B. We’ve inherited this French brigade system in how we run kitchens. There’s a strict hierarchy and everyone has to go through it. But not everyone’s the same; certain people are just exceptional at doing certain things. Noma recognises that because they do it by departments, like how we do it at a corporate company.\n\nFor example, there’s a finance department that specialises in money. They have a research arm, people who do service, people who do fermentation.\xa0At that time, I was specialising in foraging and I helped out in the R&D kitchen. I spent a lot of time going around Denmark, driving around. That was quite cool.\xa0I foraged for wildflowers. We spent a lot of time on the beaches, because there’s a lot of beach plants that grow along the coast. We foraged for berries during the spring, summer. In recent years, they had the most glorious summer, and at that time, we had two months of beautiful, perfect weather.\n\nNormally, we go: “Oh, what do we need for today for service?” And then we would go to all the different places where we know we can find this thing. Sometimes it’s not available, so we go to another venue. It was fun but tiring. \n\nSometimes we’d pick herbs at the beaches, and then say “OK, let’s go for a quick swim”. And then come back.\xa0 When I came back from Scandinavia, because I had spent a bit of time with some bakeries there, I thought: “OK, I’ll keep it simple. Let’s just do a small business.”\xa0 \n\nI wanted to start a small bakery that also offers a dining experience at night. So a very small-scale thing. But then the pandemic happened and it wasn’t really a good time to take that risk. \n\nSo I wasn’t even looking around, but someone told me about an opportunity here.\xa0I said: “OK, I’ll just show up and chat with the hiring person.”\xa0After the chat, I agreed to help them out because there were only a few people there and it was a waste for the restaurant to close just because they didn’t have enough staff.\xa0And I even volunteered to interview people for the head chef role. So I brought a couple of my friends in. When there were no takers, I went: “OK, I’m gonna just continue what I’m doing.”\xa0Of course, you can’t just sit back, so I had to launch new things.\nI was always quite adamant about putting my mark on something.\n\nThe ethos has always been exceptional produce, prepared simply. But it’s just that that whole transition… because I’ve always done tasting menus, and this is the first a la carte restaurant that I’ve actually worked at, was very different.\xa0Doing inventory is a nightmare and forecasting, too, because you never know what people will order. You can influence them, but there’s still a level of unpredictability.\xa0So I’m used to preparing everything fresh every day, and we should still try to do that. But at the same time, you’re limited by how you can do that with a la carte. Because you cannot predict, right?\nBefore, they would prep for a week’s worth of this dish, like mass production. Now we try to do smaller batches more often.\xa0And because of that, we can work with fresher produce, too, like beautiful fish from Europe and Japan, just because it’s prepared fresh every day. Because there’s no point getting beautiful produce if you’re going to keep it for one or two weeks.In the fine-dining realm, a lot of people do produce-driven cuisine, but the challenge in Singapore is that nothing grows here.\xa0So everything is pretty much imported. So it’s more about building the relationship with some of the suppliers and growers overseas. Some of the growers are good because they can do custom stuff for you. Certain sizes, certain things, certain colours. Like tomatoes or micro herbs — they can do that for you, and even flowers.\xa0At first, it was staffing. Because there were two guys left.\xa0And then the whole focus on customers, because at the end of the day, we are a hospitality company.\xa0It’s all about taking care of the people here, and our guests.\xa0During the pandemic… everyone was just trying to survive. I heard a lot of people cut salaries of their staff or forced leave. We didn’t do any of that. Even when we weren’t earning anything, we continued to pay full salaries.\xa0So the business aspect of things was the most challenging part. We did takeouts, but that was never enough. It’s good that the government helped. If there wasn’t any subsidy from the government, we wouldn’t have been here.\nFor the avocado dish, I’m not a millennial, but I’ve always loved avocado. It’s healthy and delicious. I wanted to challenge myself because you see it everywhere.\xa0And it’s quite tricky to work with. It oxidises quite fast and you never really get the perfect avocado. There’s always something wrong with it. If you get the perfect one, buy Toto because you’re really lucky!\xa0The tendency is always just to make guacamole because that’s the best way. But I wanted to challenge myself to elevate something so ubiquitous and do something creative out of it.\xa0\nIt took a long time to get that dish. For the avocado, I wanted to do it with a lot of umami and smokiness as well, which we’re getting from the Spanish smoked eel it is served with.\xa0It also comes with housemade black garlic. The sauce is a housemade ponzu enriched with coconut milk, so a bit of that Southeast Asian touch. And the alyssum flowers that change with the season. Sometimes, we use chive flowers.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n35 of the best Tanjong Pagar food places to try\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSingapore Food Festival 2023: More than 100 food options & over S$2k in prizes to be won\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHawker Hustlers: Happiness is a warm Mian Mian Bu Duan Peanut Pancake\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe crab dish is a bit more of a homage to my heritage. Crab relleno is a dish that’s quite famous back home.\xa0\xa0You can find it in Spain, too, because our cuisine is heavily influenced by Spain and even Mexico. It’s a crab shell that’s been emptied out and all the meat that you get, you cook it with aromatics and you stuff it back and then you bread it and fry it, so it’s like double-cooked. But that sometimes tends to be quite dry. \n\nI wanted to take that idea of stuffing it, but we do it very differently.\xa0It’s still aromatic, with different types of crab — blue crabs, zuwaigani and river crab.\xa0What ties it all together is something that’s unique from back home, which is “aligue”, a paste of river crab tomalley cooked with aromatics.\xa0So to be able to extract all this is actually quite a lot of hard work. So you have old women in some villages whose hands are permanently (curled), because their job is to take it out, salt it, extract and cook that paste with aromatics. It’s like the hawker centres here. They are few and far between, the older generation used to do it, but nobody wants to take it up because of the tedious labour.\xa0\nIt’s different approaches for different things. I start to think about how I can present it in the best light, given its properties. So it can be something that goes really well with it in terms of flavour profile, something that you find within its own ecosystem. I tend to serve different things that go together.\xa0It’s very familial.\xa0It’s not like, I’m the boss, you listen to me. But because it’s more familial, I still push them in the sense of how can we do better, less salty, more acidity?\xa0I want it to be a sustainable culture. We spend so much time here; I spend more time with my kids (referring to her staff) than my husband. So it might as well be enjoyable and we might as well enjoy one another’s company.\xa0\xa0When I talk to people, I refer to them as my kids. People here help each other out; if you’re in trouble, everyone jumps in to help.\nWhen I was growing up, or when I was training as a young chef, there were not a lot of female figures that you can look up to. Maybe some TV personalities, like Julia Child, or presenters, but there weren’t a lot of women at the highest level.\xa0For me, the important aspect is putting yourself in the cuisine, and building that connection with people who are eating your food. So home cooking was actually more impressive to me. Because it’s authentic, nurturing.My family, definitely. My husband, who’s always been very supportive. \n\nHe’s always here at the restaurant when I do my R&D.\xa0He comes to accompany me, because I’m a scaredy cat. It’s very dark here, and I wonder if I’m hearing something? (laughs)\xa0He just comes in and reads his book on his iPad, and he tells me: “I’m hungry.” So I feed him. He’s very patient. He’s in tech.\xa0Thank goodness, because otherwise, we won’t see each other if he’s also in F&B.It means a lot. There are a lot of detractors for the award.\xa0Wherever I go, without fail, people would ask: “Why is it Best Female Chef? Why can’t it be Best Chef?”\xa0But it’s meaningful because it gives us a voice. It gives us women more visibility at work. And it’s important for younger chefs, especially female chefs, to be able to have role models. To say, yes, it can be done and something to aspire to.\xa0I’m not a morning person. I wake up quite late because I sleep quite late, about 3 or 4am.\xa0When I get up, I go through what I need to do for the day and the list of people who are coming for that day and prepare for that. \n\nAnd when I come in, we do the staff briefing for service. We discuss the customers who are coming in — are they regulars or not? — and their dietary needs, what we can do for them. And then we do the mise en place. In the afternoon, I do some office work, or I meet up with people, suppliers and friends in the industry. \n\nFor instance, a lady that came in just now; she owns a store at Palais Renaissance in Orchard. I was asking her for some custom containers for sauces.\xa0And then I come back for dinner service, do another round of briefing, then service, and then I stay until we finish dinner. I leave at about 11.30pm.\xa0I get home and have something to eat. My husband usually gets my food because I always have to cook hungry. I feel like I cannot cook when I’m full; I don’t feel it’s so good, leh. But when I cook, and I’m hungry and I taste it, whoa. (pats herself on the shoulder) \n\nMy husband buys food for me; he doesn’t cook. Once, I made him peel hardboiled eggs and he gave up, saying it’s too difficult.\xa0\xa0We live somewhere near Newton. So he’ll come from a basketball game and he’ll pass by Newton Circus to buy me dinner. There’s a place called Heng Carrot Cake — it’s quite famous. They do a black and white carrot cake; he’ll usually get that for me and some chicken wings.\xa0\nSleep, lor. I used to go hiking a lot. I actually used to run marathons, but then I stopped, because this is like a marathon in itself.Since I love noodles, we discovered this noodle place many years back. It’s called Da Shi Jia Big Prawn Mee, at 89 Killiney Road. It’s not your conventional prawn mee, but it’s delicious. The young couple that owns the place is so hardworking.\xa0When I first met them, the wife was pregnant but was still working there manning the cashier counter. And then the baby pretty much grew up there. Just sitting on the counter, and she would be doing the cashiering.\xa0I’m a very simple girl, so just coffee.I want to bring out a little more of my heritage. Because of course, since it predates me, we’re limited in terms of how much we can push the concept, as people would still expect Mediterranean, Spanish, European kind of food.\xa0Now, we have incorporated Asian touches, and that’s OK. But to push it further might be a little challenging. Maybe I would like to focus on another concept.

Shaped by these experiences, the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) graduate dreamt of something he could call his own.\xa0In 2017, at 24, Lee started a humble hawker stall — Burgs by Project Warung — with two others at Golden Mile Food Centre.\xa0Their goal was to bring affordable halal gourmet burgers to the hawker scene.\xa0Despite being a business newbie, and fending off sceptics, Lee was single-minded in his vision.\xa0He left Burgs by Project Warung in 2019 to start Ashes Burnnit — and, boy, did it take off quickly. (That same year, armed with good looks and a megawatt smile, Lee was crowned Cleo’s Most Eligible Bachelor 2019.)\xa0During the Covid-19 pandemic, Ashes Burnnit expanded into the different regions of Singapore, from Bedok South to Alexandra and, now, its newest outlet at Woodlands.

In September last year, Seetoh started Urban Hawker in New York City, the city’s first “Singapore-style street food market” housing 17 stalls, including Ashes Burnnit’s burgers alongside chicken rice and satay. \n\nLee tells us: “It was a dream come true to bring our Singapore brand to the burger capital of the world.”\xa0\n\nThe 31-year-old is constantly setting his sights on something new. He launched the now-defunct Maison Sucree bakery in 2020, eatery Sembarang Nasi Lemak in October last year, as well as an events company. Next up, he plans to introduce a tipping system to its Alexandra outlet, inspired by New York’s tipping culture.\n\n“Innovating is so important to me because we must keep up with the food trends in Singapore and keep customers coming back. Without it, the business will be stagnant,” he says.Here’s a lightly edited excerpt of our interview:\xa0It started from my family, my parents and my aunt. My family loves to go out and eat, and try different food.\xa0From as young as Primary 5 and secondary school, I used to work part-time at my aunt’s staff canteen. She sold typical Malay food, like mee rebus and nasi padang.\xa0I remember learning to fry an egg. That was my first taste of cooking.\xa0That’s how I started my culinary journey, from Malay cuisine to subsequently Western.\xa0Did I know that I wanted to be a chef? At that time, it was 50-50.\xa0I already helped my aunt previously and I knew what I could do, but I wasn’t sure what I wanted to do in the near future. After getting advice from my parents, they said I should take up a course in a field where I want to work in the near future.\xa0So that’s how I enrolled in the culinary-arts course at ITE.At ITE, I was there for five years and took up a lot of culinary courses and interned at hotels like the Hilton and Swissotel, and a few other restaurants.\xa0After going through National Service, I immediately applied for jobs. Terra Tokyo Italian was hiring, and I got a recommendation through ITE. \n\nWhen I joined, it was only six months old. At that point, I wanted to join a new establishment and help build a startup restaurant. That was one of my goals.\n\nIt’s exactly like starting a hawker stall, but of course, this was on a bigger scale — finding staff, creating menus, how you engage with your customers, your clients, how you’re going to do your marketing.\xa0I was with Terra for two years, starting out as a cook, then becoming a junior sous chef.\xa0The head chef is Seita Nakahara. I love the way he portrays himself. He’s a Japanese chef, but he can speak Italian and grew his skills in Italian cuisine.\xa0So Terra Tokyo Italian is a fusion kitchen. Back in school, I was learning French cuisine, and it was an honour to get the opportunity to learn the best of both worlds: Japanese and Italian.\n\nI also learnt about kitchen operations, cleanliness and operation flow. Another thing was how he can source cheap produce and come up with gourmet products.\xa0That’s how we got the idea of bringing gourmet burgers to a hawker setting. Because hawkers are usually portrayed as selling cheap food, but no one sees hawkers as gourmet.I wanted to do something for myself. As young chefs, we always dream of having our own restaurant, our own cafe and being our own boss. I’d already been in the industry for six to eight years.\xa0We wanted to come up with something new — concepts that people don’t regularly see in hawker centres. I was so happy that we started a trend of selling burgers in hawker centres.\xa0After that, you can see a lot more young people start to join. Whenever people hear that I was studying Western cuisine (during my ITE days), they automatically say: “Oh, fish and chips, ah? Chicken chop, ah?” We wanted to change that perspective. \n\nI brought in my NS mate Farhan. Instead of doing ordinary burgers, we thought: “Why not do charcoal burgers?”\xa0That’s how Ashes Burnnit came about; it has got to do with burnt stuff. It also means that you keep the fire burning in you, right?The funny thing is that Farhan had just graduated from Nanyang Technological University, studying chemical engineering.\xa0He had high-paying offers from big companies. I pitched the idea to him, and he took the risk to join me. Looking back, no regrets.\xa0Golden Mile was central to everything. It had one of the best food options in a hawker centre around Singapore.\xa0The demand was very good during the first few months of operations. We had queues where people would wait in line for one-and-a-half hours. We used to sell out very early.People heard about us through social media and food bloggers, so we were lucky that social media was on the rise. When you come up with trendy food, straightaway, bang!\xa0We just rolled out a new menu. On the previous menu, we were focusing on gourmet burgers, and now people know us for it.\xa0We wanted to innovate more and got the idea to launch roti john this year.\xa0 We want to change the perspective on roti john next. \n\nYou’ve never heard of charcoal roti john, right? It’s like how we do our burgers; we want to replicate that and make it a trend. It also became a hit in our New York City outlet.\xa0So when it became one of the bestsellers, we thought: “Hey, we should have that in Singapore as well.” You should definitely try the Ashes classic cheeseburger and the short-rib brisket burger. And lastly, the charcoal roti john; hopefully, people are willing to give it a try.\n\nWe also have things like pasta, chicken chop, lamb chop and different types of fries. If you’re bored of normal fries, you can upgrade that to truffle fries, cheese fries or brisket fries. When you start your own business, you use up all your savings.\xa0So we started from ground zero and had zero dollars in our bank (after putting in the capital) — and just enough to run the business.\xa0\xa0Second, before you build contacts with suppliers, you’ve got to buy off the shelf.\xa0I would get 15kg of flour and other things from the Sheng Siong supermarket near my home in Woodlands, then travel to Lavender by train. Every single dollar counts.When the pandemic happened, we had to deliver door to door to sustain the business. We got our own pool of private-hire car drivers, including people who lost their jobs.\xa0The demand for our burgers was still high even during the pandemic, and that’s how we learnt the demographic of our clientele.Before the pandemic, people would travel to Golden Mile, eat our burgers and then go to town. During the pandemic, we thought about getting our burgers to customers in the shortest time.Since business was doing pretty good, we thought: “Why not diversify and go where our clients are, and they can have the food fresher?” For our burgers to travel from Golden Mile to Woodlands, it would take around 45 minutes and the quality degrades.So we decided to take our comfort food and expand it to the heartlands, starting with our second outlet in Alexandra, third in Bedok, followed by Teck Whye and Woodlands.\n\nThe story behind the Teck Whye outlet is that I used to come to this coffee shop while I was schooling at ITE College West, just around the corner.\xa0I know how the crowd is. My dad came by and we saw the empty stall, so we asked if it was available for rent. There aren’t many food options at this coffee shop, but the thing is, we already built our brand. So we’re confident that people will come to us.The crowd here is more for students after school and people who come for dinner after work, while we see more of the CBD crowd at Golden Mile.We also offer student discounts. When we were schooling, we didn’t have much pocket money, so we tried to look for student meals. Now, we try to cater to the students, too. And we try to portray that we’re a cafe at a hawker centre. The funny thing is, sometimes, people enquire on social media if they can make a reservation! \nI used to work on the ground, but when the business grew, I got more people to help with it.\xa0\xa0I got one of my ex-schoolmates with a graphic-design background to join us and help with branding.\xa0We have a team of five in the office, a shophouse in Balestier. They’re doing marketing, finance, filing; basically, we’ve moved to a more corporate model.\xa0As for my outlet staff, we have a team of 30. I get them from everywhere. One of them joined Potato Head Singapore, but came back to join us. It’s good to know that people want to come back and work for us.Going to the Istana to serve our burgers to President Halimah, as part of an event organised by the National Environment Agency. She was surprised at first; she didn’t expect us to serve charcoal buns.Last year, we also had the opportunity to do a live station serving burgers to National Day Rally participants.KF Seetoh approached us and pitched to us, asking if we were interested to be part of his new concept, and for us to set up a burger joint in New York. Some people would say: “No, why serve burgers in New York? It’s the burger capital.” But I said “we are representing local burgers and sandwiches”. \n\nIt was pretty surreal when we launched it. There was a lot of press, some VIPs, and so many Singaporeans from all over who came down to try it.\n\nIf you ask me what’s the difference with our New York outlet, it’s the tipping culture. And we’re serving a brand-new menu specially curated just for NYC.\xa0We also noticed that people are more willing to pay a higher price, compared with Singapore. Recently, a famous blogger posted about our burgers that garnered about 1,000 new followers for us!\xa0 \n\nFor our staff, we put in place an “exchange programme”, where anyone in the team can do a three-month exchange to New York, and the accommodation is fully covered. It’s a really good opportunity.Roughly 300 to 400 burgers per shop.A lot of meetings, visiting the different outlets, meeting different suppliers, and R&D (research and development).\xa0At midnight, I’m also working, making calls to the US side. I basically work seven days a week.I like to stay home, spend time with my wife, or meet friends. I’m part of a mentorship programme under the National Environment Agency.\xa0I had two interns who came on board and trained with us for a few months in the kitchen. They had to plan their own menu and had a taste of hawker life. These could be people working in banks, taxi drivers, mid-career switchers. I had one intern who was 40 years old. \n\nI want to do this because a lot of the older hawkers are retiring, and there might not be anyone left to take over.\xa0We want to show that the hawker trade is for young people; you can open your own prawn-noodle stall and so on.\xa0I hope by the success we have shown with Ashes Burnnit, it could inspire more people to start their business in the hawker trade.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10 Suntec City dinner spots for every budget\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFree hashbrowns & coffee with KFC's breakfast Original Recipe Riser deal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMcDonald’s Ninja burger returns with 50% off deal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI like to cafe hop, look out for new cafes that have opened, and go and try them.\xa0Sometimes I will just visit on my own, take away while I go for my next meeting.\xa0I also need my fresh coffee, because my day starts early.\xa0Now, I’m on a weight-loss programme. Every morning, I’ll start with my exercise and go to my friend’s gym on Carpenter Street. I want a healthy lifestyle, because I grew too big and I also work long hours. \xa0Hardworking.\n\xa0My dad — my inspiration to building my own business.\n\xa0\nYou’ve got to be prepared to lose a lot, in terms of personal time. You’ve got to put in 100%.\xa0You won’t be spending a lot of time with your loved ones, your friends, and your life will change.\xa0And take measured risks. Don’t just follow because you see someone else doing it.My target for Singapore is to be a household burger brand. We also want to diversify into different food concepts and brands, like what we did with Sembarang Nasi Lemak.\xa0For New York, we would love to expand and grow the roti john to other states, perhaps Los Angeles.\xa0Hopefully, in five years’ time, we can invest in more young people to run the brands.\xa0Starting off, I didn’t have the opportunity and people didn’t believe in me. Now, I want to help the younger generation to have a platform.\xa0\xa0Ashes Burnnit is on the GrabFood delivery service.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/20-questions-pastry-chef-janice-wong/:['20 Questions is a HungryGoWhere interview series with the who’s who of the F&B sector. You can’t talk about Singapore’s dessert scene without mentioning the country’s most prominent dessert and chocolate doyenne Janice Wong. \nWong, a Singaporean, fell into the world of culinary arts by chance through a life-changing farm trip in Melbourne, Australia, during her university days.\xa0Since then, the 39-year-old has never taken a break from the “pursuit of perfection in imperfection and imperfection in perfection”, as she tests the limits of traditional dessert, chocolate and pastry making.Having studied under American luminaries Thomas Keller and Grant Achatz, Spanish chocolatier virtuoso Oriol Balaguer and prodigious French pastry chef Pierre Herme, Wong started her first dessert restaurant, 2am:dessertbar, in Singapore in 2007.\n\nIn 2014, the Janice Wong Singapore brand was formally established to market a range of confectionery, including custom chocolate bon bons, cakes and ice cream sold in stores across Singapore. Her foray into the retail space has led to openings on various continents and at landmark hotels, expanding globally to include an outlet in London at Selfridges Oxford Street. Notable global tie-ups include Janice Wong MGM in Macau, Paradise City in Incheon, South Korea, and Kadewe in Berlin. \n\nMost would know Wong for her Willy Wonka-esque signature edible works of art. Her first solo exhibition at Huis Ten Bosch Nagasaki featured a rainfall of orchids, gum drops, drips and a vertical glow garden.\nShe’s also created whimsical installations of giant-sized watch parts for Richard Mille, a sky filled with suspended sugar diamonds for Tiffany & Co, and a floating chocolate lip sculpture for Guerlain.\xa0Wong was also behind a luminous edible hanging garden at the Ion Orchard shopping complex to mark Singapore’s 50th birthday. It comprised 2,000 sugar orchids and hanging hybrids, gummy flowers planted in chocolate soil, and chocolate green grass balls on the floor.Her accolades are numerous, with titles such as Asia’s Best Pastry Chef, Pastry Chef of the Year and Young Woman of the Year, on top of being constantly in the limelight on global TV food shows, events and competitions.\xa0Most recently, she made headlines for opening Pure Imagination, a chocolate cafe and full-scale chocolate production facility at Great World, where guests can learn first-hand about the entire chocolate-making process.\xa0Wong and her team have set a target to plant 1,000 cacao trees across the island at places such as Gardens by the Bay and Spectra Secondary School.\n\nWith such a star-studded resume, it felt a little nerve-racking to interview Wong. A seasoned pro with the media, she came across as firm and business-like. You got the sense that time was of the essence.\n\nYet she was warm and personable, too. She made the effort to get to know each of us, giving us a personalised tour of the place, adding us on Instagram and checking out our feeds, ensuring we were well-fed by ordering avocado toast, a beef burger off the menu and cups of hot chocolate (“we want the Janice Wong experience”, we told her), and making the interview seem more like a conversation between friends.\xa0I guess we got the Janice Wong experience. \n\nHere’s an edited excerpt of our interview.During the pandemic, everything was at a standstill and I felt an immense amount of inspiration to start growing cacao. \n\nWe knew we needed to create a new brand, and hence, Pure Imagination.\xa0Pure Imagination bean-to-bar is dedicated to hosting Singapore’s first single-origin chocolate, so on that note, we are quite excited. What we’ve been doing for one year is taking a lot of Singapore cacao, and we have been germinating them and making Singapore original chocolate trees.\xa0For all these years, there has never been a Singapore origin chocolate tree. The trees are all imported.\xa0It was important for me to create a movement that delivers cacao fresh to our doorstep and Singapore doesn’t have land, so I knew it was very important to find partners to plant the cacao trees.\xa0I started seeking out schools and rooftop gardens like Edible Garden City. The kids are tasked to take care of them and it’s very important to do that.\xa0To me, it’s about education, more than anything else. Now, we’re aiming to have 1,000 Singapore original trees.\xa0Our climate definitely allows it. In Johor Bahru, there are a lot of cacao trees across the border. We just don’t have land space… We’ve got kids as young as five years old and people of all ages who are interested, and that’s the beauty of it. I decided to visit the Amazon because I’ve always wanted to live there. It’s so amazing. There are lots of ingredients, and as a chef and artist, you’re always in discovery mode. You want to learn because it gives you inspiration.\nI lived in the forest and was taken to a lot of different farms. I was hosted by the locals, my chef friends. There were a lot of things growing together; the ecosystem doesn’t just support cacao plants, but vanilla, Amazonian honey and different types of fruit trees. That car accident definitely changed my perception of life — it’s short and you should really treasure every moment. It was a near-death experience for me, but it also made me reflect that it’s very important to be more daring with my pursuit of entrepreneurship. Singapore didn’t have that experience. Even if we had farms, they wouldn’t let you pick freely.\xa0The difference in Australia is that they give you a basket and let you pick from the ground. Here in Singapore, the parents will be like: “Oh, it’s dirty, must wash first.”\xa0We’re all brought up that way, in some sense or the other. Things are very clean here, the supermarkets are all super nice and clean, everything is wrapped. We never got to see where our food came from. I don’t think there’s one chef who has had the largest influence — it’s an accumulation of different chef friends.\xa0But one of them would be Peruvian chef Virgilio Martinez Veliz of Central Restaurante. He changed my perception by pushing the limits of education. He’s really documenting all the indigenous Peruvian ingredients — not just cooking for the sake of cooking, but educating the world about it.\xa0For me, it’s very important to continue experimenting, because you never know what you discover. Continuous learning. You never know what you’re going to create. Making mistakes is also very important.\xa0To me, it’s important that when you build a brand, it’s built to last. Brand-building is very important; the greater purpose is to inspire, deliver warm hospitality, create a family.I’m honoured. I’m just a chef-artist trying to make a change. I wouldn’t call myself a Superwoman. I don’t have a family with three kids, but if I do, maybe I’ll see myself that way. I like a lot of Japanese ingredients with umami, like miso or mustard; salt; and butter. Really good butter goes a long way. The biggest installation recently was at The Art Gallery of Western Australia. That one had 4,000 people involved over six days to create it. You go through an edible tunnel. For me, every time we do edible installations, we do better, we keep challenging ourselves to do something different. When we started expanding overseas, Indonesia, Thailand all came and asked if we could run a 2am:dessertbar there.\nBut we weren’t ready. Then Japan came, so that was our first overseas outlet.\xa0Then Hong Kong came, then Macau came, then we started opening all these.\xa0During the pandemic, we had to bring back a lot of resources to Singapore, which was a wise thing. We had a lot of overseas outlets not meant for takeaways. Even up till now, I like to handle media interviews on my own. Even though I have a public relations team, being personal has always been my thing.\xa0I don’t need to be babysitted all the time. I don’t have a personal assistant. I communicate a lot with people around the world. Even with my clients, it’s very personal when I host them. All our hotel clients, fashion clients, we service quite a lot of them. I like eating nasi lemak at The Coconut Club, but I eat in moderation. I don’t eat a lot of carbs. Other than that, it’s anything. I’m quite easygoing. I don’t eat many desserts now — it’s too much. It comes with age. When you’re past 35, you stop all that sugary stuff.\xa0So that’s why we have to rethink a lot of our concepts, our cakes — less sugar.Interview with the media in the morning, then I go back to work.\xa0No, really! I go to the different locations, meet a lot of my head chefs and managers. Spend a lot of time with my heads, head of business development, head of creative, and liaising with people from overseas outlets.\xa0And I go to a lot of events, get to know people and support the community.\xa0Tonight (on the day of our interview), I have a pop-up, in support of a friend, at Tiong Bahru Bakery. Then I’ll find somewhere to change into a gown, do my hair and makeup to attend a Prestige gala tonight. I end at 12am. And I was at the airport this morning at 8 with my producer who produced the Australia show (documenting my installation at The Art Gallery of Western Australia).\xa0I manage my own schedule. I still manage my own Instagram account, too.\xa0I have a flexible schedule — you just manage your time well. When there’s a problem, you find a solution.\xa0When you work with a team of 50, you’ve to empower all your heads to make their own decisions, because they will always be asking you things.\xa0And if they make a mistake, you have to note that you’ve empowered them and you’re ultimately responsible.\xa0It’s always about cost; if someone makes a mistake, buys a board of the wrong size, then you incur S$300 and you start nagging… \n\nI’m glad that our staff have stayed with us a long time.\xa0I have a young staff member, and I took a chance and sent her when she was 23 to open the Macau outlet because I believed she had a lot of talent. It jumpstarted her whole career and she jumped many hoops. She came back to help with Pure Imagination. I do yoga twice a week.\nIt still needs a lot more originality. Singapore is a very trendy city and there are a lot of bakeries that work, which is great, but I think we really need to push that further.\xa0In that sense, even for plated desserts as an experience, we’re still one of the few ones that do it. I want to create a family. I need to look for the perfect other half first.\xa0Before, it was all about the brand, personal development.\xa0At some point in your life, you need to ask yourself what’s really important.\xa0I’m actively looking. Let’s see what happens at tonight’s gala! I can’t do online dating, for sure. Too sweet, too cold, too small… so many things. It’s okay. As creatives, we need to be confident in putting out our products.\xa0Our success has shown that we’re confident in what we’re putting out; if not, we wouldn’t be around for the last 15 years. They think I’m very fierce. I can be when I need to, but most of the time, I’m chill. Janice Wong Pure Imagination is on the GrabFood delivery service.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/20-questions-clarence-chooi-nudedles-4/:['20 Questions is a HungryGoWhere interview series with the who’s who of the F&B sector.\n\nItalian pasta at Chinatown Complex Food Centre? It might seem an unlikely concept, given the area’s elderly demographic who might be less familiar with such atas Western dishes.But that gamble has paid off for chef turned hawker Clarence Chooi of Nudedles.4, a stall he started in December last year.The 28-year-old chef has been making headlines for turning out consistently affordable yet ridiculously flavourful food. Prices for his pastas range from S$4.50 to S$9.People might be surprised that Chooi didn’t enjoy cooking at first, when he took up a Nitec course in Western culinary arts at the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) College West.But everything changed after he underwent six-month internships at two-Michelin-starred modern British restaurant Jaan and the now-defunct Joel Robuchon Restaurant.\xa0After that, in 2013, he got the chance to train under the Institut Paul Bocuse programme, which accepts only a select few ITE students every year. As part of the programme, he worked at the Abbaye de Talloires restaurant in France for four months.Most recently, he did a two-year stint as chef de partie at the Spanish eatery Olivia Restaurant & Lounge before taking the dive into the hawker world.Earlier this year, the millennial chef made news for a month-long pop-up collaboration with Italian chef Mirko Febbrile, who worked at one-Michelin-starred restaurant Braci. Just 35 minutes after the pop-up opened, all 80 portions of pasta were sold out.Today, Nudedles.4 has no shortage of customers, from the young CBD workers who’ve become fast friends with Chooi and readily tag him on Instagram, to curious old folks turned pasta converts, and even a customer who pens passionate poems about his pasta.Despite all the media attention, Chooi comes across as the boy next door.He’s modest to a fault, dismissing his cooking prowess. “Honestly, I’m just throwing everything together,” he jokes.\xa0He dreams of travelling to Italy one day to explore and sample its produce.Most days, he toils alone.\xa0It’s hard work, but his passion for the craft shines through.\xa0It’s 3pm when we finally manage to find a pocket of time to speak to him.\xa0Over his lunch of fishball noodles, Chooi tells us how the last few years have been for him.Here’s an edited excerpt of our interview.He’s the first one to try something like this, serving Michelin Italian handmade pasta at a hawker centre in Chinatown.\xa0 We make the pasta on-site. That was the base. We did linguine al pesto, ricotta and tomato cavatelli, rigatoni alla carbonara and pappardelle oxtail ragu. Every product was from his hometown in Puglia, from the oil to the flour. \n\nThere was quite an overwhelming response from the general public. Even my neighbours were quite receptive to the month-long pop-up, from start to end, asking if they could have a portion, too. \n\nThe biggest insight was that I could meet more Italian suppliers through Mirko’s contacts. We brought in real Italian produce — it could range from olive oil, tomatoes to cheese, the basics of Italian cooking.\xa0Some suppliers don’t really want to send to hawkers because we’re small and don’t have as much spending power.\xa0But some close one eye and support us. I don’t use Mirko’s name when I contact them. I say I’m running an Italian stall using quality Italian produce. I will introduce myself to them, let them know what I need, and where I am. It was crazier than usual. What surprised me was how early the first customer started queuing. On the first day of the pop-up, the first person came at 8.30am. (We open at 11am.)\xa0There was one lady who came four to five times. In my head, I was like: “Yeah, I know you like our food… but give (other) people some chance also, lah.”As the days passed, people started to come earlier and earlier. I think it’s Singaporean kiasu-ness. We don’t dictate what time the queue starts, but if they want to come early, we can’t stop them.\xa0On the last day of the pop-up, someone queued from 6.30am.Actually it’s a damn stupid story. I did my N Levels and I got four points, so I was choosing courses and someone told me: “Eh, if you do culinary, you have a good future. It’s a skill you won’t lose. You have it for life.” I thought, why not?\n\nSo I enrolled in ITE College West, where I took up a Nitec course in Western culinary arts. I hated it for the first one-and-a-half years. Not hated, but I didn’t really have the passion for it.It was only when I underwent internships at Jaan and Joel Robuchon Restaurant that I realised that the culinary course was quite nice.\xa0I got to try a lot of exotic products like caviar, foie gras, at 18 or 19 years old. A lot of people don’t get a chance to taste these, maybe only at a later stage in life when they have the spending power. I got to try them for free on a daily basis.\xa0That was what made me grow deeper into the culinary world — the endless amount of products you can taste and experience. For Asians, we’re better with spices, the French are more attuned to their butter, cream; we are exposed to different ingredients altogether.\xa0I have more responsibility but more liberty to do whatever dishes I want. In a restaurant, I am always following someone else’s recipe. Here, I can come up with whatever recipe I want and I get to cook what I want, instead of cooking someone else’s dishes. \n\nThe most recent fine-dining restaurant I worked at was Olivia. I left in February 2021, and took eight to nine months to do my business, set up my hawker stall. The biggest challenge for me was to churn out proper recipes, not only for me to follow but for my future employees to follow.\xa0I would say being your own boss or a hawker is better, but at the same time, you also have more responsibilities. You have to make sure to pay suppliers on time, pay bills, pay rent.\xa0These are things nobody will tell you that you need to do. You just have to experience it for yourself. I’ve always wanted to open a pasta-based stall. I’ve always been selling pasta from day one. I sat down with myself and said: “If I want to sell pasta, I must sell pasta. I don’t want to break away from that.” In Singapore, we lack affordable pasta at good prices. The older generation will look at the menu and say they don’t know how to eat pasta. So I’m trying to bridge that gap for them and for everyone. I had a regular customer who’s 60, 70 years old, and she just likes to come back to my stall to eat the lobster bisque.\xa0For me, it’s the satisfaction — I can impact an elderly person’s life by introducing pasta to her. \nAs for the name, Nudedles was created using two words: Nude and noodles. By itself, noodles are naked, plain, ordinary. I had this mission to sort of dress it up with a sauce or various ingredients.\xa0And I just like the number 4.It depends on the trend. For the first three months, I was selling 90 per cent lobster bisque every day. Now it’s leaning to the lighter stuff, the pesto, and something more meaty, like beef bolognese.\xa0I’m easygoing, hard on myself, and ambitious. \n\nTo open an Italian stall in Chinatown takes quite a lot of ambition.\xa0\xa0Before this, I went to various hawker centres like Amoy. I did my research and found that Chinatown Complex Food Centre has one of the better crowds for lunch and for office crowds.\xa0When I was working at Olivia nearby, I used to frequent this food centre for lunch thrice a week, so I got to see how the crowd was like. Pre-Covid, the situation was that you could never get a table here. I guess it’s a good spot. It’s something familiar and there’s so much food.\xa0Being able to eat good food!\xa0It’s something you can buy with money, but at a young age, you don’t have spending power, unless you’re from a rich family.\xa0So I guess it was a really good start to my culinary career. I got exposed to many expensive ingredients, especially from France, from meats to seafood to some things I’ve never seen in Singapore, like old pigeon, yellow chicken and langouste.\xa0The hours. But I still think it’s one of the most honest jobs in the world. Food makes people happy, or angry.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Junction Westgate opening with promos; will house 23 tenants, including new halal teppanyaki\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHawker Hustlers: Hipster hawker Ray Yeo of Bei-Ing Dimsum Club on reinventing dim sum and his love for all things Japan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have a few Chinese-speaking customers who went from “don’t know how to eat” (in Mandarin) to “very delicious”.

Just take it with a pinch of salt, see whether or not I need to make any improvements. If you ask me if there’s someone I’d like to emulate, I’d say nobody. I don’t have any culinary idol that I’m a die-hard fan of or that I follow.\xa0The culinary scene is quite broad, so I told myself that there’s no point to learn from just one person. Best if I learn from as many chefs as I can.\xa0I don’t just learn about culinary techniques, but values like professionalism, how you conduct yourself in the kitchen. Every chef has a good repertoire of knowledge — whether or not I want to acquire that knowledge from them is a different story. What I learnt from Mirko? He’s a chef of a different calibre, a Michelin chef. I can’t compare; he’s so far ahead.\xa0But the best thing I learnt from him was how to do things the traditional way, but the traditional way might not always be the right way. At the end of the day, I’m still serving 90 per cent Singaporeans. But taste buds are always changing, and maybe even the aunty and uncle might want something different. Hokkien mee at Bukit Batok, quite close to where I live. Yesterday, I had hokkien mee.\xa0I love noodles in general. Even now, (when I’m talking to you), I’m having fishball noodles.On a normal work day, I usually wake up at 7am. It depends on how much there is to do for the day. Prep work is until 11am, and then I open.\nFrom 11am till after I finish the lunch crowd, I won’t do any prep.\xa0From 2pm onwards, I can start to slowly clean the stall and prep. Right now, I try to end at about 6.30pm and spend some time with my parents for dinner. My mum usually cooks steamed fish and minced pork with tofu, and a small plate of veggies, like kailan with oyster sauce or ladies’ fingers with light sauce.\xa0At night, I’ll do the business stuff. Because I have different forms of payment, I need to make sure all the payments are accounted for. My girlfriend helps me with Instagram because she’s the more creative one. For me, I’m cooped up here (at the stall) doing the preparation, so I have no time. \n\nNormally, I close on Mondays, but I’ll still be back at the stall doing preparations for the next day. So not really a rest day. It’s more like the day when I wake up late.So many! I have a list of dishes that I want to try. I want to try handmade gnocchi, cacio e pepe, another cheese-based dish. Another one would be a cold pasta salad.During my last holiday in May, I went to France and London with my girlfriend.\xa0We spent our time touring, visiting Buckingham Palace in London.

Now I’m doing this, of course I can do it. But whether or not I can do it to sustain the family, then it’s a different thing, so I must change the focus. \n\nAnd the third one is sleep.\n\nLast night, I slept around 4am. I was busy churning out some new recipes. Normally, I sleep around 1am.\xa0At night, I usually play games with my friends, just to talk to them and destress. I guess that’s an important part of my day. I get to work, have dinner with my family, and spend some time with my friends.Get good. When you’re playing a game like League of Legends, the person is telling you to become better; don’t be such a noob. For the time being, I want to settle down in Chinatown until I hit a year here.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/20-questions-maira-yeo-cloudstreet/:['20 Questions is a HungryGoWhere interview series with the who’s who of the F&B sector.It’s a sunny weekday afternoon when I meet pastry chef Maira Yeo, 30, in her lush domain above the two-Michelin-starred Cloudstreet along Amoy Street.In the most rudimentary terms, it’s a dessert-and-drinks lounge — Cloudstreet diners and staff refer to it as simply “the second floor” — situated on top of the fine-dining restaurant’s main space.After their meals, diners make their way upstairs, where they are served cheese, port and innovative desserts that transcend the usual sweet and creamy notes.This is where Yeo holds court.The upstairs space is, in Yeo’s words, “very much more, in a way, feminine”, compared with the restaurant’s main area, where Cloudstreet chef-owner Rishi Naleendra orchestrates much of the gastronomic action.Bright light filters into the cosy lounge, appointed ornately with luxurious touches — plush couches, intricate floral arrangements and more.\xa0But the devil is in the details.\xa0Think butterflies, jaguars and Sri Lankan tribal chiefs hidden in the wallpaper, dried cacao pods refashioned into a floral centrepiece, and even a callback to the era of Chinatown’s opium houses by way of dramatic drapes between each richly marbled tabletop.Dressed simply in a black tee, Yeo takes our interview like a pro.For the recently crowned Asia’s Best Pastry Chef, interactions with the media have been par for the course. As have public appearances, video shoots and workshops — including one at the recent Singapore Food Festival.\xa0It was something she had to get used to, and has gotten better at, out of sheer necessity, says Yeo.But you wouldn’t know that, listening to her. Prepared but not rehearsed, our conversation flows freely, with thoughtful answers that offer slivers of insight into her drive, ambition and, at times, vulnerability.In speaking about her work and career, Yeo has a no-nonsense air about her. But turn the conversation to her — so to speak — “origin story”, and she gets a little sheepish.\xa0It’s not often that someone discovers her life calling from watching TV, but that’s exactly what Yeo did. My Name is Kim Sam-soon, a popular Korean drama about a talented pastry chef that aired in the mid-2000s, sealed the deal for her.Despite her accolades, Yeo is careful not to assign syrupy platitudes to her life’s work. She’s dedicated to it but won’t quite call it a passion.At one point, I asked her how her love of pastries bloomed.\xa0“Love is a very complicated emotion. So let’s not get involved in that,” she says matter-of-factly.\xa0Like her words, some of Yeo’s desserts eschew the usual saccharine cloy of sugar. They depart from convention by being primarily savoury, starring non-traditional ingredients such as vinegar, lettuce and coriander.\xa0Each dessert is carefully curated and greater than the sum of its parts.Here’s an edited excerpt of our interview:It was my mum. She used to do a lot of baking at home and I used to help out a lot as a kid. She likes to have an extra hand to do all the small details, like dividing the dough.\nI was basically there to help her with her projects.So pastry wasn’t something foreign to me — it was something that felt very typical. But I didn’t really think of having it as a career, as a job.There was this Korean drama that I watched. The opening of every episode always had a life lesson integrated with some pastry principles.\xa0That intrigued me even more. Especially when you’re at the age of 14 or 15, you’re going through that whole finding-your-identity-and-being-a-dramatic-teenager stuff. As though you were going to find the meaning of life by doing pastry.The show was My Name is Kim Sam-soon. It doesn’t sound so cool when I say the title like that, haha. That was back in 2005 — it was a big hit.That was how I decided to do pastry.Law. You know how, as a teenager, you always have arguments with your parents and just have reasons to debate with them?\nThat’s how I was — always justifying my point of view and trying to get them to understand. In turn, they used to say things like “oh, since you like to argue so much, you should just go be a lawyer”.In secondary school, teachers would pick me for the debate team, and I thought: “Oh, it’ll be quite nice to debate.”Even if it’s not a side you believe in, it’s quite exciting to know how to deliver a specific message, or to persuade people to a certain point of view.This was until someone told me I’d need to memorise the whole law book — I don’t know if that’s true or not — and then I realised “nope, that’s not my thing”.At that point, I was going to do my O Levels. I knew I wanted to study hard enough to get into the culinary and catering management programme at Temasek Polytechnic, because that was pretty much the only relevant course available at that time in a government-affiliated institution.\nThere was also At-Sunrice GlobalChef Academy and Shatec, but my parents said they’d be more comfortable if I went to a government school. It was a nice compromise, so I did that.I did my internship with the Garibaldi Group’s pastry production kitchen, and stayed with them for another three years or so.After that, I went to work under the Luke Mangan Group at Salt.I took a little break before starting at Meta, where I was for four to five years. Around the end of my time there, I felt I had to break out of what I was doing.\xa0I was already the group pastry chef there, and I had kind of reached the peak of what I could do within the company.\xa0I couldn’t see how I was going to provide more value, and I wanted to see how much better I could be.\xa0The best way to do that was to leave my position, go work for some of the best restaurants in the world, and start from the bottom.\xa0I wanted to start as an intern all over again, to get a new perspective and see things in a new light.I was working in Norway for a while, and when the pandemic hit, I had to come back to Singapore. Chef Rishi at that time didn’t have a pastry chef, and he asked me to come in and set up the pastry programme at Cloudstreet.I wasn’t supposed to join full-time. It was going to be a short stint, to set up the structure and provide recipes, so that they could run their own thing afterwards.But now, here we are.The second-floor lounge.\xa0At that time, I was still waiting for Norway to get back about my visa.\xa0It took so long. During the pandemic, there were so many things going on that they couldn’t process it.So I ended up biding my time.I remember it was a couple of weeks shy of the whole second-floor project being completed — we had furniture in already — when Norway got back to me about my visa. They were like “hey, do you still want to come back?”Well, I would love to, but I can’t. I’ve a responsibility now over here.Chef gave me this opportunity, and all this belief and trust. It’s a massive investment, and he’s doing it in the middle of Covid-19, when everyone is struggling.\xa0He took a massive chance on me, too, so it was not fair for me to leave — to just say “I’m gonna do what I want to do; I’m going to take care of myself”.\xa0So I turned Norway down. I wanted to make this work.(Our diners) don’t have a choice. At Cloudstreet, there’s only one tasting menu — they just have to try it, haha.\nThe main dessert now is Celeriac. We’ve a bit of vanilla rose cream, with salt-baked celeriac and deep-fried capers. It’s covered with a layer of rose-pickled guava, and on top, we have celeriac ice cream to finish it off.Aesthetically, the idea was inspired by the weaving culture in Sri Lanka. The way the guava slices are arranged resembles a weaving pattern.\xa0This dessert came about because I just wanted to use roses. It’s a prominent flavour in Sri Lankan desserts, and in Singapore, rose makes me think about bandung (a rose syrup drink).For most people, they get intrigued when they hear “fried capers”.\xa0I love fried capers. When you have them in beef tartare, they have nice bursts of umami, salt and brininess. They always go so well with something that’s creamy and fatty, to help cut through all that.It makes sense to use it in a dessert because there’s usually so much fat and cream. You just need something small to make it more balanced.Especially so if you’re having a tasting menu, where at the end of it, you just need to feel excited about eating.We also have the Watermelon dessert. It’s a bit of hay curd underneath that we serve with pickled kombu and watermelon rind chutney. There’s a bit of salted condensed milk ice cream, and we cover it with watermelon granita at the tableside.We also have Soursop that’s infused with juniper berries, milk curd, fresh jambu slices, and kaffir lime leaf powder.Salt and vinegar.\nWhenever we create a dish, one factor that we think about is “okay, so where’s the acid coming from? And how — what acid are we bringing in?”Having acid changes so much — it brightens the dish, lifts everything up. And it provides you with the balance you need.\xa0We get to work with different vinegars. It helps to have such a wide range to work with.For example, in our Celeriac dish, the rose vinegar we use is made in-house. We get fresh roses from this lady called Ting Ting. She grows the roses in Singapore.It’s insane that she managed to grow them in Singapore. And they’re of really good quality.We infuse the roses in champagne vinegar. We let them sit for a good month at least, to make sure all the flavours come out slowly and nicely, and age them for a bit. Then we use them for our dessert.I don’t really know how I managed to get this award. I didn’t apply for it or anything — it was a really big surprise to me as well, when it was announced.\nI do still think that it was pure luck, but at the same time, I know this wouldn’t be possible without the support of my team at Cloudstreet.My day-to-day hasn’t really changed much since then. I still do prep. I’m still very involved with kitchen work and also with service.Pretty much the only thing that has changed is that media interviews are more common now.\xa0It’s also nice to travel more for work. That’s one thing I really like with the current exposure that’s been given — I’m very thankful for that.I try not to draw so much inspiration from other pastry chefs.\nI get inspired by pastry chefs who have their own distinct personality, when it comes to the food they make. It makes me want to have that sort of distinctiveness as well.For example, Francisco Migoya — he’s this amazing pastry chef. He is the chef of the Modernist Cuisine kitchen now.The way he processes pastry and how it’s presented — it’s very him. No one else in the world does what he does.So I wouldn’t say I get inspiration from him, to do exactly what he does — his flavour profiles and such — but he does set that example, which is that it’s very important to have your own sense of identity and aesthetic.I want to follow that, where I can develop something of my own, instead of doing something that you can see on Instagram.There are things I see that are pretty cool. It can be small things.\nThe other day, I saw this guy who was doing a video on making flat cupcake tops.\xa0He piped the buttercream, flipped it over, and then put it in the chiller to set. And then when he removed it, it was flat.I’d never thought of that before, like that actually makes sense.I don’t make cupcakes as part of my daily life, but in the future, I could play on that sort of technique.\xa0So I think it’s cool — it helps to bring new light to certain topics and it’s up to us as individuals to see how we’re going to work with it.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSingapore Food Festival 2023: More than 100 food options & over S$2k in prizes to be won\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHawker Hustlers: Happiness is a warm Mian Mian Bu Duan Peanut Pancake\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Scratch: How beef rendang is made and the best places to get it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe basically stuck with the same designer that we had for the first floor of Cloudstreet.\xa0The only reason it looks so different is that the designer wanted to show the history of Amoy Street. It’s very much more, in a way, feminine, because there used to be a lot of opium houses and some brothels. So we have some nice dramatic curtains here.In the decor itself, there are still some touches of Sri Lanka. On the wallpaper, you can see all the nature, animals, fauna, and humans native to Sri Lanka. The people featured there are the tribal chiefs.She (the designer) has this crazy eye for detail. But I like how she does things in a way that’s still subtle.\xa0I told chef Rishi that I wanted a wooden surface for the pastry pass — for easier prep and the sound. I don’t generally like the sound of plates on marble, and I found that wood can have a softer sound in comparison. When I told her about it, she thought it was cool and that she could make it into a nice, raised block that would resemble a cheeseboard.Even in the flower arrangements, we’ve these cacao pods that have been dried, cut up and refashioned into a flower — yet another subtle detail that hints to you that this is a pastry floor.Barbary Coast. The interior is very dramatic. The people who work there are so nice and the cocktails are always so tasty.\nYou also have a sense of privacy as well — it’s one of the small details my friends and I love. You can hear the music, but the acoustics are so well-positioned that you can’t hear other people’s conversations. You don’t need to raise your voice.It’s so well thought out. It’s on the pricier side, but at the same time, it brings you this level of comfort.Chef Sun Kim from Meta has played a very big role in my career. He was the first person to make me his pastry chef, and I was so young then.\nI was definitely underprepared for that job, but he took a chance on me. I was 24 when I was the pastry chef at Meta, and we got the Michelin star when I was 25.He gave me that opportunity and that freedom to do anything I wanted. Even now, after I’ve left Meta for some time, he’s still so proud of me and my achievements.The relationship we have now is more like family. In Korean, for females, you call an older brother “oppa”, but I don’t have a very feminine personality, so I call him “hyung”. He’s like a big brother to me and he really looks out for me a lot.He’s still the person I go to sometimes when I have difficulties. I know that whenever he gives me advice, he has my back. It’s very rare to have that.I usually get up around 8am to 9am, laze around for a bit, then I leave.\nI live very close to Cloudstreet, so it’s just a 15-minute walk. On my way in, I grab a cup of coffee.By 10am, I’m in the kitchen and we start prepping.Around 4.30pm, we take a little break. Service downstairs usually starts at 6.30pm, but the pastry team is usually still preparing by then. If not, we’ll help out with service on the first floor.Guests start coming up here around 8.30pm and that’s when pastry service starts, until about midnight.Usually, I’m home by 1.30am. Usually, when I walk in or home from work, I’d put some music on. Obviously, to start off the day, it’s more to pump you up. I listen to a lot of Eminem, Linkin Park, Metallica, stuff like that — more hard rock.\nOn my way home, it’s more chill, to relax myself. When I reach home, all that tension from a whole round of service is out.\xa0If things aren’t so busy that day, maybe I’ll listen to Taylor Swift, Adele, The XX, or one of Spotify’s daily mixes.I missed the soups my family used to cook. When I was still living with my parents, there would be soup at every meal. Those with dried scallops and dried sotong that would be boiled for four hours, minimum. Even when I had grown up, that was a staple at every meal.\nIt’s a very Cantonese thing. You need to have soup at every meal. If there’s no soup, the meal isn’t complete. And you can’t get that sort of soup overseas that easily, and I didn’t have the time to do it myself as well.It’s a difficult environment to rise in, in general. The F&B industry is not an easy place to work in — not just because it’s male-dominated.\nAt Cloudstreet, we do things very differently. I work a lot of hours, but not everyone works the hours I do. I work these hours because I choose to.Our head chef and sous chef — they both have three kids — and they’re still able to balance their work and personal lives.For our junior staff, we try to schedule proper eight-, nine-hour shifts for them. Not many restaurants run at the level we’re running at, and we try to make sure our staff work a maximum of 50 hours per week.For a lot of people, that’s a lot of hours — a normal schedule would be 44 hours per week. But in this industry, some of the best restaurants do a 90-hour work week, at the minimum.That’s not how we want to run things at Cloudstreet. It’s very important, for us and chef Rishi, that we try to provide the best we can for staff, and in return, that’s how they’ll be able to do the best for the company.I don’t think it’s about gender. People have different priorities. To put it very bluntly, it’s not a priority for my personal life to be married, and then to have a child. But for others, it might be.\xa0Traditionally, it would be the females’ burden to take care of. But it’s 2022, everyone is more involved, so that’s why we have a more balanced lifestyle for the staff at Cloudstreet. If it’s a quick weekend trip, I’d go to Johor Bahru — a place that’s nearby — for a quick recharge.\nI follow the typical Singaporean schedule, where you go into JB for a massage, sing karaoke, eat lok-lok (hotpot skewers), and then you come back to Singapore.Bak chor mee (minced meat noodles), but only if it’s good. It’s so hard to get good bak chor mee these days.\nIt needs that good amount of black vinegar and nice sambal chilli.I live in the CBD now, and it’s not easy to get a good bowl in this area. It’s just not the bak chor mee I grew up eating.\xa0So I’m still on the hunt for a really good stall where I don’t have to worry about the consistency of the dish.I’ve had the Michelin-starred Hill Street Tai Hwa Pork Noodle before — that was pretty good.I would tell her to work harder. Things will fall into place.\nI’m not big on big plans.\nBefore the pandemic, I did have these plans to move and work outside Singapore, but after Covid-19, it totally changed my mindset.My (initial visa application to work in Norway) was rejected (because of the pandemic) and I was super upset about it, to be very honest. It took me a very long time to get over it.With the pandemic, it made me realise that no matter how much you plan, things won’t exactly follow through.For me, whatever happens, happens. I just need to make full use of opportunities that come up, and make the most of them.My focus is still on Cloudstreet. We’re still such a young restaurant and there’s so much potential.\xa0It’s really exciting to be a part of this growth and to see how much better we could become and improve.\xa0Book a ride to Cloudstreet.\xa084 Amoy Street\nNearest MRT station: Telok Ayer\nOpen: Tuesday to Thursday (6.30pm onwards), Friday and Saturday (12pm to 2.30pm, 6.30pm onwards) 84 Amoy Street\nNearest MRT station: Telok Ayer\nOpen: Tuesday to Thursday (6.30pm onwards), Friday and Saturday (12pm to 2.30pm, 6.30pm onwards) AuthorJia-En has worn several hats in her career — first writing TV scripts, then food and lifestyle stories at Wine & Dine.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/20-questions-leong-sheen-jet-proper-concepts/:['20 Questions is a HungryGoWhere interview series with the who’s who of the F&B sector.To say Leong Sheen Jet is a busy man might be an understatement. The 30-year-old launched four restaurant concepts with his business partners in rapid succession, one after another in the thick of the Covid-19 pandemic.\xa0The former fintech professional launched The Feather Blade in March 2019, Rappu in November 2020, Mezcla in October 2021, and Goho Kaiseki & Bar in March 2022. (For the moment, Mezcla is available only for event hires and catering.)\xa0As we delve into his methods, we can see that his approach is anything but foolhardy — the plan for his first restaurant concept was already in motion since his undergraduate days when he majored in finance.\xa0Leong knocked on the door of London steakhouse Flat Iron and spent a year working there.\xa0Armed with lessons from Flat Iron and a private-dining service he ran in mid-2015 in Singapore, he put together a 25,000-word dissertation as part of his undergraduate studies. It was a business proposal for his steakhouse concept The Feather Blade.Seven years after his Flat Iron stint, he now runs Proper Concepts — which manages these dining concepts — with four business partners.\xa0They are beverage director Boo Jing Heng, creative director Joel Wong, finance and human resources director Daniel Wong, and Wilfred Ong, who’s in charge of legal matters.\xa0Our hour-long interview is peppered with talk of business strategies.It’s intriguing to hear Leong speak about the advent and operation of his businesses in such a methodological and considered manner — you almost feel as if you’re watching an episode of The Apprentice.\xa0Here’s a lightly edited excerpt of the interview:My F&B career started when I was completing my undergraduate studies in London (in 2015). That’s where I stumbled upon a steakhouse called Flat Iron. Flat Iron is a very popular steakhouse in London specialising in £10 (S$15.50) steaks — great vibes, great service, all at a very affordable price point.\xa0What I did next was work part-time there to learn their operating model, and then pick up learnings to start my own concept in Singapore, which is called The Feather Blade…\xa0… I knocked on Flat Iron’s door maybe two, three times and submitted my CV. They were already looking for staff, but it took some time to get in. On the third time, I got an interview, and I was the only Chinese and Asian dude in the restaurant then. I was there for a year, mostly on the floor — in the bar, kitchen and butchery. Cooking was something I took an interest in, out of necessity because I had to learn how to cook. I experimented a lot with cooking in London because you’re on a student budget and you can’t eat out all the time. I really got into cooking when I discovered a gadget called Anova, a sous vide machine.\xa0When I bought that, it opened my world up to a whole different side of cooking. It’s a very fine dining tool that’s now been made accessible to households. From there, I learnt how to cook a greater variety of food.\xa0That (discovery) happened to coincide with the time when I discovered Flat Iron. I then put two and two together that they (Flat Iron) actually cook their steaks using sous vide.\xa0I also took a liking to cooking when my grandmother would come to Singapore (from Australia) and cook. In the months leading up to moving to London to study, I spent a lot of time with her cooking and sourcing ingredients. We would go to the wet markets and learn how she picks out stuff, different types of meats and cuts.\xa0Before that, I worked part-time in the F&B sector as a student, learning the ropes because I thought it would be a humbling experience. The biggest parallel was that when you’re in a start-up (referring to his past fintech stint), in a start-up mode, you have to be hands-on and wear multiple hats, be ready to pivot quickly, try and fail quickly, and learn from those experiences.\xa0I applied the same principle of keeping the momentum going and being agile when starting The Feather Blade. I made sure we had tastings done regularly and had next steps lined up — just very good project-management principles that apply across both start-up and corporate culture to a restaurant culture.\xa0In a similar vein, what fintech is to the finance industry is that it goes against the grain of traditional finance. That’s very much in my DNA when it comes to creating F&B concepts in Singapore.\xa0At The Feather Blade, we serve only one main cut of steak on our menu and it’s not a prime cut. So that, in itself, already goes against the grain for most steakhouses. It was probably the only steakhouse back then focusing on one cut of steak. That was a huge gamble. We tried to mitigate this risk by ensuring that the quality of the steak was good enough for what you get. The Feather Blade (as a concept) started as a private-dining service in the summer of 2015. My peers would typically sign themselves up for internships and whatnot, but I figured: Why not take a different route and start a private-dining service?\xa0I would host events at my clients’ venues, and I would cook them a multi-course meal centred on the featherblade steak and sides. This ran for about 10 weeks.\xa0We had to create a whole branding around that, take photos and curate the menu. The name featherblade is a synonym for “flat iron” — names of the cut of steak that we serve. The featherblade is cut from the shoulder of the cow. It was only in the last decade or so that butchers found that this was a very prized cut nestled between the sinews of the oyster blade.\xa0So I did private dining, worked at Flat Iron and wrote my dissertation on The Feather Blade from a business perspective. (After that,) I did get interest from restaurant groups in Singapore to open this concept, but the timing wasn’t right because I was then accepted into Cambridge in 2016 for my master’s in management. So I pursued that first and graduated in 2017.\xa0That delayed the plan for The Feather Blade. On the back of that, I got a job at a bank in London called OakNorth, which spun off a fintech company called OakNorth Analytics. I was moved there to help launch their presence in the Asia-Pacific, so I moved back to Singapore in 2018.\xa0In March 2019, I was still with the company, but as a side project, I decided to relaunch The Feather Blade as a pop-up on Club Street. Much of my role was marketing-focused, not operations, so I didn’t have to be on the ground so often.\xa0First day, we gave out free steaks. It was eight weekends long — full from day one.It depends on the concept. For example, for Goho, we didn’t have a pop-up or private dining — it was an eight-week project (to set up the restaurant) and we couldn’t squeeze that into eight weeks.We’re in the process of transitioning to scaling existing concepts and creating new concepts. We’re in a hybrid mode now.\xa0We’ve a new concept coming up in October, featuring one of the more famous celebrity chefs out there. We’re partnering him to bring a mid-market concept to Singapore.\xa0Rappu is a place where you’ve sushi handrolls alongside kickass R&B, rap and hip-hop tunes.\xa0Mezcla is a Japanese-Mexican taco and tequila affair.Goho is a kaiseki hideaway featuring contemporary Japanese cuisine and cocktails.The Feather Blade is a steakhouse where you can find proper steaks and cocktails.The name has to tie in with the concept. The Feather Blade is very clear-cut — it’s the name of the steak. When you say “Feather Blade”, it also alludes to something that’s no-nonsense and has the tone of voice where you know we mean business and we’re here to give you a good steakhouse experience.With Rappu, we wanted to come up with a name that was catchy. I Googled the word “wrap”, because at the end of the day, a sushi handroll is a wrap, and “rappu” came up.\xa0“Rappu” is a Japanese word for two things — one is “to wrap” like a sushi handroll, or rap music. This naturally guided the kind of music we would play here. When you dine at Rappu, you get sushi handrolls alongside rap, R&B and hip-hop. It also guided the look and feel, because with that kind of music going on here, it’s more like a club.Mezcla is a Mexican word for “to blend” and “mix”, and Mezcla is our attempt to bridge the gap between Singaporeans and Mexican food. Mexican food is highly popular here, but mostly with expats. My partners and I have loved Mexican food for the longest time, and we figured, what better way to do (this concept) than to blend Singapore’s favourite foreign cuisine, Japanese, with Mexican food?\xa0Goho was our first foray into something more fine-dining-focused because we always wanted to test that market but also make it affordable. Goho means the five ways, and it alludes to the five Japanese culinary techniques involved in the kaiseki form of cuisine. It’s a multi-course meal that’s arranged in a certain permutation and also features seasonality.Rappu was one of the positives coming out of Covid — we would not have Rappu if it were not for Covid. It’s a classic example of how you make the most out of a situation and find opportunities in adversity.My business partner Joel Wong is an architect based in Los Angeles, US. He got stuck in Singapore because of Covid. He came back to Singapore for a friend’s wedding and couldn’t fly out because of the circuit breaker (partial lockdown) in 2020, so he stayed on.\xa0After the circuit breaker, we caught up, and then we talked about the idea of trying this new concept that we heard of in LA, involving handrolls. It’s a handroll bar — you do it over the counter. The next week, we were experimenting with recipes, getting in different kinds of rice, vinegar, salt, seaweed, and sashimi to test the concept.\xa0Every weekend, we started holding private-dining sessions at his place for a few of our friends and family to try the product.\xa0The whole point of running these events was not just to get arbitrary responses. We wanted quantifiable metrics (from survey forms at the dining events), so that we’d be better informed going into the pop-up or a full-scale restaurant, like how to price.\xa0We had to model this business based on Covid scenarios. With social distancing being the major factor, (we asked ourselves): Can we still run profitably because social distancing reduces your capacity?… Can our restaurant run on a 30 to 40 per cent reduction in capacity? We had to run the financial models and scenario analysis to make sure it works out.\xa0We opened Rappu in November 2020 and we broke even in four months.\xa0The focus for existing brands, as they mature, is to establish them as go-to brands for their respective cuisines. We’ll continue keeping things fresh by coming up with collabs, creating new products and merchandise, and looking to expand them locally or overseas. There’s a “happy-exciting” and a “scary-exciting”. The first (happy) one would be the initial foray into F&B, putting things together, learning how a bar, a kitchen and the floor should run. That was really fun, and I was doing what I loved.For my dissertation, especially, it was supposed to be a 10,000-word document, which most people dread because it’s such a tedious process. But I really enjoyed working on it. My dissertation ended up being 25,000 words long, to which my supervisors said “don’t worry about the word count, because you’re actually going to work on it (the restaurant)”.\xa0The other, not-so-fun but thrilling moment was manoeuvring through the circuit breaker. It was the challenge of tackling a problem as large as the circuit breaker and the various heightened alerts that came after.\xa0For the first circuit breaker, we had only The Feather Blade. In the subsequent heightened alert, we had Rappu, too, so we had to pivot the business. These challenges helped me and my team grow, being able to weather the storm and come out victorious. These moments are very special for me as well as for my company.The most rewarding moment is to see satisfied customers on a daily basis who come and dine in, and enjoy themselves here.\xa0I read reviews every day. It’s my morning digest — I get email alerts.\xa0You’ve to be able to swallow the negative ones and filter out the noise. With negative reviews, there’s the constructive and the non-constructive, so any good business owner should be able to separate his emotions from the business objectives. No, not at all. Everything happens for a reason and we are here today in our best shape possible, given the circumstances that have panned out over the years.\xa0I’m very satisfied.\xa0For The Feather Blade, I highly recommend the Feather Blade Burger. We deep-fry the patty in beef fat, so it’s crispy on the outside but still juicy on the inside.At Rappu, I highly recommend the High Roller. It’s the epitome of the Rappu experience.At Mezcla, the salmon taco. The taco shell is made of salmon skin and deep-fried, so it’s super crispy. Then you have salmon sashimi and salmon roe — so you have salmon in three ways in one taco.\xa0Goho is a multi-course dining experience, so there’s not one dish that I’ll pick a la carte. But the highlight there would be the Hassun, a platter featuring seasonal ingredients and showcasing the chef’s technique.It varies. The first thing I wake up, I respond to priority messages. I try to get in a workout on most days. I’ve lunch and then head to the restaurant for mid-afternoon meetings with the management team, my partners and also tastings that might happen.Evenings are usually spent entertaining guests and getting feedback. Sometimes, we head out for industry visits. We pay a visit to our friends in the bar or restaurant scene to show our support, connect with them and discuss ideas on how to better the industry.So far, it’s Noma in Copenhagen, which is the world’s best restaurant with three Michelin stars. I was there in May. Peaty whiskies, like a Lagavulin 16. Probably a management consultant. I had aspirations to be an investment banker or a management consultant.When I landed the gig at OakNorth, it was a great opportunity because I was working alongside the co-founders. That’s where I really learnt a lot about managing and scaling a business from a sales and an operations perspective. It’d be Rappu, because I love sushi. We also have izakaya (items), so that gives it more versatility.\xa0 Chicken rice. I’m in this for the long haul. So what’s next for me is to continue building the business. Come what may. The Feather Blade, Rappu and Mezcla are on the GrabFood delivery service. You can also book a ride to The Feather Blade, Rappu and Goho Kaiseki & Bar.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/20-questions-chef-lennard-yeong/:['20 Questions is a HungryGoWhere interview series with the who’s who of the F&B sector.\xa0I’d seen the glossy pictures of Lennard Yeong plastered over social media and slick editorial magazines. Suave with K-pop star good looks, and airbrushed to perfection.And I’d read his story: An engineer by training, the 34-year-old became a self-taught cook after realising the kitchen was his escape. After he made the finals of the 2015 edition of MasterChef Asia, he made the leap into the food world.Today, he’s the in-house chef at Miele Singapore, which sells luxury home appliances. \n\nYeong cooks at Miele’s events, such as cooking demos and private meals. He also creates content for social media in the Miele kitchen.\n\nWhen I first reached out to him in March with the prospect of an interview, his schedule was packed. It took two months before we fixed a date to meet.\n\nWhen the day came in May, Yeong was disarmingly warm and down-to-earth. Dressed in a casual singlet, he invited us into his home in West Coast. Watching us nearby with amusement were his parents — Yeong’s biggest cheerleaders.\xa0 \n\nThe one-and-a-half hours we were there — yes, Yeong was so seasoned with interviews everything ran like clockwork — felt like a far cry from the polished dialogues that are second nature to many influencers.\xa0Our interview was personal and intimate, without the theatrics.\xa0\xa0Here’s a lightly edited excerpt:\n\xa0Turning 30. I always wondered if I could make a career in food and I realised, getting close to 30, that if I didn’t do it now, I’d probably never do it. It felt like a now-or-never kind of situation. MasterChef was when I was around 27 or 28, but after that, I went back to engineering.I did it for two more years and eventually quit. I never really fit into the engineering world. At that time, I didn’t have a lot of savings and felt it was a very big risk to go into food. So I went back to engineering and saved up, so I’d have a financial safety net, in case I failed. When I had the safety net, I finally took the plunge.\n\xa0It’s hard to say. It afforded me a lot of opportunities to network and meet people, people I’m still friends with to this day. But I didn’t really pursue (this path) because, like I said, I felt I didn’t have enough savings to take the risk. \n\nI already had my Instagram following before the show. Being on MasterChef definitely helped, especially in a regional setting. There were people who started following me from Indonesia, the Philippines, markets that I didn’t even know I could be in.\xa0\xa0The physical aspect of it.\n\nFor example, if you’re an investment banker, you work 14 hours a day, and it’s probably the same for a chef. But the difference is that as an investment banker, you’re probably sitting 90 per cent of the time. For a chef, you’re standing 90 per cent of the time. And it takes a toll on your body. \n\nI know a lot of chefs in their 20s. They’re super gung-ho. Just push, push, push, but once they hit their 30s, they’re like: “Whoa, I need to see a chiropractor. I need to see a specialist because my legs are aching constantly, my back’s aching constantly.” \n\nI worked in a few restaurants for a while and I realised very early on that it’d not be sustainable for me.\xa0I love going to Tokyo to eat.My favourite restaurant is Kyo Aji. They once served me a fig dish as a first course. My friend went a week later and the restaurant served him the same dish, but it was hot. I always wondered why they changed the temperature, and they told me they change it depending on the temperature of the day. So, if it’s a hot day, like the day I went, they serve it cold because they want to cool the diner down.It changed the way I think about food, because it’s really about how the diner feels, and not about what I want the diner to eat.\xa0Soup, because that’s my comfort food. I’m half-Cantonese and half-Teochew, and the Teochew side of me just finds soup the ultimate comfort food. \n\nEggs are my go-to snack, because they’re quick to cook up and nutritious as well.There’s this dish, a crab salad layered with tomato, by Joel Robuchon (the late French chef). What’s difficult is that he cuts it into a diamond shape. And I tried to replicate that after eating it and it was very difficult.It’s more of getting the shape right. Tomatoes obviously don’t come in diamond shapes.\xa0I’ve been practising smoking meats, but mine is electronic because I don’t want to stand by every hour tending to the flame. The core of what I do is always Japanese, but I’ve many other interests.I’ve been making a lot of kimchi lately. It’s very healthy. I would stir-fry it into rice or make kimchi soup.It makes you poop a lot, haha, but it’s also very low in calories — there’s no oil and most recipes don’t have sugar, so it’s predominantly vegetables. I always have frozen chicken or fish, and I’ll just add kimchi.\xa0I realised a lot of people love following recipes to a T. I never, ever follow a recipe to a T.It’s about breaking down procedures.For example, a recipe for beef will include how to cook the beef, how to make the sauce, and how to marinate the meat. If you like the marinade, just take that and save it in your arsenal. If you’ve a better way to cook beef, you can take the same marinade but use your method of cooking beef. So you never need to follow recipes to a T.To me, it’s picking the relevant points and then applying it to what you have.I’m passionate about sustainability in general. Just pack a small tote. The way I do groceries is, I never really know when I’m going to do it.Sometimes, I go to the gym and there’s a supermarket downstairs, and I’m just going to buy a few things. I always find myself in a situation where I wished I had brought a tote.So, buy a small collapsible bag and put it into your bag. It’ll save you taking plastic bags.\xa0I try to go to the gym in the morning. And if I’ve events, I’ll buy groceries from all over, sometimes Sheng Siong, sometimes Phoon Huat, sometimes Cold Storage. And then, I’ll prep the whole day.And then, when the event time comes, guests will come in to Miele and I’ll serve them.The piano thing is long dead; I actually just sold my piano. I think I used it just four times or something, haha. It was also a Covid thing, to be honest.I recently rediscovered my love for photography.I went to Paris and realised taking street photos is so fun. It even brought me more joy than eating. It’s always been there, but it’s been stagnant.I don’t really shoot in Singapore. But when I went to Paris, the lighting there was so nice, the people were so photogenic, and the weather was so nice that it made me want to go and shoot.I don’t eat out very often, which most people don’t realise. Eating out, to me, is still a treat, and I would want the norm to still be eating in. If I go out to eat, it’s a special occasion. I’ll eat at home probably four or five times a week.\xa0Dessert is always my guilty pleasure. I don’t really like making desserts. So I tend to buy them, whereas food comes a bit more naturally to me and I can very easily whip up something.I get the influencer thing a lot.I don’t really care about social media. I mean, it’s given me a lot of opportunities and a lot of work, but I don’t really care about fame. I don’t chase it at all.But I understand that it helps me with work and everything. So it’s necessary — it’s a by-product of like, hey, I want to get good jobs, I want to meet new people, and stuff like that.\xa0Not really. The craziest was during the MasterChef days, but since then, everyone’s been quite chill. Back then, somebody impersonated me on Grindr (the gay dating app) and that person had my phone number, so he was giving it out.And I recently got impersonated on Indonesian Bumble. People were texting me, asking if this was me, and I was like: “Nope.”But that’s the reality. You don’t even have to be particularly famous. As long as you put your photos online, there’s always that risk. But these days, it doesn’t really affect me.I do get recognised on the streets, though. That day, I was shopping at Culina (in Dempsey) and this young butcher came up to me and asked: “Whoa, shooting new content, ah?” Haha.I don’t feel like I’m an expert enough in any particular subject. I guess people want to hear about the whole career-switch thing. People like to romanticise it. But for me, it was very natural.It was always something that’s been on my mind. So, when I switched careers, it wasn’t like riding off into the sunset and doing this huge career change. It just felt like the right time. So I did it.\xa0It’s very difficult because everyone’s story is different. For me, the most sensible thing to do was to begin in small steps.People always think: “Oh, you want to switch careers, you have to quit and then jump into it.” What I did was, when I was in engineering, on the weekend, once a week, I’d work in a kitchen just to get a feel for what it’s like. Rather than quit your job, you jump into that and you realise “oh, this isn’t for me”… The reality is, people over-glamorise being in F&B. Being in F&B is a very tough life.They weren’t really insecurities. It was just constant worrying. At the end of the day, I’m living in my parents’ house, but I’ve not taken a cent from them since I graduated. So I cannot make decisions, especially monetary ones, rashly.My starting pay in my first job, as an engineer, was less than S$2,800. So I barely had enough savings. That’s why I went back to engineering.If you’re very rich, you always have a safety net, so you can make more rash decisions. But someone who’s poor has to make more conscious choices.That’s why it’s very hard to give blanket recommendations or advice. For me, the financial part was definitely something I always thought about.It’d probably be non-food stuff. In the last year or so, I realised I’ve always had all these other interests.I like fashion. I like photography. I like gaming. I like TV. But I always thought I’m known as the food guy, so I cannot do anything other than food.Especially with Covid, I just got so bored and started posting nonsense on Instagram. And I realised that people can see me as more than a food person.Food will always be my core, but I realised I can pursue new interests. And people are quite accepting of that.I love the job I’m in now. It allows me to cook, but also has reasonable hours.I don’t think I’ve an interest in opening a restaurant anytime soon. Private dining may be something I can consider in the future, but maybe until I get my own place.My parents are very supportive of everything I do. When I was on MasterChef, my mum would go on Facebook and read all the comments. If someone’s saying bad things, she would try to defend me. I would tell her: “You know, people are going to find out you’re my mum and it’s not going to be good.”If it’s the first time you’ve dealt with these things, you’re not sure how to navigate it. But after a while, you just get used to it.AuthorEe Ming is a storyteller with a love of photography, insightful reads, films, and offbeat and obscure places.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/20-questions-roger-yip-hopscotch/:['20 Questions is a HungryGoWhere interview series with the who’s who of the F&B sector.\xa0Call Roger Yip from craft cocktail bar Hopscotch a serial entrepreneur and he’s quick to brush off the label.Yet his portfolio of ventures would suggest otherwise.In his first year at university, he was already running mobile bartending startup Mixes from Mars, which has popped up at high-profile events such as the Singapore Grand Prix. He did this while pursuing a Bachelor of Accountancy course at the Singapore Management University.Then, at 23, he founded Hopscotch, then housed within the courtyards of the Red Dot Traffic Building (now the Maxwell Chambers Suites) along Maxwell Road.Today, Hopscotch has two outlets at Gillman Barracks and Arcade@The Capitol Kempinski. Yip also launched the popular modern Peranakan restaurant Cherki in the Central Business District last year.On the side, he helps four former schoolmates with other non-F&B ventures, such as branding and advertising agency Story Box Collective.“We didn’t plan for it to happen,” the 31-year-old says with a shrug. “A lot of the opportunities came by chance.”We first met at Hopscotch’s Capitol store in May, after he returned from a holiday in Bali. Yip comes across as a jokester who’s friendly and down-to-earth, striking an easy rapport with our team. His staff rib him playfully in the kitchen, too.He proudly introduces the bar table, which his team built painstakingly by hand during the renovation process. They are behind much of Hopscotch and Cherki’s carpentry work, including the feature walls at both Hopscotch outlets. And instead of splashing out extra money on marketing, he decided to buy a camera and learn how to photograph drinks for Hopscotch’s menu.It’s these little details that speak volumes of Yip’s DIY spirit and passion for his brands.Though he confesses he hasn’t had time to prepare for our interview, Yip is a natural in front of the camera, responding gamely to our questions with his brand of humour and depth.Here’s a lightly edited excerpt of our interview:\xa0At that time, I was 16, working part-time as a banquet server at Swissotel to get some extra pocket money during the school holidays.I remember being asked to help pour drinks at the bar. The customers would ask me: “What wine do you have?” I’d tell them: “We’ve got red wine, white wine.” But I got very confused when it got to the spirits, rum and all that. I had to look at the bottles.\xa0The idea was conceived when I was working at a bar called Bar Bar Black Sheep. I started drinking, because that was already after junior college. My friends and I always had this idea of opening a bar together someday.One day, a friend took me to Bar Stories. I showed a bit of interest and the staff asked if I wanted to work there. I thought that wasn’t a bad idea. So I worked as a barback, basically washing glasses. I tried to taste every drink and asked what they put inside… I found it very interesting.They also took part in a lot of events and the Bar Stories manager asked if I wanted to help out at a party for a friend of his. I went and people started asking me for my namecard. They took down my number, and so, the Mixes from Mars business started from there. This was right before university.I continued doing this while at university. I didn’t do well in school obviously, haha.(The now-defunct) Mars Bar also came about from (a conversation with) one of our event clients, who asked if we wanted to take up a spot at Duxton Hotel.Hopscotch was founded in 2014. I took a gap semester. After that, I had to rely a lot on my partners (from Bar Stories) to help out with everything.Our lease at Red Dot Traffic Building ended in 2017.In 2018, we reopened Hopscotch at Gillman Barracks. It’s quite discreet, far and deep in, so it was a struggle in the first year. Then it got better. 2019 was pretty decent and events were doing well. But in 2020, Covid hit. That time, we took a small hiatus.Last year, we launched Cherki. I’ve always loved Peranakan food. I like the intensity of the flavours, herbs, aromatics, and the spices. But with Peranakan restaurants, there’s always this backstory where chefs want to recreate their grandmothers’ recipes. I don’t have that. I just really love Peranakan food.\xa0We started from Mixes from Mars. Events don’t require a lot of capital, so we slowly built a pool of money there. Even when we went to Mars Bar at Duxton, we didn’t have to renovate anything; it was all there. We just had to bring in alcohol, glasses and that kind of thing. Costs were quite minimal.But the first and biggest slap was when we opened Hopscotch at Maxwell. We renovated everything ourselves and built our bar. It became a tradition we hold till today. We didn’t engage any interior designer, so that saved us a lot of costs.\xa0For drinks, we have the Lucky Charm. At that time, there was the I Not Stupid movie. It said “go to Guanyin, burn the charm and mix it with water”, so I thought let’s make something cool. This used to be something that people did in Chinese culture for blessings, but it’s slowly diminishing.The drink is made with intense flavours such as cempedak scotch, which we try to mellow with things like peppermint and jaggery, a type of sugar.The second drink is Garden City Sling. It’s shaped in a dome, similar to Gardens by the Bay, which has a flower dome. Inside, we’ve a display of flowers and greenery, to showcase Singapore’s green landscape and flora. The smoke contains an orchid-flavoured scent. Orchids are our national flower. We wanted to impart some multisensory experience to all our drinks.For Curtain Call, the backstory is that we always try to design a drink that represents the area we’re in, because we’ve always been located in places with artsy, cultural, historical buildings. We called it Curtain Call to show appreciation and pay tribute to Capitol Theatre, having hosted international and local stars since the 1930s. We had the idea of using ingredients sourced from around the world. For example, we use verjuice, which is of French origin, a juice of unripened grapes.Food was something a bit newer to us. We wanted to create Western food with a Singaporean fusion element to it.Building an effective team that can resonate with our interests.\xa0In F&B, you’ve to get your hands dirty, so don’t be afraid to get into it. You being involved is one part. The other part is establishing a strong team that works with you.Always be quick to adapt.During the lockdown, we tried to defray a lot of our costs as much as possible. Fortunately, at that time, we had only the Gillman Barracks unit. Our land is state-owned and they were kind enough to extend it rent-free for us, which we were very appreciative of.It was tough. We told our staff we’d pay them for a good two weeks while they find part-time jobs. After that, we did some delivery, but it wasn’t sustainable. Luckily, that lasted about two months.After that, (nightlife) came back with a vengeance. For some reason, everyone was drinking a lot. That was in 2020.2021 was worse. We had that two-pax, five-pax, two-pax (restriction on dining in) — change here, change there.\xa0We never saw it that way. We always felt we were in our own world, doing our own thing.\xa0The first thing that comes to mind is making drinks, but it’s a lot more than that. It comes from the word “bartending” — you’re tending to the bar. It’s not just about making good drinks, but tending to the customers in front of you. You’re managing the cleanliness, and making sure there’s a good system around how the bar’s maintained and that everyone’s having a good time.Blood and Tears. It pays tribute to our forefathers who built Singapore. It’s a medley of elements that represent the blood, sweat and tears. We have the blood part represented by the blood orange cointreau.We wanted to name it Blood, Sweat and Tears, but the sweat sounded a bit disgusting, haha. We added a bit of salt inside, so you can taste it. And the drink’s on the strong side — it represents the deep emotions that transpired when they were fighting for our future. And there’s a hint of sweetness at the end of the drink, which represents the fruits of their labour that we’re reaping today.We also have a fun drink called Top Scorer made with Brand’s chicken essence, a fun take on the top scorers drinking chicken essence. The drink comes with a paper plane — with a quiz — and a small table, which represents a school table.What came to mind are the Anything and Whatever drinks. You open a can, but you don’t know what’s inside. It’s unpredictable; you don’t know when you’ve to react, what to prepare for. Something might happen — you’ve to be prepared to deal with every situation.It’s picking up quite a bit. At one point, when we came in, we thought that was the start of a cocktail culture in Singapore, where you’ve people going around to appreciate cocktails. It took some time for people to accept it. Compared with a lot of other bars, our crowd is mainly local. Tourists usually go to those on the Asia’s 50 Best Bars list.\xa0I end my day with a list of things to do for tomorrow. I try to fulfil them, but it’s hard most of the time.At any point, you find yourself at this outlet, that outlet, (putting out) some kind of fire. Suddenly, someone is sick here and “can you please help”?

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/20-questions-tigerlily-patisseries-maxine-ngooi/:['20 Questions is a HungryGoWhere interview series with the who’s who of the F&B sector.\xa0At 6am, the world is just stirring awake. But behind the doors of Tigerlily Patisserie in Joo Chiat, the kitchen is in full swing.Its team of pastry chefs and bakers are at their stations. The ovens are at full blast, at temperatures of up to 260°C, ready to bake the bread that’s been fermenting overnight. There’s everything from chocolate babka, pain au chocolat and hot cross buns to almond croissants.One chef is preparing a special order of blueberry tarts. Another is putting the finishing touches to the entremets.The Beehive — Tigerlily’s signature citrus-bright hive of lemon, thyme and lychee honey jelly, light lemon sponge, and honey parfait in a yuzu mousse encasing — sits pretty.It’s a highly choreographed symphony of clockwork precision.Running the show is pastry chef Maxine Ngooi.The 31-year-old, whom I’m meeting for the first time, comes across perfectly poised and polished. It’s hard to believe that this is the petite young woman’s first solo venture.After her university years in Australia doing a bachelor’s degree in commerce, she first put on her chef’s hat in the two-Michelin-starred Les Amis restaurant under the mentorship of renowned pastry chef Cheryl Koh. She later worked with Koh to launch Tarte by Cheryl Koh.Ngooi later joined the ranks of three-Michelin-starred Joel Robuchon Restaurant, then worked for Robuchon alumnus Vianney Massot’s eatery as head pastry chef.Today, as Tigerlily’s co-owner and executive chef, she’s living her dream of running a patisserie — something she aspired to achieve only years down the road.The latest feather in her cap? She was recently named Pastry Chef of the Year at the World Gourmet Awards 2022.Mindful of her busy schedule, we’re about to wrap up a weekday video shoot with Ngooi close to 9am, when Tigerlily opens for business.Flashing her distinctive sunny smile, Maxine welcomes the first customer, who’s already been waiting patiently for some time.She’s ready.Here’s a lightly edited excerpt of our interview:I was with Vianney Massot Restaurant as head pastry chef. I was there when Covid hit and the lockdown started, and eventually the restaurant closed.At that point, I was quite lost. I wanted to experience different cultures and cuisines, and work at different restaurants around the world. All my plans were put to a halt. I started thinking about what else I could do.Then I was approached by the owners of Vianney Massot Restaurant. They asked me if I wanted to open a bakery. They were like: “We’ve got a kitchen, if you want to start a small bakery business. It’s kind of like a home business, except that you’ve got a professional kitchen here. Can you handle it yourself?”I was like: “That’s a great idea — why not?” So I started Tigerlily.Operating from a space on HongKong Street, we started doing just two bake boxes — sweet and savoury — with four pastries each… The feedback was great. I just kept doing it.It felt quite surreal. In terms of operations, it’s quite a lot more work.From previously manning a team of two to now a team of 10, it’s heartwarming to see my vision materialise into something so tangible.No. Always in my culinary journey, people have suggested: “Why don’t you open your own pastry shop?” And I’d always reply that I’m not ready.But when I was approached by the Ebb & Flow Group, I felt quite safe because they’ve a lot of experience opening other concepts and they’ve quite a good team behind me.So, although I wasn’t ready, they gave me the kind of support I needed to make the leap.My mother and I used to make cupcakes from box mixes — just add water, two eggs, that kind of thing.That was my earliest memory and was sort of my gateway into baking… Slowly, I moved to making cupcakes from scratch. My mum also used to love baking bread. She liked making this olive-and-herb loaf, and I endearingly named it the “smelly bread”. It had a very strong herb smell, and as a kid, it was something I didn’t quite appreciate. But she’d let me knead it. It was all play, but I had a lot of fun.I was thinking about my concept and the type of flavours I like to use. They’re all very Asian. And, when it comes to desserts, I enjoy playing around with aromatic herbs or florals, different fragrances.Because of that, I thought it should have some floral, botanical element, but it’d be good to rope in some Asian aspects as well. We started tossing around flower names, Googling them, but they were all really airy-fairy or scientific-sounding, or were just not very pretty names.Then my sister mentioned Tigerlily, and I thought it was a good option. Tiger reminds us of Singapore and lily has that botanical element. Together, it sounds quite feminine but fierce at the same time. That’s how I like to see myself: I’m quite a feminine person, but I would like to be taken seriously as well.Ginger flower. It was a bit of a revelation. I was thinking of what to pair with figs. Usually, figs go well with blue cheese, but we wanted it sweet. So I thought about ginger — why don’t we make it Asian and use ginger flower? Ginger flower is the rojak flower. I tested it out and it went quite well (with figs), to my surprise.I also used roselle. Usually, it appears in roselle tea, but I got fresh roselle and made raspberry roselle jam.There was also pink guava. I’ve also paired coriander with lychee and strawberry. It’s pretty interesting and I liked it. I’ve also used buah keluak (nuts) in a savoury babka (a braided bread) and paired it with sambal chilli for the Singapore Food Festival.This was one of the desserts that was conceived when I thought about how I wanted it to look before I decided how I wanted it to taste.It’s not often that I do it in this order, but I wanted to have something that was beehive-shaped. I created this dessert back at Vianney Massot Restaurant. It was made of meringue and sorbet.During the lockdown, I was trying to come up with a way to do a takeaway version. But meringue and sorbet would never travel. It took me a while to test.I got quite close to finalising it, and then the restaurant closed. But Tigerlily happened and I managed to roll it out. Maybe it was meant to be.If I had to choose one of the bakes I would eat every day, it’d be the Pistachio Marimo. It’s very comforting.As for the Pink Guava and Pear, it embodies Tigerlily’s concept very well. It has our Tigerlily colours, which are pink, green and yellow. It also has that Asian flair in the flavour profile, which includes pink guava, pear and elderflower. The flavour is floral, light and delicate.My favourite ice-cream place is Fatcat Ice Cream Bar. When I started out as a chef, it was one of the first few places that really caught my eye.It started off as an ice-cream shop in Bedok, near where I lived, and then it started doing brunch and then plated desserts. Every time it had something new, I dropped by. Eventually, I became friends with the owner.All of it. Pastry-making to me, initially, seemed like magic. Who knew that when you put flour, milk and eggs together, it becomes a cake? But there’s always a science behind it.When I’m in the midst of R&D, when we’re trying to troubleshoot and something doesn’t quite go as well as we thought it would, it requires one to try to figure out the science and tweak the different ingredients.That’s the exciting part, but it requires a lot of patience. When you finally crack it, it’s so fulfilling. It’s like finding out the secret to a magic trick.It’s the flip side of the coin. It’s when you can’t figure out how the magic trick works.But that’s when you start discussing ideas with like-minded chefs, thinking about new ideas… that’s the fun part of learning new things and new ways of getting to the goal.There isn’t one set way of making a cake.\xa0I’m a huge chocolate person. Just like how coffee people can taste the different nuances in the coffee, I feel like not many people realise this, but chocolate can have differences in its flavour profile, especially the more artisanal chocolates.I’ve had chocolate where there are hints of banana, even though there’s no banana in it. Or chocolate with a smoky aftertaste.I gobble up chocolate every day. It’s convenient that I work in a pastry shop, where chocolate is readily available.\xa0Beyond the fact that it’s a male-dominated industry, it also requires a lot of physical strength.Being a woman, people automatically assume you’re not very strong and tend to look down on you. When I first joined, I felt the need to assert myself. I felt that everyone was undermining me.I’ve known other chefs who start being really bossy or fierce — unreasonably so. I take things slowly. It’s not very important to assert your dominance at the start, but you gain that respect slowly. You do things well and they can see from your performance that you’re very capable.That said, I met a lot of guys in the industry who helped me along the way. They saw me as a weak female, so they wanted to help me. At the same time, I really appreciated that.For sure. As a chef, it’s important to be confident in the work that you do. You’re your greatest judge.You’ll always have moments of self-doubt. You need to be sure of what your priorities are, and what quality and standard you want to set.There’s always room for improvement. When something is not perfect, I start doubting myself. People are going to say “the layers are not even” or “it’s not completely round”, and things like that… It’s a gradual process, and as long as it’s good for yourself, you should be confident that other people will see it the same way.I’m super late to the game, but I just finished binge-watching the first season of Demon Slayer (adapted from a popular manga series).I’m usually not an anime person because the expressions are usually very exaggerated and there’s a lot of dialogue going on, so I get impatient.But it was so gripping.\xa0I usually start at 7 every morning. We come in, and start preparing for the launch of the pastries and cakes. Between 7am and 11am, that’s our rush hour.It can get quite intensive, a lot of things going on, everybody trying to rush out the pastries, cakes and cookies… Once 11am hits, all the pastries and cakes are out (for sale). Then we start prep for the next day.People always think: “Wow, they sell out so early. After they sell out at 2pm, they can go home.”But that’s never the case. Because when we’re selling out so early, that means we’re at the back trying to do more. We also understand it’s not a great thing to sell out so early. There’s an opportunity to continue selling, so we’re pushing ourselves at the back of the house, so we tend to finish quite late.In the midst of prep, I’ve discussions. We talk about bulk orders, and sometimes, I have interviews and photoshoots (like this one). Somewhere in between, we also do R&D for new items.So I find myself all over the place every day. Sometimes I’m at the front, testing out the new hot chocolate, trying a new recipe, tinkering with the sandwiches, or cooking curry rempah because I want to try a new curry pastry.I end by 7pm. Afterwards, I wind down by doing paperwork, have dinner, and then I watch my shows.I also manage Chin Mee Chin Confectionery (along East Coast Road, also under the Ebb & Flow Group), so I go down twice or thrice a week, to touch base with everyone. It’s a 10-minute walk from here (Tigerlily), so it’s super convenient.\xa0Weekends for me are usually Mondays and Tuesdays. That’s when I get to have a life.(At the time of this interview,) I’m renovating my new place. I just got married last year and we’ve our BTO (Build-to-Order flat).And okay, this may sound super lame, but what I really like doing in my downtime is baking. There’s a difference between baking at home and baking at work.My favourite thing to bake at home is a spiced cherry pie. It’s something I love to eat and that you really need to eat fresh. I will wake up slightly earlier than my usual weekend day and take advantage of the coolness of the morning to roll out my dough.Then I will take my time to do the lattice patterns on the pie and make it look pretty… You’ve got that one hour when the smell fills the whole house and you cut into that crispy crust, and it’s gooey and slightly warm inside. I share it with my family.\xa0It has to be something savoury. My favourite food is bak kut teh (pork rib soup). I can eat it every day. I like Song Fa Bak Kut Teh and I really like the herbal bak kut teh down the road (in Joo Chiat) at Sin Heng Claypot Bak Koot Teh.\xa0Apart from the obvious building of foundations and being more sure in my techniques and confident about making good pastries, I’m a lot better at managing my team.I’ve never really had to manage a team of more than three — until now — and it’s a big team. The coordination and being able to see everybody as an individual rather than a worker are what really matter.And being there for them as well. As a leader, you’re not just meant to delegate. It’s a big part of the job — you have to delegate, so that you have time to do your own work. But at the same time, you need to show your staff that you’re there for them and you’re going through the hardship with them.It’s something I’m still trying to figure out. Because naturally, I want to be in the kitchen, to be a part of the team. But at the same time, there are other things like paperwork, planning and visualising the growth of the business as a whole.It’s something I need to find the balance for.\xa0We’re constantly trying to develop new flavours.I’ve always wanted to go back to bake boxes (which Tigerlily has brought back in June 2022).I’ve also thought of bake boxes where we’ve four new special flavours and they’re exclusive to the bake boxes. It’s kind of a discovery box. It could even be a subscription-based model.It’ll be super fun to have this discovery box, where you’ve strange and unique flavours. And it’s all experimental, then we gather feedback from everyone. And then we change to a new bake box and keep some of the favourites from the old bake box. That would be really fun.Honestly, I’m very happy with where things are with Tigerlily at the moment.\xa0Book a ride to Tigerlily.350 Joo Chiat Road\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (9am to 5pm)350 Joo Chiat Road\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (9am to 5pm)AuthorEe Ming is a storyteller with a love of photography, insightful reads, films, and offbeat and obscure places.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/20-questions-two-men-bagel-house-jereborne-lam-jerome-lam/:['20 Questions is a HungryGoWhere interview series with the who’s who of the F&B sector.\xa0It’s a rainy afternoon when we pop into the Two Men Bagel House outlet at Royal Square in Novena.Co-founder Jereborne Lam, 32, arrives in jeans, a snapback cap, and a black, oversized shirt bearing the name of the popular bagel joint.The other co-founder Jerome Lam, 31, joins us a little later, emerging from the kitchen in an all-black ensemble.In advance of the interview, they had asked if there was a dress code for the accompanying photoshoot. We told them to wear whatever they felt comfortable in.When we meet, we point out that we expected them to be in the trendy hip-hop get-up of their bagel mascots. Jereborne shrugs and replies matter-of-factly: “This is what we wear every day.”We learn later that in the eight years since Two Men Bagel House opened its doors in 2014, these two men haven’t stopped working, and thinking about the brand, the bagels and their people.And their hard work has paid dividends. Starting with a store at Icon Village in Tanjong Pagar, Two Men Bagel House now has three outlets to its name — one of which morphs into a wine bar by night — and a growing list of tie-ups with bars, cafes and, recently, luxury fashion label Coach, its first with a global brand.We asked them about everything from their favourite bagels to their guilty indulgences. Here’s a lightly edited excerpt of the interview:\xa0Jerome: We’re not. But we do look alike, yes… we met at the Singapore Management University in 2012 or 2013. Back then, that spot was where all the breakdancers went. We’re both into hip-hop culture, so we appeared there (to breakdance).Jereborne: We’ve the same surname and are of Hakka descent.\xa0Jereborne: Jerome’s a chef by profession, so it was always going to be a food business. We thought about doing something Singapore didn’t have, which was bagels. At that time, no one was doing a specialty-bagel shop, so we thought we had room to play around with the idea.Jerome: It took off naturally. When we started from 2014 all the way through 2016, we were still trying to build the brand, and introduce what a bagel is and what we do at Two Men Bagel House. (For example,) you’d never imagine smoked brisket being in a bagel sandwich. From the get-go, it was built on such foundations.Also, Jereborne used to fly for Singapore Airlines. So he inspired the whole Two Men Bagel House culture to have a bit of a more outgoing vibe. Even when we train our staff, the things that we instil in all our crew members, we try to be friendly and chill.Jereborne: Be yourself, but be casual, inviting and welcoming. We noticed that Singapore has a rigid style of customer service. If we were going to open a bagel shop, we knew we had to make it a friendly bagel shop.\xa0Jereborne: When we started it, the staple was stuff like Ya Kun (Kaya Toast), and Park Bench Deli wasn’t open yet — there wasn’t really a modern sandwich shop. We were a little bit ahead.The people who supported the business were largely expats who were well-travelled and they knew what we were trying to build. In all honesty, without expats at the beginning, we wouldn’t be here.Jerome: It was through word of mouth, and organically around Tanjong Pagar, where residences were also coming up — you walk down and have a bagel.Jerome: Through the years, constructing the menu year on year, we’ve constantly tried to break the norm. We do a lot of market research and we head out to eat at different sandwich joints. Now with Instagram, we also have an influx of information. We can see that people are doing a certain style of sandwiches, and we try to do it differently.\xa0For example, in Tanjong Pagar, we relaunched the menu several months ago. So your classics stayed, like the BEC (bacon, egg and cheese), but the signatures were all inspired by Southeast Asian flavours. There’s Banh Me Over, and there’s Hot Doe (with ayam percik, a grilled chicken dish), inspired by one of our chefs. When he broke fast during (the Muslim holy month of) Ramadan, that’s what he ate in Malaysia.\xa0Jereborne: The Novena outlet is more of a smokehouse, so it’s the only outlet where you can get smoked meats. (We were) pushing the boundaries and innovating.\xa0Jerome: At the beginning, we were very involved in the names. But over time, the guys who work with us took over that part of the process because they wanted to come up with interesting names themselves. So they will visualise during operations, when they call an order out, how it would sound and how it would ripple back to our customers.For example, we’ve this sandwich at Tanjong Pagar called Secs. Some people are sensitive about saying the word “secs”, so they will say s-e-c-s, but our expat community will just say: “Can I have a Secs?” When the order comes in, everyone will just shout: “New order. Secs!”Jereborne: For me, fondly, it was Avo Baco. That became something I really liked.Jerome: The Avo Baco sandwich was based off the BLT (bacon, lettuce, tomato) sandwich, but with avocados. So we came up with the name Avo Baco, and it so happened there was a nice ring to it.\xa0Jerome: We know how mundane it can be if all our outlets were selling the same thing. It was also a way to entice chefs to join us, like a chef’s mind — people from restaurants and popular cafes.People constantly question why we’ve different menus, and eight years later, people are still asking this question. Curiosity is a draw for our customers. But (for me, it was) the feeling of passion. As a chef, I constantly want to try different things, cook different things. Sandwiches like BEC will be a staple here. But we always have one section of signatures, and that’s where the chefs go to work.\xa0Jereborne: I’m not really a chef and I don’t have the confidence to say I can cook very well, but I’ve put a sandwich on the menu, and thankfully, it was OK and nicely received by the customers. It’s called the Personal Best (comprising spam, hashbrown, peanut butter, spicy aioli, and a sunny side up).But looking back, my favourite was definitely this sandwich called the Cow King (no longer on the menu), a pastrami sandwich.Jerome: The first version of our smoked brisket sandwich. It was damn hard to smoke a beef brisket without a smoking oven; we used a combi oven to smoke the brisket. It was really figuring out the timings and experiencing throwing a wood log into a S$10,000 to S$20,000 oven that’s not made or built for it. But we had to try it because we were already set on the whole smoked element.It took two to three months… When the sandwich was successfully built, that was my favourite, and it tasted the way I wanted it to.\xa0Jerome: I wanted to collaborate with hawkers a long, long time ago. I just didn’t have the capacity to do it. When (Jere)borne built the media team, it gave us a bit more runway to experience new things and collaborate with other partners.All these years, we’ve been partnering with restaurants, cafes, events, and festivals, but at the end of the day, we all crave hawker food, right? A lot of people think hawkers are going to be passe, so we were looking for third-generation hawkers, to help build their community again, save their tradition and preserve their heritage.Jereborne: We worked hard for the success, and for us, it’s always been work over reputation. Whether we anticipated the brand to be popular… we did everything we could. Our lives were intertwined with the brand. We worked for it to be known and we never stopped working.Jereborne: Covid was very hard. But in terms of the hardest decision, I don’t think we’ve hit that note yet. Usually, before we make decisions, we discuss as a team and invite everybody to sync up and vote for something that happens. I don’t think we’ve done anything against our conscience and been like “that was really hard to make”.Jerome: Every decision was hard, but there was no hardest. We had to pivot the company to ensure it survives, like stepping onto a lot more delivery platforms… We didn’t let go of people during Covid.The hardest thing is to retain people in our industry, which is why we’ve been saying we’ve to adapt and always be ahead of our problems. And that’s why we do so many collaborations, to help keep the team excited.Jerome: Vegemite, butter and a sunny side up.Jereborne: Anything you crave. As long as you want to have (something in) a sandwich, you can put it in a bagel. Anything.\xa0Jereborne: There are a lot of things we haven’t tried, so I wouldn’t say no-no. I wouldn’t put in a piece of Gardenia bread, lah.Jerome: I wouldn’t put in beef jerky. A hard no.\xa0Jereborne: You wake up and you go to work, and start thinking about what problems there are to fix because in our industry, there are always problems, just like any other industry. How do we always stay ahead of the problems?There’s a balance right now, though. There’s definitely time to have drinks and socialise with friends. More important, a day in the life of an F&B entrepreneur, at least for me, always revolves around the team. There are always traces of me hanging out with one or two members of the team, getting to know them.Jerome: My life is very routine. Today’s routine was to walk my dog at 6.30am and I’ll go to the gym at 7.30am. Because today (the day of this interview) is a Monday, it’s a bit more relaxed and it’s raining, so I decided to stay home for a while. On a very busy day, walk the dog, go to the gym, go to one shop — either to help them with the operations or talk to the guys to find out if there’s anything happening on the ground.If Amy’s (Winebar) is running that day, we’ll pop by Amy’s to help the chefs run the operations.\xa0Jereborne: Travelling. But I haven’t travelled in a while. It would also definitely be drinking with my buddies, popping a can of beer and good-quality conversations. Life isn’t just about work, but for us right now, for a fair bit, it still is.Jerome: Just spending time with my dog helps me unwind.\xa0Jerome: Momofuku Ssam Bar in New York City. I’ve always been a fan of founder David Chang. One dish that blew me away was the duck ssam (a Korean dish). Instead of the common pork belly (which is typically used for ssam), he made a duck dish, served with duck-fat fried rice and wrapped with lettuce.Jereborne: Best Ugly Bagels in New Zealand. The chef who came up with the concept was Al Brown — I loved how he conceptualised the idea of the bagel shop.\xa0Jereborne: Anime. I’m a big One Piece fan.Jerome: I just like to eat, man. I eat a lot of junk food, like McDonald’s and Arnold’s Fried Chicken. I eat a lot of ice cream, too.\xa0Jerome: I enjoy fitness a lot and would probably be working in a gym.Jereborne: The plan was to transition from being a flight steward to becoming a pilot. But right now, I would love to do something that is design-based and creative-based.\xa0Jereborne: Caifan (economy rice), because they have an arrangement of so many things for you to pick from.Jerome: Prawn noodles — the dry one with the broth at the side. The ngoh hiang (fried meat rolls) is also key.Jereborne: We may make a lot of new decisions to come, but definitely to scale Two Men Bagel House to greater heights. For myself, to be a better human being. Other than that, it’s to stay happy, contented and grateful.Jerome: My girlfriend and I have been living together for a while, and every time we move house, we want new stuff because I like cooking so much at home. I constantly want new plates, new pottery and things like that. So, when we looked into the idea, we thought that new, modern families would have a different idea of how they want their dinnerware to be, as they’d enjoy hosting more friends.The name of (my upcoming ceramic business) is Kane. There are a lot of different meanings to it in Japanese, but we found one that’s very suitable for us, which is “to serve”.\xa0Two Men Bagel House is on the\xa0GrabFood delivery service. You can also book a ride there.AuthorSarah is constantly seeking out new coffee spots and cocktail bars around the world, and should probably drink more water while at it.© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/beef-rendang-from-scratch/:['From Scratch is a series exploring the origins of foods that are popular in Singapore and the work that goes into making them.The Singapore food scene has come a long way. Despite its size, the country has blossomed into a thriving gastronomic powerhouse, thanks to its diverse culinary scene that ranges from quaint hawker food to fine-dining restaurants and celebrity-chef-led establishments.It’s home to all manner of cuisines from around the world, ranging from Korean and Italian to Greek, Japanese and French.Still, there’s something about authentic, traditional dishes deeply rooted in our culture that still hold a special place in our hearts. One such dish is rendang.Originating from the Minangkabau region in West Sumatra, Indonesia, it eventually spread to neighbouring Southeast Asian countries such as Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei.The rich and flavourful meat dish is steeped in cultural tradition and crafted under a chef’s careful supervision.\xa0In the past, before refrigeration became common, rendang was reserved for special occasions and festivities such as weddings and Hari Raya celebrations. Meat was a precious commodity as it was expensive and spoiled quickly, so rendang was cooked as a way to preserve the meat.\xa0By slow-cooking the meat over an extended period, the moisture from the meat evaporates, allowing it to be kept for weeks, ensuring no morsel of meat goes to waste.Today, the dish is widely available at eateries as an everyday indulgence. HJH Maimunah, a family-owned eatery specialising in traditional Malay cuisine, is one such place where you can find some of the best rendang in Singapore.It is managed by the second-generation owner, Mastura Didih Ibrahim, and her sisters. Mastura, 37, is the business manager of HJH Maimunah, and supervises its growth and expansion. The restaurant opened in the Jalan Besar area in 1992 — an outlet that’s still around today, as the property belongs to them.\xa0“The store is named after my grandmother. She bought the Jalan Besar shophouse so that my parents could start the restaurant,” Mastura says. “She also helped promote the restaurants because she had a business in tour and travel. Many of her clients were my parents’ first clients.”\xa0Looking at the success it enjoys now, you wouldn’t have thought that HJH Maimunah started humbly. It had 10 employees, including Mastura’s parents. Many family members also chipped in to help.“I have been helping at the restaurant since I was 11, with (tasks such as) cashiering, cleaning the tables and stuff like that,” Mastura recalls. “All of (my siblings) were actually helping out in the family business.”As they grew up, their roles changed, too. Mastura, inspired by her family business, decided to pursue food technology in university. She used her knowledge to improve and expand the family business.\xa0It started with managing the human resources and finance side of the business on her own.\xa0Later on, she hired others to take on these roles and focused on opening another main outlet — the now-defunct Bencoolen restaurant — and multiple smaller stalls in food courts.\xa0Today, HJH Maimunah has two restaurants, a handful of smaller stalls and more than 100 employees. One can only imagine the variety and sheer volume of food being produced daily.To ensure that items are kept up to standard across the outlets, Mastura used her knowledge on product testing and preservation to expand the central kitchen and develop HJH Maimunah’s ready-to-eat products and paste range.“It’s not easy to maintain consistent quality for the products,” she says. “We do it by making it easy for the staff to prepare the food item and following a standard operating procedure.”In the 31 years since its inception, HJH Maimunah has made great strides in improving its menu.\xa0\xa0“We first started selling the padang version of rendang, which is much drier. Over time, we realised that Singaporeans prefer the meat to be juicier, so the recipe changed over the years to cater to (their tastes),” Mastura says. This spirit of constant evolution and innovation is apparent in everything the brand does. Instead of resting on its laurels, for instance, the eatery is planning on further expansion to make it easier for customers to reach them.\xa0Though she hopes to take HJH Maimunah overseas, Mastura acknowledges that it’s difficult to do that while balancing multiple outlets and working on research and development.The brand’s main priorities right now are expanding the business locally and working on its frozen products sold in-store, especially its beef rendang paste. Beef rendang has fairly simple steps. The challenge comes in the amount of patience and effort that goes into making the dish, not to mention the deliberate and meticulous act of putting together the various spices and ingredients. Rendang is an act of carefully layering different flavours on top of one another.“What makes rendang unique is the rich flavours of the dish. It’s made of different spices and coconut ingredients, making it very different from the usual curries we have,” says Mastura. We start with oil, which is heated together with cinnamon sticks, blended chilli padi and rempah.Once aromatic, coconut milk and coconut powder are added. The liquid is stirred slowly, an act that allows everything to dissolve and the flavours to properly harmonise with one another. After it boils, the beef is added into the concoction, followed by other spices and herbs such as turmeric leaves and lime leaves. At this point, you will get hints of the fragrant and aromatic dish.What follows is a strenuously long simmer that lasts about two-and-a-half hours. This is the eatery’s advice on how to make beef rendang tender — by cooking it for long hours over low heat.\xa0This step does two things: First, it ensures the meat and spices don’t burn, which can result in an overwhelmingly bitter aftertaste. Second, it allows the spices to infuse their flavours with the meat.\xa0Once the water has evaporated, the beef rendang is complete. If this is cooked at home, the rendang will be dished out and served immediately.\xa0But for HJH Maimunah, it will be stored in giant catering containers, frozen and transported to its various outlets.18 and 18A Kandahar Street\nNearest MRT station: Bugis or Nicoll Highway\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (9am to 7pm)Established in 1954, Rumah Makan Minang is best known for its authentic and traditional Minangkabau cuisine.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/from-scratch-kimchi/:['From Scratch is a series exploring the origins of foods that are popular in Singapore and the work that goes into making them.While many Singaporeans have a love for all things spicy, kimchi has not always been a part of that lexicon.Rather, it’s something that’s gained popularity in the recent past, alongside the wave of Korean culture that’s swept the globe.Trust Jin Yinji, 75, to know this better than anyone. The veteran Singaporean actress, Mediacorp artiste and co-owner of Gold Kimchi was born in South Korea and came to Singapore in her 20s to further her career.“When I was pregnant during the 1970s, I craved kimchi, but there were limited ingredients here. I could only call my mother in Korea and sister in Japan to ask them how to make it,” she recalls, speaking to HungryGoWhere in a mixture of Mandarin and Hokkien.The result was not something Singaporeans would eat, she says. “Once my mother-in-law ate it, she asked me: ‘How can you eat this? Sure lao sai (diarrhoea)!’“It’s really different. Who would have thought that in the future, so many people would like it? Especially the younger generation. Times have changed.”Today, you can find kimchi everywhere — on fries, in burgers, in little dishes alongside a hotplate of saba fish in your neighbourhood hawker centre… the list runs on.As ubiquitous as kimchi is today, freshly made ones are a challenge to find, and this was especially so during the Covid-19 pandemic.That was how Gold Kimchi was born, says Cloe Han, 40, its co-owner. She is Jin’s daughter-in-law and the hands behind the operation.“(During the pandemic), I started to make kimchi because I couldn’t find fresh ones in Singapore. The processed ones are a bit soggy and sour, so I tried to make it myself and shared it with friends.”She found ready-made kimchi rather one-dimensional, too. “It’s good, but there’s not much taste — only spiciness and sourness.”It took six months, after consultation with her mother and aunts back home in Korea as well as some help from YouTube videos, for Han to refine the formula.Jin signed off on the recipe, too, says Han. “It has to be good; otherwise, she won’t let us sell it.”What sets Gold Kimchi’s products apart from others is the use of high-quality ingredients. Han uses products from Korea — either imported or specially bought on yearly trips home to visit her family. Korea-made fish sauce and chilli powder, for example, have different tastes and textures, so authentic ones are preferred.“We use high-quality fruits,” adds Jin.\xa0There is, of course, what Han calls a “secret-recipe sauce” in the mix as well.Today, Gold Kimchi makes everything out of its home kitchen for sale online.The products are fresh with no preservatives, adds the duo, although this means their shelf life is too short for sale in department stores.“The ones you make yourself are fresher and healthier for the body,” says Jin.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMasterchef Singapore fan-favourite launches Paan, a home-based Italian sandwich shop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSingapore Food Festival 2023: More than 100 food options & over S$2k in prizes to be won\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHawker Hustlers: Happiness is a warm Mian Mian Bu Duan Peanut Pancake\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany Singaporeans associate kimchi with just cabbages, but it can be made with many other vegetables and fruits, such as radish and cucumber, and even apple.The dish is characterised by its red hue — a by-product of the chilli powder used — and refreshingly tart flavours soaked into every bite.It’s considered a staple in Korean cuisine, and often served as one of several side dishes (banchan) or used in cooking.“You can put it in tofu soup (sundubu-jjigae) and noodles (ramen),” says Jin.In her youth, Jin recalls making it in big batches in her family kitchen. They used large pots and stored them underground over the winter.In the modern era, however, kimchi refrigerators are used.\xa0Unlike traditional refrigerators, these fridges don’t keep their contents cold per se, but rather maintain a consistent yet cool environment that aids fermentation. These fridges are also more infrequently used and aren’t opened daily, as is the norm for many kitchen fridges.Han and Jin say this is even more of a necessity in Singapore’s warm climate, which causes kimchi to ferment and turn sour more quickly.As an extension of tried-and-true recipes, Gold Kimchi recently put out a new vegan, non-spicy and kid-friendly variant made with beetroot.Aptly named Pink Kimchi, this was created in collaboration with gourmet Korean butchery The Butcher’s Dining to match its take-home barbecue sets. Gold Kimchi hopes to tie up with more brands on projects such as this. But in the meantime, Han has been sharing her love of Korean cuisine with fellow K-aficionados in the form of cooking classes.Jin says of her daughter-in-law: “She’s not stingy with the food that she cooks. Some people will hide their recipes, but not her. If someone genuinely wants to learn, she will teach them.” Han starts the process by cutting the cabbages into bite-sized pieces, and washing them thoroughly to remove dirt and impurities.Next, Han adds coarse salt granules to water and soaks the vegetables in this solution for two hours.\xa0This process is called brining and pulls the moisture out of the cabbages.Meanwhile, she prepares the marinade. For cabbage kimchi, she uses red chilli, apples, brown pear, onion, ginger and garlic. These are peeled, chopped, then blended with Korean fish sauce.To the blended paste, Han adds salted shrimp or shrimp paste and Korean chilli powder — a lot of it — so much so that the mix turns a deep red.At this stage, fish and oysters are commonly added into the mix, but these are difficult to source in Singapore, Han says.Some sugar is also added to balance the kimchi’s flavour profile, but sparingly so. This is because the apples and pears added earlier already contribute much of the necessary sweetness.The components are then mixed until fully incorporated, forming a paste. It’s then left to sit for an hour.The vegetables are carefully drained, rinsed and dried to remove any remaining saltwater.Once ready, the cabbages and kimchi paste are added into a large mixing bowl, alongside some chopped chives, and thoroughly mixed by hand.Finally, the resultant mixture is placed into storage containers and goes to its home for the next few months — a kimchi refrigerator — where it develops its iconic flavour.NEWest Mall, 01-71, 1 West Coast Drive\nNearest MRT station: Clementi\nOpens: Tuesday to Sunday (11.30am to 2.30pm, 5.30pm to 9pm — last order at 8pm)MKMK started as a home-based business, making authentic kimchi and other Korean delicacies out of a home kitchen in Tampines.

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/from-scratch-ang-ku-kueh/:['From Scratch is a series exploring the origins of foods that are popular in Singapore and the work that goes into making them.Amid the mad bustle of Bugis, a cheerful tortoise with a pink shell is hidden in a corner of a wall, as if beckoning you to follow it. Blink and you might just miss it.\xa0Follow the trail of different coloured tortoises along the wall, and you’ll find them busy making and buying ang ku kueh. \n\nThey convene against the backdrop of an enormous tree — a family of tortoises gathering to celebrate a baby’s first birthday, a tortoise smiling as it dreams of ang ku kueh in its sleep. Another two offer ang ku kueh to Caishen (the Chinese god of wealth), while some tortoise friends frolic over the rainbow while munching on ang ku kueh.The whimsical painting of these 88 tortoises is no ordinary mural.\xa0It’s the grand vision of Kelvin Toh, 41, the second-generation owner of Ji Xiang Ang Ku Kueh’s Bugis store, who dreams of making the traditional Chinese pastry known to all far and wide. In Mandarin, “ji” means luck, while “xiang” means prosperity.\xa0Ang ku kueh, also known as red tortoise cake, is a small round or oval-shaped Chinese pastry with soft, sticky glutinous rice flour skin wrapped around a sweet filling in the centre, presented on a rectangular piece of banana leaf.\xa0The pastry is moulded to resemble a tortoise’s shell to symbolise good fortune and longevity, traits the creatures are known for.\xa0While ang ku kueh has its roots in China, most Singaporean stalls, including Ji Xiang, have adopted the Nonya style of making this delicacy.\nDuring our first meeting, Kelvin is animated and chatty, clearly well-versed in giving interviews. (He says that he doesn’t turn down interview requests, even from polytechnic or university students.)He jokes that he doesn’t sell just ang ku kueh but “stories and nostalgia”. He’s on a one-man mission to revive the dying trade of crafting ang ku kueh in Singapore. It saddens him that the ang ku kueh culture is fast disappearing. \n\n“When people eat ang ku kueh now, they say: ‘Whoa, this tastes like mochi.’”\n\n“It’s very sad that a foreign foodstuff has more recognition than my traditional foodstuff. I want a point in time where, when Singaporeans bite into mochi, they say: ‘Whoa, this tastes like ang ku kueh.’ It’s a very steep hill to climb,” he adds.\xa0 \n\xa0\nFounded in 1988 by husband and wife Toh Poh Seek and Toh Bong Yeo, Ji Xiang Ang Ku Kueh is one of the longest-standing ang ku kueh stalwarts in the industry.The family-run business has humble beginnings.\xa0It began as a hobby for Mrs Toh Bong Yeo (Kelvin’s mother), who started making ang ku kueh by hand in her HDB flat at Everton Park. It was also to help out with the family income.\n\nShe started out selling only two flavours, peanut and sweet bean paste, to provision shops and hawkers around the neighbourhood. To her surprise, the ang ku kueh was so popular that she hired four people to help out.\xa0Her husband Toh Poh Seek, a former ship-welder, was roped in, too. \n\nThree years later, they opened a store tucked away at Everton Park in Outram. \n\nToday, it has amassed staunch supporters with some die-hard fans returning regularly for decades.Ji Xiang now sells a total of eight flavours: Peanut, sweet bean, salty bean, corn, sesame, coconut, yam, and seasonal durian. Each is distinguished by the different colour of its skin.\n\nDespite the tedious and time-consuming process, the kuehs are filled and moulded individually by hand, so that the skin achieves the right thickness and chewiness. Using machines might risk tearing the thin skin.\xa0The efforts of the folks at Ji Xiang have earned them accolades such as the Green Book Best Food Awards and the Slow Food Singapore Heritage Hero Award.\nAng ku kuehs are popularly used for festive occasions. Their busiest times of the year are during the birthday of the Chinese Jade Emperor (which falls on the ninth day of Chinese New Year), Hungry Ghost Festival and Qingming Festival (or Tomb Sweeping Day).\xa0The kuehs also feature frequently in gifts to celebrate a child turning a month old.One fast-disappearing Chinese custom is the act of a baby stepping on a pair of ka ta kueh (the same kueh but five times bigger in size), says Kelvin.\xa0On a child’s first birthday, the child would be dressed like a small tiger to ward off spirits and the ka ta kueh is an offering to the gods. Stepping on the ka ta kueh symbolises a smooth journey in life for the baby.\xa0\nIn 2015, Kelvin decided to practise this lesser-known custom for his oldest daughter. It attracted some media coverage and attention, so much so that the sales of ka ta kueh leapt from two pairs a year to thousands yearly.\xa0“Ka ta kueh has a very deep meaning in Chinese culture. When I did it, I felt very proud and emotional and nearly cried. I thought: ‘Why are we not doing this?’” \n\nIt further cemented his belief that Ji Xiang was not just here as a business, but had an intangible social impact on continuing rich traditions. \n\xa0With a decade of experience in the F&B industry, Kelvin oversaw Ji Xiang’s first expansion. In February 2021, he opened the legacy brand’s second outlet in Bugis. It was unlike the Everton branch, typically frequented by old-timers and big temples that would place large orders. On days leading up to festivals, groups of aunties would make the kuehs in 14-hour shifts.\xa0The Bugis outlet, though, was a whole different ball game. \n\nAlthough the new outlet saw higher footfall, which translated to “many micro-transactions”, Ji Xiang had to earn its stripes among the younger generation. \n\nTo them, ang ku kuehs were seen as uncool and typically associated with older people who used them as prayer offerings and during festivals. It was time to reinvent the ang ku kueh. \n\nTo keep the business trendy, Ji Xiang introduced new products such as rainbow and pastel-coloured ang ku kuehs and Mao Shan Wang durian-filled ones. When the Singapore Grand Prix came around, it made F1-themed kuehs. It also took on customised and corporate orders, making kuehs in all shapes and sizes, from the likes of Instagram-worthy unicorns to Minion and Pokemon-themed kuehs. And it even hired help solely to get customer feedback.Frustrated with the old-fashioned way of running things, Kelvin set up a website for online orders and to increase its social media presence — a move reluctantly accepted by the elder Tohs. \xa0But some things remain unchanged. In their possession is a legendary book that has served their family over decades and is something they’re unwilling to part with.\xa0Before modernising the ordering process, his parents would diligently pen down phone orders. Kelvin’s father often spent his days painstakingly using a ruler to draw columns in the book. \n\n“We haven’t misplaced the book for the last 30 years. So if the book goes missing, jialat for us,” he jokes. Jialat means “a dire situation” in Hokkien.The vibe at the two outlets differs, too. At the old-school Everton Park branch, efficiency is king. It’s known for its hurried service, where the aunties work at a frenetic pace and customers are served hurriedly. \n\nAt Bugis, the aunties chit-chat while making kueh and warmly greet customers. They ask about their kids and customers can walk around the store, while soaking up the likes of Cantopop tunes. By dark, the place transforms into a thumping disco as the younger staff work through the night. \n\nSometimes, Kelvin joins them when he feels stressed. He’s so familiar with making ang ku kueh that he can do it with his eyes closed.\xa0“It’s like meditation, very zen. I find it enjoyable when I sit there, not thinking about anything but focusing on the task ahead of me,” he says. These days, he dedicates his time to sharing his heritage and running workshops for people wishing to try their hand at making ang ku kueh.\xa0He’s had participants ranging from companies looking to do team-bonding events and parents with young children to tourists who sign up with Singapore hotels.“If we don’t do this, who else is going to?”\xa0\nPreparing the banana leaves may look deceptively simple, but it’s no joke when you have to wash thousands of pieces, wipe them dry and cut them to the right size.The team needs to cut 30kg worth of banana leaves twice a week. That’s 2,000 pieces of banana leaves, cut neatly into 18 to 20 portions to get the equivalent of 36,000 rectangular pieces. \n\nThe elder Mr Toh designed a machine to ensure that the leaves could be cut into perfectly symmetrical pieces.\xa0While they could easily buy pre-washed and pre-cut leaves from Malaysia and Indonesia, Kelvin says that the cleanliness may not be up to scratch in terms of food safety. They would rather do it themselves, even though it’s more expensive and labour-intensive. \xa0The most traditional is tau sar (mung bean filling), which Ji Xiang makes in-house. Some 80kg of raw beans are soaked, steamed, mashed and cooked with sugar, oil and water to achieve the right consistency for the optimum flavour to come through.\xa0After that, it is cooled and chilled to make it more malleable. Then it is divided into smaller portions, ready to be rolled into the pastry skin dough.The pastry skin is made from a mixture of glutinous rice flour, oil, salt and sugar. Food colouring is added into the mixture to give the different flavoured ang ku kuehs their colour. Finally, the pastry skin is combined with the filling and rolled into a ball. It’s then pressed into the mould that gives it the distinctive tortoise-shell shape before being placed onto a piece of banana leaf.The ang ku kueh is placed into the steamer with the pandan leaf side down. This will allow the fragrance of the leaf to permeate the kueh.\nWhen the kueh is cooked and turns into a deeper colour, the result is a glistening skin that’s soft and chewy. \n\nWorkers start as early as 6am and the first batch of ang ku kueh is rolled out by 8.30am. Popular flavours such as coconut typically sell out after lunch.\xa0When a flavour is running out for the day, more will be made in small batches of 100 to 200 pieces.The bulk of the day’s ang ku kueh is made in the morning (making the pastry skin, moulding and selling), while the team gets ready for the next day by preparing the banana leaf and filling.\xa0To meet the demands of the morning crowd, the team prepares the raw ingredients a day in advance.\n\nJi Xiang is powered by the strength of aunties — with a little help from cans of Red Bull. They enjoy the communal process of making the ang ku kueh. It’s a gruelling process that requires dexterity, attention to detail in ensuring the high quality of kuehs and patience to sit for long hours on end making kueh.It’s highly labour-intensive, which is why there are not many ang ku kueh stores around, Kelvin believes.\xa0One pro-tip on how to best enjoy the kueh — eat it as fresh as possible within the day. Otherwise, they can be kept for two or three days if stored in the fridge. \xa036 Kim Keat Road\nOpen: Tuesday to Saturday (10am to 5pm) \n\nThe Ang Ku Kueh Hut was established in 2004 by the pioneer generation of Toh siblings (unrelated to the Toh family that runs Ji Xiang Ang Ku Kueh).

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/popiah-from-scratch/:['From Scratch is a series exploring the origins of foods that are popular in Singapore and the work that goes into making them.Popiah, which means “thin pancake” in Teochew, is a roll filled with cooked vegetables and sometimes meat that’s wrapped in a thin flour skin.It is said to have originated from China’s Fujian province, where it was eaten during spring when there would be an abundance of vegetables.A common hawker food, the snack is typically served alongside local dishes such as rojak and kueh pie tee.In recent years, newer brands including Souperstar and Mr Popiah have given their takes on this traditional dish. Appealing to younger consumers, they have come up with new fillings, flavours and packaging, and marketed it as a local version of a burrito or wrap.The stalwarts of popiah-making, however, are nowhere near forgotten. Good Chance Popiah Eating House, on Silat Avenue in Jalan Bukit Merah, has been selling its fresh rolls since 1977 and has no plans on stopping.\xa0We sat down with Good Chance Popiah’s fourth-generation owner Boon Kai Chun, 38, better known as Ah Boy to regulars. He says that while the family went into the popiah business by chance, it’s through hard work and genuine service that they’re still around today.His grandfather Hou Shen Hu, who passed away last year aged 103, sold Hokkien dishes with his mother (Boon’s great-grandmother) at an office canteen in Tanjong Pagar.Popiah made it to the menu only at the suggestion of friends and family who loved their delicious homemade rolls. And when business caught on after, their landlord offered them a unit along Neil Road for expansion.Operating as a pub by night, it was called Good Chance Pub and was where they found the inspiration for their name — Good Chance Popiah Eating House.The thing that strikes you immediately when you enter Good Chance Popiah’s Silat Avenue store is how homey and quaint, albeit dated, it is.Filled with big, round banquet tables, the furniture might look too large for the compact space, but gives it plenty of character. Handed down from generations before, they’re as enduring as the multi-generational families who frequent the restaurant.Boon ushers me to a small table and asked if I’d eaten. Before I could respond, he signals to his staff to prepare two rolls of popiah. Such warm Hokkien hospitality reminded me of my Hokkien grandfather, who always expressed his affection by making sure I’d something to eat.Surviving for more than four decades, the business has taken a big hit during the pandemic, but Boon remains confident in his family’s recipe. Their do-it-yourself (DIY) popiah hasn’t changed much since the beginning.Making your own roll is where the fun is and, in his words, “you can decide whichever toppings you want, and you can wrap it in whatever way you want”.For much of his childhood, DIY popiah was a family affair and he hopes to transfer that spirit to the restaurant.If you’ve never wrapped one before, Boon and his staff are happy to show you how it’s done for the first one, but they’ll leave the rest to you.i) Prepare the popiah’s filling, which consists of turnip, cabbage, carrot, bamboo shoots, leek, French beans, shrimp, garlic, and sole-fish powder.ii) Fry the ingredients together, then simmer the vegetables over low heat for an hour, or over high heat for 45 minutes. Once done, set them aside.iii) Prepare the rest of the toppings — sliced hard-boiled egg, lettuce, beansprouts, sweet sauce, minced garlic, chilli paste, parsley, and chopped peanuts.\xa0i) Take a popiah skin and place it on a plate.ii) Spread the chilli, garlic and sweet sauce evenly on the popiah skin. Be sure to apply these sparingly because too much might make the skin too wet.iii) First, lay a lettuce leaf and a few beansprouts off-centre, on the side that’s closer to you.iv) Put two to two-and-a-half spoonfuls of the simmered filling (with the sauce squeezed out as much as possible) onto the lettuce.v) Crumble up a slice (or two) of egg on the pile of vegetables, then top everything with a few parsley leaves and chopped peanuts.vi) Starting from the end nearest to you, fold the popiah skin over the filling, and roll it once.vii) Make sure the filling is tucked firmly in the skin, before you fold the skin from the left and right towards the centre.viii) Using your index and middle fingers, hold down the sides as you continue rolling the popiah outwards with your thumbs till you reach the furthest end of the popiah skin.ix) Serve the popiah in the same way you would enjoy a burrito or cut it in half if you prefer.\xa0\xa0Paya Lebar Square, 01-48, 60 Paya Lebar Road\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (12pm to 8.30pm)\nA nondescript snack stall at the main entrance of Paya Lebar Square, Ah Long Pancake & Popiah serves up affordable pancakes and popiah.\xa0Coronation Shopping Plaza, 02-10, 587 Bukit Timah Road\nOpen: Monday (11am to 5pm); Tuesday and Wednesday, and Friday to Sunday (11am to 7pm), Thursday (10am to 7pm)Founded in 1958 by the late Mr Lim Kam Chwee, Ann Chin Popiah started off as a pushcart stall in the 1950s and later set up shop on Upper Thomson Road, before moving to its current space at Coronation Shopping Plaza.

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/local-kopi-from-scratch/:['From Scratch is a series exploring the origins of foods that are popular in Singapore and the work that goes into making them.For some years now, Singapore has seen no lack of new cafes sprouting up. Think minimalist industrial aesthetics, gourmet coffee beans and baristas whipping up fancy cups of joe — all in air-conditioned comfort.But what about the origins of the humble local kopi (Malay for coffee), typically found at your neighbourhood kopitiam or coffee shop?Kim Guan Guan Coffee Trading, founded more than three decades ago, is among the last of its kind fighting to preserve the vanishing craft of traditionally roasted Singapore kopi.Founder Jason Soon, 55, started out importing and selling raw coffee beans. Ironically, he didn’t even like coffee to begin with.He later took over a factory space where he honed his kopi-making skills.The history of Singapore kopi dates back to the 19th century, says Soon. When the British came to Singapore, they had a habit of drinking coffee and brought in imported Arabica beans.The locals who had a taste were hooked. For coolies toiling under the sun, the coffee was an instant pick-me-up.But Arabica beans were way too costly.So they thought: Why not use cheaper robusta beans, grown in Indonesia, as a substitute?Robusta beans have around twice the caffeine content, more bitterness and less acidity than Arabica beans. They experimented with cooking the beans with barley and corn, before finding the golden combination of sugar and margarine.The result? A distinctively thick, rich and nutty brew with a dominant roast flavour, packing a punch with every sip.Since then, it’s been an intrinsic part of the Singapore story.Fast-forward to the present day and the country’s coffee scene is thriving.For 27 years, Kim Guan Guan had been located in the ageing Defu Industrial Park in Hougang, within a row of brick-red one-storey factories.Workers slogged away in a hot and smoky environment, with thick clouds of smoke perennially billowing out of the premises. Operations there were largely manual.Roasters would listen out for a crackling pop sound, which indicates that the beans were roasted.Then they would pour the mountain of beans into a vat of melted sugar. This was followed by tossing the blended beans with margarine. The roasters then shovelled metal rods to break the beans apart and store them.It was a laborious trade, says Soon.Fearing that kopi roasting might become a thing of the past, he made it his mission to sustain this disappearing art. He knew that the firm needed to innovate urgently to improve its workflow and yet maintain traditional tastes.Late last year, Kim Guan Guan moved into its brand-new premises at JTC Bedok Food City.Now, it uses state-of-the-art, tailor-made machines equipped with digital controls, so that workers can accurately manage the temperature at the push of a button.After installing conveyor belts, the company needs just one worker per roast, down from the usual three. The smoke is sucked away through funnels, which makes the environment more comfortable.When it comes to brewing the kopi, a lot of the know-how has been lost, Soon laments.Every week, he makes it a point to visit various kopitiams and cafes to teach the staff there the art of brewing Singapore kopi.Soon says that when knowledge is passed down, many coffee-shop staff simply follow the steps they were taught without truly understanding the process, or take shortcuts to speed up the process.For instance, they might estimate how much hot water to put in, or let the coffee powder sit for a very short time in the hot water, resulting in a less consistent brew.Nigel Soon, Soon’s 25-year-old son who is learning the ropes, says Kim Guan Guan attracts people in their mid-20s to 40s.Jason Soon and his team are setting their sights on partnering with Singapore hotel chains and enlarging the company’s presence in places such as Hong Kong, South Korea and the Philippines.He’s confident that Singapore kopi will prevail.Drinking kopi not only helps Singaporeans feel connected to their heritage and brings a sense of comfort and nostalgia. It also allows tourists to experience authentic Singapore culture, says Jason Soon.Being exposed to coffee and having to do quality checks daily, he came to love the brews and now gets his daily fix of five to eight cups a day.“Coffee is an essential part of Singapore culture. It’s how we bring friends and our neighbours together. As manufacturers, if we don’t work hard at preserving it, who will?”Raw robusta beans, sourced from Indonesia, are stored in a cool environment inside the warehouse for a few months. Once ready, they are placed in a machine that tosses and turns to sieve the coffee beans until all the dust and dirt are shaken off.\xa0This is the most crucial part of the process, which involves roasting, caramelising and cooling. One batch of coffee takes between 50 minutes and an hour to roast.First, the beans are cooked in a drum at about 240°C. At the same time, sugar is melted at 150°C or so, before it caramelises and coats the beans. Precision is key; either the sugar or coffee might get burnt if there’s even the slightest miscalculation in timing. It could also affect the taste profile of the coffee.It takes about seven minutes for the beans to cool and the funnels help expel the smoke.Once the beans are cooled, the workers store them in gunny sacks quickly.Three tonnes of coffee are produced each day.The beans are ground, packed and shipped to more than 1,000 clients. These include kopitiams, cafes, supermarkets and high-end hotels.Some of its clients are casual dining business Fei Siong Group, soya bean product retailer Mr Bean Singapore, bakery chain Polar Puffs & Cakes, and The Wok People, which manages cafeterias at locations such as department store Takashimaya and Gleneagles Hospital.\xa0The coffee is brewed with a flannel sock as a filter, and poured from long-necked kettles to create a thick cuppa. It can be drunk black, or with sugar and evaporated milk.\xa0Hong Lim Food Centre, 02-41, 531A Upper Cross Street\nOpen: Monday to Friday (7.30am to 2.30pm)Located at Amoy Street Food Centre and Hong Lim Food Centre, Coffee Break remains rooted in the tradition of hawking traditional kopi, while offering new concoctions with a twist.\xa037 Beach Road, 01-01\nOpen: Tuesday to Friday (7.30am to 7pm); Saturday and Sunday (8am to 7pm)YY Kafei Dian, an old-school Hainanese coffee shop, is outfitted with a chicken rice stall, a zi char stall and a drink stall.\xa0 Enjoy a hot cup of traditional kopi with its popular kaya toast and sugar donuts on the side.\xa010 North Bridge Road, 01-5109\nOpen: Daily (5am to 4pm)With almost five decades of history, Heap Seng Leong is one of Singapore’s hidden gems.

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/kouign-amann-from-scratch/:['From Scratch is a series exploring the origins of foods that are popular in Singapore and the work that goes into making them.With the rise of artisanal bakeries in Singapore, it’s hard to ignore the increasing popularity of kouign-amann — a pastry that originates from Brittany, France. Its name means “butter cake” in Breton, a Celtic language spoken in the French region.The buttery, crispy and sweet viennoiserie is well-loved for its multiple layers of pastry, interspersed with generous amounts of sugar and butter. As such, it is common to find it stocked at artisanal bakeries in Singapore.\xa0To find out more about this pastry, I spoke to Wythe Ng, 34, co-owner and executive chef of bakery La Levain on Hamilton Road.It feels as though there are as many layers to his baking career as there are in a kouign-amann from the bakery (19 layers, to be exact).Ng started his baking career at age 15, working part-time at a bakery in his hometown of Sekinchan near Selangor, Malaysia.The humble chef says he’s never gone to a culinary institute, except when he attended a training school in Japan after working for a few years. He later came to Singapore with nary a knowledge of the English language and picked up everything from scratch here.“That’s why I’m curious about everything, and I’ll do a lot of research,” Ng tells me. And his hard work over the years — in baking and English — shows in the way he’s able to methodically and clearly explain every stage of making a kouign-amann.Ng opened La Levain on Hamilton Road in December last year with a few business partners, including Ken Soh, 36, who handles operations at the cafe. Before La Levain, Ng had stints at Bakery Brera, Keong Saik Bakery, Asanoya, and Baker & Cook.Impressed by the quality and consistency of Ng’s bakes after scouring bakeries across Singapore, Soh scouted Ng from his previous bakery.Acknowledging Ng’s perseverance in learning baking and English, Soh says: “When you’ve a passion for something, it’s easier to pick it up.”Today, at La Levain, Ng and his team of six full-time chefs deftly churn out 30 to 50 types of pastries a day, including the classic kouign-amann and brown sugar kouign-amann with Himalayan sea salt.Despite the bakery’s French name, which means “mother dough”, La Levain also sells Asian- and locally inspired bakes with flavours such as bubur cha cha, hojicha (Japanese roasted green tea) and otah (direct from Muar, no less).I ask if it’s tedious to produce bakes on such a scale for a small, newish bakery, and Ng modestly replies that technology has helped a great deal. Soh adds that La Levain is able to do so because some of the chefs have worked with Ng for quite a few years, and there’s good working chemistry with one another.On why his team pushes out so many pastry varieties, Ng says: “It provides more opportunities for our young bakers to do and learn more things.”\xa0The kouign-amann ranks among the top five viennoiseries Ng has eaten after he chanced on it in Japan in 2016. Coincidentally, kouign-amann is also one of the five top-selling pastries at La Levain.Its kouign-amann is crispier and less sweet, in line with the Singapore crowd’s preferences. It also isn’t traditionally shaped — resembling a small cup — but delivered in a flat, spherical form, so customers can see the layers and pry them apart as they dig in.But despite the many steps Ng takes us through, he says this isn’t the most challenging pastry he makes at La Levain — the bakery’s Christmas panettone is.Difficulty levels aside, it’s clear La Levain’s kouign-amann is a standout. I tried one and took another home for breakfast — freezing and then toasting it a few days later. Both tasted equally good, were still crispy (the cackle of the caramel crust was unmistakable), and not cloyingly sweet, just as Ng promised.He’s unfazed about sharing his recipe with us and aspiring kouign-amann bakers.“You want the (exact) recipe, we also can give. We’re very open-minded,” he says with a laugh.He tells us that the secret behind making a good kouign-amann is temperature control, to ensure that the sugar doesn’t melt and the butter doesn’t split during the lamination process. To ensure this, he works in a 16°C room.i) Mix the ingredients — flour, milk powder, malt powder, sugar, salt butter, starter, and old dough — for four or five minutes.ii) Place the dough in the chiller for an hour. This process is called autolyse and increases the extensibility of the dough.iii) Remove the dough from the fridge, pour in fresh yeast and mix for about 10 more minutes. Once done, remove the dough from the mixer and let it rest in a container for 30 minutes.iv) After the dough has rested, shape it into a rectangle before placing it in the freezer overnight.i) The following day, remove the dough from the freezer and flatten it, using a dough sheeter, to the required thickness.ii) The lamination process — where butter is folded into dough repeatedly to create thin alternating layers of butter and dough — begins. Place the butter sheet at the centre of the dough and do a letter fold, in which the dough is divided into thirds and the edges are folded inwards to cover the butter slab.Run the dough through the dough sheeter to the required thickness and do a letter fold again.iii) The dough is then left to rest in the freezer for an hour. This allows it to stabilise, so that it’s easier to work with.iv) Once rested, coat the dough with sugar on both sides and letter-fold the dough again.v) Flatten the dough with the dough sheeter.\xa0i) Sprinkle sugar on the surface of the dough before rolling it upwards lengthwise till the whole dough is rolled up.ii) Prepare the metal ring moulds on the tray by coating them with butter on the inside and dipping them in sugar.iii) Cut 1-inch to 1.5-inch slices of dough and place them in the metal ring moulds.iv) Once the dough is placed into the moulds, let the dough proof (the final rise of the dough) for an hour or two.v) Once it’s ready, bake the dough at 180°C for 18 to 21 minutes. After that, remove the mould, flip each kouign-amann and bake the other side for another three minutes before it’s done.\xa03 Jalan Kledek\nOpen: Wednesday to Sunday (11am to 6pm)Established in 2018, Mother Dough gets its name from the fermentation starter used in bread-making.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/lilac-oak/:['With Singapore’s vibrant and dynamic dining scene, it’s easy to rattle off the names of the newest Italian joints or retro burger bars in town. However, it can be hard to pinpoint a solid vegan diner to head down to.\xa0Lilac Oak, a cosy vegan cafe tucked away just off the main thoroughfare of Orchard, is a good and accessible bet.\xa0It’s a popular vegan-friendly eatery that prides itself on serving plant-based sweets and savouries, which are great for both the body and environment. Its dishes are also allium-free, which means recipes are prepared without garlic, leeks, scallions, and chives.Situated near Dhoby Ghaut MRT station, Lilac Oak is nestled between condominiums along River Valley. We do think the place is a tad challenging to get to and some navigation is needed, but the food makes the journey all worth it.\xa0The cafe reminds us of a glass house, with a floor-to-ceiling glass exterior that allows us to peek into the bustling activity within. You can spot it from afar, too, simply by the steady stream of customers filing in and out to get their usual cuppa or brunch fix.Set foot in the store and you’ll be warmly greeted by Lilac Oak’s owner herself, Chloe Lee. Besides taking on the role of head chef, she’s also the brains behind Lilac Oak’s menu.\xa0According to Lee, the menu is kept lean because she wanted to encourage diners to try something new at Lilac Oak every time they visit.\xa0You can look forward to tantalising brunch fare, pastries such as cinnamon rolls and banana bread, as well as housemade gelato.You can tell that the cafe is close to her heart, too.\xa0Chloe’s mother is a vegan and Buddhist vegetarian, and whenever she’s on the hunt for food options, plant-based ones were limited — and not exactly tasty. Chloe decided to take matters into her own hands and create an enticing menu that would appeal to both meat lovers and vegans alike.\xa0Since then, Lilac Oak has garnered a strong following of regulars who often patronise the cafe for its signature ice cream and brews.We started off with the hearty peanut tempeh sandwich (S$10.90), which comes with an oh-so-chonky marinated tempeh patty, fresh lettuce, wilted baby spinach, and tomatoes. The ingredients are then sandwiched between homemade peanut sauce and fluffy nine-grain toast.The peanut sauce is delicious, with just the right balance between sweet and salty. It also adds a savoury nuttiness that elevates the dish. If you’re torn between which main to go for, let this be a sign — the gochujang (Korean chilli paste) rose penne (S$16.90) is a must-try item. It’s sweet, creamy and spicy, with each bite reeling you in for more.\xa0Peppered with mushrooms, carrots and corn, the pasta is tossed in a housemade allium-free kimchi and gochujang sauce. Despite utilising only plant-based ingredients, the dish is incredibly flavourful — we dare say it’s one of our favourite pasta dishes to date. The best way to round off a meal is by tucking into pastries, and you can’t miss out on the pulut hitam (black glutinous rice) taro (S$4) and taro tarts (S$4.50) — specially made for the Singaporean palate.The pulut hitam taro tart, which features 100% fresh taro paste atop a base of rich pulut hitam paste, is our favourite. Holding the treat together is a crumbly tart that simply melts in your mouth. We devoured the tart in a minute — every bite was as luscious as the next.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Feuds: Saizeriya vs Milan Shokudo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeat the heat with Lilac Oak’s signature gelato.

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/my-must-eats-lai-shanru/:['My Must-Eats is a HungryGoWhere series featuring Singapore’s public figures and their favourite food haunts. This week, we speak to Lai Shanru, co-founder of Shopback.Every Singaporean loves a good deal. And that’s something Lai Shanru, co-founder of ShopBack, recognised early.\xa0Back then, the idea of getting cashback with multiple brands was still a fairly new concept.Today, the brand serves more than 35 million users across 10 markets, including Singapore and Australia. There aren’t many who don’t know about it.\xa0The 35-year-old is a bona fide girl boss. At the young age of 26, she joined forces with her other co-founders to start ShopBack.\xa0Armed with just three years of working experience, including online fashion retailer Zalora, it was an undeniably daunting task for anyone. But Lai took it in stride and learnt quickly from the get-go.\xa0In 2018, the Singapore Management University graduate was featured in Forbes’ 30 Under 30: Big Money list for the Asian region, and a year later, she was featured in Prestige’s 40 under 40 list.\xa0Another fact about Lai – she’s a certified foodie obsessed with hawker eats, just like the rest of us.\xa0HungryGoWhere sits down with her as she dishes out some of her favourite meals.\xa0Pro tip: Some of these stalls can even earn you some cashback with ShopBack Go!Mostly Asian food such as porridge, zi char or hawker favourites such as chicken rice, hokkien mee, chai tow kway (carrot cake).\xa0Growing up, my favourite place for porridge and zi char with my family was Springleaf Taiwan Porridge. We used to go there often for family meals.\xa0I liked it so much that one year I even asked to have my birthday celebration meal there, when typically we would go to “fancier” restaurants for such special occasions. It was a decision that was much to my siblings’ dismay, as they were looking forward to a rare meal out at a more expensive restaurant!Hawker centres such as the Beo Crescent Food Centre (in in Bukit Ho Swee). I love the variety of food I can find there, and it’s not only delicious but also affordable. My favourites from there are the fish soup, herbal bak kut teh, claypot rice and ban mian, just to name a few.\xa0Ah Mei Handmade Noodles is one of my favourites\xa0 — it has great ban mian. I particularly love its mee hoon kuey (hand-pulled noodles). The stall owner is generous with ingredients and the soup is so heartwarming. I also like Cantonese Claypot Rice from the same food centre. It has tasty claypot rice and is super affordable, too. Plus it has soups and other dishes.\xa0\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy Must-Eats with the Korean oppa from SG, Eric Youn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommentary: Why I don’t go to cafes anymore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7 best cafes at Joo Chiat for brunch, coffee & cakes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHokkien mee! I like most Hokkien mee options as long as they’re tasty. Golden Mile Food Centre and Chomp Chomp have pretty good ones that are “prawn-y” (really umami, thanks to the rich prawn stock) with good chilli! Chilli makes a big difference.Actually, I miss hawker food in general when I travel. You don’t usually get to experience such tasty and diverse types of food under the same roof like you do at our Singapore hawker centres.Perhaps authentic kimbap in Korea! I’ve only tried kimbap once in Singapore and would like to try traditional ones in Korea. I absolutely love Korean food.\xa0I liked Dae.baps at Oxley Tower, but unfortunately it seems to have closed down. I love Korean BBQ, stews, soups, pancakes, rice balls, jjamppong (spicy seafood noodle soup), bossam (boiled pork wraps)… the list goes on.My go-to eateries are Kimildo Korean BBQ at Tras Street, Wang Dae Bak, Masizzim (a Korean stew specialist), Yogiyo at Beauty World Centre, Anju (for elevated Korean food), and The Butcher’s Dining at Havelock Road (for great quality meats for home barbecues!).Can I say my husband’s cooking? I was just telling him how much I missed brunch food one weekend, so he whipped up some french toast and tartine and it was so good! I tend to find the usual brunch food outside quite underwhelming. I’m very blessed that I married such a good chef! Otherwise, my recent trip to Ashino, an omakase restaurant at Chijmes, was amazing. I’m usually not an omakase fan in Singapore, but went there to celebrate my husband’s birthday. The food was really really good. The assortment of sashimi was very tasty and the rice was exceptionally flavourful, too.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/gajalee/:['MUST TRIES: Butter garlic pepper prawns and shyam saveraOne of Mumbai’s most famous seafood restaurants, Gajalee, threw open its doors recently in Singapore.For many years, Gajalee’s six restaurants have been the place in Mumbai to taste Maharashtrian seafood dishes.But most Singaporeans were not familiar with it until a travel show hosted by actor Mark Lee featured the restaurant.The steady stream of Singaporean tourists that followed prompted the seafood group to open an outlet here. To maintain standards, it even brought along a chef who has been with the restaurant for 20 years to head the kitchen.After hearing about its reputation in India, we were keen to check out the Singapore branch, in particular it’s signature dish Bombay Duck.We dropped by for lunch on a weekday afternoon and quickly ordered the famous Bombil (Bombay Duck) Fry ($14). Puzzled as to why the dish was listed among the seafood dishes, we asked the waiter how the duck is prepared.That’s when we found out that Bombay Duck is in fact a fish that’s native to Mumbai!Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/unatoto/:['As a proud Friends fan, unagi is a state of total awareness. But, to most, it’s a freshwater eel beloved in Japanese cuisine.\xa0Jokes aside, unagi isn’t new to Singapore and a number of eateries specialise in the delicacy, such as Man Man (now Unagi Tei) and Una Una.\xa0But unagi isn’t typically the most affordable meal around — a decent unagi rice bowl can set you back easily by S$25 or more.\xa0Well, we’ve got good news for all the unagi fans out there! With prices starting from S$9.50, Unatoto in Tanjong Pagar makes decent unagi rice bowls a more economical, everyday option.Unagi and “fast food” are two words that don’t usually go together, until we heard about Unatoto. Unatoto is a popular Japanese unagi fast-food chain with more than 100 stores in Japan, Hong Kong, Thailand and Vietnam.Unatoto’s first Singapore outlet opened in January 2023 and is located conveniently in the basement of Guoco Tower, right beside Exit J of Tanjong Pagar MRT station.\xa0\xa0The space itself isn’t that big but can seat 50 to 55 people at a time. Given its prime location, we imagine Unatoto can get crowded at lunchtime on weekdays, what with its affordable prices and fast service.Inside, you’ll be surrounded by Japanese decor such as wooden furniture, hanging paper umbrellas and paper lanterns. There’s even a cute eel mascot that’s the undeniable star of its wall art.We visited Unatoto on a Saturday afternoon, and thankfully, there wasn’t much of a queue.\xa0Once seated at the restaurant, which is completely cashless, you’ll see a QR code for ordering and you can pay directly from your phone.\xa0While there wasn’t a snaking queue, Unatoto enjoyed a steady stream of customers throughout our visit.\xa0Unfortunately, the restaurant offers takeaways only in the evenings, so if you’re looking for a quick and tasty meal, you should definitely dine in — but during off-peak hours.\xa0You can’t visit Unatoto without trying its signature Unadon (S$9.50), served with a portion of grilled unagi over a bed of fluffy Japanese rice and topped with a generous drizzle of unagi sauce. If you prefer a heartier portion, we recommend getting the Unadon Double (S$14.50), which comes with two pieces of grilled eel.\xa0The grilled eel had a distinct smoky flavour. My dining companion found it too smoky, but I thought there was just enough char.\xa0Next to your table, you’ll see various spices and condiments, such as unagi sauce, soy sauce and chilli flakes, which you can use to add even more flavour to your meal. We don’t think this is necessary, but hey, diner’s choice!You can also complete your meal with a value set — choose either soup (S$4) or mini noodle (S$5) with one of the following sides: Kimchi, onsen egg, okra (ladies’ fingers), chilled tofu, pickled vegetables, or a mini salad.\xa0We also tried the unagi tempura don (S$15), which caught our attention as my dining companion and I have never had fried unagi. What arrived was an assortment of lightly fried tempura, including unagi, prawn, okra and mushrooms, and more of that delicious unagi sauce drizzled over a generous serving of rice.\xa0We enjoyed the fried unagi and tempura, which was crisp and well-seasoned. But get it to share — after a while, we felt it was too rich and can be cloying.If you’re not in the mood for unagi, Unatoto has other options such as teriyaki chicken don (S$8.50), plain udon or soba (S$8). It also serves hitsumabushi (S$13.50), which features finely sliced unagi over steamed Japanese rice, with a set of condiments for seasoning as you’d like.We added value soup sets to our meal and tried both options: The red miso and unagi liver soup.\xa0The red miso soup was flavourful, and had a good amount of tofu and seaweed. The unagi liver soup, on the other hand, was a bit of a miss. It didn’t have many ingredients and was rather insipid. If you’re not a fan of innards, you should probably skip this.Another interesting item on Unatoto’s menu was the umaki, or Japanese omelette with unagi (half for S$3, regular for S$5.50). The menu portrayed it as a thick piece of unagi sandwiched between tamago, but the half umaki didn’t have a lot of eel.\xa0\xa0While there were some hits and misses, our experience was positive overall. Unatoto had tasty unagi and a decent variety of dishes, and was value for money. We can see this place becoming a regular haunt for unagi lovers and we would come back the next time an unagi craving hits. Is it conducive to conversation? Yes, unless it’s full. The tables are rather close to one another.Is a reservation necessary? No, Unatoto does not take reservations.How to get there? Walk from Tanjong Pagar MRT station’s Exit J or via Guoco Tower’s basement.HungryGoWhere paid for its meal at this restaurant for this review. Still hungry?

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/brostern-hawker-hustlers/:['Hawker Hustlers is a new HungryGoWhere series spotlighting young and emerging hawkers with compelling stories. Read through all the way for an exclusive GrabFood promo so you can try their food, too.\nHalal-Western fusion stall Brostern has made it a point to embody what it means to be not just a business, but also one with heart.\xa0It’s certainly been making its presence felt within the community. Some of its initiatives include keeping meals affordable for people in need, sponsoring a mixed-age-group sepak takraw team named Wutank, dishing out life advice to youngsters, and even encouraging its staff to grow their savings through cash incentives.\n\nLocated at Ci Yuan Hawker Centre, Brostern was founded during the Covid-19 pandemic by four friends who had known one another since primary school. \n\nInitially started by Roimy Tan, Khairul Sulaiman, Rully Romally, and Faliq Ahmad in September 2020, Brostern was meant to provide affordable and tasty meals for those who had been affected by pandemic job cuts. \n\nThey settled on their hometown Hougang, a stone’s throw away from their alma mater, Yio Chu Kang Primary School.Today, the Brostern brand is managed by brothers Raimy Tan, 31, Roimy Tan, 30, and Rainy Tan, 28, who are Chinese-Muslim.\xa0\xa0Upon entering the hawker centre, hungry patrons are greeted by Brostern’s modern facade, cheery blue banners and brightly lit LED sign.\n\nThe business has expanded to include two stalls in the same row, one serving classic Western fare and the other offering fusion Indian cuisine. The second is a more recent addition, which opened in December 2022.\n\nWhen HungryGoWhere met the three Brostern hawkers one afternoon in April, they cut a striking trio, sporting nearly identical Brostern jerseys they had designed themselves.The “PR and marketing spokesperson” of the business is the burly and outgoing Raimy Tan, with the cheekily named title of “towkay” emblazoned on the back of his shirt. He’s flanked by his brothers Roimy Tan and Rainy Tan.With dishes such as the massive Brostern Ambeng platter, Volcano Burger — a homemade beef patty served with fries and a veritable flood of nachos cheese — and a spicy Lemak chilli padi pasta, Brostern’s menu sports a greater variety than most Western stalls. And they’re at affordable prices, too.\xa0It’s garnered them some devoted fans. Our photoshoot with the brothers is brought to a momentary halt by a Brostern customer who came by to declare his love for their biryani dish.\n\nTheir dedication to do good — while uplifting the hawker culture — has earned them accolades such as the Promising New Hawker Award 2022. \n\nOn what drives their social mission, Raimy Tan says: “If we don’t lead as an example to the new generation, then who will?“When we put in effort to maintain hawker culture wholeheartedly, we create a sense of harmony. (This is) where we find love and unity in being a Singaporean.”Here’s an edited excerpt of our interview with Raimy Tan:Brostern was started by four of our friends during the pandemic, but today, it has been taken over by our family. At that time, there were a lot of challenges and ups-and-downs, especially with food costs.\n\nDuring Covid-19, our mission was to help those who lost their jobs or were trying to save money, because buying a meal would be difficult for them. Our idea was to sell food at a lower cost.A lot of businesses are like: “I want to make a certain amount of money at the end of the month”. To be able to reach that amount, they will break it down: “Okay, so my plan is to sell at S$8, so I can reach that.”\xa0That’s the businessman mindset. Ours is the other way round. We look at the cost and think: “Can we do this at S$5?”\xa0In order for us to profit, we have to sell twice the number of plates.At the end of the day, with the prices that we sell at, a lot of residents and customers ask us: “Do you guys actually earn?” \n\n(From the start,) we already had this mindset that we want to earn a salary. We are not here to scale up, to become a very big business.\n\nThe reason the government made a hawker centre like this is that they want heartlanders to have a cleaner place to eat and still maintain the lively culture of hawkers and affordable food.\xa0We try our best to also stick to it, but of course, balancing our costs, maintenance of the shop and everything.Western food (in Singapore) can go many ways, be it Chinese, Muslim or Indian. It is a multiracial cuisine. You make it halal and everybody can eat. And of course it’s easier to cook Western food. Actually, we don’t have culinary backgrounds; we were in the nightlife industry. I worked as head of security in a club, and my second brother Roimy was an assistant manager in a club while pursuing a diploma in aerospace engineering. My third brother, Rainy, was a bartender.\xa0So when Covid-19 struck, the nightlife industry closed. My brothers started thinking: “Should we open this (stall)?”\xa0So they went ahead and did it. I was not working then, but I was the backbone: Supporting everything, (overseeing) the set-up, doing handyman jobs for the stall. So we saved a lot on the piping work, the lights. Everything that we could do, we did ourselves, including the photos and design. For everything else, we got a certified person to come and do it. One month before the stall opened, my father and I would stand around and do PR for the stall. We (called out) in Mandarin: “Aunty, one more month and the stall will open.”\n\nBecause we conversed in Chinese, it’s comfortable for them. The residents — especially the elderly (around) my mother’s age, 60-plus (years old) — know how to eat, but don’t know how to say the dish name.\xa0(In Mandarin) “There’s a person eating the noodles, it looks very good. What’s it called?” they would ask me. \n\nWhen we can explain to them in Mandarin, we win their hearts. When they feel comfortable, they will support you, and of course, you must be respectful. They will look at your manners all the time.\n\nI have a customer who comes every day for our mac and cheese because we sell the cheapest mac and cheese. Back then, it was S$2.50 and the portion was big enough for two people to share. We really pulled the prices very low: Fish and chips, S$5, chicken chop and chicken cutlet, S$5.50. That kind of pricing.\n\nGoing through the pandemic, the challenge was ingredient costs. We were thinking: “Can we cover those costs?”We really squeezed (prices) until last year, until we told the management we really could not do it anymore, and we decided to increase our price. \n\nBut when we increased our prices, our customers were really happy for me. They really hope that we can earn and profit.\xa0\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Junction Westgate opening with promos; will house 23 tenants, including new halal teppanyaki\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHawker Hustlers: Hipster hawker Ray Yeo of Bei-Ing Dimsum Club on reinventing dim sum and his love for all things Japan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur signature is the Brostern Ambeng platter (starting from S$42). Nasi ambeng is a meal in Malay. It is a big platter with different Malay dishes with rice and (usually eaten by sharing it) in a group, so there’s a sense of community while eating. That’s why we named our dish that way, but we do it in the Western style and make it affordable for everyone.\n\nAs for our (second stall), we thought: “Why should we be known for only one cuisine?” So we went into nasi biryani, satay, and so on.I learnt to cook this nasi biryani from my ex-boss Suzana Sarwan — the owner of wedding caterer Marvelicious by MLC.\n\nShe taught me all these skills and cooking techniques. Her standards for chefs are (just) like (those at) The Fullerton Hotel. She guided and taught me what to do, what cannot do.I will put up a tripod and my camera, and I will put my spare phone there to record every single thing. I will write my notes, ask her questions and she will advise me: “Okay, this one, the taste is not enough, you add this one. What is this for? What is that for?”\n… She makes amazing desserts and cakes… and she’s more than willing to show me the ropes. My brothers will do operations, while I will go and study the area — other Western stalls and their food.If this place is popular, I’ll go and try it out. If the place serves pork, I will get my friend to go and eat and try what is so special about it. We always want to keep up.\n\nMy (second) brother Roimy has the most important role — the treasurer and purchaser of Brostern. Money in, money out — all his responsibility.I will do the marketing and speak on behalf of the business. Because my younger brothers can’t really talk much, but I can talk a lot.\n\nIn terms of character, Roimy is very calm. He has always contained his emotions very well. In business, there are always quarrels; I’m the one who’s very aggressive. When certain things are not done right, I always press them: “Why is it not like this or like that?”\xa0My third brother (Rainy) just joined (us). He’s very hardworking. He has an idea for a business, but (it’s) more of a cafe. He likes that type. But I told him he must learn the ropes here first.We were complacent. We thought that we had a branding that is very steady, so we opened our second outlet at Pasir Ris Central Hawker Centre without doing sufficient research to study the area and footfall. We thought: “We are Brostern!”.\xa0We had a lot of customers coming from the east, Tampines and Bedok. So we thought we would go nearer to them — it’ll be easier for them to come. But we lost it all and that was our downfall. Business was bad, (our finances) were (in the) negative.\xa0That’s why we closed that outlet down after six months. After that we came here — we have the opportunity (to serve more people at Ci Yuan).As for the happiest thing, it’s that we are still around.\n\nWe didn’t cut manpower; we still have the same manpower. Even though (our workers) are sitting down there (because there are sometimes no customers to serve). Even when we had that downfall in Pasir Ris and we closed for three months, everyone went jobless, and they still came back here and we started all over again.\n\nSo December 2022 was a brand-new start for us.\n\nTill now, I feel like we have gone through a number of storms in our life. That period of time was really very bad. We opened there (in Pasir Ris), lost a lot of money. The staff still all get their salary, but for us, for a few months we didn’t have a salary. That’s a lesson for us to remember. We plan to do different things under our brand. We plan to open a barbershop, because we’ve got a good number of youngsters here and our branding is known as these three guys. So very easily, we can get all these boys to go and do all these gentlemen haircuts. They like it. \n\nAnd we want to learn how to become a supplier. We want to be a one-stop-shop for Western suppliers. You come to me; I can tell you whatever you need. I can give you the (full) service. I can set up everything for you — even your photos I can take for you. So we (want to) become like a consultancy.We can also help link them up to good staff.Because in life, I have done wrong before. I have been the worst version of myself. I always got into unnecessary trouble with the law, chose to be a rebel and chose the wrong path in life.\xa0 \n\nToday, I have overcome my past and turned over a new tree, instead of a leaf.\xa0I’m inspired to teach the younger boys and lead them to success in life, rather than being lost without proper guidance. I feel I should repay society. I will always believe that you should always give people a second chance.\xa0\xa0But I have no regrets. If I didn’t go through that, I won’t be who I am now at 31 years old.\n\nI hope that my voice, or Brostern’s (social) movement, can set an example for other youngsters.Our staff are always younger than us. From time to time, they may make wrong decisions in their lives that affect them badly. We encourage them to listen to us.The boys from Wutank (sepak takraw group) also listen to us because they know about our past and what we have gone through.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/fukudon-remus-seow-hawker-hustlers/:['Hawker Hustlers is a new HungryGoWhere series spotlighting young and emerging hawkers with compelling stories.Fukudon sits in an unassuming corner of Marine Parade Central Market and Food Centre. It’s almost easy to miss for those unfamiliar with the area. \n\nBut, as we observed from a distance, a steady stream of customers in the know make a beeline for its hearty, delicious and affordable Asian fusion donburi (rice bowls). Fukudon’s customer base ranges widely from gym bros and students to neighbourhood aunties and working adults. In fact, without fail, one mystery customer orders its crunchy-fries set every afternoon at 3. \n\nOpened in 2020, Fukudon’s loyal following is testament to the hard work of Remus Seow, 27, who has built a reputation for creating dishes that are a cut above the usual Japanese hawker fare.\xa0\xa0With his baby face and casual demeanour, Seow comes across as friendly and approachable, striking an easy rapport with the HungryGoWhere team.After stints in Michelin-starred kitchens such as Les Amis and Basque Kitchen by Aitor, Seow took the plunge and ventured into the hawker business at the very place he grew up in: Marine Parade.\xa0He also wanted to pay homage to his fondest memories from his schooling years. “During my secondary school days, my friends and I would queue up during recess to buy our favourite donburi bowls. We squeezed a load of mayonnaise on top of our meals, making it even more sinful and scrumptious. I had always yearned to create my own version of donburi bowls with that same warm and hearty feel.\n\n“Being able to bring my memories to life through Fukudon is not only nostalgic, but a great joy knowing everyone else can feel the same.”Here’s a lightly edited excerpt of our interview:I started Fukudon based on my secondary school memory. I was studying at Bedok South Secondary and there always was a long queue at the Japanese stall in the school’s canteen. During the pandemic, I was still working at Basque Kitchen by Aitor. The lockdowns happened and many restaurants had to switch to takeaways. During that period, there was a lot of uncertainty. I wasn’t sure how long this situation would go on for.\xa0Then the pay cuts started… I was talking to my secondary school friend Jonathan Khoo (now our business partner), and he suggested: “Why not open your own hawker stall?” I took it as a joke at first. \n\nWhen that happened, I went home to think about it. I asked my then-girlfriend (now wife). She said: “It’s a risk, but if you want it, you should go for it.”\n\nI was only 24 at the time. I thought, if I do this, and if I fail after two years, I can do something else. \n\nI met my other business partner, also my childhood friend, Bryan Tan, who suggested that we make rice bowls. The moment he said it, the memory of my secondary school came back.\xa0He knew that there was a stall at Marine Parade, and this was where I grew up previously. I close my eyes, I can walk the whole place. So there’s a story behind this; there’s some soul in it.\n\nFor me, my earliest memory starts at the hawker centre. It didn’t start in a restaurant; I wasn’t born with a silver spoon in my mouth.\xa0I grew up with homecooked food. You know the movie Ratatouille? When the rat ate the cheese and had that mind-blowing experience? It’s the same thing when it comes to hawker food. It’s something I hold dearly to my heart.Fast-forward to the R&D process with my wife, who’s also a chef. She’s now a sous chef at Les Amis restaurant. I was working there when I met her. She was the one who supported me every step of the way. I couldn’t have done this alone. Nobody in their right mind can do this alone.\n\nThe first two rounds of R&D were a total failure. I can throw up and spit into the drain. Even the dog won’t eat it. It was that bad.\xa0I had little experience with Japanese food. Previously, I was doing French, Spanish and Asian.\xa0I literally broke down. I started crying. Did I make the wrong move before we even started? My wife said: “There’s no harm in trying one more time.” I sat there for a while. I was very tired. But I decided to try one more time and tweak the dishes.\xa0We tweaked the alcohol levels, the burning of the alcohol levels, how we fry, how we plate, the sauce for the salmon, and tried to make the techniques consistent. All these didn’t come overnight. After that, the food tasted not bad. After the seventh or eighth round, we invited our friends to come over and we collected a lot of feedback.The first day we opened the shop, nobody came for the first half hour. I was like: “Oh, shit. Is this my life now?”\n\nBut then word of Fukudon slowly grew and we were super packed. For the first month, I worked from 7am to 2am every day. It was crazy. I worked until I wanted to die. All the lights were already off and I was still here, peeling potatoes, cooking the onions and everything.\n\nAfter six to seven months, there was the Covid-19 Heightened Alert and we did takeaways.\xa0We decided to expand. We went to Punggol at first, but we didn’t think it through because that was a very secluded location. Not a lot of people came down. So we moved to Novena. Slowly, I grew my team.All our sauces are done by ourselves. We cook on the spot, so your food is not like cai fan (economic rice) where it’s put outside. The taste, the quality, the pricing of the food. That’s the difference between our food and others.\xa0It’s affordable and showcases how Japanese food is supposed to taste.\xa0Usually, at most places, the salmon and chicken breast are dry. I try my best to use my skills to make it as authentic as possible.It’s the suppliers. There’s a big difference. I compare it to clothing. You have your luxury brands like Prada and Gucci, then H&M and Uniqlo, and then you’re down to pasar malam (night markets).\xa0At different levels, the sourcing of the supplier will be very different. For me, all my contacts are from the fine-dining world. I can’t bring them here, so I have to reach out to new suppliers.\xa0Luckily, my wife’s cousin works in cai fan, so he helped connect me to good suppliers.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Junction Westgate opening with promos; will house 23 tenants, including new halal teppanyaki\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHawker Hustlers: Hipster hawker Ray Yeo of Bei-Ing Dimsum Club on reinventing dim sum and his love for all things Japan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n When people enjoy the food. Some people are a bit sceptical, but after they try it, they enjoy it.\xa0They tell me that the food is very good. That’s when you feel a sense of accomplishment, that you have done something right. We always want to do something right in our lives, whether it is making our parents proud or making it in life. When that happens, you feel good: “Oh, I’m the one who made the food that is nice and they return.”\n\nThere was a student who just ate one beef rice bowl. And then he came back to order one more bowl straight after. I said: “Bro, you can really eat!” He went: “I’m hungry, I’m hungry.” (laughs)\n\nActually, Fukudon means “happy don”. There was one day I almost went crazy. When it comes, it all happens at the same time. One staff member was down with Covid, the gas ran into problems, the fryer was spoilt, all on the same day. And I had long queues. I closed the shop, rushed to get all the things settled. I got through all that. This happens occasionally. \n\nI came to a point where I got numb to it, but I’m able to be more prepared.\xa0I can put in place timelines, and if someone is sick, how to cover them. I try to make it work. At the end of the day, I tell myself the day will still go on, people will still complain, but you just go with the flow. You need to tell yourself to just do the best that you can. Whether it’s good enough for other people, it does not matter. It matters only to you. I wouldn’t say it’s crazy, crazy. My life is a simple life. Just play mahjong and poker. Three nights ago, I was playing poker for three days straight. But not a crazy amount, lah, just hanging out with friends. \n\nIt’s how simple or how complicated you want your life to be. There’s a lot less me-time with my wife, but I still try to spend as much time with my family.\xa0My wife is off on the weekends, and then on Monday, my mother-in-law takes care of our daughter, together with my helper, and from Tuesday to Friday, our daughter will be at my mum’s place where my mum educates her in Mandarin. It’s the best I can do.We want to open another three outlets, each with a different concept, depending on the chef we bring in. \n\nAt Fukudon, I want to create a culture where everyone is on an equal level. I build the company around my people. I don’t call them my workers, but my colleagues. We are all trying to support one another. The Chinese stall next to mine, called Chinese Noodle. I’ve eaten the whole menu already. I swear, she’s got the best chilli-oil dumplings and cold noodles. It’s still very shiok, even though I’ve been here for the last three years.\xa0Good news for our readers who scrolled all the way to the end!

Coupled with wooden furniture and dried floral arrangements, the place exudes serenity, making you feel right at home.\xa0Here, take a breather and unwind with a good cup of tea. If you’re in the mood for light bites, check out the pastries or sandos (also known as Japanese-style sandwiches).\xa0Price range: $Crowd favourites: The speculoos blondie (S$1.80) goes well with the rich iced chocolate (S$6).

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/ameising-la-volta/:['If you want good pasta in Singapore, you typically go to a bona fide Italian restaurant or you beeline for one of those newer breeds of specialty joints around town that are all the rage.We’re talking about places such as Tipo Pasta Bar, Eleven Strands, and La Mensa — they aren’t quite authentically Italian, but still serve up very good plates of pasta.\xa0Ameising La Volta, which opened at the doorstep of Lazada One at Bras Basah Road two months ago, belongs to the latter.This is the latest concept by the Ameising group, which boasts CBD favourites such as Ameising Bar & Dining and Ameising Hikaru among its brands.\xa0Ameising La Volta, a stone’s throw away from Bencoolen MRT station, might specialise in pasta and tapas, but it still retains the group’s signature of taking inspiration from Japanese flavours.\xa0The chef leading the new concept, Caleb Ang, used to run Mono Izakaya, a modern experimental izakaya in Jalan Besar. He brings over some of his star dishes, including the unagi puff and melon ice cream with parma ham.There’s not been much buzz around the restaurant since its opening, which is strange, because I say with some confidence that Ameising La Volta is a hidden gem to be watched.\xa0It combines the flair of an upscale dining venue with the coolness of a casual gastrobar — suitable for both casual luncheons and a nice dinner date. Prices make sense for its downtown location and the quality of the food.\xa0Service is also on point, with the wait staff taking several minutes to talk me through the menu upon being seated.The handmade pasta (from S$18) I ordered was excellent, as were the cold and hot tapas (from S$13). You might want to partake in one of its artisanal highballs or craft beers for an especially good time.One thing to note is that Ameising La Volta is strictly dine-in only — it does not allow takeaways so as not to compromise the freshness and quality of its food.From the hot tapas section, the unagi puffs (S$13 for three) are divine. I’ve only had unagi on rice, so this is a refreshing spin that’s worthy of the hype. Crispy puff pastry comes delicate and golden, each encasing a generous slice of unagi, or Japanese eel slathered in a sweet and salty tare sauce.\xa0The warm pastry is baked light and flaky, pairing perfectly with the medium-soft bite of the unagi. There’s a sprinkle of aonori, or dried seaweed, to amp up the umami and add a distinct “ocean aroma”. It’s a real steal for the price.I ordered the avocado ramen egg salad (S$13) from the cold section, and the first thing that came to mind when it arrived was: “Where’s the avocado ramen?”. Turns out, the avocado was a slightly tangy mousse at the bottom of the plate and the “ramen” referred to ajitsuke tamago, popularly known as ramen egg.\xa0While avocado noodles would be a fascinating thing to try, this is still a seductive starter that’s again heavy on the umami, thanks to little heaps of ikura, cured parma ham, and avruga pescaviar — named as such because it is made from wild smoked herrings instead of sturgeon fish (the only fish used for making caviar).The soy-marinated medium-boiled egg and creamy avocado base make this an especially indulgent appetiser.The pasta menu is split into “Reinvented Classics”, which take their cue from more conventional pasta dishes, and “Creative Spins”, featuring more innovative Asian-inspired creations such as omu pasta, cheesy creamy butter chicken, and unagi “yaki soba”. While all of those sound delicious, I opted for the spicy black pepper crab (S$28) with fresh fettuccine (you can also choose from fresh linguine, maltagliati, pappardelle and gluten-free sweet potato noodles).\xa0While it isn’t possible for fresh pasta to achieve the same level of firmness (al dente) as its dried counterpart, some restaurants take theirs a bit too far and you end up with limp, almost mushy pasta. But chef Caleb, who makes the dough himself, does it beautifully.\xa0Each bite is springy, rich (I can only imagine how many egg yolks went into this) and spicy, soaking up flavours from the accompanying ingredients well.\xa0Like a good stir-fry, there is dried chilli, capsicum, onion, and a savoury-sweet black pepper sauce that’s addictive as heck. Throw in copious chunks of crab meat and you’ve got a winner of a dish.Ameising La Volta has a fantastic alcoholic repertoire, including fancy shochu and soju highballs made with things such as yuzu compote and frozen Sarawak pineapple.\xa0It also has a decent craft beer selection on tap and by the can (think brands such as Sydney’s One Drop Brewing and Melbourne’s Deeds Brewing Company).If I had something to gripe about, it’s the fact that the restaurant ran out of ice cream during my dinner there, despite my early visit around six in the evening.\xa0It doesn’t sound like a big deal, until you realise that the only two desserts at Ameising La Volta are ice cream-based: A melon ice cream wrapped in parma ham, and a double scoop of imported Japanese ice cream.\xa0A larger choice of desserts would solve that; after all, a meal at a good restaurant feels incomplete without a sweet treat to bring a sense of balance to an otherwise very memorable experience.Is it conducive to conversation? Yes, unless you visit during peak lunch hour.Is a reservation necessary? Good to have but not necessary.How to get there? Ameising La Volta is right in front of Exit B of Bencoolen MRT station.HungryGoWhere paid for its meal at this restaurant for this review. Still hungry?

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/51-tras/:['Step into any hawker centre worth its salt and you’ll find yourself a decent chee cheong fun, the ubiquitous rice noodle roll that’s steamed till translucent and silky-soft.\xa0I’ve snacked on hundreds of them in my lifetime — from the savoury Hong Kong-style served with soy sauce and a sprinkling of toasted sesame seeds, to the more common Singapore variety drenched in dark sweet sauce and, occasionally, a decadent shrimp sambal.\xa0I hardly consider myself a connoisseur, but I love the dish — so much that talk of an aburi (Japanese for “flame-seared”) version led me to Tanjong Pagar one weekend.\xa0Before I continue, I must emphasise this isn’t a chee cheong fun review — well, at least not completely. This is about 51 Tras, a new cafe wedged in the middle of Tras Street.\xa051 Tras is a unique concept that combines food offerings from three culinary artists: Pastry chefs Maxine Ngooi and Francis Wong, and Ben Yeo — you know, that Mediacorp celebrity who used to run Hawkerman and Tenderfresh?\xa0Ngooi, who co-owns the popular Joo Chiat patisserie Tigerlily, plays with Asian ingredients and splashes of Singapore flavours for the pastry menu. Wong, who used to head the now-defunct Non Entree Desserts, takes care of the dessert and cakes that he bases around the cafe’s Eclipse theme. Which leaves us with Yeo and his latest venture, SG Chee Cheong Fun.As far as industrial-inspired cafes go, 51 Tras is one of the more promising ones.\xa0It’s not a cafe in the way its neighbours Baristart and Nesuto are, where matcha lattes, cream puffs and dainty cakes take centre stage.\xa0Self-described as a creative space, the large room is filled with raw furnishings and a small tree, with grungy art and exposed concrete lining the walls. It’s an apt setting for an art gallery — or, in this case, a kitchen of food-loving collaborators inspiring one another to create food as art?Swing by for a midday treat of pastries and dessert, and stay for the drinks — from coffees and sodas topped with whipped cream to a curated booze menu. The vibes are fantastic.\xa0You can’t go wrong with the laksa quiche (S$8), part of a selection of four pastries that Ngooi brings over from Tigerlily Patisserie daily. The buttery pastry is packed with fragrant spicy coconut custard, like a laksa broth that’s been reduced and thickened. It’s a tad runny for a quiche, which she makes up for with extra-flaky pastry, and morsels of prawns and fishcake. The flavours and textures work brilliantly, and we’d have ordered more if they didn’t sell out so quickly.The muachee mochi blondie (S$8) is another tasty choice, stuffed with mochi and tucked in a crumbly layer of powdered peanuts. It has everything you love in a good muah chee — crunch, sweetness and chewiness — with the added fudginess and denseness of a blondie.Then there’s Ben Yeo with his aburi chee cheong fun (S$14.50).\xa0The thing about this classic dish is that you can’t fake it. It’s either on point, or your grandmother goes home. His version is slippery-smooth and comes torched with an underlying smokiness, luxing it up with onsen egg, crispy shallots and robust sambal chilli. But it’s the smoky sweet sauce that really gets us going. Granny would baulk at paying this much for chee cheong fun, but I’d do it anyway.Every table around us seemed to be enjoying (or taking photos of) Francis Wong’s Instagram-worthy creations, so really, who could resist?\xa0The Pacific Rim (S$9) comes as a small orange cake that opens to reveal mandarin yuzu mousse and milk chocolate curd. It tastes like a tarter version of the classic chocolate-and-orange pairing. There are also bits of coconut flakes for added crunch, which, as a coconut lover, I absolutely approve of.You could have an iced latte or mocha, but according to the staff, the einspanner (S$8.50 for black or S$9 for white) might be the ticket here. While this Viennese-style coffee is typically served hot, the ones here come iced, topped with cool whipped cream that’s been soda-charged to give it a fizzy mouthfeel. I ordered the black version to better taste the coffee — made with a Brazilian-Ethiopian bean blend from Cumolo Coffee in Chinatown — and relished the fruity notes and balanced acidity. It’s like a good espresso tonic, but creamier.The short drinks list also has beverages such as honey orange chocolate and orange cream soda, which I’ll be back to try. If you’re looking to imbibe, 51 Tras offers a few beers and ciders, as well as a particularly impressive collection of sake, shochu and umeshu (from S$16 a glass or S$98 a bottle).\xa0I’m more of a cocktail man, so I get the 03 Vodka (S$20), a feisty concoction of vodka, ripe mango juice, lime, Angostura bitters, and strangely… chilli padi. This is a tropical flavour bomb that’s sweet, sour, bitter, and spicy at the same time. While delicious, it was fairly low in alcohol strength.There are four other cocktails named after different alcoholic spirits – I reckon the 01 Gin (S$20), with Campari and two types of vermouth, could knock your socks off.\xa0Compared with Ngooi’s other pastries, the haebi hiam brioche feuillete and gula melaka coconut babka (both S$8) weren’t particularly memorable.\xa0The brioche feuillete — like a bready kouign-amann with a caramelised sugary top — didn’t quite appeal with its intense, savoury shrimp sambal flavour. I’d have enjoyed this more in a less buttery pastry.\xa0The babka was less fluffy and soft than I hoped and tasted closer to plain coconut bread. Perhaps some bits of gula melaka inside would make this more interesting.The Blood Moon (S$16.50), another round dessert by Wong with a planet-esque chocolate shell, juxtaposes milk chocolate hazelnut gelato with blood orange espuma foam. While I love the idea, I expected more espuma, which would have cut the richness of the gelato for a more refreshing experience.Is it conducive to conversation? Like in a lot of minimalist industrial-style spaces, it can get slightly echoey. The music is loud enough to be present but not overbearing.Is a reservation necessary? Walk-ins only! Avoid going for brunch for a higher chance of scoring a seat.\xa0How to get there? Make your way to Tras Street, a three-minute walk from Exit A of Tanjong Pagar MRT station.Things to note:\xa0\xa0HungryGoWhere paid for its meal at this eatery for this review.Book a ride to 51 Tras. 51 Tras Street\nOpen: Wednesday to Sunday (11am to 7pm)51 Tras Street\nOpen: Wednesday to Sunday (11am to 7pm)AuthorGary eats and knows things, which he attributes to over 30 years of eating and drinking — surely that must count for something, he surmises.

That translates to plenty of meticulous preparation and R&D, which sees the couple tenaciously trying to build their dream bowl of bak chor mee from the ground up.No. 25 Minced Meat Noodles will take to the festival grounds with a unique Singapore-style Mazesoba (S$12, +S$3 for ikura) — a SFF-exclusive dish.It’s an apt creation considering all the joking comparisons between the dry-style Japanese ramen and local minced meat noodles.If there’s a pastry that best represents Singapore’s dessert trends in recent years, it has to be the donut.

Even amid a sea of artisan patisserie-cafes in Singapore, Madu the Bakery is one that stands out with its deft marriage of local flavours with classic pastries.\xa0The bakery keeps its ideas simple and elegant and has converted many people with creations such as its cereal prawn croissant.Pastry lovers can look forward to a variety of new items that Madu the Bakery has specially created for the festival. These include black sesame croissants (S$9), muah chee roll cakes (S$10) and the weekend-exclusive chilli crab otah croissants (S$15).

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/mian-mian-bu-duan-peanut-pancake-hawker-hustlers/:['Hawker Hustlers is a HungryGoWhere series spotlighting young and emerging hawkers with compelling stories. Read through all the way for an exclusive GrabFood promo so you can try their food, too.If you think peanut min jiang kueh are just slabs of flour with peanut filling, think again, urges Li Jiali, founder of Mian Mian Bu Duan Peanut Pancake.If you were to sit and watch Li work at her stall at Bukit Merah, you might find that min jiang kueh (peanut pancake) making can be a pretty meditative experience — one in which she beats the pancake batter to the rhythm of her heart.After the dough mixture is laid out to rest for a while, she carefully ladles it onto a hot pan and spreads it evenly.\n\nWhen the batter puffs up and becomes dotted with holes, it means that the min jiang kueh is almost ready. These holes allow the peanut filling to flow through, such that the kueh and filling becomes inseparable. Take a bite into the min jiang kueh, and you’ll find it has a pudding-like, yet firm, texture — one that is delightfully velvety, moist and chewy.During our visit, we paired the pancakes with delicious soya bean drinks from a nearby stall.\n\n“The next time you lay hands on (a min jiang kueh), you can open the pancake. Sometimes, it looks like you’re staring down at the peaks of the most beautiful mountains,” says the 36-year-old. \n\nOne morning spent with Li has completely changed my perception of this ordinary dessert. It’s easier to see it for what it is — an artisanal craft that deserves more recognition.\xa0Beyond the usual classics, we got a chance to sample not just your usual cookie-cutter flavours, spanning the likes of peanut butter jelly, creamy coconut and peanut butter chocolate.\n\nLi, a former tax accountant, found her calling in the F&B industry. She was first a barista making specialty brews at Dutch Colony Coffee Co and now, she’s an entrepreneur selling min jiang kueh. Working with her hands helps her centre herself, says Li, who has bipolar disorder. Over the course of our conversation, we discover her struggles with the condition, the backstory of how she came to found the stall, and even fascinating nuggets of information about the min jiang kueh empire in Singapore. \n\nAmid the hustle and bustle of the world, she hopes to bring some joy to others with her pancakes. “We may not have everything we want in life, but you can always find satisfaction eating peanut pancakes,” she says. \n\nWho knew that eating min jiang kueh could be such a philosophical experience?Here’s a lightly edited excerpt of our interview:Before starting this business, I was a coffee barista at Dutch Colony Coffee Co. I was there for about two years. \n\nWhen I left the cafe, I wanted to do something for myself. I wanted to grow within the F&B industry. \n\nMy favourite childhood food is min jiang kueh. So I took a National Environment Agency course for a year. I was attached to Granny’s Pancake (for my apprenticeship). I knew the boss personally, too. For one year, I learnt how to beat the batter and the foundation of a pancake business. \n\nThe secret behind it? You have to follow your heart’s rhythm, try to relax as much as possible, chill, and take it easy. Just think about beating the flour. You must be calm.\xa0\nAfter that, I bid for this stall in 2021 and got it.I chose this location because it’s quite chill, not as busy as areas like the Central Business District, or other more popular neighbourhoods. This is a good place for me to start.\xa0\xa0The name Mian Mian Bu Duan means to continue a trade — to keep practising it.\n\nWhen I got (my own stall), I realised I didn’t actually know how to cook the pancakes! When I was apprenticing, it looked very easy, but I didn’t have much chance to cook then. \n\nWhen the opportunity came for me to do it myself, I realised there were a lot of things I didn’t know. I learnt everything by trial and error. The trick is temperature control. You need to make sure the pancake is not burnt, but at the same time it cannot be too soft. So it must be at the optimum heat. Then, it will come out nicely.\n\nOne second can make such a big difference. If you leave the kueh on the pan for one second longer or one second shorter, it can make or break the pancake.The peanut, red bean and coconut pancake. These are the three main classic flavours.\n\nI also offer peanut butter jelly — that’s our new flavour. We make the jelly from scratch, using New Zealand raspberries, strawberries and blueberries.\xa0Other innovative flavours include the creamy coconut and peanut butter chocolate, which is (made with) 55% cacao.When I first started, I also came up with my own flavours such as Fanta Orange and vegan cheese.\n\nOur top-selling item is the peanut butter pancake. A lot of the elderly go for the classic flavours.\xa0 \n\nToday, we made a vegan chilli crab pancake specially for the HungryGoWhere team.This is something that isn’t on the menu. It is the first time we are doing a savoury-and-spicy-flavoured pancake. The vegan chilli crab sauce is homemade and the crab meat is replaced by cauliflower florets.The pancakes are red in colour and presented in the form of a crab. The crab shape was inspired by my mentor, Billy Ng from Granny’s Pancake. He taught me how to rearrange the pancakes to look like a crab.\xa0We mostly source from local suppliers to get our ingredients and we make our pancakes fresh at the stall every day. Each pancake is handmade from scratch, right from the beating of flour by hand.\n\nWhat differentiates us from others is also the texture of the pancake. It’s fluffy, soft and not so cloying. Customers, especially the elderly, find it easy to chew.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Junction Westgate opening with promos; will house 23 tenants, including new halal teppanyaki\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHawker Hustlers: Hipster hawker Ray Yeo of Bei-Ing Dimsum Club on reinventing dim sum and his love for all things Japan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy parents initially thought I was crazy when I told them about the hawker idea. After that, they were supportive as they saw that I was serious about it.\xa0They also helped me sell my pancakes. When I was setting up the stall, my dad helped to drive me around to get supplies since he used to be a taxi driver.The hardest part about starting a new business is that you have no clue what you’re doing. It’s very stressful, as you don’t want it to fail.\xa0\n\nFor me, failure is when there are no customers eating my pancake, or if they think the pancake is not nice. When the pancakes are not up to my expectations or if the batter spoils, my mood tends to get affected for the whole day.\n\nBut you have to tell yourself to take it easy. After all, you’re just cooking pancakes for people to eat!After the first three to six months have passed, the business becomes stable; you have a proper flow and a better sense of things. You kind of know the market conditions, how many people are here, (and) how much to make every day.\xa0Now, I make 400 slices of pancake a day.One thing, though — you don’t get much personal time, so you don’t have a lot of time for friends.\xa0You also have to learn to trust your own instincts. Some people might give feedback. Your pancakes can be cooked for longer or tweaked here and there. But there’s this inner voice you have to listen to and trust yourself.\xa0The best part of my day is the beginning and the end. I arrive at the stall early in the morning. I take the first bus and reach here at about 6.30am.There’s not many people around, so I can do my work slowly. It’s quite therapeutic — baking the batter, pre-heating the pan.\n\nAnd then at the end, it is also very shiok (enjoyable). Because if you manage (to get) through the day, you’ll feel like you have done the work with your own hands.You’ve done what you can, and you’ve earned the money with your own sweat and tears. There’s a sense of accomplishment. These days, I’ve taken a step back, and Jess, my girlfriend and business partner, is still learning how to cook the pancakes. She’s figuring out what works and what doesn’t.We came up with a lot of the new flavours together. We complement each other and we bounce off ideas well.Granny’s Pancake is one of the leading min jiang kueh chains in Singapore, with more than 10 outlets islandwide. They started off as family business and sell pancakes with traditional flavours. \n\nThese days, there are quite a few new min jiang kueh entrants, with some selling innovative flavours such as charcoal, matcha, sesame, even Thai milk tea.\n\nFor us, we believe in baby steps. Slow but steady.\nI was diagnosed with bipolar disorder more than five years ago. It took a long time for doctors to figure out my diagnosis, as I was depressed and felt anxious.\n\nI’ve been on medication for the last five years, and it helps me stabilise my mood. However, with the medication, it can be quite challenging for me to wake up in the morning as it affects my energy levels. I move a little slower.It doesn’t help (that I’m) in the hawker trade, which is very physically demanding. You have to bear through it.\n\nThankfully, Jess came into the picture and it was like a punch in my perspective. She inspired me to do better. Baking helps me, too. It’s very therapeutic.\n\nThese days, mental health issues are becoming more common. I want to speak out because I want to raise more awareness about this. Some people may not be diagnosed and they may be going through a hard time. \n\nDiagnosed or not, mental illness or not, you should never judge a book by its cover. I am learning that it does not break a limb to be extra nice and kind. If I am able to help, I will help.\nIn my opinion, desserts do not need to be a guilty pleasure and min jiang kueh can be a breakfast staple.\xa0We are hoping to modify our current recipe to make it healthier. If I come up with my own recipe, I can make it according to my own preferences.\n\nAlso, we are exploring tweaking our classic flavours. I think we want to go back to the basics.I’m also itching to do sling coffees, the traditional kind. I love making coffee. Once this (stall) is stabilised, I’m thinking of finding another stall.Good news for our readers who scrolled all the way to the end!

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/the-bank-singapore/:['If you’re a burger connoisseur, there’s no doubt you’d be familiar with the legendary Burger Joint in New York City — a hip, clandestine operation known for its decadent New York-style burgers.But did you know that Burger Joint had an outpost in Singapore? It was franchised locally and was operating out of an alleyway behind Amoy Street.After leaving the franchise in 2019, the burger joint then became known as Burger Bar New York, until it closed in late 2022 after six-and-a-half years.\xa0But great things come to those who wait.\xa0Good news for the forlorn fans who were wistfully awaiting the return of their favourite burger bar in Singapore: Its former general manager, as well as members of the old team, are back and raring to go at their own new restaurant, The Bank.Located on Craig Road, The Bank restaurant can be found behind an unassuming door that’s masquerading as an ATM. Sadly, the machine can’t actually be used for withdrawals, in case you run out of spare cash.Behind the “ATM” is a fun-filled retro shindig, brought to life with striking, darkened teal walls, a glitzy disco ball and an assortment of vintage film posters.\xa0If you’re an old soul that understands the allure of the 1980s, you’ll feel right at home with The Bank’s retro American diner getup and vibrant colours.The founding team had a speakeasy concept in mind, too. But the choice of entrance — an ATM facade — was almost entirely random. It was partly born of a desire to buck the trend of hidden bars behind vending machines or fridges, and a surprisingly thematic one due to The Bank’s name.Besides juicy burgers, the bar also plays host to a collection of 12 craft beers on tap, making it a similarly great watering-hole addition to a swanky area that’s usually saturated with cocktail bars instead.Of course, the focus is still on the stars — its signature New York-style cheeseburgers.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50% off at picturesque date spots, including Wildseed Cafe at The Alkaff Mansion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat that means is a succulent 100% angus prime beef patty, hand-butchered and pressed, adorned with a melted layer of American cheese, and finished with “the works” (lettuce, onions, tomatoes and housemade sauce).The Bank serves only one type of beef burger, which can be ordered as either a Single (S$18.80) or Double (S$26.80).But if you enjoy indulging in crunchy textures, you can go for the chicken burger (fried buttermilk chicken, melted American cheese; S$18 for single, S$26 for double).It even comes with a choice of special toppings: Spicy coleslaw, or bacon and herb aioli.The Bank’s menu also features a portobello burger (grilled portobello mushroom, melted American cheese; S$18 for single, S$26 for double) — in case you’re cutting down on meat but still want a juicy burger.As with most classic American burger joints in Singapore, The Bank also churns out some creamy milkshakes for you to pair with your toothsome buns.Basic flavours (S$12.50) include chocolate, vanilla, strawberry and Oreo, but you can top up S$2 for a more decadent Reese’s peanut butter flavour or get a boozy Baileys milkshake for S$17.For more ideas on what to eat, read our stories on other popular food haunts in the Outram Park area and the hottest new openings in Singapore.The Bank is on the GrabFood delivery service and offers free delivery (up to S$3 off) with GrabUnlimited.

More brands are expected to make an appearance in the future.\xa0The brand also recently launched a Jamba pop-up at Resort Worlds’ Sentosa.\xa0We spotted familiar flavours from its US menu like Mango-a-go-go (from S$7.90 for a small cup), which has a passion fruit mango juice blend, pineapple sherbet and fresh mangoes, and Strawberry Wild with apple strawberry juice, vanilla yoghurt, strawberries and bananas.\xa0Its ginormous chunky strawberry energy bowl (S$13.90) is also available at Jamba’s T1 store in Singapore and comes with soy milk, strawberries, banana, greek yoghurt, granola, and peanut butter.The bowl is massive and we’re sure it’ll make for a super filling lunch or a great dessert to share among friends for those meal-afters.\xa0For those who prefer less fruity flavours there’s a nutty almond butter bowl (S$13.90), and Chocolate Moo’d (vanilla yoghurt, milk and chocolate powder, S$7.90 for a small cup).\xa0For now, the Jamba Singapore menu is a lot smaller than what you might get at the original Jamba stores in the US.But be patient: We hear there might be new types of drinks rolled out in the near future, such as coconut-based refreshers.Regardless, we’re sure Jamba Singapore’s current slew of icy-cold blended smoothies will still be a much-needed reprieve in our erratic heat!\xa0For more refreshing treats, check out the latest Blackpink and Starbucks merchandise collaboration or visit these hidden bars in Singapore.\xa0Book a ride to Jamba Singapore’s T1 outlet now.\xa0Changi Airport Terminal 1, 02–05, 80 Airport Boulevard\nNearest MRT station: Changi Airport\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (10am to 10pm)Changi Airport Terminal 1, 02–05, 80 Airport Boulevard\nNearest MRT station: Changi Airport\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (10am to 10pm)AuthorSarah is constantly seeking out new coffee spots and cocktail bars around the world, and should probably drink more water while at it.© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/poke-theory-telok-ayer/:['Looking for a healthy lunch spot in the CBD? You’re in luck because the popular Poke Theory has opened a new outlet at Telok Ayer!Homegrown franchise Poke Theory is one of Singapore’s most well-known spots for poke bowls, which are — in case you didn’t know — wholesome salad bowls packed full of sashimi and fresh veggies.This new opening sees the brand returning to its roots, with an outpost in the same neighbourhood that housed its first outlet in 2016.The store will be officially opening on July 17.If you’re wondering where it’ll be located, Poke Theory’s newest Telok Ayer cafe takes over the vacant shophouse unit previously occupied by Park Bench Deli, which closed in March 2023.Poke Theory retains the sleek concave wooden facade used by its predecessor but changes things up with a fresh colour palette, along with incorporating the brand’s signature poke counter into the 104-seater space.The launch of the new store will be accompanied by a menu revamp, based on months of development and feedback.Post-refresh, Poke Theory’s menu includes a myriad of new options for customers to indulge in.This includes signature bowls curated by the Poke Theory’s owners themselves — these are available only in the regular size. In particular, there are two new ones on the menu.One is a gym-diet-appropriate Samsui Chica (cajun sweet potato, lime avocado and egg whites, S$11.90) that features flavourful Samsui ginger chicken.\xa0The other is the sweet and tangy Tempeh-tress (pomegranate, pickled green chillies and smoked almonds, S$11.90) that’s crafted around the umami tempeh — an all-new addition to the menu.Other than the signature bowls, diners can also design their own meals. A build-your-own poke bowl starts from S$9.90 depending on the size, poke protein of choice and the number of toppings. Two sizes are available: Regular and light.For example, building a regular bowl with salmon and seven toppings would set you back S$14.90. \n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50% off at picturesque date spots, including Wildseed Cafe at The Alkaff Mansion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are a total of 18 toppings for you to mix and match to your heart’s content — 13 of which are basic toppings, such as corn salsa and pickled green chillies, while the other five are premium toppings such as ikura.Diners are also given access to the Poke Theory sauce bar, which is chock full of complimentary condiments and free-flow sauces for customers looking to spruce up their bowls even further.To celebrate the opening of the Telok Ayer outlet, Poke Theory will be extending a bunch of opening-day special deals on July 17.The first 50 customers will be treated to one free poke bowl, on the house, while the rest can enjoy a scrumptious one-for-one promo on all poke bowls!Not only that: There will also be a limited-time-only opening promotion bundle (from S$31.40) which comes with one of the two limited-edition Poke Theory plushies.The bundle consists of a signature poke bowl, snack pack and a Sodaly canned soft drink.But the highlight has to be the adorable plushies, quirkily named ‘Sasha’ and ‘Tina’, as a nod towards its customers’ love for salmon and tuna.For more ideas on what to eat, read our stories on 10 unique dishes to try at the upcoming Singapore Food Festival and another cool new opening at Telok Ayer.Poke Theory is the GrabFood delivery service and offers free delivery (up to S$3 off) with GrabUnlimited.\xa0They can be found on GrabFood Dine-in.You can also book a ride to Poke Theory’s new Telok Ayer store. 179 Telok Ayer Street\nNearest MRT station: Telok Ayer\nOpen: Monday to Friday (11am to 8pm), Saturday (11am to 3pm)179 Telok Ayer Street\nNearest MRT station: Telok Ayer\nOpen: Monday to Friday (11am to 8pm), Saturday (11am to 3pm)AuthorEvan started off writing about food on Instagram, before joining outlets such as Buro and Confirm Good to pursue his passion.

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/myanmar-food-singapore/:['Singapore is a melting pot of different cultures and cuisines, so it’s no wonder it is a country known for having a bustling, top-quality food scene. But while we’ve had our fair share of Japanese, Korean and Italian delicacies, most of us have never tried Myanmar food in Singapore.\xa0If you’re someone who hasn’t encountered Burmese food in Singapore, we recommend that you refer to our guide. We’ve compiled a list of eateries serving authentic Myanmar fare that’s both delicious and affordable. Each bite also offers Burmese locals a nostalgic taste of home.\xa0You snooze, you lose, so be sure to check out these places for Myanmar food in Singapore before they get even more crowded.Peninsula Plaza, B1-07A/B, 111 North Bridge Road\nOpen: Monday to Saturday (11am to 9pm), Sunday (10am to 8.30pm)Why visit? When searching for the best Myanmar restaurant in Singapore, Inle Myanmar is number one on our list. Located at the basement level of Peninsula Plaza, this no-frills joint checks all the right boxes for us, thanks to its hearty food that offers a bang for our buck.\xa0The dishes here are aplenty – they remind us of our local zi char-style offerings, so expect an extensive menu outlining sharing platters, mains, sides, and more.\xa0Feel free to take your pick from anything that catches your fancy, for it’s likely you won’t go wrong either way — the folks at Inle Myanmar Restaurant are reputed to serve authentic Burmese delicacies that consistently pack a flavourful punch.\xa0Price range: $Crowd favourites: Start your meal right with the crispy tofu fritters (S$7.50) that are deep-fried to a perfect golden brown. The mohinga (S$8.50) is another must-order item, as it’s considered a national Myanmar dish. It’s a delightful rice noodle dish cooked in fish broth, accompanied by ingredients such as fish cake and a hard-boiled egg. 328 Clementi Avenue 2, 01-220\nOpen: Tuesday to Saturday (9am to 8.30pm), Sunday (9am to 7.30pm)\xa0Why visit? A quick search online for the eatery with the best Burmese food in Singapore and Little Myanmar Halal Foods will undoubtedly pop up. We’ve been told that Burmese locals have no qualms making a beeline to the establishment when they’re looking for Myanmar food in Clementi, and we wholeheartedly agree. Not only is the stall halal-certified, its dishes are all affordably priced — a rare sight amid this inflated economy.Founded by a Mandalay native, owner Kyaw Kyaw Lin had merely one purpose: To dish up tasty, traditional Burmese fare that offers comfort and solace to homesick Burmese expats. It’s a goal that he has certainly achieved, as the eatery sees a steady stream of customers daily, spanning from foreigners to Singaporeans alike.Price range: $Crowd favourites: Try the Shan noodles (S$6), a rice noodle dish topped with chicken cooked in tomato sauce and a generous sprinkling of roasted sesame seeds.\xa0The Myanmar coconut laksa (S$6) is another top choice — it comes with yellow noodles bathed in rich coconut gravy, chickpea crackers and garnishes.Kimly Coffeeshop, 01-155, 325 Clementi Avenue 5\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (9.30am to 9pm)Why visit? Another undiscovered Clementi Myanmar food gem is Shwe Kant Kaw Myanmar Cuisine. At first glance, this unassuming stall is easy to overlook, especially since the signboard bears no prices. You’d have to ask the owner how much the dishes cost, but fret not, the dishes are reasonably priced!\xa0This stall also reminds us of a cai png (economic rice) stall, with an assortment of authentic Burmese classics proudly on display. There are various meats and vegetables to choose from that pair well with rice.\xa0However, for diners trying Burmese food in Singapore for the first time, do get recommendations from the stall owner. Founded in 2008 by Win Win Nwe, the eatery has garnered quite a reputation for itself over the years, and there are certain favourites that she’d suggest gravitating towards.\xa0Price range: $Crowd favourite: Besides its very hearty and authentic mohinga (S$5), the tea leaves salad (S$5) — a colourful dish made up of cabbage slices, dried shrimp, preserved tea leaves, fresh tomato slices, roasted peanuts and more — is worth a try. Toss everything together for a multi-dimensional and multi-textured mouthfeel.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Junction Westgate opening with promos; will house 23 tenants, including new halal teppanyaki\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHawker Hustlers: Hipster hawker Ray Yeo of Bei-Ing Dimsum Club on reinventing dim sum and his love for all things Japan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeninsula Plaza, B1-01, 111 North Bridge Road\nOpen: Monday to Friday (11am to 10pm), Saturday (10am to 10pm) and Sunday (9am to 10pm)Why visit? This restaurant is where we’d go for traditional Burmese food in Singapore. Nestled in the basement of Peninsula Plaza, Mandalay Style Restaurant is an establishment that never fails to draw long queues. Beyond boasting wallet-friendly prices, the menu is also extensive with a myriad of dishes that are unique to Burmese cuisine.Set foot into the eatery, and the place reveals an expansive dining hall. The joint is mostly crowded with regular Burmese locals during lunch hours — albeit with the occasional Singaporean keen to expand their culinary horizons.\xa0Price range: $Crowd favourites: The chicken leg soup with suon tang (S$7.50) sees chopped chicken feet simmered in a tangy, savoury broth. The deep-fried Myanmar tofu (S$7) is another item that caught our eye. Made with chickpea flour, the dish is fried to a crisp perfection. It also comes with a spicy sauce for a refreshing burst of flavour. Peninsula Plaza, B1-07, North Bridge Road\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (9am to 9pm)Why visit? Helmed by a native Burmese couple, Yanant Thit Restaurant was kickstarted due to a passion to share the delectable flavours of Burmese food in Singapore. It’s yet another gem in Peninsula Plaza that prides itself on serving cai png-style dishes to customers.\xa0Take your pick from the plethora of proteins, vegetables and side dishes available on display. Most tend to go for a serving of rice, meat and salad, accompanied by a bowl of soup. You’ll have to point to the items that you want, though, as the owners don’t speak English nor Mandarin.What we like best about Yanant Thit Restaurant is that the folks here aren’t stingy with the portions. They’re known to heap a generous dollop of food onto your plate. So, go hungry, go all out and order as many mouthwatering dishes as your heart desires!\xa0Price range: $Crowd favourite: If you’ve never tried fried catfish before, perhaps this is the time to do so. It has crisp, slightly-charred skin that is full of smoked flavour. Accompanied by chilli sauce, you get a savoury profile that is elevated by the tangy spice. 5 Soon Lee Street\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (11am to 10pm)90 Boon Lay Place\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (10am to 9pm)Why visit? Not much has been said about this eatery, but Kay-Tu Myanmar Cuisine is another great place for Burmese food in Singapore. Boasting two outlets that are situated in the western part of Singapore, it’s best known for its assorted pig organs (S$10). Workers in the area would flock to its stalls just to have a taste of authentic Myanmar food.\xa0There are also other signature Burmese delicacies to be had, such as nangyi thoke (S$6) — also known as a thick rice noodle salad — and pig head salad (S$7). Alternatively, if you prefer to have your choice of proteins and vegetables alongside rice, Kay-Tu Myanmar Cuisine also serves yummy cai png-style dishes.\xa0Price range: $Crowd favourite: If you’re in the area on a weekend, the Myanmar chicken briyani (S$7) is a bestselling item at the Boon Lay outlet. It’s only sold on Sundays, and is worth the trip to the west. It comes with a fluffy bed of basmati rice, tender chicken thigh and a sprinkle of spices.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/elijah-pies/:['It can be quite challenging to satisfy a pie craving in Singapore. Artisanal pie specialists aren’t as easily found here, unlike gelato, pastries or cakes.But if you’re on the hunt for some delicious pies in Singapore, you can’t go wrong with online bakery Elijah Pies, known for its imaginative and ’gram-worthy bakes.The brand, which was founded in 2014, has a rather sweet beginning. To satiate a craving his girlfriend had, owner Elijah Tan painstakingly experimented with various recipes to create the perfect Nutella pie for her.It goes to show the stomach really is the fastest way to a person’s heart! The pie was so good that Elijah was inspired to create more pies with familiar flavours. He joined hands with his girlfriend, Limin, and Elijah Pies was born.Since then, Elijah Pies has grown into one of the most-talked-about pie brands on Instagram.For the past eight years, it has been operating out of a central kitchen at King George’s Avenue, which also functions as a takeaway spot. This year, the couple decided to set up their first dine-in cafe in the heart of the CBD, at Tanjong Pagar.Elijah Pies’ quaint cafe, located by the main road at Tanjong Pagar Plaza, is set up quite unlike any other cafe in Singapore. The owners’ intention is to make the space so warm that you’d feel like you’re stepping into someone’s home.The gorgeous minimalist interior looks like it came straight out of the pages of Kinfolk. Furnished with chic wooden accents, handcrafted marble furniture, plush sofa seats and a striking vapour “fireplace”, it exudes a cosy and peaceful atmosphere that will make you not want to leave.It’s especially inviting thanks to some quirky finishing touches from local artisans, including botanical arrangements by This Humid House and intricately illustrated menus by The Wild Abandon.Svelte Japandi minimalist aesthetics aside, Elijah Pie’s signature crusty offerings also live up to their reputation.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTalad Thai Banana opens at AMK Hub with S$2 opening promotion for the first 100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first we tried was, of course, the iconic Nutella pie (S$7.50 per slice) that started it all. It’s nothing complicated, just unadulterated chocolatey indulgence. Chocolate lovers will enjoy the luxuriously smooth and rich filling that’s complemented by its crunchy base.Another standout at Elijah Pies is the photogenic wild berry lavender pie (S$7.90 per slice) that’s picture-perfect with elegant lavender swirls.This pie was a refreshing offering that featured a mix of berries and fresh yoghurt. Its profile was slightly tart and fruity, jazzed up with the faintest perfume of lavender.If you’re looking for something heftier than its sweet offerings, Elijah Pies’ menu also features a slew of savoury pies. Try the new mac n’ cheese pie (S$12.90 for a four-inch pie) that is baked a la minute to ensure you’re greeted with a gloriously warm and melty cheese tart.If you’re a mac n’ cheese fan, you’d enjoy the creamy filling and how the cheese’s richness is complemented by a sprinkling of chives and onion crumble for added texture and a punchy flavour.Other than pies, Elijah Pies’ sit-down cafe also has a new range of original drinks.\xa0Besides the usual basic coffee and tea, there are creations such as the fragrant and nutty vanilla latte (S$8.90 for iced) and a well-balanced matcha strawberry (S$7.90 for iced).With tasty treats, thirst-quenching drinks and relaxing vibes, we think we’ve found our new favourite spot for a coffee break in Tanjong Pagar.\xa0\xa0A post shared by HungryGoWhere (@hungrygowhere)This was a hosted tasting.Elijah Pies is on the GrabFood delivery service and offers free delivery (up to S$3 off) with GrabUnlimited.

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/hidden-bars-singapore/:['Singapore is one of the most renowned cities in the world when it comes to its thriving bar scene. Case in point: 11 Singapore bars made it to the most recent Asia’s 50 Best Bars list. That said, there’s a new type of bar that has started thriving in this country: speakeasy-style hidden bars in Singapore.\xa0After all, there’s just something thrilling about searching for a spot that’s a tad hard to find. The anticipation during your search, that delight when you discover a whole new world behind a nondescript entrance — all of this just adds to its allure. Yes, venturing off the beaten path is infinitely more rewarding.\xa0Traditionally, speakeasy bars referred to top-secret bars in America that existed during the Prohibition era when alcohol was illegal, and they usually operated under the guise of a conventional business.In recent times, the term is used more loosely to refer to secretive, dimly lit establishments that are so hidden, they’d require some careful detective work. Many are pretty much unidentifiable — unless you’ve received prior information.\xa0Don’t worry, we’ve done the legwork for you. From clandestine speakeasy bars that are best-kept-secrets among the #iykyk crowd, to IG-worthy hidden bars in Singapore behind unexpected scenes such as traditional Chinese medicine halls, we’ve rounded them up so you don’t have to hunt them down (too hard).\xa038 Prinsep Street\nOpen: Sunday to Thursday (4pm to 10.30pm), Friday and Saturday (4pm to 12am)Why visit? Mama Diam caught everyone’s attention when it first opened, thanks to its iconic neighbourhood mama shop storefront. Resembling a scene straight out of the 80s and 90s (complete with beloved childhood snacks and toys on display!), it simply evokes nostalgia for every Singaporean.Owner Sebastian Ang created the concept to pay homage to the heritage of the mama shop, but with a modern twist to appeal to the younger folks. With Asian-influenced dishes and locally influenced cocktails, this Prinsep Street bar will charm everyone with its quirky offerings of tipples and bites.Price range: $$Crowd favourites: It’s all about weaving those familiar flavours into innovative new creations at Mama Diam. Expect creative concoctions such as the chicken curry kueh pie tee with coconut foam (S$18) and emperor herbal chicken poached rice (S$20).The drinks menu at Mama Diam is equally fascinating, ranging from the OG kopi (S$22) to the herbaceous liang teh (S$20).\xa0One Raffles Place Mall, 01-03, 1 Raffles Place\nOpen: Saturday, Monday to Wednesday (5pm to 12am), Thursday and Friday (5pm to 1am)Why visit? Most people wouldn’t suspect that something’s amiss when they spot a fancy tailor shop at Raffles Place. However, Taylor Adam is no ordinary bespoke tailor.You guessed it: There’s a bar hidden behind its elegant storefront. It’s quite an adventure to enter the establishment. First, staff there will ask if you are scheduled for a fitting today. Answer yes, and they will pull open a fitting room to reveal a classy bar within that gives off Kingsman vibes.It’s like going on a mission to uncover a secret lair, except your prize is a menu full of intricately concocted cocktails.Price range: $$$Crowd favourites: You’re not short of intriguing options here — the bar’s latest menu features a myriad of drinks inspired by different countries throughout Asia, ranging from the makgeoli-focused A Farmer’s Bliss (S$25) to the wabi-sabi (S$25) that uses an unorthodox component in wasabi.\xa011 Neil Road\nOpen: Tuesday to Saturday (4pm to 12am)Why visit? The Store is a bar that’s hidden in plain sight. You’d hardly know it’s there, if not for a nondescript blue wooden door nestled against a grey wall and its unassuming name in small letters located right next to it. There’s an easel beside the door, but it’s not particularly conspicuous unless you stop to read it.A stone’s throw away from the new Maxwell MRT station, the cryptically plain facade belies an intimate hidden bar that serves up experimental cocktails. While it started off as a well-kept secret among regulars, it has now earned itself a sizeable following, thanks to its affordable happy hour deals of S$11 per craft cocktail.\xa0Price range: $$Crowd favourites: Don’t. Miss. Out. On. Happy. Hour. S$11 for a taste of the viral negroni sbagliato or a criminally smooth ginger gimlet? You’re not getting better deals anywhere else.\xa0If you decide to stay past 6pm, when the restaurant-bar’s two-hour-long happy hour ends, you can also delve into its main menu that contains original inventions such as the Tito’s Twisties sour (Tito’s vodka infused with Twisties, lemon, syrup and saline, S$25). The seafood options in its food menu are worth a shot, too.\xa0\xa028 Hongkong Street\nOpen: Sunday to Wednesday (6pm to 1am), Thursday to Saturday (6pm to 2am)Why visit? If we were to trace Singapore’s burgeoning speakeasy bar trend back to one source, 28 HongKong Street will no doubt be a top candidate to stake its claim as the godfather of Singapore speakeasies.The legendary bar has been in operation since 2011 and continues to draw crowds on weekends. It’s located within a nondescript shophouse that doesn’t give much away, with the party clandestinely contained behind the vintage doors that always stay shut.But its newly minted status at number 24 in this year’s Asia 50 Best Bars list says enough about the great time you’d be in for.Price range: $$$Crowd favourites: It’s hard to single out popular drinks, for this legendary speakeasy bar has a new menu that’s a rather creative one. Tipples are segmented into four stylistic categories: Modern speciality cocktails, fancy hotel bar libations, no-frills dive bar booze and iconic night club classics.But if you’re looking for some decadent bar bites to go with your drinks, don’t miss out on the addictive mac and cheese balls (S$19).\xa019 Cecil Street, level 2\nOpen: Monday to Thursday (5pm to 12am), Friday and Saturday (5pm to 2am)Why visit? Sugarhall is an iconic name in the bar scene, having originally operated out of Amoy Street, beside its sibling concept Jigger & Pony, Singapore’s top bar and number two on the Asia’s 50 Best Bars list.Sugarhall shuttered in 2018 when Jigger & Pony moved out of the location to make a new home at Amara Hotel. But as they say, good things come to those who wait — Sugarhall returned in 2022, much to the delight of its old fans.\xa0This time, the rum-focused pub-themed concept is hidden away on the second floor of sister brand Rosemead, only accessible through a surreptitiously marked staircase at the side of the heritage building.Price range: $$$Crowd favourites: As the bar prides itself on its selection of rum, there’s no doubt that the signature Dark & Stormy (XO rum, dark sugar lime and ginger beer, S$23) is a must-order.\xa0Besides that, Sugarhall has also rolled out a fun new “Not Too Sweet” menu that consists of several locally infused drinks, such as the BBT-inspired boba razzi (S$24) and short & stout (S$25) that takes its cues from the childhood-favourite root beer float.\xa02 Circular Road\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (11am to 3pm, 5pm to 10.30pm)Why visit? The Dragon Chamber is probably one of the worst kept secrets of Boat Quay. At this point, most foodies in Singapore are already aware of this secret hidden bar and restaurant in Singapore, behind the beer fridge at its deceptive old-school coffee shop facade.Once you step into the hidden chamber, you’ll be greeted with a mix of modish retro touches and edgy street-style. The food here is as off-kilter as the decor suggests — traditional Chinese flavours are unconventionally reimagined and you can even indulge in a taste of the lesser-seen American-Chinese dishes.\xa0Price range: $$$Crowd favourites: The familiar fusion twists are the bread and butter of Dragon Chamber, with dishes such as wagyu truffle beef hor fun (S$32) earning them rave reviews.But if you’re an adventurous foodie, you wouldn’t want to miss out on rare options — that are not for the faint-hearted — such as the dragon claw (braised crocodile foot, S$66) and d*** soup (chicken and pork-based herbal soup that’s double boiled for six hours with crocodile penis, S$30).\xa0\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50% off at picturesque date spots, including Wildseed Cafe at The Alkaff Mansion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHawker Hustlers: Hipster hawker Ray Yeo of Bei-Ing Dimsum Club on reinventing dim sum and his love for all things Japan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xa0Fortune Centre, 02-07, 190 Middle Road\nOpen: Monday to Friday (11.30am to 2.30pm, 5pm to 11pm), Saturday (5pm to 11pm), Sunday (5pm to 10am)Why visit? Most people would have been made aware of Ume San 100 when it first blew up on social media a few months back. This Fortune Centre hidden bar has one big selling point — it’s cleverly hidden behind a row of “vending machines” that look like they belong in the streets of Japan.Besides the Instagram-worthy facade, this viral hidden bar in Singapore also has a unique specialisation as the only bar in Singapore that focuses on Umeshu (Japanese plum wine).Price range: $$Crowd favourites: This viral hidden bar offers a diverse array of bar bites. Some crowd favourites include the addictive garlic chicken karaage (S$16) and The Uni is the Bomb! (S$14 for two pieces) — a croquette that splits open to release a deluge of creamy uni-flavoured filling.\xa040B Sago Street\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (6pm to 12am)Why visit? Sago House has been all the rage in the Singapore bar scene since it first opened in 2020, especially due to its idiosyncratic trait of changing up its menu every single week.It enjoyed the meteoric rise in global stature and has constantly represented Singapore on the Asia’s 50 Best Bars list, coming in at No 10 this year. In many ways, it’s the perfect embodiment of a speakeasy-style bar.\xa0Furtively situated on the top floor of a Chinatown shophouse, this hidden bar is only accessible when you head through an inconspicuous door and wind your way up three flights of dingy stairs. Many passers-by wouldn’t even realise they’d just walked past it.Price range: $$Crowd favourites: Sago House has no menu. Well, it does, but it changes up every week and that’s part of the fun. Just check Instagram for the week’s poison.From S$20 per drink, you can get everything from wacky Thai-milk-tea-inspired cocktails to hard-hitting negronis. You could even request for a bespoke drink! Let the talented bartenders there surprise you — they rarely disappoint.\xa075 Duxton Road\nOpen: Monday to Saturday (5pm to 12am)Why visit? Cat Bite Club is the newest kid on the block in the Singapore cocktail bar scene but it’s already one to watch. After all, it’s the latest venture of Jess Vida, formerly the head bartender at Atlas, which took the 27th spot on this year’s Asia’s 50 Best Bars list.\xa0This secret bar in Singapore specialises in agave spirits — referring to tequila and mezcal — and operates out of a curtain-obscured section at the back of Duxton’s Monument Coffee. This unpretentious hole-in-the-wall (look out for a neon-lit grinning Cheshire cat) is a place made for those seeking a fun, clandestine hideout.Price range: $$$Crowd favourites: Having just launched in June, the jury is still out on this bar’s signatures. But if what social media fans say is true, its take on the punchy classic of Vieux Carre (rye whiskey, cognac, sweet vermouth, benedictine and bitters, S$28) is one of the best in town.\xa046 Craig Road\nOpen: Monday to Thursday (11.30am to 11pm), Friday and Saturday (11.30am to 11.59pm), Sunday (11.30am to 8pm)Why visit? Those familiar with the now-defunct Burger Bar New York at Gemmill Lane would be thrilled to hear of this new burger bar — it’s run by a team made up of the brand’s former general manager and several team members.The Bank is not a speakeasy bar or even well-hidden per se, since its facade is marked by a striking neon sign, but the front door tries its hardest to disguise itself as an ATM. The machine is not operational, though — so you’re out of luck if you’re in need of some spare cash.Price range: $$Crowd favourites: Burger lovers would want to sink their teeth into the signature New York-style burgers for themselves, due to the team’s affiliation with one of the most famous burger bar brands in the world.\xa0Using hand-butchered 100% prime Angus beef in the patties, a single signature cheeseburger goes for S$18.80 and a double goes for S$26.80. For drinks, there’s an assortment of specially curated craft beers on tap, which are kept on rotation to encourage return visits.\xa0115A East Coast Road\nOpen: Monday to Saturday (6pm to 12am)Why visit? Katong has no shortage of trendy or interesting restaurants, cafes and bars. Even then, Katong’s The Hidden Story is still probably one of the best hidden\xa0bars in Singapore.Located right above steak specialist Stirling Steakhouse, it’s only accessible through an entrance at the back of the restaurant — one that’s hidden behind its meat freezer door. Enter it, make your way up the stairs, and you’d find yourself in a swanky bar and lounge that draws inspiration from the rich Peranakan heritage of the neighbourhood. The highlight is its Onyx bar top that’s prominently wrapped with Peranakan tiles.Price range: $$$Crowd favourites: Paying homage to the culture-rich Katong area, The Hidden Story’s menu is packed with local inflections, with drinks such as Peranakan Enclave (S$22), a dry gin with rose and lychee notes that bring to mind the motifs of Peranakan ceramic tiles. Customers can also pick the bartenders’ brains by requesting for bespoke (S$25) beverages.\xa0115 Amoy Street, along Gemmill Lane, 01-03\nOpen: Tuesday to Saturday (5pm to 12am)Why visit? Underdog Inn is one of the more popular new bar openings in Singapore this year, given that it’s a new concept opened by the folks operating Sago House. Like Sago House, this is a bar that doesn’t take itself too seriously and is suited for the bon vivants looking to paint the town red.Its “hidden bar” speakeasy factor lies in its unique location at the less-travelled back alleys of Gemmill Lane, where Burger Bar New York once stood.Price range: $$$$Crowd favourites: Featuring an open-fire grill in the kitchen, Underdog Inn’s signatures are its smoky proteins, such as the smoked beef neck (S$40) served with kimchi. The hidden bar in Singapore also follows a “nose-to-tail” practice, which sees many unique off-cuts turned into dishes that go on its ever-changing specials menu. Don’t forget to try one of its experimental cocktails, too. The Only If You Want It (S$25) is a citrusy, tangy thirst quencher featuring blanco tequila and espadin.For more ideas on other interesting bars to explore, read our stories on the best rooftop bars in Singapore and the most affordable but vibey date spots.Or if you’re keen on more food options, read our latest articles on Orchard food places and Burmese restaurants in Singapore.The Bank is on the GrabFood delivery service and offers free delivery (up to S$3 off) with GrabUnlimited.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/two-men-bagel-house-joo-chiat-review/:['In a food-obsessed country like Singapore, there are plenty of local breakfast or brunch options. But anytime a bagel is mentioned, there’s one name that comes to mind right away — Two Men Bagel House.\xa0In April this year, Two Men Bagel House opened its fourth outlet in the hipster neighbourhood of the east, at Joo Chiat.The outlet, which observes the same hours as the rest of its other stores, has been given a facelift from its previous cafe tenant — it sports a striking marbled orange epoxy floor and chipboard walls.\xa0Complete with a neon sign, chain curtains, hand-drawn signs, framed artwork and Morissey over the speakers, the Two Men Bagel House Joo Chiat outlet evokes a certain nostalgia of diners of the past.Two Men Bagel House is an independent, Singapore-born eatery started almost a decade ago by Jereborne Lam and Jerome Lam. (And no, they aren’t brothers.)\xa0In addition to making its bagels daily, the Bagel House’s distinct branding inspired by hip-hop and skate culture as well as collaborations with like-minded people has earned them the cool kids badge.It has also earned that title, in part, to its genre-defying bagel-wiches — generously stuffed bagels with unexpectedly good sweet and savoury combinations that you won’t find anywhere else.Although it’s the newest member of the Two Men Bagel House family, this outlet in the east is not short on good vibes and flavour. There was a comfortable-sized crowd on our visit on a weekday afternoon, with a steady stream of customers. Some ordered bagels to go and some had theirs seated.\xa0The store has kept to the same format of classics and signatures (unique to the location), sides, and the option to either buy bagels on their own — such as the buah keluak bagel (S$5) that’s made only for Joo Chiat — or build your own bagel-wich.We appreciated that what you see is what you get, with no unscrupulous compromise on portion or taste. Two Men Bagel House is good at what it does, which is making the most interesting bagel-wiches you can find in the city. To check on consistency, we got one classic and one Joo Chiat signature to try.\xa0The personal best (S$17) is something regulars should be familiar with. It’s an upsized breakfast bagel-wich comprising spam, a sunny side up, hash brown, chunky peanut butter and spicy aioli. And to hold it all together, we opted for a sesame bagel. The peanut butter was the star of this combination, providing an added creaminess to saltiness of the spam and slight spiciness of the aioli. It got us wondering what other savoury foods peanut butter could be used in.\xa0Another staple on Two Men Bagel House Joo Chiat’s menu is the leek and potato soup (S$10) with chunks of leeks charred till soft, bits of in-house maple bacon, a soft boiled egg and a crispy hash brown on the side.With so many options to choose from, it’s easy to dismiss a side dish simply named ‘soup’ on the menu.\xa0But we’d definitely recommend this flavour-packed moreish bowl of warm thick soup that goes especially well with a freshly fried hash brown.\xa0We opted for the rammstein (S$22.50), a Joo Chiat signature on a plain bagel. For a bagel-wich that features a grilled lamb shoulder with ras el hanout (an Arabic spice blend of more than a dozen spices and aromatics commonly used in Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria), it was surprisingly refreshing.\xa0The tzatziki, fresh romaine lettuce, red onion, tomato and avocado helped balance out the saltiness of the meat and gave it a good crunch with each bite.\xa0Just the perfect drink to wash it down was the iced tea (S$5.50), a simple, slightly sweetened cup of black tea.\xa0While we’re hard pressed to find where the Two Men Bagel House’s well-oiled machine could improve on, there were a few teething problems to iron out.\xa0My dining partner ordered the iced chocolate (S$6.50), which initially tasted sour.\xa0Right after bringing it up to the barista, he promptly gave us a replacement with a dark chocolate mix after explaining that the chocolate from their new supplier tends to taste a little more sour than usual.\xa0\xa0Apologetic and smiley, it was great service recovery on his part. Is it conducive to conversation? It might be tough to get some personal space if it’s a full house, but otherwise, there’s sufficient room to find your own corner for quiet chats.Is a reservation necessary? Walk-ins only.How to get there? Get to Dakota MRT station, where you can take buses 16, 33, 10 or 32.Things to note:\xa0HungryGoWhere paid for its meal at this restaurant for this review.

The menu features unconventional options, such as s’mores (S$8.20 ala carte, S$14 combo), which boasts gooey melted marshmallows, and Kinder Bueno (S$7.20 ala carte, S$13 combo).\xa0Not only do you get to enjoy a refreshing sugar rush, but these sweet treats also offer bang for your buck. Take, for example, the signature combo set (S$12). It comprises a single scoop of ice cream on either plain charcoal (S$6.20 ala carte, S$12 combo) or loaded red velvet waffles (S$6.20 ala carte, S$12 combo). You can also pick your preferred syrup and a beverage to complete the combo.\xa0Price range: $$Crowd faves: The earl grey lavender (S$4.20 for a single scoop) ice cream and red velvet waffles\xa0are to die for. 35 Hamilton Road, 01-03\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (2pm to 2am)Why visit? If you’re searching high and low for a dessert joint that opens till late, look no further. Lola Faye Cafe is a Muslim-owned establishment that opens till 2am daily, boasting premium gelato, waffles and bakes. Situated near Bendemeer MRT, the cafe is easy to spot with its tropical-themed decor and pastel signage.\xa0The star item on its extensive menu is its gelato croissant (S$10). It comes with a scoop of decadent gelato within a buttery croissant, finished with whipped cream, sauce and toppings. Not only is it the perfect Instagrammable dessert, but it tastes excellent, too.\xa0Price range: $Crowd faves: You’ll fall head over heels for the gelato croissant. We suggest having it with Black Fantasy (S$5 for a single scoop), a beloved rendition of dark chocolate ice cream. 34 Haji Lane\nOpen: Monday to Thursday (1pm to 11pm), Friday and Saturday (12pm to 2am), Sunday (12pm to 11pm)Why visit? Momolato needs no further introduction. Tucked away in Haji Lane, it’s a halal-certified ice-cream shop that prides itself on botanical-inspired gelato. Expect nothing less than quality desserts here — the cafe’s gelato flavour of gula melaka caramel with sea salt, topped with crispy flakes of caramelised tofu skin, was crowned the Asia Pacific champion at the Singapore leg of Gelato World Tour Finals in 2015!\xa0It serves both regular and keto ice-cream flavours. The latter sees healthier flavours that are great for a low-carb diet, namely the Korean strawberry cheesecake swirl (S$7.40 for a single scoop) and chocolate coconut (S$7.40 for a single scoop). If you’re craving a hassle-free treat to grab and go, then don’t miss out on the popsicles (S$4.90 each).Price range: $$Crowd faves: The nama chocolate (S$7.40 for a single scoop) atop pandan waffles (S$6.90) is our go-to at Momolato. Thomson Garden Estate, 246F Upper Thomson Road\nOpen: Sunday to Thursday (12pm to 11pm), Friday and Saturday (12pm to 1am)Why visit? Salted Caramel is undoubtedly one of the top dessert shops to visit at Upper Thomson. The brand has multiple outlets across the island and is recognised for its artisanal ice cream.\xa0A signature flavour that we recommend is the salted caramel (S$3.90 for a single scoop), made with a sweet and salty blend of fleur de sel. Have it with crispy buttermilk waffles (S$5) or a waffle cone (S$1) for that extra crunch.Note that the cafe can get crowded over the weekends, so be prepared to queue for a seat.\xa0Price range: $Crowd faves: Regulars love the kaya toast (S$3.90 for a single scoop), pineapple tart (S$6.90 for a single scoop) and Gold Digger (S$6.90 for a single scoop).

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/dakga-korean-barbecue/:['Fans of Korean barbecue: Heads up!There’s a new kid on the Tanjong Pagar block — an all-new chicken-only joint named Dakga.Here, fresh chicken meat is the name of the game, all day, every day. (Dakga is by extension pork- and lard-free.)It’s not just the usual cuts of meat on the menu. Besides thigh (from S$27 for 400g), Dakga serves chicken gizzard (S$13 for 120g), heart (S$13 for 100g) and oysters (S$24 for six pieces).Chicken neck meat is also available here, until it sells out, that is. This cut is generally an uncommon one, especially in Singapore, and comes in two versions — one marinated (S$29/150g) and the other boneless (S$28/150g). The latter is painstakingly and carefully deboned by hand, too.As with any good Korean restaurant, there’s a range of banchan (side dishes) to nibble on while the meat sizzles on the grill. This includes slivers of tortilla to wrap your meats in, alongside housemade sauces and all the garlic you can desire.Besides barbecue, there’s a healthy range of other chicken-based dishes to choose from. \n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50% off at picturesque date spots, including Wildseed Cafe at The Alkaff Mansion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoodle lovers will gravitate towards the Dakga ramen (S$12), which comes with a rich chicken broth and a gooey onsen egg, or the Gye Bim Myun (S$14), a spicy, chilled noodle dish that comes dry — unlike the broth-laden Korean cold noodles that you may be familiar with.We liked the Old School Lunch Box (S$10).\xa0Here, chicken spam, kimchi, stir-fried anchovies and a sunny side up are placed in a rectangular metal lunch box, before being cut up and then thoroughly shaken. The result is a wonderfully mixed, orange-hued meal that melds sweet, sour and savoury in one bowl.You can also get your chimaek (fried chicken and beer) fix here, with Dakga’s curry fried chicken (S$22 for three pieces).In celebration of its opening, Dakga is offering a free plate of nachos and cheese fondue with a minimum spending of S$50.This was a hosted tasting.If you love Korean food, check out our series on the best authentic eateries in Singapore.

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/my-must-eats-audra-morrice/:['My Must-Eats is a HungryGoWhere series featuring Singapore’s public figures and their favourite food haunts. This week, chef Audra Morrice is in the limelight.If you love MasterChef and all things culinary, Audra Morrice is no stranger to you.She first burst onto our television screens as a finalist on MasterChef Australia in 2012, before appearing on subsequent editions of MasterChef Asia and MasterChef Singapore as a judge and host.Born and raised in Singapore, Audra has made a name for herself internationally for her fusion Asian flavours, some of which draw on her Chinese-Indian heritage.A post shared by audramorrice (@audramorrice)She is also an established author, television personality and business owner, with two cookbooks under her belt — My Kitchen Your Table and Cook & Feast.NGL, her responses to our questions make my tummy rumble. Having travelled all over the world, Audra has much to say about what multicultural and produce-driven cuisine has to offer us.Be sure to catch her when Season 4 of MasterChef Singapore goes on air from August 9 on Channel 5.There are quite a few, from lor mai gai (steamed glutinous rice with chicken) to lek tau suan (mung bean dessert) with you char kway (deep fried dough). I used to have lor mai gai at my primary school canteen when Mom didn’t pack me a luncheon meat sandwich, which was few and far between — she was pretty organised with our school lunches! We’d always either get tau suan and you char kway on weekends from the market, along with the sesame sugared butterfly bun, or an array of kuehs.I was one of those lucky kids whose mother loved food, too. She cooked well and always knew what to buy! To be honest, Mum and I cook a lot at home when I visit. We know what we like and usually it’s a vegetable dish loaded with fresh chillies and garlic, sometimes ikan bilis (dried anchovies) or salted fish.I’m a big fan of bean sprouts, okra (lady’s fingers), eggplant, mushroom, nai bai, kang kong, tofu, and so on, so the variety of vegetables we cook is endless. If I were to head out, my current two favourites would be: Candlenut, for incredibly refined authentic Peranakan cuisine, and Madras New Woodlands restaurant on Upper Dickson Road in Little India for Indian vegetarian.My other favourite cuisine is nasi padang. A great place for lunch is Rumah Makan Minang on Kandahar Street.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50% off at picturesque date spots, including Wildseed Cafe at The Alkaff Mansion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHawker Hustlers: Hipster hawker Ray Yeo of Bei-Ing Dimsum Club on reinventing dim sum and his love for all things Japan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActually, anything that has chillies in it. I love my chillies! But mostly, I crave nyonya kueh. I do make some in Sydney, but rather infrequently, as you often have to make a decent amount. And since I am generally the only one in my family who eats it, I don’t bother. That said, I do have a great recipe for a small gao teng kueh (nine-layered rainbow kueh), which is perfect for one to two people. Check it out on my Instagram page. I have travelled quite extensively. But on my bucket list: To travel around India and explore ALL their cuisine. India is such a huge country and differs dramatically from north to south, east to west. I’ve always loved how cuisine changes based on their climate and proximity to neighbouring cultures, which dictates what grows, how people eat and the various influences.\xa0My first trip to India was last year, but just to Chennai. Ironically, I was taken by some friends to a Rajasthani vegetarian restaurant and it blew my mind how a dozen vegetarian dishes could all taste so different — and all equally delicious.\xa0 Hmm…. In May, I was in Japan doing the Kumano Kodo trek.The best food (I tried) was at a minshuku in a small village called Chikatsuyu. They’ve been running their minshuku (bed and breakfast) for the past 30 years.\xa0The mum was the cook and the dad the admin guy, while the son and his wife were the most beautiful and helpful hosts. They facilitated check-ins and the serving of food. I’m sure among the four of them, the running of the place was a massive shared responsibility.Dinner was exquisite — simple, yet cooked with such care and precision, which is one of the things I love about Japanese cuisine.\xa0Ingredients grown locally are widely used. They grew their own rice, onions, potatoes, sweet potatoes, broccoli, cabbage, eggplant, Myoga (a ginger flower with a milder flavour compared to Singapore varieties), and so on.\xa0Alongside the beautiful array of vegetables and everything else grown on their farm — which by the way are not as commonly served in restaurants right across the larger city — the local river trout and sashimi of tuna, snapper and hirame (flounder) were so fresh and delicious. I was in heaven.For more ideas on local eats, check out the latest F&B openings in town.\xa0Candlenut is on the GrabFood delivery service and offers free delivery (up to S$3 off) with GrabUnlimited.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/heng-en-noodle-house-closing/:['Heng En Noodle House, the sister outlet of the famous No. 25 Minced Meat Noodle at Bukit Merah, will close its Bedok store come Sunday, July 30.This comes less than two months after the owners, couple Lam Geng Han, 27, and Chelsea Goh, 26, opened Heng En Noodle House on June 9.When Heng En Noodle House first opened in the east, it was met with much fanfare and anticipation due to the popularity of the couple’s first stall, No. 25 Minced Meat Noodle.\xa0No. 25 Minced Meat Noodle, which opened in February 2022, had amassed a legion of fans for its well-seasoned, pork lard-laden minced meat noodles and robust broth made in a traditional style, with ti po (sole fish powder).Both Heng En and No. 25 sell bak chor mee, or minced meat noodles, but the couple had hoped to differentiate Heng En by adding Japanese-style mazesoba (dry noodles, S$6.80) and assorted handmade fish cake products (from S$4.30) to its menu.\xa0The handmade fishcake products, made from premium yellowtail fish, are sourced from a local second-generation owner/supplier and were brought in by the couple as an effort to further preserve the hawker heritage in Singapore.\xa0A post shared by HENG EN NOODLE HOUSE 恒恩面家 (@hengennoodlehouse)At Heng En, there is also a stronger focus on its popular signature garlic kway teow (S$6.80 for small, $8.80 for big) dish, as well as a clearer, lighter version of its pork broth.\xa0“Our signature garlic kway teow is something really special and we are confident it can’t be found elsewhere…we’d really love for more people to try this taste,” explained Goh.Its pork broth, which comes with every purchase of its signature garlic kway teow, Japanese-style mazesoba and mee tai bak items, comes chockfull with ingredients including sliced cabbage, yellowtail fishball and Teochew fishball.\xa0\xa0On why they chose this location for Heng En, Goh said: “There were many people who approached us to tell us to open in the east, but the turnout has been disappointing.”\xa0The couple acknowledged that despite the supposed demand, they might have chosen a location that was less than suitable, given that Heng En is a new and unknown brand compared to the more established No. 25 name.\xa0Despite being in the central Bedok area, the stall is tucked away in a coffee shop that is slightly out of the way. Competition in the area is also quite stiff.Owing to these factors, business has been slow since they opened and the couple are unfortunately unable to keep up with rent and rising food costs.\xa0Expressing extreme sadness at the closure, Goh says that if they could have done things differently, they would have done more market research and not rushed into opening the Bedok store.But thankfully for Heng En fans, the couple will continue to serve their signature garlic kway teow, Japanese-style mazesoba, and handmade fishcake products back at their home base No. 25 in Bukit Merah. The fishcake products will likely be available from Thursdays to Saturdays.Following the closure, the couple will focus on No. 25 and take the time needed to recoup their losses. They plan to expand the business again next year, after their wedding ceremony in December.\xa0Speaking to us before news of Heng En’s closure broke, Goh stressed: “We need a lot of support from fellow Singaporeans. We really have a very strong passion and drive to do this, but we can’t do this without people’s support.”So show your support and grab your signature garlic kway teow and Japanese mazesoba from Heng En Noodle House at Bedok by this Sunday, July 30. Or continue to support them from No. 25 at Bukit Merah Central thereafter.\xa0For more ideas on local eats, check out our guide to some of the best nasi padang places in Singapore, or some affordable places to eat at Suntec City.\xa0Heng En Noodle House and No. 25 Minced Meat Noodle are available on Grabfood delivery\xa0and offer free delivery (up to S$3 off) with GrabUnlimited.Book a ride to have your bak chor mee fix at Heng En Noodle House or No. 25 Minced Meat Noodle.

Flor is a Portuguese word for flower and chef Yamashita says he’s inspired by Mother Nature to create edible works of art — no wonder it’s also known as “cake gallery”.Unlike Glace, which only has takeaway options, the new bakery has a few tables where one can enjoy a slice of cake — made with fresh, high quality ingredients — with coffee or tea.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/waku-ghin/:['Chef Tetsuya Wakuda is opening his second restaurant at the Marina Bay Sands, and the reservations list looks set to be no shorter than Tetsuya in Sydney — typically booked out for months in advance.After all, this Japanese-born chef is wildly popular — he’s rated as one of Australia’s finest chefs on the S Pellegrino World’s Best Restaurant list. In addition, the new Singapore outlet, called Waku Ghin, will sit just 28 diners. So even at full capacity every evening, the waiting list of this modern French-Japanese restaurant will not move along too quickly.However, that’s not to say that the new outlet is small. Occupying 8,000 square feet — enough to house a decent-sized bungalow and maybe a pool — it is among the biggest of the seven celebrity restaurants at the integrated resort.inSing.com caught up with the amicable Japanese-born chef to understand the concept behind Waku Ghin, slated to open end July, as well as to get a glimpse of the new dishes diners here can look forward to.I want to give my guests a personalised dining experience, so having fewer guests helps foster that closeness.Waku Ghin will have four dining rooms and a main dining hall, and the idea is to allow my guests to move around in the different sections of the restaurant throughout the different courses. This makes for a more varied experience.You can get access to very different ingredients here in Singapore, I’m so excited! One of the dishes I’m looking at is the bamboo crab, it’s also one of my favourites. We’ve been experimenting with different ways to cook it, and one of them is to steam the crab for a period of time with some garlic and cream. The texture of the crab is like sea cucumber. The dish is not exclusive per se, but we just can’t get that type of crab in Australia.I don’t think so, Singapore is such a hub. I believe we’ll have no issues having fresh ingredients flown in from Japan or other countries.As much as I would like to spend more time in Singapore, I’m committed to running the Sydney restaurant for now. But as Singapore is only about six hours from Sydney, I will try and come here at least once or twice a month. I will have a very capable team run the restaurant here.Speaking of my team, some of my staff have worked with me for 23 years, since I first started out. They are very loyal to me. So I really hope to train and develop my people well.It has always been my dream to start a restaurant in Japan, especially when I think about the fresh ingredients you can get there. Of course, it’s also because I think the restaurants in Japan are amazing, from the food you get to the level of service.I know one day my dream will come true, and I imagine my restaurant to be a very small and cozy one.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/princess-terrace-peranakan-buffet/:['Looking for the perfect family get-together spot that factors in price, convenience and diverse preferences can be hard.That’s exactly what makes hotel buffets one of the best options in town, especially when it comes to bigger gatherings.Let’s face it: Buffets not only provide variety but also plenty of opportunities to mingle. Above all, it provides better value than a similarly priced restaurant.If you’re looking to bring the fam bam together in August, here’s an interesting option — Princess Terrace at Copthorne King’s Hotel.This restaurant is known for serving authentic Penang-style Peranakan food and — more importantly — Princess Terrace will be having a National Day promotion of S$58 for its Penang-Peranakan buffet (U.P. S$60 for lunch, S$65 for dinner).The promotion applies to both lunch and dinner, any day of the week.What’s more: Children aged five and below get to dine free, making it hassle-free and conducive for jio-ing your extended family.Unlike your run-of-the-mill international buffet, Princess Terrace offers an enticing spread that focuses on a slew of uniquely Penang street foods.Interesting Penang spins on familiar classics include rojak (green mango, guava, cuttlefish, cucumber, white turnip, honey pineapple and dough fritters), chee cheong fun (rice noodles topped with dark prawn paste) and wok-fried porridge.Princess Terrace also has live stations at the ready to receive your orders, where you can watch hearty dishes freshly assembled a la minute, including freshly made popiah and nyonya kueh pie tee.\xa0It’s here that diners can grab quintessential Penang dishes such as wok-fried char kway teow, hokkien mee (similar to local prawn noodle soup).And when it comes to the heftier mains, you are met with a staggering array of gourmet classics. \n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50% off at picturesque date spots, including Wildseed Cafe at The Alkaff Mansion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThink assam fish, chicken satay, fish otah otah, curry chicken and braised pork trotters — all comforting and homely flavours that the whole family will enjoy.There’s even the stir-fried chilli slipper lobster, which is only available for dinner, if you’re craving something a little more bougie.After all these rich and heavy Penang dishes, the whole family can then indulge in Princess Terrace’s nostalgic traditional desserts. Pace yourselves because you’ll want to work through as many of the old-school treats as possible with favourites such as homemade beancurd, assorted nyonya kueh, bubur cha cha, ice kachang and cendol.As mentioned earlier, children below the age of 5 get to indulge in the same buffet spread as well for free.But they will also have access to a special kids’ menu that includes their favourite treats including chicken nuggets and fries.If you’re not a fan of the hubbub that comes with a big gathering, Princess Terrace also offers a great-value Peranakan high tea that costs just S$10 per person!\xa0The Peranakan high tea will be priced at S$20 for two diners until Aug 31, after which, it will still be available at S$28. It’s offered daily from 3pm to 5pm.For high tea, the restaurant will be treating diners to a medley of both Peranakan and Western tidbits to cater to more diverse palates — just in case you wanted to bring mum out for a girl’s day out.Daintier bites include signature handmade nyonya kuehs, assorted sandwiches, French macarons, and French patisserie.\xa0However, the high tea set also comes with hot bubur cha cha (coconut milk dessert), hot bubur pulut hitam with coconut milk (black glutinuous rice desser), and homemade beancurd with gula melaka for a different kind of high tea experience.Drinkwise, you are given the usual choices of coffee or tea to wash everything down.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/back-to-eden-cafe/:['Veganism is all the rage right now, thanks to our growing appetites for a healthier, meat-free diet that’s great for the environment and soul.\xa0If you’re on the hunt for vegan fare done well, the Back to Eden cafe is first on our list of go-to plant-focused establishments in Singapore.\xa0Formerly known as the popular brunch spot Curious Palette, it recently rebranded as an artisanal, all-day dining concept that is now Back to Eden. The vegan-friendly joint touts a holistic plant-based menu, as well as a micro-bakery with tantalising bakes.\xa0Located at the same Prinsep Street location, Back to Eden is the team’s take on indulgent contemporary fare sans the guilt.\xa0Beyond conjuring flavourful recipes, Back to Eden also whips up sauces and condiments that are made from scratch. It also boasts a thriving nursery growing organic herbs, such as basil and coriander, that are incorporated into its dishes.\xa0This is a testament to the establishment’s dedication to creating dishes that are not just delicious and one-of-a-kind, but also sustainable. The first dish to arrive at the table was the roasted butternut squash with beet hummus (S$13.90). It caught our eye right from the get-go, thanks to its vibrant pink and orange hues.\xa0While we’re not typically fans of butternut squash, this dish is a pleasant surprise. Tender slices of roasted, maple-glazed butternut squash are presented atop a bed of luscious pink beet hummus.It had the perfect balance of sweet and savoury notes.\xa0The crunch of sunflower seeds set against the smokiness of the charred butternut squash brought out a symphony of flavours and textures.Another moreish appetiser on the Back to Eden menu is the Holy Chips (S$11.90), featuring deep-fried lotus roots tossed in homemade mala powder. Paper-thin and crispy, it’s so addictive that we can’t help but snack on a second chip (or more).\xa0A scrumptious Lao Gan Ma (chilli sauce) dip is also available on the side if you need an extra numbing, fiery kick of spice.Every diner at the table thoroughly enjoyed the oyster mushroom berempah (S$11.90). Huge chunks of oyster mushrooms are coated in a tantalising herb and spice mix, also known as “Kakak’s secret berempah recipe”.\xa0It’s then deep fried with fragrant curry leaves for added flavour and aroma. Lastly, the dish is completed with a creamy, herbed lime mayo dip, the tanginess of which perfectly balances the savoury fried mushrooms.The roasted roma tomato soup (S$15.90) is a best-seller at Back to Eden. Enriched with smoked cashew sour cream, basil oil and fresh basil leaves, it’s a comforting dish that’s best savoured on a cold day.\xa0There is a choice of either country sourdough bread or a cheese toastie (additional S$4). We chose the latter, a drool-worthy grilled cheese sandwich slathered in marmite, Dijon mustard and sweet onion jam.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTalad Thai Banana opens at AMK Hub with S$2 opening promotion for the first 100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe star of the show at Back to Eden cafe is the shakshuka (S$18.90). It is the eatery’s unique rendition of the famed Mediterranean dish, which promises addictive, robust flavours. It sees vivid colours on a plate, what with its visually-captivating shades of orange, yellow and red.\xa0Look forward to a rich tomato peperonata (Italian vegetable stew) adorned with a creamy pumpkin carrot puree seasoned with Himalayan black salt ‘yolk”. It’s also topped with a dollop of smoked cashew sour cream and a coarse-grain homemade dukkah. When paired with thick slices of herbed focaccia that’s baked in-house, it made for a comforting and satisfying meal.The crispy potato rosti (S$18.90) is another dish that’s worth an order. Fried to golden-brown perfection, the rosti is served with a side of creamed spinach, mushrooms and herbaceous basil pesto atop a slow-roasted tomato.\xa0What’s a classic breakfast dish without scrambled eggs? Or rather, tofu scramble (additional S$3), as the folks at Back to Eden would have it. Made from tofu, oat milk, turmeric and Himalayan black salt, the tofu scramble is reminiscent of scrambled eggs — it bears the same texture and is equally as creamy.Round off the meal with Back to Eden cafe’s homemade 10% whole wheat buttermylk waffles (S$14.90). It’s made from whole wheat, artisan bread flour and homemade buttermilk from apple cider vinegar and soy milk.\xa0Besides its light and fluffy texture, the waffles are also drizzled with pure maple syrup and decorated with fresh seasonal fruits.If you prefer a lil’ more oomph and sweetness in your dessert,\xa0add on the velvety plant-based vanilla yoghurt for an additional S$5.90.The dining experience isn’t complete without Back to Eden’s range of healthy smoothies. Chock-full of nourishing ingredients such as fruits and oats, the yummy smoothies promise both flavour and nutritional benefits.\xa0The immunity-elevating Flamingo (S$10.50) is a gorgeous, red-hued beverage prepared with frozen raspberries, grapefruit and orange among others.\xa0The Purple (S$10.50) is another popular order. Inspired by blueberry pies, the drink comprises a number of ingredients, including berries, bananas, rolled oats and more.\xa0If you’re craving a cuppa, Back to Eden also serves freshly-brewed coffee, courtesy of its sister brand Strangers’ Reunion. Expect a list of caffeinated staples like the espresso (S$4) and long black (S$5.50 for hot, S$6.50 for iced), as well as cold brews such as Oatgasm (S$7.50) and sea salt chocolate (S$7.50).

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/prata-lahhh-hougang-hawker-hustlers/:['Hawker Hustlers is a HungryGoWhere series spotlighting young and emerging hawkers with compelling stories. Read through all the way for an exclusive GrabFood promo so you can try their food, too.Growing up, Ghauthaman s/o Ramanan (or ‘Ghau’ for short) has always acutely felt the weight of living up to his family’s prata empire legacy.\n\nAfter all, his kin are behind some of the most well-known Indian restaurants in Singapore. His father, for one, is behind household name Casuarina Curry, which has three outlets, while his uncle owns Springleaf Prata Place, which has nine outlets islandwide. His cousin runs Gandhi Restaurant in Little India.\n\nHaving helped out with the family business since he was 14, Ghau always knew that he would one day start his own F&B business. As to what it was going to be? He wasn’t sure, exactly. After completing his National Service, he ventured into various sales roles for about two to three years to understand the mechanics behind running a business.\n\nArmed with the business know-how, Ghau finally felt ready to forge his own path. He would leverage his family history — but give it a flavour of his own.\n\nIn December 2022, he invested S$40,000 to launch Prata Lahhh! in Hougang — a trendy stall in a coffee shop to appeal to the younger market.\xa0Billed as Singapore’s “first DIY prata” concept, diners get the chance to customise their own unique prata dish to satisfy their cravings.\xa0\xa0On the origins of the name, the down-to-earth 30-year-old explains: “When people ask: ‘What do you want to eat?’ We usually answer, ‘Prata, lah!’”First, opt for your main base carb (prata or thosai). Then, choose your filling of choice from a list of some 20 ingredients.\xa0Beyond the basic egg, onion, garlic, and cheese, you can go wild with mushroom, chicken or mutton keema, as well as more premium fare such as prawn and crab meat. Have a sweet tooth? Add options such as honey or chocolate dips.Previously, diners had the option of grabbing a plate to help themselves to the ingredients — akin to the way you have mala xiang guo or yong tau foo. But as this resulted in even longer queues, the stall decided to do away with this model.Today, all you have to do is let them know what you’d like, and the staff will do the rest.While there, the HungryGoWhere team had a chance in crafting the most overloaded prata. Stumped by the array of choices, Ghau helpfully suggested some ingredient pairings, such as swapping out the chicken keema with sardine sambal, which would go better with the prawn and crab.\n\nAfter loading the prata with our ingredients and flipping it expertly, Ghau presented our dish. It was the most enormous prata creation we’ve ever seen, paired with our pick of chicken, mutton or fish curry, or dhal.Every mouthful “gives a different dimension”, Ghau observes as we dig in. It’s an indulgence, indeed.The ability to tailor your own dish extends to other items in the stall, too. Diners can customise their own thosai or goreng dish. Choices for goreng include bee hoon and maggie mee — you can even opt for a prata goreng.For those who prefer the standard prata-ordering experience, you can order off the regular set Prata Lahhh! menu, which include classics such as plain, paper, egg, garlic prata and the like. There are also innovative dishes such as eggs benedict prata.Since the stall’s opening, the brand has received plenty of media coverage and attention on social media. It’s also drawn a fair share of new customers and prata lovers who make their way down to the obscure residential estate in Hougang, eager to experiment with adventurous flavour combinations. Many of them are in their twenties to thirties — dropping by after work for their prata fix.Ghau says he has his family to thank for his new business. He has enjoyed their support, every step of the way.\n\nThis includes both big and small matters, from bouncing off business ideas and discussing marketing strategies, to hiring decisions, or even searching for the best stainless steel supplier. He’s grateful he can always turn to his father and extended family for help, he says. \n\nHowever, perhaps what’s best is the fact that they give him the space to learn, instead of dictating what he should do.\xa0“When I ask them for advice on something, they never tell me yes or no… They just give me the pros and cons, and at the end of the day, it’s my decision. Having these strong pillars and a (solid) foundation is very reassuring,” he adds.More importantly, Ghau says all the years of helping out with the family business has sharpened his instincts on how to “work hard, work smart, talk to customers, understand what they need, and how to treat employees right”.This certainly came across during our visit, as the friendly and unassuming Ghau quickly made us feel at ease during our chat.Speaking to us in front of his stall, you can sense Ghau’s passion for the craft. After all, the art of cooking is ingrained into his very being, and his family’s, too.\xa0\xa0Recounting how cooking has always come naturally to his family, Ghau recalls a time when his family was overseas in Dubai for a holiday a few years ago.\n\nWhen it was time to prepare breakfast for the family in their Airbnb, his father and younger brothers fell into their roles automatically, like a well-oiled machine. One person got busy preparing the bread and cereal, while the others made omelettes and drinks.\n\n“It made me realise that everyone here is a cook and we all work together so seamlessly in a kitchen… Cooking is in our blood,” he says.While acknowledging that he has benefitted from his family legacy, Ghau says he believes there’s a chance for anyone to make it in this industry, as long as they give it a go. “It really depends on how we make use of (what we’ve been given).”Dishing out his advice for young entrepreneurs, Ghau says: “Don’t listen to any naysayers. Just believe in your vision, 200%. There will be many times that will cause you to doubt yourself, but if you keep pressing on, you’ll reach your goal.”Although he has been handling prata for more than a decade, Ghau is quick to say that he is still far from being a prata master.\n\n“It’s the same with a sushi chef. Each time, you learn something different about how the dough falls, how to press it, what ingredients go well with it,” he says.\xa0“Every day, the world around you changes. The butter, ghee, sugar, flour — the taste of these (ingredients) varies… No matter how many years of experience you have, you still learn something new about the craft.”Just like those who have gone before him, Ghau has ambitions to bring Prata Lahhh! further. \n\nBy the start of November, he plans to open a second branch at a 24-hour halal coffee shop, a popular supper spot in eastern Singapore. Some innovative dishes in the works include lobster and fried duck biryani.In time, he hopes to expand the brand overseas to places such as Australia and Britain, because of its strong Asian presence.He admits with a grin: “I want more people to know about Prata Lahhh!. Of course, the goal is to be as good as the family standard, but deep down, the goal is to be better than the family brand!”Good news for our readers who scrolled all the way to the end!

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/nasi-padang-singapore/:['Nothing whets our appetite better than a hearty plate of nasi padang in Singapore, thanks to the sheer number of aromatic dishes on display. It’s not just a meal that’s made for sharing, but one that brings families and friends together.Named after the city of Padang, capital of the West Sumatra province, nasi padang offers an extensive array of meats, fish and vegetables that’s paired with curries and sambal, and eaten with white rice.Although some might say it’s similar to economic rice, also fondly known as cai fan, nasi padang differs as the dishes offered often come with a much more flavourful punch. This is because they’re prepared with a variety of herbs and spices, and typically simmered for hours to produce robust flavours.You can have it as mixed rice (nasi campur-style), where all the different ingredients are piled on individual plates or you can opt to have the dishes served family-style (hidang), where each item is presented on its own small plate.So, if you’re craving a savoury plate of nasi padang, we’ve found 15 spots with the best nasi padang in Singapore offering dishes that will make you go: “Sedap!”.\xa0117 Upper Paya Lebar Road\nOpen: Monday to Friday (6.30am to 6.30pm)\xa0Why visit?

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/thai-supermarket-singapore/:['If you were one of those who mourned the closure of the iconic Golden Mile Complex, then you must have heard of the newest specialty supermarket in town — Thai supermarket at Aperia Mall.\xa0While some tenants took the closure as their swan song, others went on to new spaces around Singapore.\xa0Thai Supermarket, one of Golden Mile’s anchor tenants that has been at the complex since 1985, has found a new home at Aperia Mall, just a stone’s throw from Lavender MRT station.\xa0The supermarket is located right around the mall’s main atrium at the ground floor, and draws you in immediately with its bright lights, unmissable signage and life-sized tuktuk at the front.\xa0It occupies roughly the same amount of space as it did in Golden Mile Complex (10,000 sq ft), but this time the supermarket shares its space with five F&B vendors, a nail salon and hair salon, with more shops to come.\xa0We get that most of you would have made your way down to Thai Supermarket to stock up on Thai groceries and snacks.But if you’re feeling peckish or craving some Thai food, there are plenty of Thai street food vendors such as Yung Ying, Talad Thai Banana, Thai Yum mee and dine-in-eateries — Folks Collective and Slurp Noodle & Tea Bar.Here’s our top picks on what to eat at Thai Supermarket so you make the most of your time there:Fans of Thai food might have come across Folks Collective located in the heart of bustling Cross Street. Folks Collective at Thai Supermarket serves up just as authentic Thai food, offering a modern take while staying true to modern flavours.We enjoyed its prawn sashimi (S$22), which were juicy, plump and extremely fresh.\xa0You might have wanted to try raw seafood when exploring Bangkok, but refrained from it as you’re unsure about its freshness. You wouldn’t have that problem here at Folk’s Collective.The prawns we had were so fresh you could taste their sweetness. The dish also comes with a slightly spicy, tangy sauce if you prefer a little extra spice.\xa0If you want other options, the restaurant serves up raw flower crab (S$28), too.Slurp is a new Thai noodle bar concept by the people behind Folk’s Collective. Slurp serves up boat noodles, Thai iced teas and other streetside favourites such as moo ping pork skewers (S$12 for four pieces), and even Isan sausage (S$8).\xa0We tried its pork boat noodles (S$10.90) and instantly felt like we were back in the streets of Bangkok with its authentic taste.The noodles were al dente and its soup flavourful and robust.\xa0If you find yourself ordering more food and need something to wash it all down, try its variety of Thai milk teas. There’s the regular Thai milk tea and Thai green milk tea (both S$4.50), but also the rose milk tea (S$4.50), which we loved and couldn’t quite get enough of. If you go to Thai Supermarket, you’ll notice a long, seemingly never ending queue. Follow the queue and you’ll see that it ends at Talad Thai Banana.There is a constant stream of people queuing for the store’s signature banana fritters, but also its other fried goodies.Its sweet potato balls (12 for S$5) were crispy on the outside, and chewy on the inside, almost like a mochi ball. It tasted amazing piping hot and we could see just why the queues keep coming.If you want the full experience, opt for its mixed bag (S$6), which comes with fried bananas and yam chips on top of the sweet potato balls. Fans of Yaowarat buns, this is Yung Yung’s second outpost since its first shop at Bishan.\xa0Yung Yung may sell bubble tea, but the true star is its Yaowarat-style buns — they’re crispy on the outside, fluffy and soft on the inside.Its speculoos bun (S$3.80) with Lotus biscoff is a hot favourite, but if you want something a little more local, its kaya (S$3) and milky milk (S$3.5) buns are also ones to note.\xa0Dig into it warm — you’ll thank us later! If you’ve still got space and time after all that queuing and munching, don’t forget to check out Thai Yum Mee, a mango dessert and Thai salad food kiosk.You can even opt for your mango slushie to be served with your Thai salad or Thai noodles, like we did.A Chiang Rai noodle and mango slushie combo goes for S$11.50 and makes for a pretty neat photo and snack, especially if you are the type who needs a sip of drink with every bite of the spicy noodles.Prefer them separate? You can get the Chiang Rai noodles at S$7.90 and the mango slushie bomb (S$9.90) individually. In Aperia Mall or Lavender and want to check out other eats?

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/yao-yao-sauerkraut-fish/:['The latest concept to pop up in the VivoCity shopping mall is Yao Yao Sauerkraut Fish, one of China’s famed pickled fish brands. It’s best known for its signature suan cai yu (sour vegetable fish).Hailing from Shenzhen, the restaurant has been a crowd favourite since its inception in 2016. It now boasts more than 60 outlets in China.Yao Yao’s VivoCity store marks its first overseas outpost in Singapore, which is also its flagship outlet.Decked in wooden trimmings and gorgeous Tiffany-blue hues, the establishment is easily spotted from afar. You’ll also be greeted at the door by a statue of Yao Yao Sauerkraut Fish’s adorable mascot: A quirky animal that’s a bear-and-fish-hybrid.\xa0We visited the restaurant during lunch hour, and it was crowded with diners eager to taste its tantalising dishes. We’d recommend coming down earlier to snag a table and skip the queue.First on our list of appetisers to try is the Sichuan spicy poached chicken (S$12). It sees tender slices of boneless chicken drumstick poached in an aromatic, fiery broth.\xa0You may want to have a drink on standby. Made from Sichuan peppercorns, dried red chilli peppers and a plethora of fragrant spices, this spicy dressing is not for the faint of heart.The sour and spicy organic white fungus (S$9) is another dish that we enjoyed. It’s presented in a bowl chockfull of generous chunks of liao (ingredients): Yunnan white fungus and onions drizzled with piquant chilli oil.\xa0This appetiser is sure to get your tummies rumbling for the main course, with its addictive crunch and flavour in every bite.The signature Yao Yao Sauerkraut Fish (S$48 for two persons, S$68 for three to four persons, S$88 for five to six persons) is the star of the show at the restaurant.\xa0Tender slices of California white seabass are prepared with suan cai (sauerkraut) that has been fermented for 24 days. The succulent fish is then cooked in a peppery, herbaceous broth that’s simmered for eight hours, alongside rich spices specially imported from Sichuan.\xa0The result is a tongue-numbing delicacy that’s incredibly savoury and satisfying. Feel free to throw in additional ingredients, such as enoki mushrooms, luncheon meat and tofu (from S$3), to jazz up the dish.\xa0Get the best of both worlds with the Yao Yao Super Combination (from S$53), where you can mix and match the signature fish dish with another soup of your choice. Choose between two flavours: Tomato fish and Sichuan poached fish (also referred to as shui zhu yu).\xa0The latter is our favourite. It features a medley of aromatic spices and juicy fish slices cooked in a spicy, flavoursome broth. If you’re a spice lover, this red-hot dish is one you cannot miss.Alternatively, for an East-meets-West creation, opt for the Hong Kong-style Typhoon Shelter shrimp with fries to go with the sauerkraut fish. The prawns are crisp, juicy and fragrant, while the fries are a crunchy and delightful addition to the mix. The Yao Yao Peking duck (S$45 for half, S$90 for whole) won our hearts at first bite. Served with a plethora of dips, such as a housemade sesame-mustard sauce and traditional Peking duck dressing, the dish spotlights mouthwatering slices of duck meat with a crispy skin.\xa0The meat is melt-in-your-mouth tender, and each mouthful promises a myriad of flavours. The dish is also accompanied by paper-thin crepe rolls that you can use as a wrap, as well as slices of honeydew and scallions.The last item to savour at Yao Yao Sauerkraut Fish in Singapore is the Rainbow Cold Jelly (S$8). It’s a colourful dish with shades of red, orange and yellow, making it a perfect shot for the ’gram.\xa0The picturesque dessert is a homemade oolong jelly that’s adorned with ingredients including the likes of raisins, red bean, hawthorn and barley. It’s not cloying sweet and is a wonderful refresher on a hot day.\xa0If you prefer other sweets on the menu, there’s also the chilled layered coconut pudding (S$9) and red bean cold jelly (S$3).

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/my-must-eats-cara-neo/:['My Must-Eats is a HungryGoWhere series featuring Singapore’s public figures and their favourite food haunts. This week Cara Neo, Singapore’s first professional mermaid, takes the limelight.\n\nCara Neo has been busy. Really busy. The 31-year-old professional mermaid, who holds the title of Singapore’s first mermaid, was last seen in Netflix’s documentary, MerPeople. The popular four-part series is an intense look at underwater performers who have turned their love for the sea creature into real-world careers.Neo, who’s also known by her pseudonym Syrena, is part of the cast showing the ins and outs of mermaiding — a world that might look glamorous, but is hardly easy, or fun.Neo first pursued her passion when she was an undergraduate at the National University of Singapore. She conducted events part-time then, but upon graduating, she embarked on this full-time, performing at various shindigs including children’s parties and corporate events for big names such as Marina Bay Sands and the Singapore Zoo.In 2015, she founded the Singapore Mermaid School for both kids and adults, which teaches everything from mermaid corework exercise and caring for one’s tail to mermaid culture, myths, and pop culture.These days, you can find her teaching or performing, doing what she loves. A notable event included an outdoor mermaid tank installation for Ion Orchard’s 10th anniversary in 2019 — Neo appeared weekly in the custom-built tank, performing and posing for passers-by with a glittery mermaid tail.Now, the important part — have you ever wondered what a mermaid eats?\n\nTurns out, mermaids love local eats, just as much as we do. Although Neo has travelled all over the world to conduct her live performances, she still loves Singapore food, most notably, nostalgic dishes that remind her of home.\xa0Popiah! It’s a very nostalgic dish for me. Sometimes for Chinese New Year, my family would order in a popiah party. It was always fun to DIY our own rolls… I always over-stuffed mine and would end up with a gloriously messy roll with ingredients spilling out of it.After school, I’d frequently stop by My Cosy Corner in Coronation Plaza for a bite. It was a fun snack on the go. The eatery is a little hole-in-the-wall with a loyal clientele, and the aunty knows my order as soon as she sees my face.\xa0Its popiah has the perfect blend of soft cooked radish and crunch from the golden rice bits. I’ve lots of fond memories of lunching there with grandparents, parents and school friends, so I’m sure the nostalgia makes the fare taste even better. I’m a creature of habit, so I tend to visit the places I love over and over again.\n\nFor local fare, Diamond Kitchen is my go-to — it has an outlet in the east and in the west, so I joke that wherever I am in Singapore, I can head there for my fix. Its lala bee hoon comes with generous helpings of clams, and is the perfect balance of light and umami. It’s really delicious, and great for times when you need a wholesome meal that isn’t cloying, or something comforting on a rainy day.\xa0I love its crab dishes as well — there are lots of flavours to choose from, but my favourites are the signature chilli crab and the salted egg yolk crab. They have a decadent, drippy sauce that I can sweep my mantous through — heaven!I also really enjoy the bamboo clams, which are savoury and garlicky in all the best ways. They often sell out fast, so I’d call to reserve them if you can. \n\nI’m also a big sushi girl and a regular at Koh Grill & Sushi Bar for my lunchtime fix. Its head chef blends various traditional Japanese elements while catering to Singapore tastes, resulting in strong flavours that are so delicious.The Shiok Maki and pitan tofu are must-orders when you’re there, and its regular sushi and sashimi are fresh and generous, too. My husband brought me there roughly 10 years ago, and we’ve been going there since. Barbeque chicken wings and a massive cold glass of sugarcane juice from Newton Food Centre. A Singapore classic. That, and the lime-laced sambal belachan from Diamond Kitchen. \n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50% off at picturesque date spots, including Wildseed Cafe at The Alkaff Mansion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMartin’s Kitchen: New restaurant serves unique Hakka-inspired dishes with Mexican and European influences\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy American mermaid friends know I’m a big fan of seafood and have impressed upon me the joys of a good ol’ seafood boil!\xa0When I’m in the right neck of the woods I’d love to have the full experience: What’s not to like about a great glorious mess of crawfish, sweet corn, prawns and clams — all tossed in butter and spices? Sounds like an absolute dream to me.\xa0I also like the social aspect of it — sitting around on a cool evening with a cold cider and a heaping plate of Cajun-spiced seafood. Yes, please. My husband cooked a glorious steak just the other night, and it was perfect! We enjoy the ritual of visiting our favourite butcher and having a steak night every fortnight or so.\n\nWe also love having steak nights with friends, maybe over a game of Dungeons and Dragons. We’d sear up the steaks, break out a bottle of cab (cabernet sauvignon), and put on a Skyrim or Witcher ambient playlist. \n\nSounds silly, but it just adds to the immersiveness of it all, and I love having these “tavern nights”! For the latest on the food scene, check out the opening of Yao Yao Sauerkraut Fish or our guides on what to eat at the new Thai Supermarket and must-eats in Singapore.\n\nAll eateries except for Koh Grill & Sushi Bar are on the GrabFood Delivery Service and offer free delivery (up to S$3 off) with GrabUnlimited. They can also be found on GrabFood Dine-in.You can also book a ride to these eateries.AuthorPhyllis is a sweet tooth with a love for all things dessert.

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/singapore-best-laksa/:['Singapore has a few dishes that can be considered its national dish. It’s debatable, but the main contenders are usually chicken rice, chilli crab and, of course, laksa.Given its popularity, it’s hard for everyone to agree on where to get Singapore’s best laksa. Food is a contentious subject after all, and we all have our allegiances to the numerous famous laksa icons in Singapore.It doesn’t help, too, that there are quite a few laksa varieties. There’s the decadently lemak type with a coconut-based curry broth, the assam type that has a sour and spicy fish broth, Siamese Laksa, which is a hybrid between the first two and tom yum, and more.No matter the variety you profess your love to, we can all agree on one thing — all of them soothe the soul like no other dish with warm, soupy comfort.\xa0If you’re planning on eating your way through Singapore’s best laksa stalls, we’ve done the legwork for you with our curated list of different styles. We know you’re familiar with 328 Katong Laksa, so here are some lesser known options.All you have to do now, is to put that stomach to work.Roxy Square, 50 East Coast Road\nOpen: Monday to Friday (10.30am to 4.30pm), Saturday and Sunday (9am to 4.30pm)Why visit? Janggut Laksa is a heritage stall founded in the 1950s along East Coast Road. Now, there are tons of stalls in Katong that claim to be the first to serve the “original Katong laksa”, and Janggut Laksa is one of them.\xa0While we hesitate to get in on this debate, it’s undeniable that Janggut Laksa is a perennial favourite among many laksa aficionados, and serves a delicious and rich bowl of laksa. You simply can’t declare that other stalls have Singapore’s best version of laksa, until you tried this one first.\xa0Price range: $Crowd favourites: No prizes for guessing what’s the crowd favourite here. Constantly in the running for the title of best laksa in Singapore, the original Janggut laksa (S$5.50 for regular, S$7.50 for large) will hit the spot with its sapid and creamy broth. Slurp up all the rice noodles, toppings and curry in one spoonful for the best experience.928 Yishun Central 1, 01-155\nOpen: Monday to Saturday (7.30am to 6pm)Why visit? Yishun might be known for many things, having landed itself on the news for unsavoury instances that even caught the attention of streaming giant Netflix. However, this northern neighbourhood is also known for its thriving food scene, and it is where you can find Yishun 928 Laksa — one of Singapore’s best laksa options, in our opinion.Differing from the usual lemak Katong-style broth, this Yishun stalwart draws long queues for its lighter and creamier style of broth.\xa0If there’s a reason for you to brave the infamous ’hood of Yishun — speaking as a Yishunite myself — it’s this bowl of heaven.Price range: $Crowd favourites: This unassuming laksa stall only sells one item, which you can customise in terms of the size, addition of toppings and type of carb. Its basic bowl of laksa (S$3.30) is good enough, boasting a generous amount of ingredients such as cockles, egg and taupok in a comfortingly balanced and aromatic broth. Tanglin Halt Food Centre, 01-20, 48A Tanglin Halt Road\nOpen: Tuesday and Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday (5.30am to 12.30pm)Why visit? We’ve all heard the hubbub about Tanglin Halt Market & Food Centre’s impending demise. It has been slated for redevelopment since 2021, but its closure has been repeatedly delayed. Recent news has confirmed that it’ll be demolished from 2024.If you must head down to say goodbye, make sure you try one of its most popular stalls, Wei Yi Laksa, which has been open for more than three decades.\xa0You can make your own judgments on whether the stall serves one of the best bowls of laksa in Singapore, but the snaking queues that form as early as 5.30am should be indicative enough.Price range: $Crowd favourites: As its name suggests, Wei Yi offers laksa (from S$4) and prawn noodles (S$3). You can choose from various combinations of ingredients to customise your bowl of laksa, which includes chicken, prawn, cockles and fried bean curd. The gravy here doesn’t have coconut milk and is lighter than most, so if you prefer that, this stall is for you.VivoCity, 02-48, 1 HarbourFront Walk\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (11.30am to 10pm)Why visit? Dry laksa is a relatively new discovery for many Singaporeans. While this stir-fried rendition has always existed, it has never quite garnered so much attention until Jelebu Dry Laksa exploded onto social media.The concept headed by chef Renee Tang had humble origins as a home-based business, but eventually caught the eye of homegrown F&B specialist Tipsy Group, culminating in a joint venture at VivoCity in 2022.This is for the more adventurous eaters who are looking for something unconventional, other than the usual suspects under the Singapore’s best laksa list.Price range: $$Crowd favourites: If you ask anyone what’s the signature dish here, it’ll obviously be the \xa0Jelebu dry laksa (from S$13).\xa0The addictive stir-fried dish is filled with umami, thanks to the richness of its rempah. It is available with a variety of ingredients, such as crispy squid (S$14) and grilled prawn (S$18). Feeling bougie? Go for the butter poached lobster (S$38 for half, S$56 for full).Far East Plaza, 03-89, 14 Scotts Road\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (11am to 8.30pm)Why visit? Penang’s rendition of laksa, the assam laksa, is a piquant dish of rich and tangy fish broth, opening the palate to flavours of sweet, sour, spicy, and savoury.\xa0Usually consumed any time of the day, it comprises rice noodles topped with ingredients such as shredded boiled fish, torch ginger flower, pineapple, sliced cucumber, onion, and mint leaves.We recommend heading to Penang Kitchen to try not just the laksa, but also other authentic Penang delicacies, including nasi goreng and char kway teow.\xa0Price range: $$Crowd favourites: Definitely try the sweet-and-sour Penang-style assam laksa (S$10), which is light but a flavour bomb all the same. While there, you can also dig into its rich prawn noodles soup (S$10) and share the belachan chicken wings (from S$8) with your friends.307 Changi Road\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (8am to 3pm)Why visit? While it bears the name of Katong in its signboard, this stall isn’t actually located in the location. Instead, it can be found along a stretch of quaint shophouses located between Eunos and Kembangan MRT stations.It is a bit of a hidden gem compared to other big names such as 328 Katong Laksa or Janggut Laksa, but don’t let its (comparative) lack of fanfare fool you.\xa0The stall was started by George’s father more than half a decade ago, who purportedly learnt the recipe from the founder of Janggut Laksa. Definitely a contender for the Singapore’s best laksa list.Price range: $Crowd favourites: Some discerning foodies consider the laksa here to be one of the best versions of Katong laksa you can find in Singapore. Priced from S$5, each bowl has a healthy helping of fish cakes, prawns and cockles, soaked in a complex and thick broth.27 Jalan Berseh, 01-100\nOpen: Thursday to Tuesday (9.30am to 4pm)Why visit? Sequestered in a tiny coffee shop in the middle of Jalan Besar, this stall is a bit of an inconspicuous gem, and it’s easy to miss it if you’re not paying attention.But if you do take notice, you’ll see a sizable lunch crowd there, which sometimes eclipses even that of some popular stalls at the nearby Berseh Food Centre.This humble stall might not look like much, but it’s known by many as one of the go-to spots when you’re on the hunt for Singapore’s best laksa places. It serves up a lighter but equally rich rendition of the broth popularised by its Katong compatriots.Price range: $Crowd favourites: Hordes of laksa fanatics swarm this establishment for the one item, its signature laksa (S$4), which features a lighter and creamier broth that allows the rest of the aromatics and spices to shine.Havelock Road Cooked Food Centre, 01-08, 22A Havelock Road,\xa0\nOpen: Monday to Saturday (8am to 1.30pm)Why visit? It’s fair to say that Guang Fa Laksa isn’t the most recognisable name when it comes to listing the stalls that serve Singapore’s best laksa. But that’s understandable, since it’s housed in the under-the-radar Havelock Road Cooked Food Centre.That said, this cult-favourite has built up quite a following for itself, as scores of regulars flock down to the stall just to wait in line for its cockles-filled signature.Price range: $Crowd favourites: There’s the usual laksa (S$4/S$5) up for grabs — a generous bowl of fragrant laksa broth topped with your typical laksa ingredients. However, we recommend the unique only cockles laksa (S$5/S$6) if you really love your hum — it’s a flavourful, indulgent bowl that will perk you right up.Ulu Pandan Community Club, 01-03, 170 Ghim Moh Road\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (9am to 4.30pm)Why visit? While most of the curation deals with rustic and old-school coffee shop stalls, House Downstairs can be seen as a bit of an unusual inclusion in a list for Singapore’s best laksa destinations.Make no mistake, this dreamy and cleanly minimalist cafe near Ghim Moh is a worthy entrant, for it whips up a mean plate of dry-style laksa goreng. Who knew you could get such sedap noodles while enjoying a gorgeous Scandi-minimalist vibe like this?Price range: $$Crowd favourites: The laksa goreng (S$17) is undoubtedly one of the signatures that put House Downstairs on the map, but the cafe also excels in other elevated Asian-fusion dishes, such as the moreish scallions pancake (S$7) and Korean riceball (S$9).Pop-up at Bistro Bytes at i12 Katong, 02-12/14, 112 East Coast Road\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (12pm to 8pm)Why visit? A famous Penang brand that’s brought in as a pop-up by reputed F&B expert, Proper Concepts, you won’t find any tangy assam broth here — strangely enough — despite its name alluding to its geographical roots.Instead, the relatively new Granny Q actually gained popularity for serving a red-style broth influenced by the Nyonya-Thai style of laksa. It’s spicy and rich with coconut milk, not too dissimilar to Singaporean laksa.\xa0It will be operating as a pop-up at Katong, home to some of Singapore’s best laksa options, from Aug 3 until Oct 29.Price range: $$Crowd favourites: The family-run business uses an original century-old recipe that was first created by the Heng family’s grandmother in the 1920s.\xa0Each bowl of signature GQ laksa (S$8.80 for poached tilapia, S$9.80 for fried tilapia) is served with rice noodles, tilapia, prawns, and a heap of punchy Penang hei-ko (prawn paste) to give it that extra oomph of umami.Multiple stores islandwide\xa0\nOpen: Operating hours vary across outletsWhy visit? D’Laksa is an intriguing brand. Founded in 2012 in Johor Bahru, its speciality actually lies in throwing together an appetising bowl of Penang-style assam laksa, because Penang is the owner’s birthplace.Since its launch in Singapore in 2017, the brand now has three outlets islandwide, conveniently found in heartland malls in the north, north-east and west of Singapore.Price range: $Crowd favourites: Sure D’Laksa also serves up other assam dishes and rojak, but it’ll be egregious not to get yourself a bowl of its signature assam laksa (S$5). It’s a hearty sweet-and-sour medley of spices that is perfect for those rainy days.

It was later gazetted for conservation in 2013.The new Margaret Market aims to preserve echoes of history, retaining aspects of the original building such as its iconic facade, while incorporating more modern touches to serve the residents better.The capacious interior has been converted into a stylishly modernised boutique market — above all, it’s fully air-conditioned to meet the demands of increasingly sweltering local weather.As for its tenants, Margaret Market has curated a plethora of boutique brands, with an emphasis on local businesses.This means many perennial local favourites can be found in the market, including Creamier, one of Singaporean’s go-tos for creamy gelato, and kaya toast specialist Ya Kun Kaya Toast.Not sure what to get at Margaret Market? Many first-time F&B entrepreneurs have also decided to choose Margaret Market as their new home, with four new concepts debuting.In particular, cafe fanatics will relish a chance to check out intricate bakes by The Homme Baker and unique Australian-inspired jaffles (sealed-up toasted cheese sandwiches) from Urban Folks at Margaret Market.The Homme Baker\xa0had previously operated as an online business, garnering attention for elaborate cakes such as its T&J collection, which comprises cakes that are whimsically moulded into the shape of Swiss cheese.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Junction Westgate opening with promos; will house 23 tenants, including new halal teppanyaki\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTalad Thai Banana opens at AMK Hub with S$2 opening promotion for the first 100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Feuds: Saizeriya vs Milan Shokudo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, Urban Folks is a brand-new concept and specialises in hearty brunch items.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/cafe-ren-farrer-park/:['Most hardcore cafe-hoppers would know this: Farrer Park is home to a thriving cafe enclave, which sees the likes of popular fixtures such as SYIP and Old Hen Kitchen.However, it can be a scramble to get seats for your Farrer Park brunch dates on weekends. Thankfully, the cool new Cafe Ren is a great alternative to other more established brands.Opened in July, the sleek cafe is done up tastefully without much extravagance — it’s lush with calming swathes of beiges that are accentuated with contrasting wooden details.Located just a stone’s throw away from the other cafes, and under a HDB block, it possesses a homelier vibe than the usual voguish minimalist cafes that trend on social media, while still being aesthetically pleasing.More importantly, the food here is just as solid as the other brunch spots in the area.While Cafe Ren’s food menu isn’t particularly adventurous or off-the-wall, diners will find it flush with a plethora of comforting classics.One particular crowd favourite is the hearty breakfast ensemble of avocado, mentaiko and egg (S$18) from the all-day brunch section — an oldie but goodie.As simple as its composition is, the dish is a well-executed rendition of the ubiquitous breakfast combo.The scrambled eggs are velvety, the avocado creamy, and the ikura (salmon roe) adds a potent touch of umami.If you’re looking for other wholesome brunch options that don’t involve scrambled eggs, Cafe Ren also has options such as the vegetarian-friendly mushroom cheese toastie (S$16) and healthier banana split yoghurt bowl (S$13).Carb-partial diners might be more attracted to options such as the scallop and truffle cold pasta (S$14) and Asian prawn and clam chilli pasta (S$22).A post shared by HungryGoWhere (@hungrygowhere)While the latter is enjoyably rich and jazzed up with juicy prawns, it could do with a bit more emulsification.On the other hand, a more substantial dish that also involves carbs is Cafe Ren’s Hawaiian chicken burger (S$19).Stacked up high with a juicy 24-hour-marinated chicken thigh patty, grilled pineapple and creamy slaw sandwiched between two fluffy charcoal buns, this big-boy burger will satisfy even the hangriest of people.Cafe Ren’s menu has a couple of desserts for those who need some sweets to complete their meal, namely: Artisan gelato and crumble (S$6 for single scoop, S$11 for double), sweet potato cheesecake (S$12) and pistachio lava Kuki (S$10).Fans of the home-based bakery business scene would be familiar with the last item, a signature of Kuki, an online business known for its open-faced lava cookies — this time served with ice cream on the side!For more ideas on what to eat, read our stories on Singapore’s coolest hidden bars and the new Taiwan night-market concept that has been trending.You can book a ride to Cafe Ren in Farrer Park.\xa0681 Race Course Road, 01-305\nNearest MRT station: Farrer Park\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (10am to 7pm)681 Race Course Road, 01-305\nNearest MRT station: Farrer Park\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (10am to 7pm)AuthorEvan started off writing about food on Instagram, before joining outlets such as Buro and Confirm Good to pursue his passion.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/brash-boys-coffee-singapore/:['If you work at One-North or Biopolis and need a breather from your back-to-back meetings or never-ending stream of emails, there’s a cafe right round the corner that promises caffeine and conversations.\xa0\xa0Brash Boys Coffee, located at Neuros building, was started by secondary school friends Leon Tham and Seah Shing Hao, both 25. The cafe is so named because its owners are self-professed to be “quite brash and loud”.\xa0But don’t take that to mean that the duo are unwelcoming.\xa0On the contrary, Brash Boys’ online business profile proudly proclaims that they are the “only coffee spot in Singapore with two clowns here to entertain you”.\xa0Seah explains: “If you walk by sometimes, you’ll see the both of us just playing around — just clowning around when we have nothing much to do.”“We don’t want to take things too seriously,” adds Tham, a third-year business student at the National University of Singapore. “Because in the end, we’re just trying to help people relax. People around here are generally quite stressed about their work.”Growing up, the dynamic duo had always wanted to start a business together. Since Tham had previously worked at several cafes around Singapore, opening a cafe seemed like a given.\xa0They decided upon their current location at Neuros after assessing the clientele and rental. Brash Boys Coffee then opened its doors in November 2022.In Brash Boys Coffee’s vicinity, you’ll notice that there are already a few prominent names in the neighbourhood, such as Little Big Coffee Roasters and Runes just a short walk away.But Tham is unfazed, stating matter-of-factly: “You can’t avoid competition no matter where you go.”\xa0More than half a year on, it appears that the both of them have carved out a niche for themselves brewing up good coffee and entertaining customers with their banter and antics.In fact, aside from building a good rapport with their regulars (some of whom even buy them souvenirs when they travel), Seah has also attracted a small following on TikTok (around 58,000 followers, no less) by doing livestreams almost daily since the cafe opened.\xa0Inspired by German barista Dritan Alsela — who streams himself making coffee after coffee at his busy coffee shop in Dusseldorf — Seah wanted to do the same.A post shared by HungryGoWhere (@hungrygowhere)Alas, the cafe’s first week was quiet. So Seah started interacting with customers since there were no coffees to make.\xa0This clearly worked in their favour. They began attracting customers — from as far as the east side of Singapore — who come by just to try their coffees and say hi.\xa0Seah still does daily livestreams from 10am to 12pm, a quieter time at the cafe. If you tune in, expect to see the boys clowning around, making coffee or just interacting with fellow Tiktokers.\xa0\xa0Jokes aside, Brash Boys doesn’t kid around with strong coffee drinks made with beans from local roaster Tiong Hoe Specialty Coffee — a special ‘Brash’ Colombian and Guatemalan blend with notes of caramel, hazelnut and stonefruit.\xa0Its signature drinks are its iced oat milk latte (S$6.30) and Brash white (S$6.90).\xa0While the former, made with popular local oat milk brand Oatside, is the cafe’s bestselling drink, its star beverages are clearly its Brash white and Brash black (S$5.90).\xa0Both drinks come with frozen cubes of concentrated cold brew as a substitute for your usual ice. This was born out of the duo’s intention to help caffeine fiends in the area “double up” on their coffee.\xa0The cold brew ice cubes also help office workers “drink it throughout the day without the coffee being diluted”.\xa0If you need something to nibble on, the cafe offers a selection of bakes including tarts, cookies, and donuts, both baked in-house and sourced from local bakeries such as Puff and Peaks and Browned Butter Bake House.\xa0We got to try an assortment of its in-house cookies (all priced at S$5.50) and loved the biscoff cheesecake cookie. It had a strong hint of Lotus biscoff spread without being too cloyingly sweet, and had soft cheese in the middle.\xa0The bakes are on a rotating schedule. Tarts are available from Monday to Wednesday; donuts on Thursday. The cookies are available every day.\xa0Both Tham and Seah have grand plans for Brash Boys’ future. They hope to open more outlets locally and even around Southeast Asia.\xa0But for now, these two guys are content with the way things are at their quaint One-North space. According to them, things are definitely “aight”.\xa0For more unique food spots, read our article on hidden bars in Singapore and our island’s first Jamba outlet right from the US.\xa0Book a ride to Brash Boys Coffee.Neuros, 01-12, 8 Biomedical Grove\nNearest MRT station: One-North\nOpen: Monday to Friday (8am to 5pm)Neuros, 01-12, 8 Biomedical Grove\nNearest MRT station: One-North\nOpen: Monday to Friday (8am to 5pm)AuthorSarah is constantly seeking out new coffee spots and cocktail bars around the world, and should probably drink more water while at it.© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/cotelato-dessert-cafe-hillview/:['Joining the fray of popular F&B establishments in Hillview is Cotelato cafe, a whimsical dessert parlour offering decadent sweets that delight both the eyes and soul.\xa0Nestled in the bustling HillV2 shopping mall, it’s the latest concept by Danny Pang, the founder of Spruce restaurant.\xa0The Cotelato dessert cafe is his take on a multi-sensorial dessert joint serving contemporary treats. Boasting luscious cakes inspired by designer handbags and teas with flowers that bloom in a pot, it’s not just pretty bakes for the ’gram — diners can look forward to an interactive dessert experience.Confectioneries are baked in-house with premium ingredients flown in from various parts of the world, including vanilla from Madagascar. Cotelato takes pride in its quality, so you’ll definitely be getting your money’s worth of desserts.The Whimsical Carousel (S$28) impressed us all when it arrived at the table. Touting an assortment of six desserts, this is the chef’s selection of mouthwatering tea cakes and petits gateaux (little cakes).\xa0It is a sight to behold. The cakes are perched on a rotating merry-go-round, complete with music and dazzling lights.\xa0The cake flavours include a double chocolate cake that oozes a rich chocolate ganache, a fluffy chocolate brownie and a carrot cake embedded with grated carrots and crunchy walnuts. For a hands-on experience (or if you’d like to vent a lil’ pent-up anger), don’t sleep on the Break the Blossom series (S$16).It’s a dish unique to Cotelato, as the sweet treat is presented in a chocolate sphere and comes with a hammer. Gently tap on the shell with the hammer to reveal a fluffy cake embellished with a myriad of toppings.\xa0You can get it in two tantalising flavours: Mystic white chocolate and Red Hot chocolate.The Mystic white chocolate is our favourite of the two. Encased in a white chocolate sphere, it comprises a strawberry shortcake adorned with edible flowers and fresh raspberries. It’s just the right amount of sweetness without being too cloying.\xa0A post shared by HungryGoWhere (@hungrygowhere)The Red Hot chocolate version sees a red velvet cake cocooned in a stunning rouge shell. The shortcake is layered with a sweet and tangy cream cheese frosting that keeps us reaching for a second bite.The Pinky Lava (S$16) is a must-order item on Cotelato’s menu if you’re a fan of souffle pancakes (or simply love all things pink).\xa0Glazed with a rich strawberry cream cheese sauce and edible flowers, the dish features moist, oh-so-thicc hotcakes that melt in your mouth. The marriage of sweet berry-infused cream and fluffy hotcakes makes for a sweet and savoury delight. \n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTalad Thai Banana opens at AMK Hub with S$2 opening promotion for the first 100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Feuds: Saizeriya vs Milan Shokudo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatisserie Cle brings its well-crafted pastries to new River Valley flagship for fifth anniversary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother signature dish at Cotelato is The Golden Rosa (S$18), which showcases freshly-made golden crepes crafted into the shape of two roses.\xa0The crepes are layered with caramel sauce, hazelnut praline and French chantilly cream to create a party of flavours in your mouth. It’s also served with a side of orange caramel sauce a la crepes suzette.\xa0It’s then plated with decorative “leaves” and a hazelnut praline sauce to create a work of art. The scene stealers at this Hillview cafe are undoubtedly its designer handbag cakes. Each cake in the Surprise Package (S$48) series is intricately designed to mimic a luxury handbag; it’s perfect for fashionistas and bag lovers alike.On the menu is a lineup of three miniature bags inspired by designer brands, and these are crafted on rotation every two months. Note that limited orders are available daily.If you wish to wow your peers with a larger version of the cakes, feel free to place an advanced order. Pair the desserts at Cotelato with its signature blend coffee (S$9). Meticulously brewed by hand, the Cotelato signature blend utilises 100% arabica beans sourced from Tanzania and Ethiopia. They’re also extracted with a slow-brew technique to obtain the rich, natural flavours of the coffee.Not a fan of coffee?

The cake is not too sweet, too.Sweet bakes aren’t the only options at Rise Bakehouse, though — the menu also comes with a plethora of simple, brunch-appropriate creature comforts such as eggs on toast (S$13.90) and croque madame (S$15.90).One of the recommended signatures is the Rise breakfast (S$15.90), which features a crunchy carb base — a choice of sourdough toast or brown butter waffles — that’s piled on with chicken bratwurst, seasonal fruits and eggs.A post shared by HungryGoWhere (@hungrygowhere)Diners have a choice of a sunny side up or scrambled egg, of which we’d recommend the latter. Its silky smooth texture complements the base carb perfectly.Discerning cafe-hoppers would also know that the brown butter waffles are one of the top crowd-favourites at Rise Bakehouse. They’re available in different permutations that include both sweet and savoury. Those who prefer savoury waffle combinations would be smitten with the honey soy garlic fried chicken (S$16.90) pairing.However, the sweet-toothed would prefer the classic gelato waffles (from S$14.90) and waffles with fresh berries (housemade berry compote, fresh strawberries, blueberries and seasonal berry gelato, S$16.90).For more ideas on what to eat, read our stories on the famous American ice cream brand that’s opening in Singapore and the first local outlet of Hong-Kong-based burger brand, Honbo.Book a ride to Rise Bakehouse’s new TripleOne Somerset flagship outlet.TripleOne Somerset, 01-05, 111 Somerset Road,\nNearest MRT station: Somerset\nOpen: Monday to Thursday (9.30am to 6.30pm), Friday to Sunday (9.30am to 9.30pm)TripleOne Somerset, 01-05, 111 Somerset Road,\nNearest MRT station: Somerset\nOpen: Monday to Thursday (9.30am to 6.30pm), Friday to Sunday (9.30am to 9.30pm)AuthorEvan started off writing about food on Instagram, before joining outlets such as Buro and Confirm Good to pursue his passion.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/nesuto-jewel-singapore/:['New cafe alert: Local Japanese-French patisserie brand Nesuto will be at Jewel soon. The cafe will be opening its second nest at Jewel Changi Airport on July 24.\xa0Beyond an all-new lineup of outlet-exclusive desserts and chocolate bonbons, the popular patisserie’s newest outlet also sports a chic, minimalistic interior.\xa0Nesuto’s name translates to “nest” in Japanese, which embodies the brand’s vision to build an inviting space that inspires return visits — just like a bird coming home to its nest.As part of a recent rebrand, Nesuto has swapped its original bird motif for a new design of an egg resting atop a nest.\xa0Set foot into the 30-seater Nesuto Jewel cafe and you’ll be struck by its carefully designed interior. The store features curved lines and soft textures that mimic the contours of an egg — a playful design choice that pays homage to Nesuto’s origins.\xa0It’s an inviting space that exudes cosiness and warmth, complete with pebble-washed pillars, wooden fittings and textured wall finishes that are meticulously painted by hand.\xa0Every corner is set up to be picture-perfect, so you’ll get amazing pictures for the ’gram no matter where you’re seated at. Alicia Wong is the co-founder and executive pastry chef behind Nesuto’s exquisite cakes. As an expert in marrying flavours and textures, she has doled out artisanal desserts that impress.\xa0For Nesuto’s signature bakes, she draws inspiration from Japanese flavours, courtesy of her regular trips to Japan. Some of these include the yuzu raspberry (S$11.20) and Konichiwa Hojicha (S$11.90) cakes.Wong prides herself on using pure, quality ingredients in her recipes, which allow the flavours to shine.\xa0She also uses traditional French pastry techniques to bring her dream creations to life, such that each handcrafted treat is unique and close to her heart. The Nesuto Jewel outlet-exclusive cakes did not disappoint. There are three new flavours to look forward to on Nesuto Jewel’s menu: Matcha chestnut (S$12.90), whisky chocolate (S$11.90) and chocolate orange (S$11.20).Wong recommends that the cakes be tasted in a three-part manner, alongside different pairings of tea to cleanse your palate.\xa0We start with the cake bearing the lightest of flavours: Matcha chestnut.\xa0It’s a heartwarming creation that draws on Wong’s memory of being in Japan during the winter, sipping on matcha latte while enjoying the scent of roasted chestnuts in the air.\xa0It is an Uji matcha mousse cake featuring a delectable custard base with layers of chestnut mousse and matcha chantilly cream — take a bite into it and you’ll also find chunks of chestnuts. A post shared by HungryGoWhere (@hungrygowhere)We found that the sencha tea (S$6) paired wonderfully with the matcha chestnut. It has a delicate aroma that is incredibly refreshing and elevates the earthy notes of the cake. Boy, is the whisky chocolate cake going to be a huge hit with the crowd. (It’s our personal favourite!)It’s an addictive dessert that sees a medley of chocolate, whisky and a lil’ cinnamon spice.\xa0The cake is crowned with blond Orelys 35% chocolate mousse and is infused with a dash of whisky for added depth and smokiness. It is then layered with a Jivara 40% cremeux chocolate that is enhanced with crunchy cacao nibs and subtle hints of cinnamon.The whisky chocolate is best accompanied by hojicha tea (S$6), which has a slight sweetness and roasted flavour that goes well with the nuttiness of the cake. It doesn’t overpower the flavours of the cake either, but refreshes your palate enough to keep you reaching for a second bite of cake.\xa0\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHawker Hustlers: Hipster hawker Ray Yeo of Bei-Ing Dimsum Club on reinventing dim sum and his love for all things Japan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Feuds: Saizeriya vs Milan Shokudo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatisserie Cle brings its well-crafted pastries to new River Valley flagship for fifth anniversary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe chocolate orange cake is an acquired taste for sure. Besides boasting rich and luscious dark chocolate, the dessert is also infused with a tangy orange essence.\xa0We hear that some customers find the orange compote a tad off-putting in contrast to the indulgent dark chocolate ganache, but we think that both ingredients balance each other out well.This is because the citrusy sweetness complements the bitterness of the dark chocolate, so every bite promises a party of vibrant flavours in your mouth.The tangerine oolong tea (S$6) is the perfect pairing to the chocolate orange cake. It has a bold flavour profile with subtle bursts of tangerine notes. It cuts through the richness of the chocolate and brings out the lighter, citrusy flavours of the cake. As part of its opening launch, Nesuto Jewel is introducing an array of mouthwatering chocolate bonbons. Made from chocolates that are sustainably and ethically sourced, diners can expect six imaginative flavour combinations.\xa0Expect one-of-a-kind creations such as earl grey and bergamot, smoked dark chocolate and caramel and sesame rum.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/mcdonalds-nasi-lemak-burger/:['Most Singaporeans would probably remember McDonald’s nasi lemak burger that was originally launched in 2017 to much public fanfare.Good news for fans: The insanely viral special is back again, from July 27, just in time for National Day!The McDonald’s nasi lemak burger (from S$8.30 ala carte, from S$9.30 for an Extra Value Meal) is returning as part of McDonald’s special National Day line-up, which also includes a brand new drink.However, this incarnation of the local-inspired classic comes with a few tweaks that differentiate it from the original.For one, McDonald’s has turned up the heat in this version of the nasi lemak burger. Contained within is an ikan-bilis-infused sambal chilli sauce that comes packed with more spice and umami and is not as sweet as the original.There is also a modified crispy chicken patty that’s imbued with mixed spices and coconut flavours to make it more akin to the time-honoured local dish it draws inspiration from.A post shared by HungryGoWhere (@hungrygowhere)McDonald’s is also offering a bundle deal: The nasi lemak burger feast (from S$11.50).Customers will get to indulge in the oh-so-sedap (tasty) burger, together with a side of potato wedges (from S$4.50 for ala carte) and a decadent Cocoa-nut Pie (from S$1.70 for a la carte). \n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tried and rated 30 stalls selling nasi lemak in Singapore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMcDonald’s x New Jeans: Limited-time sweet & spicy McCrispy, Korean fried chicken style\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10 Suntec City dinner spots for every budget\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the set comes with a small Coca-Cola Zero Sugar by default, you can upgrade it (from S$1.90) to include the brand-new bandung Frappe instead.\xa0Featuring a creamy rose syrup base, this new concoction works great as a nostalgic, locally-inspired companion to the burger.The bandung Frappe will also be available a la carte from S$4.75 for a small and S$4.95 for a medium.The nasi lemak burger, bandung Frappe and potato wedges are available from July 27 onwards, after breakfast hours for both dine-in or takeaway.The Cocoa-nut pie, which has been in-stores since June, will also continue to be on the menu.They will be available at all McDonald’s restaurants, Drive-Thrus, as well as through McDelivery and various delivery platforms for a limited time only, while stocks last.Hungry for more unique McDonald’s eats?

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/singapore-food-festival-2023-must-eats/:['Foodies in Singapore, it’s time to get excited, because the Singapore Food Festival (SFF) 2023 is back again this year from July 19 to 30 at the Bayfront Event Space.\xa0The festival, which turns 30 this year, celebrates Singapore’s food culture — past, present and future — and will showcase the best of our local F&B scene.\xa0Expect to enjoy treats from more than 100 brands spread across different zones: SG Food Walk, Food Cartel, Sweets Alley, Cafe Boulevard, SG Mama Shop and Gourmet Market.If you find yourself wandering around the expansive festival space with no idea where to start, why not go with our take on the top 10 unique dishes to try at the Singapore Food Festival 2023?Oh, and remember to have your cards or digital payments ready on your phones as the event is cashless.\xa0\xa0Widely popular minimalist brunch cafe Syip started because its founders wanted to create a space for people to sip (or syip) and dine. The name also bears resemblance to the names of the sisters, Sandee Yip and Sara Yip, who founded the cafe.Both of its outlets at Bendemeer and Farrer Park attract long queues, so if you’ve been wanting to pop down but haven’t had a chance, the festival would be a perfect chance to do so.\xa0Try its ondeh ondeh French toast (S$12), an SFF-exclusive offering, and sip, or syip, on its kaya cloud drink (S$8), which combines gula melaka, pandan, oat milk and coconut cream.Fans of the brand, don’t worry, you’ll also get to try its bestselling items such as the creamy chicken scrambled egg croissant (S$12) and mushroom fritters (S$8) at its stall. A post shared by HungryGoWhere (@hungrygowhere)This noodle store at Amoy Street Food Centre may be new to the scene, but Chun Feng Man Mian’s elevated take on the humble bowl of wonton mee (think truffle powder, fish roe and Iberico pork) has quite a fervent following.\xa0Building on its well-loved menu items, Chun Feng Man Mian is introducing iberico char siu and wagyu duo noodles (S$15) exclusively at the event.\xa0Those familiar with the stall would have tried its well-seasoned iberico char siu, which we hear uses an oolong tea marinade, and spicy wagyu separately, but why choose when you can have both at the same time?\xa0Known for its meticulously crafted artisanal bakes, La Levain is no stranger to melding flavours from all over the world. Co-founder and executive chef Wythe Ng has rolled out intriguing bakes, such as bobo chacha croissants and bacon edamame danish, that combine Asian flavours with traditional European pastries.For SFF 2023, Ng is serving up a nasi lemak pizza (S$13 for a half pizza, S$19 for a whole), topped with cucumber slices, eggs, ikan billis and peanuts, over a sourdough base.\xa0There’s a bit of everything that you love about nasi lemak spread out over the whole pizza, topped with a generous serving of cheese. Perfect for those of us who love bread, cheese AND nasi lemak.\xa0\xa0Hold up, we know what you might be thinking — doesn’t Elemen serve up meatless cuisine? Founded in 2015, Elemen has been offering natural, high-quality meatless dishes to diners from its five outlets located across Singapore.At this year’s SFF, the brand will be presenting its very own rendition of braised “duck” rice (S$10).\xa0The duck slices are made of king oyster mushrooms and the dish will come with braised peanuts, cucumber slices and the quintessential sambal. It’s so well-flavoured and tender that you might even forget you’re having a meatless dish!\xa0\xa0Located within the Proper Grub Hub at the festival’s Food Cartel section, the hub sees a collective of six trailblazing restaurant and bar concepts by Proper Concepts, the parent company behind popular brands Rappu and Mish Mash.\xa0One of the brands is Ms Maria and Mr Singh, a Mexican-Indian restaurant by famed Bangkok chef Gaggan Anand. The casual eatery, which opened to much fanfare in Singapore last year, has sharing plates and tacos on its menu.\xa0It is serving up a festival-exclusive chicken tikka taco (S$16 for a pair), a taco flavour not yet seen in its restaurant, though a standalone chicken tikka masala dish does exist. Its spice levels left us reaching for a drink, so grab a cocktail or two from its sister brands The Feather Blade or Goho while you’re at the hub.\xa0\xa0Fan Bao Bao, which literally translates to rice baby, is a new pop-up brand by the brains behind Beastro Collective. True to its name, its signature dish marries two popular carb favourites — burgers and rice — while adopting local flavours like nasi lemak, claypot rice and Hakka thunder tea rice.\xa0If you love claypot rice, then give its SFF-exclusive chicken claypot rice burger (S$16) a go. The burgers’ rice patties come with bits of salted fish and chinese sausage commonly found in the claypot rice dish, while its chicken patty is seasoned just like the chicken pieces you’ll find in the same dish.\xa0If claypot rice isn’t quite your thing, there are also other rice burger flavours such as nasi lemak (S$16), Hakka lei cha (S$16) and even a mango sticky rice burger (S$12). All burgers come with coleslaw and fries, except for the mango sticky rice burger.\xa0\xa0Chen Fu Ji’s fried rice has a decorated history, originating from the outskirts of Singapore’s Chinatown in the 1960s. Its current owner Roger Koh shuttered the brand in 2016 but brought it back in 2021, promising to retain quality control on its signature dishes.The restaurant is well-known for its crab meat fried rice, so you can be sure that its SFF-exclusive rendition, the ultimate sake fried rice (S$30), will be an absolute show-stopper. Chen Fu Ji combines century egg yolk and sake to concoct an umami-laden sauce for the fried rice, elevating the dish on all fronts.In case you need more convincing (which you shouldn’t), the recipe for this dish topped the International Fried Rice competition, a large-scale event organised by Chen Fu Ji back in 2001.\xa0\xa0Halal Indonesian restaurant Rumah Makan Minang has been serving reasonably priced Minangkabau cuisine since 1954 in the vicinity of Sultan Mosque. The restaurant specialises in nasi padang and beef rendang, and it has managed to retain its traditional recipes up till this day.\xa0For SFF, the team has come up with a variety of dishes, but the one must-try is its padang-style beef burrito (S$14), which combines its classic nasi padang dish with the convenience of the well-loved Mexican burrito. Have the best of both Indonesian and Mexican flavours within this power-packed wrap.\xa0Chef Damian D’Silva has been making waves in Singapore for decades with his heritage dishes, and most recently at his restaurant Rempapa in Paya Lebar. The term ‘rempapa’ comes from the Malay word ‘rempah’ for spice paste and also pays homage to D’Silva’s role as the grandfather of heritage cuisine in Singapore.At Rempapa, D’Silva builds on traditional recipes, refreshing the recipes by imbuing them with elements from different ethnic groups to appeal to the modern diner.\xa0One such example is the pita pockets that it’ll be serving up at SFF. We love its classic Rempapa ayam bakar pita pocket (S$12), which comes with grilled chicken thigh, mayonnaise, pickled cucumber and chives.\xa0But if you want something truly unique to the festival, try its chilli no carne cruffin (S$15), a croissant-muffin with Impossible ground meat chilli con carne-style.\xa0\xa0Pilot Kitchen is a hole-in-the-wall restaurant located within the unassuming Havelock II building, right next to Clarke Quay MRT station. The restaurant only opened in late 2022, but it has already built a reputation for serving up inventive sharing plates using uncomplicated ingredients and the freshest seafood.\xa0The ‘pilot’ in its name refers to how the team experiments with ideas and charts new grounds in the culinary plane, akin to a pilot project. You’ll find that its dishes don’t quite have a particular cuisine tagged to them.\xa0Take its signature gunpowder short ribs (S$38) it’ll be serving at the festival, for example. It is marinated with Indian gunpowder spice (made of lentils, sesame seeds, chilli, cumin, and coriander among other spices) and served alongside a Greek tzatziki dip of yogurt and cucumber, with padron peppers on the side. You’ll have to try it for yourself at SFF to see if this eclectic mix works.\xa0\xa0For more ideas on what to eat, read our stories on atas food places you can order from and our ultimate Orchard food guide.\xa0\xa0This article was written in partnership with Singapore Food Festival.Syip, La Levain, Elemen, Chen Fu Ji and Rempapa can be found on GrabFood Dine-in.\xa0You can also book a ride to the Singapore Food Festival 2023.AuthorSarah is constantly seeking out new coffee spots and cocktail bars around the world, and should probably drink more water while at it.© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/swirlgo-omakase-gelato-lab/:['Have you ever had a wild ice-cream flavour idea that you swear would be amazing, but just can’t find a cafe that’s genius enough to attempt it?Well, if you’re an ice-cream lover who’s grown bored of the usual gelato-and-waffles combo, the new SwirlGo omakase lab at Orchard’s Wisma Atria shopping centre is a must-visit.Unlike your usual soft-serve ice-cream machines, SwirlGo uses a proprietary tech developed by its 33-year-old owner Jeremy Tan.What sets it apart from other ice-cream tech that’s already on the market? It’s designed with an elegant and mess-free capsule system, a la Nespresso.\xa0SwirlGo’s streamlined process allows for countless ice-cream types. By contrast, dedicated machines are usually needed for individual flavours.Above all, it’s the mix-in capabilities where the tech shines — it allows SwirlGo to easily incorporate an assortment of toppings, which, in turn, allows for a myriad of unique textural combinations.Ordering your own dream ice cream at SwirlGo is a straightforward and painless process.\xa0The experience begins with an order chit that lists all the ingredients and flavours that you can go crazy with.You are given the option of a Single (1 base, 1 mix-in, 1 topping, 1 drizzle, S$6.90) or Combo (1 base, 2 mix-ins, 3 toppings, 1 drizzle), and for it to be served in a cup or charcoal cone (+S$1).Following that, you’ll be selecting from 10 flavour bases, which include vanilla, cream cheese (+S$1), salted caramel, gula melaka, rock melon, black sesame and honey frozen yoghurt (+S$1).That’s right — despite SwirlGo’s name, you can get also get soft-serve made not just from gelato, but from sorbet and yoghurt.SwirlGo also gives you a whopping 32 mix-in items to play with — so you can unleash your creativity, and modify the texture and profile however you please.SwirlGo’s toppings range from the most timeless favourites, such as Oreo, speculoos (caramelised biscuits) and Ferrero Rocher (+S$1.50), to those meant only for the adventurous, such as D24 durian (+50 cents), mala potato chips and its signature Lao Gan Ma chilli oil. Yes, you can have your Lao Gan Ma ice cream and eat it.\xa0Besides these, you can even decide to spice up your ice-cream amalgams with all manner of pastries, including butter croissant (+S$2.50) and mini apple butter turnover (+S$2.50)A post shared by HungryGoWhere (@hungrygowhere)The SwirlGo omakase lab has even added in some quirky local-inspired treats, such as nyonya kueh (+S$2.50), blue pea sticky rice (+S$2.50) and tang yuan (glutinous rice balls, +S$2.50).Then you end off with your preferred toppings — chosen from a narrower selection of the 32 mix-in items — plus a choice of drizzle, with options including butterscotch and white chocolate.That said, making your own dream ice cream can be hard, especially with the overwhelming number of options on offer. In that case, you can opt for SwirlGo’s special omakase (S$12.90) creations.SwirlGo’s omakase set will feature an ice cream, as well as a side of pastry to go with it. It’s almost like a bespoke cocktail experience, where the friendly staff will ask for your taste profile and tailor their creations to suit it.The result will depend on whether you’re looking for something sweet, refreshing or adventurous. But rest assured, the combinations aren’t decided on a whim — SwirlGo has a trained chef who comes up with the recipes.For an easy start, the Birthday Cake or Rock Melon off SwirlGo’s menu are easy choices that can be enjoyed by almost anyone.\xa0The Rock Melon is a refreshing medley of rock melon soft-serve adorned with chunks of watermelon and pandan sago — a perfect combination for the scorching weather.If you want something really, really special, then don’t miss out on the unique burrata or SwirlGo’s iconic Lao Gan Ma creation. While both sound like cheesy novelties, the burrata is the cheesier of the two — literally.\xa0The lightly savoury creation is made with a mildly tangy cream-cheese base that’s enlivened with touches of dried basil, balsamic vinegar, sundried tomato, olive oil, and finished with freshly grated parmesan.As it turns out, it’s really not that weird. It reminds you of a savoury cheesecake and is quite different from other types of burrata ice cream we’ve had elsewhere.For more ideas on where to feed your “dessert stomach”, check out our stories on the best traditional dessert spots and where to find the best healthy desserts in Singapore.Book a ride to the new SwirlGo Omakase Gelato Lab in Wisma Atria mall.Wisma Atria, B1-04, 435 Orchard Road\xa0\nNearest MRT station: Orchard\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (11am to 10pm)Wisma Atria, B1-04, 435 Orchard Road\xa0\nNearest MRT station: Orchard\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (11am to 10pm)AuthorEvan started off writing about food on Instagram, before joining outlets such as Buro and Confirm Good to pursue his passion.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/joo-chiat-oyster-house/:['We are no stranger to the plethora of ’gram-worthy cafes that continue to set up shop on our sunny island ever so often.Joo Chiat Oyster House is one such establishment, with a trendy zip code, intimate vibes and lush bites that make your mouth water.Despite being the new kid on the block, however, this particular concept has already garnered a reputation for itself. After all, it’s the latest venture by the folks behind Kings Cart Coffee, who are known for their creative concoctions and delectable brunch fare. Joo Chiat Oyster House marks the team’s first foray into the restaurant scene with a non-coffee concept.\xa0This time, they’ve brought to life a one-stop shop for oyster lovers and cocktail enthusiasts.Besides creamy smooth oysters that are sure to convert even non-believers, Joo Chiat Oyster House also serves up good ol’ booze that draws inspiration from Singaporean flavours and culture.Joo Chiat Oyster House is nestled in a particularly hip spot within the heart of Katong —\xa0 a stone’s throw away from the famed Peranakan shophouses that draw many tourists — along with a row of popular restaurants and bistros.Read about Cheeky BeeHoon, a new specialty beehoon spot in Katong.You won’t miss it either. The eatery stands out, thanks to its vibrant, neon red signage.\xa0But this place isn’t just your ordinary bar, for it comes with a special twist. It appears to be a quaint, cosy cafe by day, but come evening, the space transforms into a groovy bar, enlivened with reddish hues and funky music beats.Joo Chiat Oyster House’s menu touts an array of tantalising bites and mains, but the star of the show is undoubtedly the flavoured oysters that are topped with chimichurri, ikura, red wine mignon, and yuzu foam (from S$3.30, minimum order of two pieces per flavour).\xa0Oysters are specially flown in from Hyogo prefecture in Japan every week, so you can expect premium shellfish, top-tier freshness and the utmost creaminess. The oysters with chimichurri flavouring are our top pick, as the herbaceous dressing adds hints of zest and garlic to the juicy oysters. If you’re not a fan of raw oysters, there are also baked oysters (from S$4.30, minimum order of two pieces per flavour). This range comes in four selections: Mentaiko, miso butter, garlic chilli and an option to have it baked in cheese.\xa0You’ll have a tough time deciding which flavour to go for, though.\xa0We loved the mentaiko-baked oysters; its savoury mentaiko sauce is packed with sheer umami goodness and this in turn elevates the briny taste of the shellfish.\xa0You’re in for a flamin’ good show, too, as the oysters are torched tableside for that extra razzle and dazzle. For the main course, there’s the portobello aglio olio (S$21). Tossed with portobello mushrooms, cherry tomatoes and white wine, the aglio olio is adorned with parmesan for an addictive nuttiness and richness. Be warned: The pasta is peppered with chilli flakes and packs a fiery punch.A post shared by HungryGoWhere (@hungrygowhere)One nod to our local cuisine is the chilli crab mantou (S$16), which is a winner in our books. It’s creamy, sweet, yet savoury and pairs impeccably well with the fried, fluffy mantou buns. Though simple, it’s a dish that is executed well and one that we would order again. Other tapas dishes include the Blur Like Sotong fritters (S$14). This features delish fried calamari that is not only crispy, but also accompanied by a housemade kaffir lime mayo. The squid is incredibly tender and succulent — just the way we like it.\xa0Note that the portion is huge, so we recommend sharing this dish with friends.There is also the picture-perfect tako romesco (S$14), which sees a cured octopus leg cooked in a thick romesco sauce, and then embellished with charred capsicums and pistachio nuts.\xa0While the dish is definitely one for the ’gram, we do think it can benefit from more varied textures and crunch.Our favourite part of the night is undoubtedly the cocktails, which are heavily inspired by Singaporean culture.\xa0The highlight of the drink menu is the Solero (S$20), which pays homage to our childhood favourite lime ice cream.It is a familiar, comforting treat that is wonderfully replicated in this rum-based cocktail. It features a fluffy cloud of tart lime sorbet cream, which marries well with the sweet rum. Looks are absolutely deceiving with this mild-looking drink: Every sip packs a strong boozy punch.Aunty Rosalyn (S$22) is a vodka-based delight that is inspired by Peranakan culture and its timeless classic flavours.\xa0Mixed with herbs such as lemongrass and galangal, the drink is a playful homage to a real-life matriarch of the same name.It encapsulates her feisty and flamboyant personality, for this deceptively demure and simple-looking cocktail is chock-full of spice and aromatics, and packs quite the punch.Joo Chiat Oyster House also has a plan for the East Coast: The East Coast Plan (S$22).\xa0The cocktail is a combination of Hendrick’s gin, fresh mint, lime and prosecco. Each sip is a burst of refreshing flavour in your mouth, making it the perfect starter for every meal.If you’re not one for alcoholic drinks, the coolers are equally worth a try.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/cafe-margaret-singapore/:['Just returned from holidays and having withdrawals from Seoul’s quaint cafes and pretty bakes?\xa0We’ve got just the remedy for you: Cafe Margaret’s first Singapore outlet.If you haven’t heard, the popular Seoul dessert cafe has just opened its first outpost outside of South Korea.Cafe Margaret originates from Yeonnamdong in Seoul, near the popular Hongdae district, and is known for its pastries — the unique cube pies in particular.Many cafe-hoppers also flock to the Insta-worthy cafe to get their OOTDs in.The cafe is set within a cosy two-storey house that’s charmingly decorated with rustic touches, and even boasts a picturesque front porch view.Cafe Margaret Singapore follows the same blueprint; you’ll find it nestled inside a homely little two-storey shophouse at Bugis.Most cafe lovers would be familiar with this Bali Lane unit — it was the spot formerly occupied by the iconic Brotherbird Coffeehouse, which closed in Dec 2022.Now decked out in whimsical trinkets, vintage frames and wooden shelves, the Bugis shophouse sports the same homely vibe as Cafe Margaret’s flagship store in Seoul.The first storey is laid out more like a cottage living room, with its confectioneries displayed among odds-and-ends, tchotchkes and more. It’s laid out in the open for self-service, though, so be prepared to help yourselves.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTalad Thai Banana opens at AMK Hub with S$2 opening promotion for the first 100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, head upstairs for seats galore. All the dining happens here, amid an array of chicly worn-out furniture, reminiscent of a rustic cottage from your childhood fairy tales.While the menu isn’t as extensive, guests will still be treated to a variety of Cafe Margaret classics at the Singapore outlet, including its signature cube pie.Despite the name, though, the cube pie isn’t really a pie. Instead, it is more similar to a cubed croissant, not unlike the circular croissant rolls that were trending in Singapore last year.It features a flaky, 72-layer exterior of laminated pastry that breaks open to reveal a glut of various fillings.A post shared by HungryGoWhere (@hungrygowhere)They are available in flavours such as matcha cream (S$8.30), lotus cream (S$8.30) and real vanilla (S$7.80).But those craving a more nostalgic taste of Korea should get the injeolmi (S$8.30), which comes dusted in soy bean powder and is absolutely loaded with fragrant cream.Other than the picturesque cubes, another popular item at Cafe Margaret is its cookies.Unlike your usual run-of-the-mill cookies, they come in a myriad of unique flavours such as red velvet cheesecake ($5.10) and black chocolate strawberry ($4.90).There will also be exclusives to Cafe Margaret’s Singapore outlet — juicy lemon (S$7.50) and raspberry (S$7.50) pound cakes.Moist, spongy and extra tangy, these are the perfect complement to the other bakes, which tend towards heavier, more intense flavours.There are also an assortment of drinks available on Cafe Margaret’s menu but the matcha latte (S$7.50) we had was slightly too cloying for us.For more ideas on what to eat, read our stories on the best food gems in Jurong East and the swankiest new oyster bar in town.You can also book a ride to Cafe Margaret in Bugis. 32 Bali Lane\nNearest MRT station: Bugis\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (10am to 8pm)32 Bali Lane\nNearest MRT station: Bugis\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (10am to 8pm)AuthorEvan started off writing about food on Instagram, before joining outlets such as Buro and Confirm Good to pursue his passion.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/fico-east-coast-singapore/:['New restaurant alert: Service at East Coast Park’s Fico, probably one of the most anticipated new restaurant openings in Singapore this year, is officially in full swing.Why the hype, you ask?\xa0One of the main reasons is its location — Fico is housed in a cottage nestled just at the edge of the East Coast Park shoreline. The building, gorgeously clad in soothing whites and warm earthy tones, seems to transport you to the idyllic southern Italian coastline.Its main dining room is a homey affair that’s supplemented with a semi-open kitchen. Meanwhile, the airy al fresco area lets diners revel in the sea breeze while indulging in a spectacular waterfront vista.Another reason for the fanfare? The names attached to the project.\xa0The picturesque seaside restaurant is the latest concept by the Lo & Behold Group, the mastermind behind other lauded establishments including the three-Michelin-starred Odette and The Coconut Club.The casual Italian restaurant is also helmed by chef-partner Mirko Febbrile, who had a hand in delivering Michelin-star glory to Braci, a modern-Italian outfit at Boat Quay.Discerning foodies might also be familiar with Febbrile in a different setting — the hawker centre.\xa0In August 2022, he teamed up with chef-owner Clarence Chooi of the now-defunct Nudedles.4 for a pasta pop-up at its Chinatown Complex location.\xa0Needless to say, the collaboration turned out to be a roaring success and commanded snaking queues that would start forming hours before the stall even opened.It’s only natural that all eyes are on his latest venture.\xa0Febbrile’s Fico is a concept that’s close to his heart — it takes inspiration from his native Puglia, a culture-rich coastal region located in the south of Italy.A post shared by HungryGoWhere (@hungrygowhere)Fico’s menu is produce-centred and heavily features fresh seafood and vegetables, which are staples in the region’s cuisine.To start, we were presented with the Fico seafood platter (S$98), which was loaded up with a bounty of delightfully luscious and fresh fine de claire oysters, red prawns and scampis. A perfect introduction to whet the appetite.The rest of the small plates are rustic and simple, featuring many timeless Italian flavors such as the charred red peppers (served with Cantabrico anchovies, capers, and extra virgin olive oil, S$18) and earthy cardoncelli (king trumpet) mushrooms (S$21).If you are partial to dairy or that IG-worthy moment for your feed, you will also enjoy the spectacle of velvety gushing cheese as you slice into the pancetta-encrusted exterior of the umami Tomino cheese (S$22).While classic-style pizzas don’t earn a spot on Fico’s menu, the focaccina (from S$18) — a focaccia-pizza hybrid — is a more than adequate stand-in. With Febbrile’s recipe — crafted meticulously with 80% semolina dough — this dish enthrals with an immaculate mix of airiness and crunch.The focaccina are nine inches in size and are available in three permutations. However, it was the tried-and-true ensemble of San Marzano tomatoes (S$22) that won the most hearts with its hearty combination of tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, basil, and extra virgin olive oil.Fico at East Coast is also an opportune place to try the Italian chef’s highly-raved handmade pasta if you couldn’t stomach the queues at last year’s pop-up — its fresh pasta section features six items.The viridescent denti del drago (served with white ragu, S$25) is a fine choice for those who prefer their carbs with a helping of meat. On the other hand, the burnt wheat balanzoni (stuffed tortellini-like pasta, S$23) will satisfy those who enjoy a little textural interplay in their pasta.Fans of the classics should make a beeline for the spaghetti cacio e pepe (S$26), a pasta dish served tableside with sauce freshly emulsified from a wheel of pecorino cheese.As a fan of the classic, heavy-handed Roman iteration of the dish, I was thoroughly delighted by the pasta’s cheese-forward profile and peppery punch — though Fico’s take is a tad more elegant and nuanced.If you still have spare room in your stomach, Fico’s menu also provides a few heftier mains options such as a moreish charcoal-grilled baby octopus (S$34) and tender grilled pork collar (S$38).To cap off the feast with a glorious heap of impeccably pink-centered bone-in ribeye steak, meat fanatics in bigger parties can also consider the beef costata (1 to 1.2kg, S$178).That said, here’s a tip: Save more space for desserts, even beyond what your second “dessert stomach” allows.\xa0Dessert (S$14 for a choice of two, top-up S$5 for every extra item) here is a fun experience — a dessert trolley is wheeled over to your table. Choose from an assortment of sweets, including tarts and pies.It’s natural to feel like a child in a candy shop with so many alluring options up close. But one definite must-try is Fico’s refreshing take on the classic cannoli (cream-filled pastry), piped up right before your eyes.Besides the trolley selection, Fico also has intriguing ice-cream options, including the unique burrata gelato, a chilly and creamy treat that is doused in strawberry and tomato jam, then enlivened with a splash of aromatic extra virgin olive oil. This was a hosted tasting.For more ideas on what to eat, check out our stories on an affordable halal pasta bar by an ex-fine-dining chef and the popular Keong Saik Bakery’s recent relocation.Book a ride to Fico at East Coast Park.Next to East Coast Park Carpark F, 1300 East Coast Parkway\xa0\nOpen: Tuesday to Thursday (5.30pm to 10.30pm), Friday to Sunday (11.30am to 3pm, 5.30pm to 10.30pm)Next to East Coast Park Carpark F, 1300 East Coast Parkway\xa0\nOpen: Tuesday to Thursday (5.30pm to 10.30pm), Friday to Sunday (11.30am to 3pm, 5.30pm to 10.30pm)AuthorEvan started off writing about food on Instagram, before joining outlets such as Buro and Confirm Good to pursue his passion.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/ume-san-100/:['If you’re on the lookout for quirky hidden bars in Singapore, here’s a new one you shouldn’t miss: Ume San 100, a speakeasy hidden behind a row of Japanese vending machines.Located at Fortune Centre, Ume San 100 boasts the largest selection of umeshu in Singapore, sourced exclusively from Wakayama. It is the birthplace of the beloved Japanese liqueur.\xa0On its facade, you’ll be greeted by vending machines carrying a litany of items such as liquor, magazines, and… condoms.\xa0We all know what you’re thinking — yes, Ume San 100’s unique entrance is perfect for those OOTDs.Once you’re done with your photos, a gentle push on the “condom vending machine” (none of the vending machines are operational) in the middle will reveal a clandestine bar space situated just behind it, done up in a way reminiscent of authentic Japanese izakayas.This means a laidback ambience underscored by rustic wooden fixtures, high stools, retro flag banners, and vintage posters.Complementing the umeshu experience, Ume San 100’s menu also offers a delectable array of Japanese food and bar snacks.If you’re not sure what to try, the bar’s signature Umesan Nachi Pagoda (S$20) is a good, safe option. It is an assortment of four seafood–focused sides — such as luscious lobster salad and numbing mala clams — paired with a stack of crunchy, fried gyoza skin.To sweeten the deal, Ume San 100 is also running a special deal through June where customers can get the signature Pagoda dish at 50% off.Other popular bar bites include the garlic chicken karaage (S$16), made extra addictive with a heap of fried garlic, and The Uni is the Bomb! (S$14 for two pieces) that’s essentially a croquette that splits open to release a deluge of creamy uni-flavoured filling.There are also mains available on Ume San 100’s menu in case you find your tummy growling before the drinks arrive.One crowd favourite was the Angry asari soup ramen (S$16), a clean but hearty indulgence served with a smattering of asari (Manila) clams drenched in a rich asari white miso and pork bone broth.A post shared by HungryGoWhere (@hungrygowhere)Alternatively, the Wagyu is the New Black chahan (S$22) is a solid option for those who can’t live without rice. You just can’t beat the simple pleasures of smoky charcoal rice topped with wagyu beef cubes and tobiko (flying fish roe).Food aside, Ume San 100’s strength undoubtedly lies in its esoteric range of tipples. Highball fans, in particular, are in luck — there’s a staggering choice of 24 different highball permutations on the menu.These vary from the timeless Suntory Kakubin highball (from S$14) and classic ume highball (S$14), to more\xa0luxe offerings such as the Hakushu highball (S$26) and Yamazaki highball (S$28), which use premium whisky as their base.However, for those on the hunt for something new, we strongly recommend diving into Ume San 100’s umeshu (plum wine) collection.Aptly named the Umeshu Bible, the speciality menu comprises everything from no-frills classic umeshu to dessert variants. Think strawberry milk (S$16 per glass, S$78 for bottle) and matcha latte (S$12 per glass, S$58 for bottle).Cocktail fans can also access a specially designed menu with a myriad of original concoctions based on the classics. If you’re looking to feed your cameras, then the striking blue-hued Sea Garden (S$22) is a must-get.This was a hosted tasting.For more new cafe openings, read our stories on the relocation of Keong Saik Bakery and the first local outpost of the popular Mister Donut.Book a ride to Ume San 100.Fortune Centre, 02-07, 190 Middle Road\nNearest MRT station: Rochor and Bugis\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (5pm to 11pm)Fortune Centre, 02-07, 190 Middle Road\nNearest MRT station: Rochor and Bugis\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (5pm to 11pm)AuthorEvan started off writing about food on Instagram, before joining outlets such as Buro and Confirm Good to pursue his passion.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/2kulguyz-italian-inspired/:['Most pasta aficionados would know how expensive the beloved Italian staple can be in Singapore. If you’re looking for a wallet-friendly option, there’s a new joint you ought to check out — 2KulGuyz at One-North.In case you are wondering, 2KulGuyz isn’t just a quirky stylistic choice. According to the team, “kul” is the Arabic word for “eat”. Opened in late March, this 100% Muslim-owned concept is headed by a group that includes chef-owner Sazali Ahmad, who was head chef at Pezzo Group and corporate chef at The Black Hole Group.If The Black Hole Group sounds familiar, that’s because it’s the group behind not only the Tipo brand, but other well-known casual-dining concepts such as The Great Mischief and Working Title.Compared with trendier pasta bars, 2KulGuyz’s main charm is in how it eschewed glitzy modern aesthetics, instead setting up a cosy space where customers can feel at home — similar to how the best authentic trattorias are fashioned.Its brand of fusion pasta is comforting and homely, but there’s substance. Instead of the gimmicky laksa or salted-egg sauces you’ll often find at fusion-pasta cafes, the creations at 2KulGuyz are rooted in sound Italian-inspired flavours.All the pasta is handmade in-house and dried, and comes in a myriad of striking shapes and colours, ranging from blue pea mafalde to black pepper & lime spaghetti.Chef Sazali has worked at fine-dining establishments such as Italy’s famous Cova Pasticceria-Confetteria Singapore and even worked closely with Michelin-starred chef Michele Sorrentino.The lunch and dinner experience at 2KulGuyz will be slightly different. Lunch is touch-and-go and everything is served in convenient takeaway bowls, while dinner is slower-paced and leans towards restaurant service.The selection of sides and snacks — which differ at lunch and dinner — is a mishmash of simple and hearty soups, salads, finger food, and Italian appetisers with a bit of a fusion twist.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/tinto-singapore/:['Mention Spanish food, and paella comes to the top of mind.\xa0Fewer folks might know that paella hails from the southeastern coast of Spain, in the port city of Valencia, and I’d wager a guess that only a smaller set might have heard of another dish from the same hometown: Fideua.Chef-owner Daniel Chavez and head chef Tamara Chavez are hoping to change that by bringing fideua to the fore in their newest concept, Tinto, a spanish restaurant at Dempsey.Fideua is simply described as “paella, but made with noodles”. It’s cooked the same way as paella, but instead of rice, short spaghetti-like pasta called fideos is used.Tinto — a name that was inspired by the Spanish word for red wine, vino tinto — is the husband-and-wife pair’s second restaurant in Dempsey. They have another concept, Canchita Peruvian Cuisine, just a stone’s throw away. Chef Daniel Chavez was also the brains behind the now-defunct Ola Cocina del Mar and Tono Cevicheria.This is their first Spanish restaurant, and with it, they are bringing Valencia’s flavours to Dempsey Hill. You can expect seafood-forward dishes as well as Valencia’s much loved exports, the paella and fideua.It’s quite clear the pair wish to pay homage to the birthplace of both dishes, as Tinto’s menu has nine variations to choose from.Although there is an abundance of Spanish restaurants in Singapore, Tinto stands out for its focus on Valencian cuisine. Its menu is lively, spirited and moreish.\xa0A full vegetarian menu is also available, indicating the eatery’s commitment to welcoming diners of all preferences and appetites.The dressed-up interiors of the restaurant make it a Dempsey destination suited for special occasions and celebrations.A post shared by HungryGoWhere (@hungrygowhere)They say don’t fill up on the bread — we say, well, good luck with that. A basket of warm bread hits the table as soon as you’re seated, and it’s divine — crusty but soft with just enough spring.Served with a grassy extra-virgin olive oil and syrupy balsamic vinegar, the bread set the tone and the meal was off to a good start.A standout of the meal was the anchovy toast (S$22). This was a layered dish —\xa0literally. Oily anchovies, studs of dried figs, creamy burrata and juicy crushed tomatoes are layered on top of toasted pan de cristal.\xa0Spanish for “crystal bread” because of its fine translucent crust, I choose to believe that it’s because of how shatteringly it crunches when bit into — making it the perfect carriage to deliver a jubilant medley of flavours and textures. The fried baby smelt fish (S$26) brought as much pleasure as one could expect from hot, crispy, freshly fried fish. Propped up by a deeply smoky romesco sauce and zingy garlic aioli, it’s just missing a wedge of lemon.The squid ink fideua (S$36 for half, S$68 for full) was hefty as it packed a large amount of noodles (remember?), hunks of sea bass, calamari and potatoes. The half portion yields two to three full servings.\xa0The best part was the crispy burnt crust scraped up from the bottom of the pan and folded into the silky noodles. The short noodles used in this dish meant more surface area for extra crispiness.The meal was joined by both the white and red sangria (S$18 each). The white sangria was welcomingly crisp with apricot leading the nose. The red sangria had round, warming caramel notes without being too sweet. These will easily go down a treat. You’ve been warned.It’s worth noting that they have a conservatory in the rear, nestled among lush greenery that’s intimately sized for birthdays and “nearest-and-dearest-only” wedding receptions. If you’re looking for a venue that will be the envy of your social media following, take a number.The rice in the New Valenciana paella (S$32 for half, S$58 for full) was a touch overcooked. I ordered it specifically for the artichoke and chorizo, but found them scant in the paella.\xa0Unlike the fideua, the paella did not have that prized socarrat — the crispy, chewy crust of scorched rice that forms at the bottom of the pan. Lovers of bibimbap, claypot rice or tahdig (crispy Persian rice) will commiserate with me. I adore olive oil and blood oranges as dessert ingredients, so much so that I ordered the blood orange cake (S$16) instead of the safer, crowd-pleasing churros. Although the cake crumb was a bit dry, the olive oil ice cream served alongside was perfectly flavoured, with just the right hit of salt. However its texture was more like frozen whipped cream than ice cream.Minor, negligible bumps aside, the team at Tinto took great care of us. I’ll certainly be back to tackle the other mains, lubricate with a few more sangrias and play it safe with the churros.Is it conducive to conversation? Yes. Tables were comfortably spaced and the reggaeton was dialed up enough for you to gyrate in your seat without missing the banter.Is a reservation necessary? Yes. Crowds were streaming in steadily for a Tuesday evening. This may be due to the new opening buzz, but it’s always a good idea to RSVP.How to get there? As is the usual case for the access-challenged Dempsey Hill, take a Grab direct-to-door, or go by a combination of public transportation and walk the last leg.\xa0HungryGoWhere paid for its meal at this restaurant for this review.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/coffee-tea-library/:['Just like a hidden oasis known only to a fortunate few, Coffee Tea Library was a difficult find. Our journey was peppered with moments of uncertainty — whether we were on the right track or when we would finally arrive — but a quest like that was enthralling in its own right.\xa0Located behind the Salvation Army in Tanglin, the specialty cafe is discreetly tucked behind a curtain of verdant foliage.\xa0As you climb the short steps up to its entrance, an ethereal layer of mist swirls around our feet. No, we’re not being dramatic: The mist is a result of fog machines lining the pond outside the cafe.\xa0Enter the cafe to find over fifty meticulously curated tea blends awaiting exploration. These teas were curated and sourced directly from tea plantations in Vietnam, China, Taiwan, and Japan.\xa0The team behind the cafe personally journeyed overseas and forged relationships with the tea producers to select each blend carefully.\xa0We encountered some unique flavours, including a lotus oasis tea (S$9.90 for 15g, S$25 for 50g) from Vietnam. The tea is soothing and refreshing, but may not be suited to everyone’s tastes. It is a delicate tea with a subtle floral essence and a slight earthiness.\xa0For less adventurous souls, Coffee Tea Library also houses more common tea flavours such as Taiwan’s dong ding oolong tea (S$19.90 for 30g, S$29 for 50g) or the delicate blossom (S$7.90 for 15g, S$19 for 50g), a black tea also from Taiwan.\xa0It has a wonderful floral scent and is closer in flavour to teas found in commercial markets.\xa0If you find a blend that catches your fancy, you can bring your favourite leaves home. For these, Coffee Tea Library charges by weight, with varying prices for the type of leaves chosen.For dine-in, the teas are sold in pots of S$9.90 for signature pots and S$11.90 for premium pots, for all teas. This will entitle you to a full pot, as well as one refill.\xa0If you’re looking to learn more about different types of tea, Coffee Tea Library also hosts tea tasting sessions for S$34.25 per person, where participants get to try three different types of tea and enjoy a cake at the end. Each session usually lasts up to two hours, though a minimum of two participants are required.\xa0Where does the coffee come in, you wonder? The cafe plans to bring in a selection of coffees eventually, making it a perfect stop for those who enjoy both.\xa0It’s clear the cafe takes its drinks seriously, so don’t be surprised that food options are limited.\xa0There is no fixed Coffee Tea Library menu for food, though the cafe does offer desserts created in collaboration with a local baker.\xa0One thing is for sure: It’ll be your cup of tea, especially if you’re a fan of desserts that aren’t too sweet. This is an intentional decision so that it can pair nicely with its drinks for a teatime treat.\xa0\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTalad Thai Banana opens at AMK Hub with S$2 opening promotion for the first 100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you’re hungry for a full meal, you could always head to the Vietnamese restaurant next door, Lucky Saigon Cafe.\xa0A post shared by HungryGoWhere (@hungrygowhere)We recommend coming in pairs as the narrow seating area accommodates only two at each table.

There’s also a dedicated chocolate-making showroom that passersby can peer into to catch pastry chef Justin Oh, 26, hard at work.\xa0Oh is the man behind Luna’s menus at Amoy and Joo Chiat, and will be spending most of his time at its outlet in the east moving forward. His creations range from delicate entremets and tarts, to quiches and madeleines.Luna opened in 2019 with its inaugural store along Amoy Street, and has since become known for its gorgeous confections.\xa0HungryGoWhere was invited for a sneak peek ahead of its launch. Here’s what you can look forward to when it opens later this month.A post shared by HungryGoWhere (@hungrygowhere)Its new location is a mere stone’s throw away from the iconic Joo Chiat shophouses that have become quite the tourist attraction in recent years. Unlike its centrally located counterpart — which has bright, woodsy vibes — the new cafe is all about dark metal and concrete. As you enter the cafe, exposed brickwork, textured granite countertops and bare concrete walls catch your eye.Someone quipped that the cafe looked like it was still under construction — but no, we were assured that this was the final and intended look.Grey hues abound in this almost cavernous space, with clean, minimalist countertops and a sleek glass display case that cuts through the length of the eatery.I do think the interior’s stark, industrial chic aesthetic contrasts well with the patisserie’s too-pretty-to-eat bakes and tarts.\xa0Think pink, delicately crafted floral confections popping out against a blank canvas of carefully textured granite and rough-hewn walls.Food-wise, Luna has rolled five outlet-exclusive tarts and cakes, starring unconventional ingredients such as buckwheat and tofu.Tofu (S$8.50), a glossy snow-white square of vanilla sponge and mousse, held the most aesthetic appeal to me. Concealed within its spongy exterior is a blend of hazelnut praline and silken tofu, with an added crunch of toasted buckwheat. The texture was intriguing, but did end up being a touch too sweet for my liking.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHawker Hustlers: Hipster hawker Ray Yeo of Bei-Ing Dimsum Club on reinventing dim sum and his love for all things Japan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Feuds: Saizeriya vs Milan Shokudo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatisserie Cle brings its well-crafted pastries to new River Valley flagship for fifth anniversary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI was partial to the caramel banana chocolate tart (S$9).

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/honbo-burger-singapore/:['There’s a new burger joint in Singapore and its name is Honbo.The award-winning burger chain hailing from Hong Kong has set up shop in Chijmes and will open officially from Friday, July 28.This is Honbo’s first international outpost after six stores across Hong Kong.Classic American-style burgers built for Asian palates are the draw here, says founder Michael Chan.“The concept Honbo, on its own, is designed to cater to the modern Asian palate. From the making of the bun, (to) the cut of beef that we use, how we make our sauces, and even the pickles, (it) is really dialed into the Asian demographic,” says Chan.Chan says the brand is still tweaking the recipes, and may make further adjustments as time goes on.The menu we tried at its launch is what Chan calls its “greatest hits”, with some Singapore-exclusives in the pipeline.So just what is it that makes Honbo stand out?For one, the brand prides itself on housemade potato milk buns made fresh each day, under the auspices of renowned baker Eric Kayser (of Maison Kayser fame).\xa0If you find yourself reaching for the tabasco bottle, you’ll find some Flaming Smash Sauce — also housemade and exclusive to Honbo — instead. Its pickles, too, are made in-house with Japanese cucumbers.Honbo’s signature patties come in two variations: A two-ounce crispy patty that is smashed thinly on the grill, and a thicker version.You’ll find the former nestled between layers of melty cheese and raw onions in the Honbo series of burgers. For a good sampling of what it has to offer, try the Honbo 1.5 (S$23), which comes with three crispy patties, cheese, pickles, and house sauce. Depending on your appetite for the day, you can get a smaller or larger portion of meat. There’s the Honbo (S$18), which has two patties, for smaller eaters, while the Honbo 2.0 (S$28) has four.There’s even a BB Honbo (S$15) with a single crispy patty, which works as a snack or a kid-friendly meal. Here, the mildly spicy house sauce has been swapped out for ketchup.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTalad Thai Banana opens at AMK Hub with S$2 opening promotion for the first 100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a more traditional, juicier burger, there’s the cheeseburger (S$18), which comes with a thick beef patty, American cheese, pickles, onions, lettuce and house sauce.For a souped-up version, order The Gold Standard (S$28) to get double the patties and extra slices of applewood-smoked bacon.If you love fresh seafood, be sure to order the scallop burger (S$26) while you can. It’ll be available on Honbo’s menu for only the next three months. Thick slices of sashimi-grade Hokkaido scallops are seared and pressed between pillowy buns and finished off with Japanese rocket and lashings of wasabi pico de gallo.Honbo says there’s a soft-shelled crab burger in the works, featuring a vodka batter and ginger coleslaw, that will make an appearance in the coming months.Drinkswise, we liked the Michaelada (S$16), Honbo’s take on the Bloody Mary cocktail, but with Corona beer instead of the usual vodka. Made with tomato juice and a dash of its Flaming Smash Sauce, it was wonderfully tart and helped to cut through the grease. Do note that this will only be available on weekends for now.If you can’t get your hands on that, there’s an apple pie iced tea (S$7) with notes of cinnamon that worked equally well to refresh the palate.A post shared by HungryGoWhere (@hungrygowhere)Just like its burgers, the restaurant is reminiscent of a classic American diner, with tiled floors, booth seating and countertop seats.Instead of the usual black-and-white tiles, pleathery seats and dazzling reds however, Honbo sports more muted, seaside vibes.Decked out in warm oranges, blues and wooden accents, Honbo’s Chijmes’ store — just like its original flagship in Hong Kong — draws inspiration from the Malibu beachside.Citing a penchant for car-lite pedestrian areas, Chan says that Chijmes was a natural go-to for Honbo’s debut.“Our shop in Harbour City in Hong Kong — it directly faces the ocean… even my original ground-floor shop in Hong Kong is on a pedestrian-only street. So this is our thing.”The vibe here is certainly well-curated, even down to the dishes used. At first glance, it looks like a run-of-the-mill disposable box, just like the ones you’d get with any fast-food burger.But no, it’s a pretty solid ceramic dish designed to look just like it.We understand it’s a special Honbo collab with international ceramics brand Loveramics. If you love it as much as we do, you’d be glad to know Honbo will be bringing these in for sale in the coming months. So keep your eyes peeled: You might be able to snag your very own.This was a hosted tasting.For more ideas on what to eat, read our stories on McDonald’s latest nasi lemak burger and our top hidden bar picks.You can book a ride to Honbo at Chijmes.Chijmes, 01-09, 30 Victoria Street\nNearest MRT station: City Hall\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (12pm to 10pm)Chijmes, 01-09, 30 Victoria Street\nNearest MRT station: City Hall\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (12pm to 10pm)AuthorJia-En has worn several hats in her career — first writing TV scripts, then food and lifestyle stories at Wine & Dine.

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/muslim-friendly-japanese-restaurants/:['Halal Japanese food places have mushroomed over the years in Singapore. Perhaps more exciting is the increasing variety of Japanese cuisine offered.In the past, Japanese halal restaurants typically served sashimi, tempura dishes and sushi served on conveyor belts. Eateries offering halal ramen\xa0were also in short supply.Lately, though, a variety of Japanese food and concepts have arrived on our shores. Muslims in Singapore can now indulge in halal sushi and halal ramen from different parts of Japan, izakaya-style dining and even yakiniku — Japanese-style barbecued food.In this list, we recommend five Muslim-friendly Japanese restaurants you should check out in Singapore.254 Jalan Kayu\nNearest MRT station: Sengkang\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (11.30am to 10.30pm)An izakaya is a Japanese take on what tapas bars are to Spain, or what gastropubs are to Britain. Dating back to the Edo era, an izakaya is an informal bar where co-workers or friends gather to eat, drink and unwind after a hard day’s work.\xa0Daya Izakaya aims to replicate the social and casual dining experience, but without all the booze. Located at Jalan Kayu, it is the first Muslim-owned izakaya in Singapore.The restaurant is known for its kaminabe, a mini paper hotpot with a choice of either a spicy or clear soup base. Seafood lovers can try the seafood nabe (S$18) or oyster nabe (S$19), while those who prefer meat can opt for the chicken nabe (S$14) or beef nabe (S$18) options.Alternatively, for light bites, guests can try Daya Izakaya’s kushiyaki (Japanese skewered and grilled meat or vegetables). More than 10 types of kushiyaki are available, ranging from tebasaki (S$4) — a chicken midwing skewer — and kamo (S$7), a grilled marinated duck meat skewer.Hong Leong Building, B1-17/18, 16 Raffles Quay\nNearest MRT station: Telok Ayer\nOpen: Monday to Friday (11am to 8pm), Saturday (10am to 3pm)Known for its clear, rich broth, Hakata ramen is one of the most popular types of ramen in Japan. However, one of the main ingredients for the broth is pork bones, making it a non-option for Muslim foodies.Munemori Toshihiro and his wife, Sharon Woo, found a way to replicate the broth while at the same time making it Muslim-friendly. They used four types of fish boiled at high temperatures to replicate the creamy texture and umami flavours of the original Hakata-style broth.\xa0Fu-Men Japanese Udon & Donburi was thus born in 2018 at Raffles Quay, much to the delight of workers in the Central Business District.A must-try at the halal-certified restaurant is the burdock tempura udon (S$14). Burdock is a plant native to Japan and is known for its medicinal properties, such as “purifying” blood. The burdock tempura is crunchy and it blends well with the springy and chewy udon. Best of all, the combination went really well with the heavenly broth!If you prefer something less adventurous, the Japanese seaweed udon (S$9.50) or yummy chicken udon (S$13) would be a safe yet comforting choice.\xa0If you live in the east of Singapore, you can pay a visit to its other outlet at Pasir Ris East Community Club, which opened in April.Jurong Point, B1-56, 63 Jurong West Central 3\nNearest MRT station: Boon Lay\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (11am to 10pm)With eight stores all over Singapore, Ichikokudo Ramen is one of the largest halal Japanese food franchises on the island.\xa0The restaurant serves authentic ramen that pays homage to its Hokkaido roots. Its rich and dense broth is made by simmering chicken bones for hours, before it is finished with a blend of bonito, mackerel and 100 per cent Hokkaido kelp.\xa0The noodles are made from a special blend of flour that includes Hokkaido wheat to give it a satisfyingly firm bite.A standout dish is the Hokkai clams ramen (S$14.90). The sweetness of the clams marries well with the lightweight saltiness of the Hokkaido butter infused in the broth. It is a refreshing meal that does not leave you feeling jelak.There are plenty of thirst quenchers at Ichikokudo Ramen. Try the chocolate matcha latte (S$5.50) — a beverage made primarily from Kyoto uji matcha, and topped with chocolate and whipped cream.Nam Wah Coffee Shop, B1-02, 61 Tai Seng Avenue\nNearest MRT station: Bartley\nOpen: Monday to Saturday (5pm to 10.30pm)Launched in late 2021, Ryo Yakiniku is a Muslim-owned eatery that sells affordable Japanese barbecued food in a casual setting. Located in a coffee shop at Tai Seng, guests here are presented with their choice of ingredients in cardboard boxes, which are served along with a portable barbecue station to grill the meat.It also has another outlet at Gambas Crescent in Sembawang.You will be spoilt for choice with the various types of meat available. For beef lovers, options include prime karubi (boneless beef short rib, S$6 for 50g), gyutan (beef tongue, S$6 for 50g) and USDA Angus striploin (S$12 for 140g). The more premium A5 Japanese wagyu (S$28 for 100g) is available, too, as well as some non-beef options.\xa0If you are unsure what to order, you can opt for the deluxe set (S$40). Ideal for two, the set comprises 200g of karubi, 50g of prime karubi, 50g of gyutan, 200g of chicken cubes, a mushroom platter, two onsen eggs, and two bowls of rice.Oxley Tower, 02-03, 138 Robinson Road\nNearest MRT station: Tanjong Pagar\nOpen: Monday to Wednesday (12pm to 6.30pm), Thursday and Friday (12pm to 8pm)Opened in 2018, Gyunion is a Muslim-owned eatery that sells donburi (Japanese rice bowl) and ramen at wallet-friendly prices. As its name suggests — the “gyu” in Gyunion means beef in Japan — the cafe serves mainly beef in its dishes.You can choose from three versions of donburi — the standard gyudon (S$7.90), gyudon with curry sauce (S$7.90), and cheesy gyudon (S$8.90). They all feature sweet-savoury thinly sliced beef with onions atop warm rice.For ramen, a crowd favourite is the standard gyu-men which comes in three flavours: Standard (S$8.90), curry (S$8.90) and spicy (S$9.90). The sliced beef and onions are served on thin noodles in a warm beef broth. You can elevate your gyu-men by adding some smoky bonito flakes and tamago (Japanese egg), for an extra S$2.Keen for more halal food options?

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/best-chicken-rice-2/:['Moving on from Part I of the massive 20-plate chicken rice taste test we conducted at our office,\xa0we have the second half of this finger-lickin’ good operation. Read on for the vegetarian, halal and roast chicken rice dishes, as well as the hottest chicken rice chilli sauce, and best overall chicken rice in Singapore.___________________________________________BEST ROAST CHICKEN RICE Loy Kee Chicken Rice, $4.80\nThe roast flavour is strong in this one. The Hainanese-style bird is the best of the restaurant’s elements – tender, with a hint of sesame oil, and salty-skinned. The full-grained rice is stiff in fragrance, while the big-flaked sweet chilli sauce, and even sweeter thick black sauce, drag this version down a little.\nLoy Kee Chicken Rice | Address: 342 Balestier | Tel: 62522318 | Opening hours: Daily: 9.30am-10.30pmVEGETARIAN’S CHOICE Pine Tree Cafe (Fortune Centre), $5\n“Like chap chye peng (Chinese dialect for ‘mixed vegetables rice’),” said a slightly turned-off taster. Pine Tree Cafe’s vegetarian chicken rice uses beancurd skin to create its mock roast chicken dish. As flavourful as the filmy tofu skin is, the mock meat is, quite regrettably, “as fake as it can get”. Not surprisingly, the rice has almost no taste on every count; and the chilli – though spicy – has a bizarre raw veggie taste. We reckon it’s not that bad for a vegetarian dish though – they really tried.\nPine Tree Cafe (Fortune Centre) | Address: 190 Middle Road, #02-09/13 Fortune Centre | Tel: 98154940 | Opening hours: Mon-Sat 10am-10.30pmRed Riding Hood Hainanese Chicken Rice\nRoast chicken, $3.50\nThis popular business-worker’s cheap lunch spot has two entries in this test. While the rice and chilli is the same for both – grains: flat in flavour and integrity; chilli: spicy, garlicky and not enough vinegar – the roast chicken is tough, dense and has not much flavour, even though it smells as a good roast should. The egg is not strongly flavoured enough either.White chicken, $3.50\nSoft but tasteless (like the roast version), and a little dry. The rice looks whole, but is bloated, mushy with no taste of chicken; while the chilli sauce is “barely there” with too much coriander – we blame the garnish.\nRed Riding Hood Hainanese Chicken Rice | Address: 7 Tanjong Pagar Plaza, #02-102 | Tel: 62263869 | Opening hours: Mon-Sat 10.30am-8pm\xa0Sin Kee Famous Chicken Rice (Mei Chin Food Centre), $3\nWe’re convinced this Cantonese-style stall might be famous for something else altogether: the roast chicken is a selection of fibrous, healthy-looking (and -tasting) breast meat; overcooked rice is soggy and flavourful, though not of the chicken stock; and flake-filled chilli sauce is too sweet. The dish doesn’t come together, not even with the bitter-noted dark sauce.\nSin Kee Famous Chicken Rice (Mei Chin Food Centre) | Address: 159 Mei Chin Road, #02-22 Mei Chin Food Centre | Tel: 64739525 | Opening hours: Tue-Sun 11.30am-2.30pmTong Fong Fatt Hainanese Boneless Chicken Rice, $3.50\n“Yikes.” This halal white chicken is soft – not in a good way – and a bit dry. “Doesn’t taste like chicken,” a taster flapped. The lumpy rice is flat, with a strange and “slightly ‘off’ smell”. The chilli sauce is also disconnected: dark and dull in appearance, but too sweet and too spicy. It disappoints the rest of the already disappointing dish.\nTong Fong Fatt Hainanese Boneless Chicken Rice | Address:\xa0#01-32 6 Jalan Bukit Merah, ABC Brickworks Food Centre HOTTEST CHILLI SAUCE Tian Shui Chicken Rice, $3\nWe were served the wing of a white bird, which turned out to be a little tough and not flavourful enough. The same goes for the rice – bland. The citrus-noted chilli sauce killed the Hainanese dish – “very hot!” and “damn spicy” was the consensus; this fiery sauce is overpowering.\nTian Shui Chicken Rice | Address:\xa0#01-21 48A Tanglin Halt Road, Tanglin Halt Market & Food Centre | Tel:\xa097575532 | Opening hours: Tue-Sun 9am-10pm)BEST CHICKEN RICE Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice, $3.80\nYet again. “Wah shiok ah!” are the words on the street for Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice, though in our test environs, that exclamation refers specifically to the sour-spicy chilli sauce that is the “right balance of chilli, garlic and ginger”. The fragrant fluffed-up rice is smooth, not mushy and nicely oiled with a rich chicken stock flavour. The white chicken, however, received mixed reviews: some thought it was too stiff and dense (us), while others praised it for being “very tender and glistening with [good] oil”. Whichever side the chicken roosts, this one evokes familiar taste points; one even scribbled on the comment sheet, “is that you, Boon Tong Kee?”\nTian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice | Address: 443 Joo Chiat Road | Tel: 63459443 | Opening hours: Daily 10 am-10 pmBEST CHICKEN RICE CONDIMENTS Wee Nam Kee Hainanese Chicken Rice Restaurant, $4.80\nWe were really excited for this Upper Thomson family restaurant to top these charts, but the entire roast version is very plain: from the bloated “Plain Salty Jane” rice grains, to the dry, tough, salted-skinned chicken. The dense, fibrous ginger sauce saved this downward-diving plate, as may have the roundly-sweet thick black sauce, and bright and tangy spicy chilli sauce.\nWee Nam Kee Hainanese Chicken Rice Restaurant | Address: 275 Thomson Rd | Tel: 62556396 | Opening hours: Daily 10.30am-2amYet Con Restaurant, $5.80\nYet Con Restaurant’s white chicken is surprisingly average in taste, and a little tough in parts. The chicken is cut wider, so you get hunks of breast meat on grains that keep their shape well. The fiery-looking chilli is actually mild yet tasty, like the Indonesian sambal oelek. General consensus: a passable Hainanese, but way too pricey.\nYet Con Restaurant | Address: 25 Purvis St | Tel: 63376819 | Opening hours: 10am-10pmAuthor© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/tokyo-foodie-gems/:['From traditional diners specialising in just one type of food, to casual izakayas and stores that provide plenty of ’grammable opportunities, it’s no secret that Tokyo is home to an exceptional range of gastronomic delights.\xa0Sorting through the endless options when deciding what to eat in Tokyo is no easy feat — so we’ve gone ahead and done that for you. Tucked away from the tourist eye, these eateries are certainly gems worth sampling the next time you’re in Tokyo.\xa0Check out our list of seven places to eat in Tokyo that are not to be missed.\xa01-chōme-19-3 Kabukichō, Shinjuku City, Tokyo 160-0021, Japan\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (11am to 9pm)Living in Singapore, we’re definitely familiar with ramen. Well, Yakiago Ramen Takahashi is set to throw everything that you know about these delicious noodles out of the window.Be sure to try its signature Yakiago shio ramen & rice (1,000 yen or S$10), as well as the seabura shoyu ramen & rice (1,020 yen). Both dishes offer very different bursts of intense flavours, each delightful in their own right.The Yakiago shio ramen (ramen in broth made from grilled flying fish) brings a combination of charred sweetness from the grill and umami from the flying fish.\xa0The seabura ramen (ramen in broth made from pork back fat), on the other hand, comes with creamy fat bits that add depth to the already tasty bone broth. The addition of onions brighten up the profound richness of the dish.Once you’re done with the hand-kneaded noodles, add rice to the remaining broth, sprinkle with the crackers provided, and top it all off with wasabi for a comforting end to the meal.What to order: Yakiago shio ramen & rice (1,000 yen), seabura shoyu ramen & rice (1,020 yen), grilled pork rice bowl (400 yen), and original yakiago shirodashi bottle (980 yen).3-chōme-28-15 Shinjuku, Shinjuku City, Tokyo 160-0022, Japan\nOpen: Monday to Friday (11.30am to 11.30pm), Saturday (11.30am to 11pm), Sunday (11.30am to 10pm)If you enjoy your alcohol, no trip to Tokyo is complete without an izakaya experience. An izakaya is a type of bar that serves small dishes and savoury snacks.When my travel companions and I headed over to Kushiroko Shinjuku, we found the toasty basement izakaya alive with conversation and laughter from a handful of locals unwinding after a long day.\xa0Many customers were there for the bar’s highly rated ikura (salmon roe) and seafood options, brought in directly from Hokkaido.While the ikura rice bowl set (from 2,200 yen) and grilled shishamo (1,080 yen) proved delectable, a surprise winner was the humble gyoza (850 yen) dish. The dumplings arrived sizzling on a hotplate, crisped to golden perfection. They were plump and juicy, too, bursting with meat, garlic, ginger, and chives.\xa0What to order: Ikura rice bowl set (2200 to 2420 yen, depending on size), gyoza (850 yen), grilled shishamo (1080 yen), and free-flow alcohol for 90 min (1800 yen).1-chōme-1-13, Kanda Sudacho, Chiyoda City, Tokyo 101-0041, Japan\nOpen: Monday to Friday (11am to 8.30pm), Saturday (11am to 7.30pm)Slurping up a steaming bowl of soba (buckwheat noodles) at the homely Kanda Matsuya following a long day of shopping provides a certain comfort that’s pretty much unparalleled.\xa0Founded in 1884, this charming restaurant is currently run by a sixth-generation owner, and retains its traditional wooden building structure. Its extensive menu comprises primarily just soba (both chilled and hot), as well as a few sides to complement.\xa0The classics, tsukimi soba (1,100 yen) and tennanban soba (1,375 yen), proved gratifying despite the light soup base and simple ingredients — raw egg, fish cake, and spinach in the former, and tempura prawns in the latter.\xa0Both bowls offered unique taste and textural experiences, accentuated by the three different kinds of peppers provided at the table — chilli pepper, yuzu chilli pepper, and sansho pepper.What to order: Tsukimi soba (1,100 yen), tennanban soba (1,375 yen), yakitori with salt (990 yen), and yuba (825 yen).2-chōme-28-7, Dogenzaka, Shibuya City, Tokyo 150-0043, Japan\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (11am to 3pm, 4pm to 9pm)When looking for places to eat in Shibuya, you mustn’t miss this cosy shop on the second floor of a small building.\xa0 Nikudoresukaisendon\xa0features an iconic dish that is literally what the store name means: “Meat dress seafood bowl”.Each signature bowl (1,600 yen) comes chock full with fluffy rice, minced tuna, and an egg — then dressed with delicate slices of lightly seared A5 wagyu, and topped with generous servings of salmon roe and sea urchin.\xa0What really stood out, however, was turning the rice bowl into chazuke (soupy rice). The store recommends that you leave about one-third of your rice bowl for this.\xa0Simply pour in some of its complimentary dashi broth and you’ll be enjoying the luscious flavours with every sip.What to order: Signature bowl (1,600 yen), roasted beef with caviar (six pieces for 950 yen), seared wagyu sushi (four pieces for 950 yen), and stewed beef (450 yen).\xa052-2 Wasedaminamicho, Shinjuku City, Tokyo 162-0043, Japan\nOpen: Monday to Tuesday (11am to 7pm), Thursday to Sunday (11am to 7pm)Coffee-ya Waseda is a nerdy wonderland for coffee lovers. It’s a tiny store on a quiet street, and you’re more likely to get a whiff of it before you see it.Inside, you’ll find it buzzing with life, from the smells and sounds of coffee beans being roasted in-house, to the coffee connoisseurs striding up and down, studying the mind-boggling array of beans displayed on rows of shelves.For those who prefer a medium roast, the Dominica AA Loma Gajo Cherry blend (550 yen) is a choice selection — fragrant and refreshing.Of course, if you’re one to relish a sweet treat with your afternoon cuppa, don’t forget to order a seasonal tart (630 yen) and some coffee jelly (510 yen) as well!What to order: Dominica AA Loma Gajo Cherry (550 yen), coffee jelly (510 yen), and seasonal tarts (630 yen).1 Chome-8-2 Nihonbashimuromachi, Chuo City, Tokyo 103-0022, Japan\nOpen: Monday to Friday (11am to 2pm, 5pm to 9pm), Saturday and Sunday (11am to 2.30pm, 5pm to 9pm) If you’re a fan of crispy, airy and light tempura, then Tenmatsu’s Nihonbashi outlet is a must-visit if you’re making a list of what to eat in Japan.Tenmatsu is a decades-old, homely Japanese restaurant that is frequented by locals and tourists alike. Its ingredients are fresh, its tempura crunchy and its prices affordable for its quality.\xa0Get its classic tendon for 1,375 yen, comprising shrimp, fish and mixed vegetables, or if you’d like to treat yourself a little, go for its tuna bowl and tempura option for 1,815 yen.\xa0Considering that it serves mainly locals, you might find yourself having to gesture and point or rely on good ole’ Google Translate. But hey, all that legwork’s worth it for good, cheap eats in Tokyo right?What to order: Tendon (1,375 yen) with shrimp, fish and mixed vegetables on rice, and tuna bowl and tempura (1,815 yen) with the same tempura assortment but with an additional tuna bowl. 3 Chome-15-10 Tsukishima, Chuo City, Tokyo 104-0052, Japan\nOpen: Monday and Friday (5pm to 10pm), Saturday and Sunday (4pm to 10pm)\xa0If you enjoy okonomiyaki, then you must surely try monjayaki, if you’re keen to explore lesser-known must-eat foods in Tokyo.\xa0Monjayaki comprises similar ingredients such as chopped vegetables and your protein of choice (seafood and meat), but with more liquid in its batter. The result is a runnier, chewier pancake, typically eaten directly from the hotplate itself using a small spatula.\xa0If you’re ever in search of this unique snack, you’ll find dozens of restaurants along Tsukishima’s Monja street, but our favourite’s Yoshimiya (好美家) – decked with a huge red sign with its name in Kanji.\xa0Don’t expect a fancy presentation of the dish – its charm lies in its messy appearance and unpredictable texture.\xa0What to order: If trying monjayaki for the first time, opt for its special monja (1,350 yen) or if you’re feeling adventurous, its mentaiko mochi cheese monja is also a crowd favourite (1,550 yen)\xa0\xa0Sarah Chua contributed to this article.\xa0For more ideas on what to eat in Japan, check out our guide on what to eat in Osaka or if you’re stuck in Singapore, how about trying some affordable Japanese restaurants?\xa0Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

One man decided to replace milk with eggs and realised the potential it had to be something special. Indeed, the founder of Cafe Giang perfected the recipe and established the first egg coffee shop in Hanoi, which now serves as a popular tourist attraction.Using egg yolks, sweetened condensed milk, coffee, and other secret ingredients, Cafe Giang’s egg coffee is creamy and dense.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/lou-shang-mama-diam-singapore/:['Are you the type to enjoy immersing yourself in a meticulously designed, themed cafe? Then you have to check out the new cafe-bar Lou Shang that officially opens on August 22.The new concept is hidden on the second floor of the viral Prinsep Street hidden bar, Mama Diam, which attracted oodles of hype when it first opened.Opened by the same creative minds behind the whimsical Mama Diam and Synthesis, Lou Shang x Mama Diam is a brand-new concept that revolves around the same theme of nostalgia.By now, most would be familiar with Mama Diam. The viral sensation pays homage to the classic mama shops that once flourished in the void decks of every HDB estate. It has a display of old-school candies, magazines and toys, and even re-used shelves from a true-blue mama shop that has since closed.Lou Shang, which translates to “upstairs”, is an extension of the concept. It quite literally recreates the sights and vibes of HDB dwellings from the 1980s and 1990s.The immersion starts before you even enter the cafe: A row of messy letterboxes are the first objects you see when you ascend the stairs.Along its side are an array of fliers, stickers and noticeboards, surrounding what looks like an old-school lift door. While the etchings above the door indicate that it could transport you to a few different levels, it actually functions as the secret entrance to Lou Shang.A post shared by HungryGoWhere (@hungrygowhere)Once you’re past the lift door, you’d be greeted by another tremendously nostalgic sight: Lou Shang’s cafe space is strikingly reminiscent of HDB living spaces.It’s flush with bamboo poles, hanging army apparel, electrical meter boxes and even rustic metal house gates — the attention to detail is staggering.The concept here is rather interesting, too. Lou Shang is a daytime cafe that transitions into a speciality bar once the clock strikes 5pm.\xa0During cafe hours, seats are available on a walk-in basis only, while reservations can be made if you’re heading in for alcoholic drinks after 5pm.Like the other two sibling concepts masterminded by owner Sebastian Ang, the Lou Shang’s menu is an intriguing medley of influences, starting from local favourites and stretches all the way to Italian pasta.To accommodate the day-to-night switch, the menu is segmented into breakfast, lunch and dinner. Since the concept is currently in the soft launch phase, its menu and prices are subject to changes.Breakfast is available until 12pm and only has one item — the rainbow roti (bread, S$10). This comes with four different custard dips for you to dip into: Chocolate, kaya, bandung and milk.The rest of the daytime menu (available until 5pm) sees a spate of creative dishes, especially under the “handmade noodles” category where the noodles are freshly made to deliver the most toothsome texture.While there were a plethora of interesting creations, the stand-out had to be the Chilli Crab-tivating (S$20), which consists of crab meat, ricotta and feta parcelled into individual dumplings, then drenched in a tangy chilli crab sauce.Other comforting twists come in the form of Prawn-tastic Adventure (S$18), a hokkien mee-inspired ravioli dish, and Murgh Makani (S$18) that is served with a butter chicken-esque sauce.There’s also an assortment of desserts on the menu to satiate various cravings, including an adorable entremet that resembles a tutu kueh (S$13).The outer “kueh” layer is fashioned out of meringue and cuts open to reveal a glut of fragrant desiccated coconut.While the noodles and desserts are available only up until 5pm, Lou Shang’s menu also contains a curation of small bites that are available all day.One intriguing bite is the Cola Pok Pok Keh (S$12), coated in a sweet and slightly tangy glaze based on old-school coca-cola chicken recipes — very addictive.The menu also pays homage to the old-school pairing of jiam tao roti (baguette) and curry in the Roti Hey! (tiger prawn, french baguette, nyonya vegetable curry, S$13) where soft toast is paired with a rich curry for extra oomph.Other than the myriad of creative grub, Lou Shang’s drinks are also concocted with local-inspired quirks in mind.Similar to the food options, the beverage menu is split into two: Beverages such as coffee and tea are available until 5pm, while cocktails take over from 5pm onwards.While the daytime menu has the standard black (from S$4.50) and white (from S$5.50) coffee, most diners would be more intrigued by Lou Shang’s unorthodox concoctions.We’re talking about Pei Pa Koa latte (S$6), the delightfully aromatic and balanced pandan kaya latte (S$7) and Hochinchow (S$8), which blends hojicha with sweetened grass jelly.As the sun sets, Lou Shang’s cocktail menu features a collection of tipples that will revolve around some quintessential Singaporean experiences.Our favourite of the bunch is the fabulous raspberry ripple (S$24), which brings up memories of childhood moments spent at iconic ice cream carts.The base is a medley of gin, raspberry and chambord and it’s topped with a layer of cream yoghurt and caramel for an extra creamy touch.This was a hosted tasting.For more ideas on what to eat, read our stories on where to find the best HK-style cha chaan teng experience in Singapore and affordable but vibey date spots that will impress your crush.You can book a ride to Lou Shang at Mama Diam in Singapore.38 Prinsep Street, 02-02\nNearest MRT station: Bencoolen\nOpen: Tuesday to Thursday (9am to 5pm, 6pm to 11pm), Friday and Saturday (9am to 5pm, 6pm to 12am), Sunday and Monday (9am to 5pm)38 Prinsep Street, 02-02\nNearest MRT station: Bencoolen\nOpen: Tuesday to Thursday (9am to 5pm, 6pm to 11pm), Friday and Saturday (9am to 5pm, 6pm to 12am), Sunday and Monday (9am to 5pm)AuthorEvan started off writing about food on Instagram, before joining outlets such as Buro and Confirm Good to pursue his passion.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/the-kongsee-gemmill-lane/:['It’s 11.45am on a Saturday morning and Taylor Swift’s Karma is playing in the background of a restaurant on the side lane next to Amoy Street. It’s quiet in the restaurant and the vicinity — not many people come to the CBD for lunch on weekends after all.\xa0It’s a whole different story during the work week, with throngs of formal-clad office workers searching for a bite during the hectic lunch hour.\xa0Which is probably why after a year of solely dinner services focusing on communal-style dining, The Kongsee has decided to open for lunch three days a week from Thursdays to Saturdays.On offer is a new curation of dishes and a set menu where selected mains, starters, and a dessert goes for S$29.90.Interestingly, the name Kongsee comes from an amalgamation of the Hokkien word for “company” and the Malay word for “sharing”.\xa0The restaurant is conceptualised by the veritable ‘godfather of modern Singapore cuisine’, chef Willin Low. It specialises in mod-Sin small plates based on popular hawker eats.The dishes on the menu — laksa, lor mee, ayam penyet, Iberico satay — may sound quite ordinary, but the modern spin that the team puts on them elevates them to an extraordinary level.\xa0It’s even more value-for-money when you go for the lunch set. Throw in some very good service, a comfortable ambience, and the entire discography of Taylor Swift (there’s clearly a Swiftie among the staff here) and you’ve got yourself a fantastic deal. Ever tried the iconic Janggut Laksa (also known as the ‘original Katong laksa’) on the first floor of Roxy Square?\xa0The Kongsee pays homage to the dish with the Roxy crab laksa (S$20 for a la carte), with an uncanny likeness down to the scissor-cut noodles that you can enjoy with simply a spoon.\xa0The broth is as fragrant and creamy with coconut milk as the original, but the version here is appreciably less spicy. It’s instead sweetened and notably rich with the flavour of succulent wild-caught crabs.\xa0The accompanying sliced fish cakes and fried tofu puffs are top notch stuff, soaking up the broth for an exceedingly indulgent dish that I slurped up in minutes.Ayam penyet isn’t an easy dish to get right. The accompanying ingredients must be done well: Soaked jasmine rice perfectly cooked till they become little pearls of fluffy goodness; tofu puffs with its skin fried to a crisp while still retaining a soft, bouncy inside; and a spicy and flavourful sambal — usually unique depending on the restaurant.\xa0Then there’s the chicken, deep-fried to a golden crisp and smashed with the flat side of a knife just before it’s served to break up the batter and separate the meat from the bone.\xa0The Kongsee ayam penyet (S$20 for a la carte) does it all and more, with a bar of tempeh — fermented soybeans — and a tangy sambal ketchup that really brings the dish together.Get the drool-worthy kou shui ji salad (S$18 for a la carte), a colourful appetiser dish served cold and vibrant with sliced chicken breast, roasted sesame seeds, garlic, ginger, peanuts, pressed tofu strips, and umami from super aromatic chilli oil.\xa0The compressed cucumber adds freshness and crunch to the dish, while Sichuan peppers create an ever-so-slight numbness on the tongue. The Chinese name of this dish literally translates to ‘saliva chicken’ for a reason.One of the best dishes we tried was the Iberico satay (S$16), which uses the very tender ‘secreto’ cut found between the shoulder and loin of prized Iberian pigs.\xa0The juicy chunks have just the right amount of fat, beautifully caramelised and charred to go with a chunky Javanese peanut sauce and pineapple salsa, so you get zest, sweetness, heat, nuttiness, and smokiness all in one bite. There are the usual beverages here, such as soft drinks, coffees and wines. More interestingly, there’s also a collection of four simple cocktails for an afternoon reprieve: Gin and tonic, Aperol spritz, whisky highball, and the vermouth with soda or tonic, which came to my table within minutes.\xa0The Cocchi Storico soda (S$14) is made with Cocchi Vermouth di Torino ‘Storico’, a vibrant, spicy vermouth with notes of cocoa, citrus, ginger, and rhubarb. It’s a fantastic drink to complement the rich and salty dishes at The Kongsee.The only dessert you can get for lunch is the housemade kaya ice cream, a medium-sized scoop of pale green ice cream flavoured with coconut and pandan.\xa0The idea is there (I’ve had dreamy kaya ice cream at several other establishments), but the execution here fell short. Rather than a smooth creamy ball of ice cream, The Kongsee’s housemade variety has bits of ice crystals inside — a sign of possible over-churning.\xa0The taste itself is fine — slightly sweet, fragrant, and earthy — but the stiffness and ice on the tongue makes it difficult to taste properly.That was a pity, especially since the ice cream is the only dessert available.\xa0Having said that, my experience at The Kongsee was generally pretty good. As We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together started playing through the speakers, I thought to myself: “Actually, I would probably come back here again.”Is it conducive to conversation? Weekend lunch was quiet, but I reckon the place gets crowded during weekday lunch.Is a reservation necessary? Good to have.How to get there?

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/kelim-dakdoritang-korean-spicy-chicken-stew/:['There is an eye-watering mound of minced garlic in my chicken stew.So much so that it’s literally making the air a little spicy, actually.But this is what you can get at Kelim Dakdoritang, a well-known Korean brand that has recently landed in Singapore.While this is its first foray overseas, the brand boasts more than 50 stores back home and is said to be one of Korea’s oldest and largest dakdoritang (spicy chicken stew) eateries.Just like Singapore, Kelim is also celebrating its 58th birthday this year, points out Lee Seongmin, 42. He is the brand’s CEO and the son of its founders.Even though many Singaporeans count themselves aficionados of Korean food, there are no dakdoritang restaurants in Singapore, which is why Kelim and its local partners decided to set up shop here.As you would expect, a meal here revolves around Kelim’s signature spicy chicken stew (S$36.90 for two diners, S$59.90 for three and S$69.90 for four).\xa0Eating the stew itself is an experience. It’s composed of three parts: Your usual stew and its assortment of hotpot staples, a noodle phase and finally, a fried rice phase.Our portion for two came chock-full with chewy tteokbokki (Korean rice cake), potatoes, leeks, and a whole chicken. You can top-up to add more toppings such as sausage (S$5), enoki mushrooms (S$5), quail eggs (S$5), and udon (S$4).Despite the name, the dish itself isn’t too spicy — by Singaporean standards, anyway — but the liberal amounts of garlic added a much-appreciated depth of flavour to an already rich stew.The ingredients were generously portioned and the chicken pieces plump, but we thought these would benefit from sitting in the Korean stew for longer.In fact, as the meal progressed, the ingredients soaked up more and more of the stew to become soft and juicy morsels of umami. Once you’ve eaten your way through half of the pot and most of the tteokbokki, you can request for kalguksu (knife-cut noodles) to be lowered into the broth. Chewy but not quite “QQ”, the texture of the noodles remind us of the best types of ban mian.We found that the noodles stuck together a little in the pot, though.As you enjoy your meal, the broth thickens into a gravy-like texture. Once it’s reduced down, it’s time for bocumbap (Korean-style fried rice).Rice, Japanese radish, seaweed, and bean sprouts are added into what’s left of the gravy-like broth.\xa0The mixture is then stirred and pressed into the heated metal of the pot until it obtains a crispy perfection. If you love claypot rice, this is a must-try.Besides the stew, we also particularly enjoyed Kelim’s dakttongjip (fried chicken gizzard, S$15.90), which uses fresh chicken gizzard that’s been marinated for six hours. This has a unique appeal, even if you’re not quite a fan of the ingredient — chewy and tender without the usual rubbery texture that one associates with gizzards.Round off the meal with a sweet treat: Hotteok (S$9.90 for two pieces), a warm, sticky pancake with caramelised brown sugar. This dessert was a welcome, satisfying addition after the soupy, umami-rich meal.This was a hosted tasting.For the latest eats, check out Lou Shang by Mama Diam, a new HDB-themed cafe-bar, or KFC’s newest cheesy mushroom Zinger Double Down burger.You can book a ride to Kelim Dakdoritang Singapore or to Serangoon for your Korean barbecue fix.Do explore the new GrabFood Dine-in service for awesome deals.14B Kensington Park Road\nNearest MRT station: Serangoon\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (11.30am to 2pm, 5.30pm to 10pm)14B Kensington Park Road\nNearest MRT station: Serangoon\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (11.30am to 2pm, 5.30pm to 10pm)AuthorJia-En has worn several hats in her career — first writing TV scripts, then food and lifestyle stories at Wine & Dine.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/sen-sen-sushi/:["Don Don Donki holds a special place in the hearts of many Singaporeans. The widely popular discount store chain brings us closer to Japan by offering a wide range of affordable Japanese delights, from ready-to-eat Japanese meals to snacks and sashimi freshly flown in from Japan.Now, the establishment has ventured into the world of conveyor belt sushi for the first time.Introducing Sen Sen Sushi, which opened its doors on July 28 and is located within its Jem branch. While Don Don Donki has a made-to-order sushi concept in Jurong Point, this is the first time it’s utilising a high-speed conveyor belt order delivery system.\xa0The previous open dining area has been transformed into a 134-seater restaurant, complete with a light wooden interior and warm lighting.Sen Sen Sushi is definitely a worthy new competitor in the conveyor belt sushi space, in both quality and accessible price point. Prices start from S$2.50 for two pieces of nigiri sushi with toppings such as inari, salmon and tamagoyaki.We anticipated a long wait time due to the hype around Sen Sen Sushi and tried to be strategic by arriving before 6pm on a Friday evening. The line was already long, but we were pleasantly surprised that it took only 20 minutes to secure our seats.The physical menu is available for browsing while queuing in line, and once seated, like many restaurants embracing digitalisation, the diners can put in their orders through scanning a QR code. Your orders will then be swiftly delivered right to your seat via a “shinkansen”, Japan’s bullet train, which will no doubt be a hit for both the young ones and young at heart. We decided to start our weekend strong and went with sake, which Sen Sen Sushi offers on tap. The sou jyunmaiginjyo nama genshu (S$10 for 90ml) was an embodiment of full-bodied richness, slightly sweet and smooth. It was so good we ended up having two!I am going to come right out and state, I have high expectations of the bluefin tuna otoro (S$4.80) and bluefin tuna chutoro (S$3.50), given the store’s benefit of having an established supply chain direct from Japan.\xa0They definitely did not disappoint. Both cuts provided the oily, robust flavours of tuna belly, causing an involuntary slight tilt of the head and happy vibes swirling in your mouth. The seared wagyu with salt (S$5.80) and sukiyaki-style seared wagyu (S$5.80) were the winners that made Sen Sen stand out from its competitors. The sushi came with a generous pile of thinly sliced beef seared to unveil its umami potential. The wagyu was devoid of any unwelcome sinewy resilience, achieving a melt-in-the-mouth euphoria.\xa0For a moment after the bite, I closed my eyes and imagined I was into my fifth course of a proper 10-course omakase. The two pieces of seared red shrimp (S$4.80) sushi came with large sweet and juicy shrimps. The infusion of smoky essence from a quick searing process created a symphony of fresh, sweet and clean flavour. When washed down with a sip of the sake, the thought that came to my mind was: “Ahhhhh, absolute bliss”.\xa0A surprise hit was the Japanese littleneck clam miso soup (S$2.80), an offering with plump and juicy clams that were well accompanied by a warm, soothing miso soup.To end the culinary experience on a sweet note, the baked sweet potato with vanilla ice cream (S$5.80) was irresistible. One may remember the sweet aroma of Don Don Donki’s sweet potatoes whenever you visit a store — now imagine the same famous sweet potato topped with sweet potato mousse, caramelised sugar, and creamy ice cream.\xa0The contrast between the cold vanilla ice cream, warm sweet potato and crispy sugar top may put creme brulees to shame. The only regret we had is, if we were not so stuffed, we would have ordered a second helping. Highly recommend all sweet potato fans to give this a shot!A post shared by HungryGoWhere (@hungrygowhere)We tried the recommended oshi sushi (S$6.80), which features salmon, shrimp, conger eel, and pickled mackerel. The sushi came hand pressed in a cute compact rectangular shape. Taste-wise, this was average and not particularly memorable, other than the fact that it had slightly more vinegared rice.We also ordered the other usual suspects such as inari, Japanese steamed egg, salmon sushi, conger eel sushi, and a scallop sushi assortment. These were competent as staples and similar to other casual japanese places, which helped to fill up the belly.Perhaps a personal preference, but the rice used in its sushi was a tad soft in my opinion. It is made from good koshiibuki rice from Niigata Prefecture, which is a famous rice production area in Japan. While it had the fluffy texture, it did not have the firm bite of more discerning sushi joints. Having said that, the rice to vinegar ratio was great, and the vinegar used in the sushi rice was blended with kelp soup stock, two kinds of red vinegar, and rice vinegar.Side note: As it is predominantly a sushi and sashimi place, it is worth noting that there are no rice bowls and noodles. There is also a 60-minute time limit, which staff repeatedly came by to remind us.Is it conducive to conversation? Yes.Is a reservation necessary? Walk-ins only.How to get there?

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/so-lemak-nasi-lemak/:['“Females shouldn’t be in the kitchen,” a senior male chef told Shanice Lim, owner of So Lemak, when she worked as a part-time kitchen helper in a hotel. She was 17 years old then.It’s a good thing Lim, who is now 25, didn’t take those words to heart.The plucky young chef subsequently went on to culinary school, worked in reputable establishments, ran a home-based business, and has now opened her own physical hawker stall.\xa0So Lemak, located at Food Loft at Bedok North Street 1, is a nasi lemak hawker stall that pairs coconut rice with har cheong gai (prawn-paste chicken wings).\xa0Most nasi lemak stalls, both Chinese and Malay, sell the dish with deep-fried chicken wings. Har cheong variations made with prawn-paste marinade — which are more aligned with Chinese cuisine — are few and far between, for now.\xa0Lim didn’t always set out to be a hawker from the get-go but arrived at it after a couple of twists and turns.\xa0\xa0When the circuit breaker hit in 2020, Lim had just graduated from The Culinary Institute of America and planned to intern at a Michelin-starred restaurant in New York. However, the pandemic derailed those plans.Instead of letting it get her down, Lim took it upon herself to start home-based business Two Hands Two Woks, which combined her love for cooking for others, culinary skills and her late grandmother’s recipes.\xa0The items she sold included fish-head curry, har cheong gai and ngoh hiang (five-spiced pork rolls).A post shared by Two Hands Two Woks (@twohandstwowoks)After the pandemic eased in 2021, Lim headed back into commercial kitchens to hone her skill sets. She clocked time as part of the opening team at restaurant-bar Low Tide and three-Michelin-starred Restaurant Zen. But something didn’t sit right with Lim.“I enjoyed my experience working at a Michelin-starred restaurant and that motivated me to try further different experiences through shorter-term gigs, “ Lim said.She added: “As I went through these experiences, together with what I learnt from my late grandmother, I realised that I wanted to continue pursuing my passion and interest in the local food scene, particularly in hawker food.”Knowing she wanted to be closer to her customers and cooking dishes from the heart, Lim started thinking about her next steps after leaving Restaurant Zen in January this year.\xa0Thanks to her experience with Two Hands Two Woks, Lim knew prawn-paste wings were a popular dish. But she also knew that selling the dish on its own would put her into a very competitive environment, especially with other more established names out there.\xa0After much thought and extensive R&D on her end, as well as help and advice from her seniors and fellow chefs, she settled on pairing prawn-paste wings with nasi lemak.\xa0A post shared by HungryGoWhere (@hungrygowhere)Within half a year, So Lemak was born. It began operations on May 28.\xa0“Nasi lemak is a very versatile dish and very Singaporean. I can introduce and play with different dishes and components,” says Lim.\xa0\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Junction Westgate opening with promos; will house 23 tenants, including new halal teppanyaki\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHawker Hustlers: Hipster hawker Ray Yeo of Bei-Ing Dimsum Club on reinventing dim sum and his love for all things Japan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn first look, So Lemak stands out against its neighbours at the same coffee shop, with its minimalist forest-green aesthetic paired with a quirky logo and neon signage.\xa0Go closer and you’ll notice that Lim keeps So Lemak’s menu small and simple. It presents a stark contrast for those of us used to the usual plethora of ingredients at a typical nasi lemak stall.It’s clear the focus of So Lemak is on its prawn-paste wings, for now at least. Lim says they will look into having more seafood and sambal-based dishes eventually.\xa0You can buy the har cheong wings on their own (S$2.20 for one, 5 pieces for S$11) or opt to have them as part of a set.If you’re making your way down to So Lemak for the first time, we’d recommend trying the So Lemak set (S$7.50) with its signature prawn paste wings, grilled otah, fried kuning fish, as well as the usual sides of egg, sambal, peanuts, and anchovies. So Lemak’s coconut rice, which we understand took Lim a while to perfect, was fragrant yet not overly lemak (rich).\xa0It might be tempting to douse your rice and chicken in sambal as you dig in, but try the chicken on its own first to fully savour the umami from the prawn-paste marinade. The sizable wings have the right amount of crunch and juiciness without being too oily.\xa0Spice fans should note that its homemade sambal veers on the savoury side and isn’t too spicy.\xa0But fret not because So Lemak’s grilled otah (S$2 per piece), which it gets from a local supplier, packs a fiery kick and so does its homemade achar (pickled vegetables, S$1.50). If an all-inclusive set is too filling, there are also smaller sets starting from S$4.80 for a grilled otah set. If you must have its wings, its har cheong wing set goes for S$5.\xa0Reception to the new stall has been healthy — Lim says there are days that So Lemak sells out its signature prawn-paste wings before its usual 8pm closing time.\xa0So if that’s on the agenda for you, do swing by for a late breakfast or lunch to avoid the disappointment of not having these crispy umami wings.\xa0For more east side eats, try Cat in the Hat’s bakes or the pig organ soup at Koh Brother’s new Tampines outlet.\xa0So Lemak is on the GrabFood delivery service and offers free delivery (up to S$3 off) with GrabUnlimited.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/ms-maria-mr-singh-degustation-menu/:['For the bougie broke among us, Ms Maria & Mr Singh’s latest degustation menu is perfect for a day out to impress.And it’s starting off from a rather reasonable price of S$48, in a town where gastronomy often costs three-digits and up. And especially so, considering you would otherwise need to travel to Thailand to sample lauded chef Gaggan Anand’s food.Just a recap: Ms Maria & Mr Singh is Anand’s Indian-Mexican casual restaurant, one whose Bangkok’s flagship took the 33rd spot on Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants list this year.Its Singapore outpost, located at Craig Road, is its first international location and opened just last year to much fanfare.Since then, the menu has been revamped somewhat — now narrower and focusing on its fan-favourites, with some new additions from its Bangkok repertoire.A la carte options continue to be available, but if you’re just looking to try chef Anand’s chart-toppers without poring over the menu, the tasting menu is surely the way to go.As one of the best-value degustation menus around town to date, prices start at S$48 for a five-course lunch menu, while an eight-course dinner starts from S$78. (There is also a S$68 vegetarian version available).For now, the S$48 lunch menu contains all the best hits — papdi chaat, cold curry scallop ceviche, pork vindaloo taco, chicken tikka masala with bread, and churros with sticky rice ice cream.We understand the menus will be updated every quarter.We got the chance to try the S$78 dinner menu, with some hits from Ms Maria’s more premium S$138 lineup.The meal opens with a papdi chaat — a riff off a classic Indian street snack and Anand’s signature Yoghurt Explosion dish — a toothsome mouthful to whet the appetite.Drawing inspiration from yet another traditional snack is the golgappa, a hollow, deep-fried snack, which is served here with a tequila-based verdita shot to wash it down with.If you’ve chosen the S$138 dinner menu, this appetiser is served with a delicate tongue of uni (sea urchin) carefully perched atop the airy morsel.This is followed by the guacamole ikura, comprising a liberal dollop of salmon roe in a bed of avocado-laden dip. Grab a sliver or two of the accompanying blue corn tortilla and papadam crackers to scoop up all that briny, creamy richness.To wrap up the opening quartet of dishes, the Ms Maria & Mr Singh ceviche arrives next — a spin-off of Anand’s classic cold curry scallop dish. Here, cured and diced hamachi (yellowtail fish), leche de tigre (tiger’s milk) and prawn fritter balls are prettily plated with edible flowers. Be sure to mix it thoroughly for the best results — it certainly left us wanting more.The meal moves into its next phase with Ms Maria’s version of an atas taco — the scallop tostada, featuring sweet, thinly sliced Hokkaido scallops on a fried tortilla base and a Mexican salsa of dried peppers, nuts and oil.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50% off at picturesque date spots, including Wildseed Cafe at The Alkaff Mansion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere’s also the mole madre pipian with seasonal root vegetables. Lotus root is slow-cooked until tender and served with black and green mole (a Mexican sauce made with chillies, spices, nuts and seeds). You are advised to spoon the sauce and veggies onto a soft tortilla shell for the most efficient delivery into your mouth.We found the lotus root had a nice bite — solid with a good crunch without being overly tough and soaked through with all the earthy goodness of the mole sauce. (We scraped the dish clean — as politely as possible, of course.)A more traditional-looking taco arrived next — Ms Maria’s pulled pork vindaloo taco. It was a welcome intermission from the meal thus far, with its roasted pineapple bits, salsa and acidic-driven base of vindaloo curry.We moved on to the carb-rich section of the meal — a choice of bread or South Indian coconut rice with chicken tikka masala and Ms Maria’s dal.The former sees chicken chunks richly marinated in a spice-infused, tomato-based curry, while the latter runs more tangy than spicy and is chock-full of chickpeas.We had another addition — Gaggan’s crab curry — which is available as part of the S$138 menu or a la carte. Sporting generous crab pieces, this is one of Anand’s signatures and is a well-loved dish.And to round off the dinner: Sticky rice ice cream\xa0atop a warm, deep-fried churro with a drizzle of dulce de leche (caramelised milk sauce) for a satisfying end.This was a hosted tasting.For more eats in Tanjong Pagar, check out our updated guide on the best Tanjong Pagar food places to try.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/great-nanyang-heritage-cafe/:['Those reminiscing about the halcyon days of the past will love Great Nanyang Heritage Cafe, an olden-day kopitiam (coffee shop) concept along Craig Road.\xa0The eatery pays homage to the old-school coffee shops of Malaysia and Singapore, and is the latest venture by Keith Kang, founder of Yang Ming Seafood. Featuring rustic grilles, traditional wooden windows and a retro signboard, its storefront impressed us when we arrived. It’s set up to be the perfect photo spot for diners and passersby alike — even we couldn’t help but snap a shot for the ’gram.The joint is meticulously designed to resemble the heyday of kopitiams in the 1950s and 1980s, with vintage memorabilia peppering every nook and cranny. Think: Old movie posters, classic vinyl speakers and even a first-edition photograph of founding father Lee Kuan Yew’s visit to Malaysia in 1963.\xa0They’re all bibs and bobs from Kang’s own collection, one that he’s cultivated over the years. All these relics are truly a peek into the past, creating a unique dining experience like no other. Great Nanyang’s menu also stays true to the theme, with a lineup of nostalgic coffee shop favourites that most of us would be familiar with.\xa0Boasting timeless flavours that’s sure to please both the young and old, the dishes at Great Nanyang Heritage Cafe make for wonderful morning pick-me-ups and afternoon tea delights.Pick from breakfast favourites such as handmade toast and soft-boiled eggs, or classic mains that include mee siam, hor fun and more. The first dish to arrive at our table was the signature Hainanese chicken cutlet (S$15.90). It’s a unique rendition of the popular Hainanese chicken chop — one of Kang’s favourite foods — just crunchier, juicier and much more succulent.\xa0The end result is not just any ol’ chicken cutlet. Great Nanyang Heritage Cafe’s version comprises tender boneless chicken meat that’s marinated and thinly battered to crisp, flavourful perfection.\xa0Accompanying this dish is a tantalising handmade sauce of butter, onions and pandan leaves. The gravy is sweet and tangy — a wonderful balance to the savoury chicken. The nasi lemak kukus with chicken berempah leg (S$8.90) is another delicious creation that sees fragrant steamed coconut rice made from basmati grains, a side of hot sambal sauce and flavoursome cubes of boneless chicken berempah leg. It’s then completed with the usual suspects of peanuts, slices of cucumber and a fried egg.\xa0The dish is also customisable to your preference. Feel free to swap out the chicken berempah leg for curry chicken, sambal petai prawn or rendang mutton. The dry mee siam (S$8.90) is one of our favourite items at the Great Nanyang coffee shop. The bee hoon noodles are cooked with a secret sauce that’s made from 13 different herbs and spices, as well as a dried shrimp paste.\xa0The prawns were also fresh and succulent, going surprisingly well with the sambal petai (stink beans cooked with sambal chilli). Overall, it’s a fragrant dish that delivers a flavourful punch.Great Nanyang Heritage Cafe also dishes up incredible zi char delights, such as the Moonlight hor fun (S$7.90) — a decadent plate of stir-fried hor fun that’s rich in wok hey and topped with runny egg yolk.\xa0To best enjoy the dish, break the egg apart and give the dish a good toss. The yolk coats the noodles with its contents, giving the dish a silkier, creamier texture. Squeeze the lime to add citrusy notes and a touch of acid.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTalad Thai Banana opens at AMK Hub with S$2 opening promotion for the first 100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBesides an extensive menu of nostalgic mains, there are also quintessential breakfast treats that you can’t miss. It comprises childhood favourites that we grew up savouring, such as soft-boiled kampung eggs (S$2.50 for two) and handmade kaya toast (from S$2.50).\xa0The kaya toast is one that we’ll return for. It’s a true morning indulgence, complete with creamy homemade kaya spread and premium butter that’s sandwiched between freshly toasted bread.\xa0\xa0For your toast, select whether you prefer your bread thick-sliced (S$2.70), traditional (thin-cut bread, S$2.50) or wholemeal (S$3). The former has our vote, since there’s more bite and crunch. The new Great Nanyang at Tanjong Pagar also introduced savoury toasts with a plethora of toppings, such as egg mayo, cheesy ham egg, tuna mayo, and more.\xa0We had the chicken floss thick toast (S$4.80), which sees the fluffy bread adorned with a crown of melt-in-your-mouth chicken floss and a layer of sambal spread in between.The French toast with peanut butter (S$4.50) is to die for. Served in dainty lil’ cubes, the pan-fried toast contains a gooey middle that oozes peanut butter with each bite. It’s also drizzled with maple syrup for extra sweetness.\xa0If you’re not a fan of sweet toasts, perhaps you’ll enjoy the savoury versions instead: Kaya butter (S$4.50) or cheesy ham (S$5). Round up the meal with its signature beverages. We love the Hor Ka Sai (from S$3), which directly translates to ‘tiger bites lion’. A harmonious blend of Milo and coffee, this indulgent drink is said to energise diners with every sip.\xa0The coconut coffee (S$5.90) is another must-try — a mixture of rich Nanyang coffee, condensed milk and creamy coconut water.\xa0Alternatively, the Golden Lime (S$3.50) is a zesty kumquat drink that’s made with limes and prunes — the perfect thirst quencher on a hot day.

It’s got small plates, bigger sharing ones such as steaks and octopus and the quintessential pizzas and pastas.Its pizza flavours veer a little from the classics, such as its Not So Classic Marg (S$24), which comes with stracciatella, basil oil, fior di latte, basil and pecorino romano, and its Almost Hawaiian (S$30) that comes with Spanish chorizo, pickled grilled pineapple, fior di latte and chilli oil. The pizzas may look small, but trust us — it’s good for two.\xa0Price range: $$$Crowd favourites: Butter chicken pizza (S$28), vodka sugo and Italian sausage — tomato sugo, vodka, chilli, norcina sausage, pecorino romano, stracciatella and pappardelle (S$24)\xa0176 Telok Ayer Street\nOpen: Tuesday to Thursday (11.30am to 2.30pm, 5.30pm to 9pm), Friday to Sunday (11.30am to 9pm)Why visit? If you’re a fan of mutton-based dishes, then Restaurant Aisyah, a Muslim-owned Xinjiang restaurant, should be on your list.\xa0Xinjiang cuisine features mutton heavily and predominantly uses seasonings such as cumin, chilli powder, cinnamon, garlic and saffron. Restaurant Aisyah’s menu is an accurate and authentic reflection of these inclinations, with dishes such as cumin mutton noodles (S$13.80).\xa0Prefer other meats? Its spicy beef noodles (S$15.80) are also quite popular and come with a spice rating of three fire icons. Don’t say they didn’t warn you.\xa0Crowd favourites: Cumin mutton noodles (S$13.80), braised mutton platter (S$36)\xa0Read our full review of Restaurant Aisyah.\xa0\xa028 Duxton Hill\nOpen: Tuesday (5pm to 11pm), Wednesday to Saturday (12pm to 11pm), Sunday (12pm to 9pm)Why visit? If you’re a fan of Greek food, Tanjong Pagar definitely has options for you. But we particularly liked Fotia, tucked away on Duxton Hill, complete with an alfresco area — something its previous outlet at Club Street didn’t have.\xa0Founded by Greek chef Sofia Beleri, the spot serves up authentic Greek and Mediterranean-style dishes from the heart.\xa0While its Duxton space is a lot bigger, you’ll feel right at home once you enter, thanks to its warm and attentive service staff. Its dishes are definitely made for sharing and are portioned as such, so go with a bigger group to try more and get greater bang for your buck.\xa0Price range: $$$Crowd favourites: Mix combo platter — beef skewers, chicken skewers, lamb and chicken kebabs with fried potatoes, tzatziki, feta dip and pita bread (S$78.80), dolmadakia — stuffed vine leaves (S$18.80)\xa058 Tanjong Pagar Road\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (11.30am to 3.30pm, 5.30pm to 9.30pm)\xa0Why visit? An offshoot of the popular Korean barbecue restaurant Super Star K, Noodle Star K specialises in Korean noodles. You’ll find many shops selling Jjajangmyeon (or black bean noodles) along the stretch, but Noodle Star K also serves up naengmyeon (cold noodles), kalguksu (knife-cut noodles) and jjolmyeon (chewy noodles).\xa0It’s a one-stop shop for anyone who loves Korean food and their noodles. We particularly liked that its kalguksu came in many variations that you don’t really see in other Korean restaurants locally — kimchi, seafood, spicy beef, and chicken — perfect for fueling up on a cool, rainy day.\xa0Price range: $$\xa0Crowd favourites: Jjajangmyeon — black bean noodles (S$14), naengmyeon — cold noodle soup (S$16.80)\xa0\xa0Maxwell Chambers, 01-05, 32 Maxwell Road\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (11.30am to 3pm, 5.30pm to 11pm)\xa0Why visit? You may have come across the name Kapitan on your TikTok For You page, due to a recent publicity push by the owner’s 21-year-old son Mark Zubovskyy. Zubovskyy dropped out of school to help his family out with the eatery after poor business, in spite of the fact that his father had poured the family’s life savings into opening the eastern European restaurant.\xa0You’ll probably also find the location familiar — it’s where the former Russian restaurant Dumplings.ru once stood. Kapitan is a rebranded version of its former occupant and now specialises in Slavic-styled boiled dumplings known as pelmeni and vereniki, instead of its previous Russian-style dumplings, which are more meat-focused.Crowd favourites: Dumplings ragout — meat pelmeni or dumpling mix, chargrilled vegetables, cheddar, mozzarella (S$24.90), Medovik — multi-layered Slavic honey cake (S$12.90)\xa0171 Telok Ayer Street\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (11.30am to 10pm)\xa0Why visit? If you found the name Thachang familiar, it’s because it’s been a Golden Mile Complex mainstay for boat noodles. Ever since the complex announced its closure, several stores have either closed or relocated. The popular Thachang opted for the latter, moving to the swankier Telok Ayer neighbourhood.Its new shop is quaint and retro-themed with Thai memorabilia, and serves up several other Thai favourites such as omelette crab bomb (S$24.90) and moo ping — grilled pork skewers (S$8 for three pieces).\xa0It’s still relatively new, so don’t be surprised to find a long queue whether at lunch or dinner.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/shake-shack-hot-honey-chicken/:['Do you still remember queueing at Changi Jewel for hours just for a taste of Shake Shack when it first came to Singapore?Since its arrival at Changi Airport in 2019, Shake Shack’s Singapore operations have grown significantly.\xa0Today, it has nine outlets islandwide, with a few even found in the heartlands of Singapore, in the North and West.Building on that success, the beloved burger chain continues to introduce exciting limited-time specials. This time, it’s brought in a hot new special, along with a slight upgrade to the regular menu.Specifically, it is beefing up their selection of chicken dishes, starting with the launch of the hot honey chicken sandwich (S$11.50) on August 16. This will be available for a limited time.This time though, Shake Shack gives you the freedom to choose your preferred cuts: Thigh or breast.\xa0Not only that, the option of patty meat will also be carried over to the regular menu. That means chicken-burger lovers can now customise your Chicken Shack (S$9.90) or Hot Chicken (S$11.50) too.Curious about what the new limited-time burger tasted like, we managed to get a preview of the special menu.As with Shake Shack’s other chicken offerings, the chicken thigh patty is solid — crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside, as it should be.Comparing the regular Hot Chicken burger with the new Hot Honey Chicken, the obvious difference is that the latter came coated in a hot-honey glaze and it’s served with appleslaw instead of regular slaw.(The regular Hot Chicken is dusted with a hot pepper blend instead.)\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Feuds: Saizeriya vs Milan Shokudo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat’s enjoyable about the honey is its well-balanced blend of sweetness and heat that jazzed things up. The glaze is done sparingly, just enough to coat the patty but not overwhelm its flavours.\xa0Including appleslaw into the mix is also a great touch, since the tart green apples added some much needed acidity. It’s refreshing but not too sharp — just enough to cut through the heaviness of the meal.\xa0Besides the hot honey chicken sandwich, Shake Shack has put a twist on yet another menu staple with the hot honey chicken bites (S$6.70 for six, S$8.70 for 10).The only change is in the dip: Instead of honey mustard or barbecue, it’s served with the same hot honey used to glaze the patty.It’s not wildly different, but the twinge of sweetness and heat made it rather addictive, especially if you enjoy a more viscous sauce.Here’s to hoping they keep it as a dip option permanently!For more ideas on what to eat, read our stories on where to find the best Nasi Padang in Singapore and the hottest new dessert shop featuring Famous Amos cookies.Shake Shack is on the GrabFood delivery service and offers free delivery (up to S$3 off) with GrabUnlimited.\xa0They can also be found on GrabFood Dine-in.Alternatively, you can book a ride to one of Shake Shack’s nine outlets to try out the limited-time hot honey chicken sandwich.Multiple stores islandwide\nOpen: Operating hours vary across outletsMultiple stores islandwide\nOpen: Operating hours vary across outletsAuthorEvan started off writing about food on Instagram, before joining outlets such as Buro and Confirm Good to pursue his passion.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/bored-and-hungry-burger-singapore/:['Another cult-favourite American brand is coming to Singapore — this time it’s Bored & Hungry, once voted the best burgers in America.It will be popping up from now until August 19 at The Parlour Mirage’s Farrer Road space, with the burgers cooked by a chef flown in from the brand’s Manila store. Its store in the Philippines is a recent launch and is Asia’s first.This marks the last pop-up for The Parlour Mirage before it’s closes officially to make way for an exciting new rebrand.As a brand, Bored & Hungry is quite different from your usual fast-food heavyweights such as Shake Shack.It has only one outlet in Long Beach, California, and more interestingly, it’s a concept based around cryptocurrency and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).More specifically, it’s based on Bored Ape Yacht Club, one of the most recognisable NFT collections in the world, which had one such Ape sold for a record price of approximately US$3.4 million.In fact, the burger brand’s logo features its owner’s own Ape, which he had purchased for upwards of US$260,000 in 2022.Even if you’re not into cryptocurrency, NFTs, Web 3.0 and all that tech jazz, one thing will interest you: Bored & Hungry’s burgers were reportedly voted as the “best burgers” by Good Morning America in 2022, a morning television programme followed by millions of Americans.The menu features only the Bored OG burger, which is available with fries and drinks in either combo one (fries and canned drink, S$25) or combo two (fries and alcoholic drink, S$35).Burgers here don’t come with the thick patties common in most burger joints. Instead, Bored & Hungry’s signature is a smash burger, where the beef patty is smashed on the grill while being cooked.This gives it a nice crust around the patty, as well as an additional smoky char which makes the juicy patty even more decadent.\xa0It is then finished with rich cheese and luscious caramelised onions to give it that extra oomph. Overall, it’s extremely hearty and packed with beefy flavours — it can be a notch too surfeit for some though.Do we think it’s the best burger around? Not really. But it’s a pretty solid one that will cater to the tastebuds of those who enjoy their burgers extra indulgent and robust in profile.Besides its smash burger, we were charmed by Bored & Hungry’s thick-cut fries, which were thick and fluffy, while also being well-seasoned with an umami, cajun spice-inspired dust.If burgers and fries aren’t enough to satisfy your appetite, there will also be a rotating secret menu (each at S$8) that changes daily — so check in with the chefs when you’re there.For more ideas on what to eat, read our stories on the halal bakeries with the most Insta-worthy bakes and a complete guide on eating through all of Singapore’s beloved hawker dishes.You can book a ride to Bored & Hungry’s Singapore pop-up before it ends on August 19. 140 Owen Road\nNearest MRT station: Farrer Park\nOpen: August 11 to 19 (5pm to 10.30pm)140 Owen Road\nNearest MRT station: Farrer Park\nOpen: August 11 to 19 (5pm to 10.30pm)AuthorEvan started off writing about food on Instagram, before joining outlets such as Buro and Confirm Good to pursue his passion.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/spectre-bar-singapore/:['Remember how films used to regularly depict bars as the haven for downtrodden souls to drown their sorrows and confide in bartenders, or sometimes even strangers?There’s no doubt Singapore’s glitzy bar scene has grown tremendously in status, laying claim to multiple spots on the Asia’s 50 Best Bars list. That kind of intimate connection, however, has become more tenuous.Well, that kind of connection is exactly what Singapore’s newest hidden bar Spectre — slated to officially open on September 9 — aims to foster.First introduced to the public as a pop-up at incubation space Ghostwriter, Spectre bar has found its permanent home on the second floor of a shophouse at Tanjong Pagar Road.\xa0Spectre was already in the works when they popped-up at incubation space Ghostwriter in May. Its current premises was undergoing renovations, so the team took the chance to open their doors to the public and experiment with their menu.Besides an inconspicuous sign by the entrance, there is little indication of the bar. It is accessible only through a lift at the back of a narrow walkway, situated on the the left of the first-floor Korean restaurant.Spectre is meant as a charming refuge from the hustle and bustle, one that also celebrates mental wellness. Facets of this can be peeped from various parts of its thoughtfully conceptualised fittings.The establishment is helmed by two kindred spirits, co-owners Inch Chua and Andrew Pang, who subscribe to the importance of mental wellness in this hectic age.For example, the floor features imperfect tiles, joined together and fixed up by streaks of gold and mismatched patches of traditional Japanese patterns.\xa0This design quirk is a nod to the time-honoured Japanese tradition of kintsugi, a repairing technique that mends broken ceramics using gold-dusted lacquer.The results often turn out more beautiful than before, even with imperfections.Kintsugi is often cited as an analogy in mental health circles — one need not be conventionally perfect, nor is beauty necessarily perfect.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50% off at picturesque date spots, including Wildseed Cafe at The Alkaff Mansion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo fully capitalise on the space, Spectre also has plans to host regular workshops to help with building up your mental wellness and build bonds.These workshops will offer a plethora of relaxing activities such as art jamming, wine tasting and even whisky masterclasses that focus on mindfulness.The mastermind behind Spectre’s food menu is co-owner and homegrown multi-hyphenate, Inch Chua.\xa0Chua is best known for her exploits both as a talented singer-songwriter and, more recently, one of the contestants on MasterChef Singapore in 2021. This will be her debut project in the F&B scene.Building on the theme of wellness, Chua and the Spectre team also draw inspiration from vintage apothecaries.More specifically, there are elements of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) weaved into the setting. Diners can expect a menu served in a medicinal cabinet and an array of nourishing, locally inspired dishes.One such example is the herb-laden herbal chicken soup (S$20) — a no-frills take on a soul-soothing classic that feels all-too-nostalgic, almost like something your grandparents would make.Apart from the homage to TCM, Chua also plays with familiar local flavours in myriad creative ways, with dishes such as the sambal smoked duck (S$22) that combines classic flavours with the smoked meat.In this instance, diners will be left comforted by a tangy but feisty layer of tomato sambal, smothered all over the tender duck.The sauce also comes together with tapioca chips that remind you of that old-school tapioca snack, or Doritos chips if you’re more of a junk food lover like young me.But the menu here is not just limited to a simple union of nostalgic flavours\xa0— Chua also showcases her culinary eclecticism, too.\xa0The watermelon sashimi (S$15), in particular, is quite an intriguing dish. It’s a riff on the less-seen watermelon steak, but handled in such a way that the texture resembles tuna sashimi.The other is the black tiger prawn kinilaw (S$16), which might be our favourite from Spectre’s food menu.\xa0Based on a classic Filipino dish that’s often likened to ceviche, it features succulent raw prawns drenched in a moreish concoction of coconut vinegar, coconut milk, chilli, and tuba (coconut liquor).It’s a dish that’s slightly tangy, refreshing and charmingly complex, where the plethora of flavours coalesce in harmony.Spectre consists of two synergising operations — one is the food by Chua and the other is the specialty cocktail programme led by Pang.Pang’s name might not ring any bells to those unfamiliar with the scene, but the industry veteran is a respected figure, having been regional brand ambassador for legendary Japanese spirits-maker Suntory since 2020.Read our feature on Andrew Pang’s mixology journey here.Here, Spectre’s signature cocktail menu is presented alongside a TCM apothecary cabinet, filled with various spices and such for diners to take a whiff.The intent is to make it more interactive. Diners can explore the various scents and herbs before making their decisions, especially since the concoctions are crafted around these specific flavours.Be prepared to be pleasantly surprised, too. Some of Spectre’s drinks come with whimsical garnishes and supporting theatrics.If you’re vexed by something, then the punchy Hathaway (rye whisky, dry vermouth, campari, prosecco, S$25) is a must-order. For this drink, a pen and paper will be provided, with the latter subsequently burned in front of your eyes.So if you have something — or someone — that’s the root of your vexation, watch it sizzle into ashes. Take it as a symbolic destruction of your problems, or just a fun stress relief.Then there’s also the LSD #2 (gin, citrus, marmalade, aperol foam, S$25), a fruity but deceptively potent tipple that takes inspiration from The Beatles’ seminal 1967 number, Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.A pair of kaleidoscopic glasses are served together with the LSD #2, which makes for some memorable selfies to add to your social media feed.This was a hosted tasting.For more ideas on what to eat, read our stories on the most delightful dining options Orchard has to offer and an extensive guide on where to find Singapore’s most classic hawker dishes.You can also book a ride to Spectre when it opens on Sep 9.\xa0Do explore the new GrabFood Dine-in service for awesome deals.120 Tanjong Pagar Road, 02-01\nNearest MRT station: Tanjong Pagar and Maxwell\nOpen: Monday to Saturday (5pm to 11.30pm)120 Tanjong Pagar Road, 02-01\nNearest MRT station: Tanjong Pagar and Maxwell\nOpen: Monday to Saturday (5pm to 11.30pm)AuthorEvan started off writing about food on Instagram, before joining outlets such as Buro and Confirm Good to pursue his passion.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/van-leeuwen-ice-cream-taste-test/:['With more than 50 scoop shops in America, it only makes sense that the ice-cream empire Van Leeuwen would start to cast its eye overseas.Singapore, it seems, was its choice for its first-ever international outpost, and it’s no surprise why. The powerhouse of a city has a dynamic, thriving food scene with a whole country of discerning foodies, so any brand establishing a home here would have no shortage of eager diners.\xa0Well aware of this, many famous international brands have already made the country its overseas debut, such as Hong Kong burger chain Honbo, China’s Luckin Coffee, America’s Museum of Ice Cream and Korea’s Cafe Margaret.And now, Van Leeuwen is part of the list. With an inspiring origin story, ingredient-focused flavours and dopamine-fuelled packaging right out of a Pantone catalogue, this scoop shop will be pulling lines through Orchard Central for a while.Founded by brothers Ben and Pete Van Leeuwen and close friend Laura O’Neill in New York City in 2008, Van Leeuwen is currently a household name and authority on ice cream in the United States.The tale of Van Leeuwen’s origin checks all the boxes of a tried and true success story.One enterprising kid finding his way in the world. Check.\xa0A seemingly humdrum summer gig driving an ice-cream truck. Plot exposition.\xa0A band of loyal, try-anything friends. Who would Harry be without Ron and Hermione?\xa0A lemon of a truck that had to be restored with nothing but gumption and a prayer. Of course.\xa0An unstoppable appetite for scooping happiness to everyone. That’s the heart of the story!Van Leeuwen had all the early signs of an entrepreneurial sensation, and it shows in its 50 scoop shops across America, ubiquity on supermarket shelves and in restaurants, and now its arrival in Singapore.\xa0According to CNBC (August 2023), Van Leeuwen has achieved multimillion-dollar business status, bringing in upwards of US$300,000 (around S$406,200) a day from its scoop shops alone. It prides itself on serving ice cream made with only natural ingredients sourced from small producers and artisans.Starting at S$6.50 a scoop (which you can have in a cup or a cone), Van Leeuwen is priced higher than some beloved local parlours, such as Creamier and Birds of Paradise.\xa0Because of this, as well as its sensational reputation, I had high hopes for the ice cream I was about to taste.Unfortunately, Van Leeuwen’s flavours came across as rather tame, lacking a flavourful punch that I came to expect from local brands here. Flavours from the latter come across as richer, more luxurious and complex — and they always leave me wanting more.Perhaps visiting on a Sunday at teatime was a risk, because the queues were healthy but the staff seemed overwhelmed by the crowds, making it a bit of a struggle to put my order in. Minor teething issues for a major opening.I brought home some pints from Van Leeuwen, too, and found that the quality of these tubs did not quite live up to its name. More on that later.Twee, rainbow-hued interiors and genial wooden seating make Van Leeuwen’s scoop shop an inviting place for multi-generational family hangs. Its prime location in Orchard Central means a scoop (or two) is always easily within reach.If you plan on going in for a scoop, I highly recommend the peanut butter brownie chip (S$6.50). This velvety, salty peanut butter ice-cream is chock-full of chewy brownie chunks, peanut butter ribbons and dark chocolate chips. I had it with the housemade waffle cone (S$1), which is made fresh, its lacy edges delivering the perfect snap in every bite.The sturdy lineup of vegan ice-cream flavours means lactose intolerant and plant-based folks can join in the fun too. I tried the vegan chocolate fudge scoop (S$7.50) and was bowled over by how rich the texture and flavour were. However, the chunks of fudge had a crumbly, sandy texture, not unlike a protein bar.Van Leeuwen’s make-your-own sundae (S$13 for 2 scoops and 3 toppings) offered a fun nod to the jolly decades of Americana when soda jerks and sundae joints were dujour.\xa0I went for a scoop of vanilla bean and strawberry ice cream, topped with regular whipped cream, cookies and cream crumble and rainbow sprinkles for my sundae as I wanted to try the quintessential, classic flavours.\xa0The vanilla bean had a fragrant, floral note to it, which I enjoyed. However, the strawberry flavour was missing the sweetness of summer-ripe fruit that I was hoping for. The whipped cream also had a rather artificial flavour to it.They say to be New York-born, is to be New York strong. Grit runs in the veins of a true-blooded New Yorker. Unfortunately for Van Leeuwen, being gritty (when it comes to ice cream, at least) is not something to be desired — not in the way Alicia Keys and Jay-Z would sing proudly about.\xa0To test out its retail-quality ice cream, I took home a pint of buttermilk berry cornbread and Sicilian pistachio (S$17 each). To my disappointment, both pints had a gritty, chalky texture. According to ice-cream scientists Ben & Jerry’s, this is likely the result of freezer burn, which is when ice cream melts and refreezes, creating larger ice crystals that leave a grainy texture.\xa0The cornbread that was folded into the buttermilk berry ice cream was pale and stale, and the sweet taste of corn was missing.As for the pistachio ice cream, it was muted in flavour and also had a grainy texture that tickled my throat.\xa0On a later revisit to have the peanut butter ice cream again, I found it had the same gritty texture as the pints. According to the staff, the ice cream is shipped all the way from the US. Coupled with the fact Van Leeuwen uses natural, artisanal ingredients, I wonder if the quality and consistency are being affected by cold chain delivery issues.\xa0Anyway, if you’re having an ice-cream craving, there’s no harm giving Van Leeuwen a go to see if you feel the same way. Otherwise, we suggest topping up an extra S$3.80 and treating yourself to a roasted pistachio pint from Creamier (S$20.80, available on the GrabFood platform). Is it conducive to conversation? Yes. The space is cavernous, with ample seating and social media-ready interiors that will start conversations.Is a reservation necessary? No.How to get there?

That’s easier said than done.Even some of the best buffets in Singapore have a cap to how much of these premium ingredients you can order.If you’re looking to really stuff yourself silly though, Japanese restaurant Azmaya has recently launched a buffet that lets you indulge in as much wagyu and snow crab as you’d like.Azmaya’s buffet price of S$68 gives you lavish amounts of wagyu beef — sourced from the Gunma and Kagoshima prefectures in Japan — as well as assorted sides and snow crab, within 90 minutes.The entire spread includes a glut of meats ranging from pork and chicken to premium A4 wagyu beef that’s served in a variety of styles, including slices, chunks and cubes.\xa0There will even be beef tongue available for those who enjoy the delicacy’s unique texture.The izakaya-style restaurant specialises in authentic Japanese shabu-shabu hotpot and can be found at two locations: Robertson Quay and Cuppage Plaza.In line with the restaurant’s speciality, diners can enjoy their wagyu feast cooked in its rich shabu-shabu broths or grilled yakiniku-style.All yakiniku-grilled meats are paired with a housemade sauce, while the shabu shabu option comes in a wide variety of broth choices. \n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50% off at picturesque date spots, including Wildseed Cafe at The Alkaff Mansion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHawker Hustlers: Hipster hawker Ray Yeo of Bei-Ing Dimsum Club on reinventing dim sum and his love for all things Japan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAzmaya’s most popular broth choices include Japanese classics such as bonito flakes, tonkatsu and seaweed.If this wagyu bonanza is too meaty for your liking, there are also seafood alternatives to switch things up.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/frosted-by-fang/:['Hidden inside a quiet HDB estate in the middle of Tai Seng — that’s probably not a spot you’d expect to find a modern artisan bakery like Frosted by Fang.\xa0However, you might soon see more pastry aficionados in the area, as fans of the popular home-based bakery\xa0will probably be headed down its first physical store.Admittedly, it might not seem to be the most convenient location, but it’s smack in the middle of three MRT stations, so you can get there easily on the many buses servicing the area.Frosted by Fang is headed by eponymous founder Lee Su Fang, who first founded it eight years ago as a self-taught baker.After gaining numerous fans and getting the opportunity to pop-up as one of the guest bakers-in-residence at Orchard Central’s Baker X, Lee decided it was time for a brick-and-mortar location.For its debut, Frosted by Fang will be a takeaway concept located on the first floor at one of the HDB flats at Joo Seng Green.Though the decor is kept simple, it stands out from the rest of the tenants. Its decor welcomes customers with elegant neutral tones and light birch accents.As with its decor, the bakes here mostly keep to the basics but contain some tasteful touches to elevate them.Frosted by Fang’s menu changes monthly and August features a few interesting creations — namely the coconut, yuzu and lychee mochi donut (S$4) and classic carrot walnut cake (S$6.50).\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTalad Thai Banana opens at AMK Hub with S$2 opening promotion for the first 100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Feuds: Saizeriya vs Milan Shokudo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatisserie Cle brings its well-crafted pastries to new River Valley flagship for fifth anniversary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you like a bit more of a chew in your pastries, the former will satisfy you with its unique gelatinous texture. On the other hand, the latter is a fragrant treat where the hearty base pairs well with the frosting.There’s also the chocolate rum cherry tiramisu (S$16), a rather unique twist on a traditional tiramisu, which consists of rum-soaked cherries, chocolate ganache and espresso ladyfinger biscuits instead of your usual mascarpone custard.For those who enjoy bakery staples more, cookies and brownies can also be found on the menu.Cookie monsters will get a choice of two flavours to munch on: Rosemary pistachio cranberry (S$3.80) and browned butter miso chocolate chip (S$3.50),While cookie fans can get heated about their preferred cookie textures, you get the best of both worlds here; the former is chunky and gooey while the latter sports a crisp and chewy profile.In case you want something really decadent, Frosted by Fang’s fudgy dark chocolate lavender espresso brownie (S$5.50) will scratch that itch with its potent 70% dark chocolate, accentuated with kisses of florals and coffee.The brand also offers a customisable cakes (from S$70 for six-inch single tier) service, perfect for those special occasions.A post shared by Frosted By Fang (@frostedbyfang)It offers a variety of flavour combos ranging from the tried-and-true chocolate mixed berries to quirkier styles including maple blueberry French toast and matcha strawberry, with the cake base and fillings customisable to your preferences.Diners can drop a message on the Instagram page to reserve bakes for self-collection or delivery on the days the shop is in operation, with weekly pre-orders opening on Monday.For more ideas on what to eat, read our stories on where to find the best pizza in Singapore and a preview of the exciting new HDB-themed cafe and bar by Mama Diam.You can book a ride to Frosted by Fang at Macpherson to snag some of the bakes.4 Upper Aljunied Lane, 01-02\nNearest MRT station: Woodeligh, Tai Seng and Mattar\nOpen: Thursday to Sunday (11am to 6pm or sold out)4 Upper Aljunied Lane, 01-02\nNearest MRT station: Woodeligh, Tai Seng and Mattar\nOpen: Thursday to Sunday (11am to 6pm or sold out)AuthorEvan started off writing about food on Instagram, before joining outlets such as Buro and Confirm Good to pursue his passion.

The slices are thick with a substantial amount of filling, and the kueh batter is delicate with a soft, cake-like texture. We recommend heating up the peanut butter and peanut pancake if you aren’t consuming it on the spot, as the filling tends to clump together when the pancake has cooled down.\xa0\xa0For more ideas on what to eat, read our stories on affordable mala xiang guo and Pretzel Planet.\xa0Munchi Pancakes, My Pancake 面煎粿, Bu Bu Gao Sheng and Mian Mian Bu Duan are on the GrabFood delivery service and offer free delivery (up to S$3 off) with GrabUnlimited.

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/noo-cheng-adam-road-big-prawn-mee-noodles/:['Two brothers man this stall in Adam Road that has made a name for itself for serving super luxurious Hokkien prawn mee soup in a stall called Noo Cheng Adam Road Big Prawn Mee.Started by their father more than 30 years ago, this stall sees younger brother Teo Aik Cheng, 43, cooking and manning the stall from 9.30am to 4.30pm, while older brother Teo Wah Ann, 49, takes over and cooks in time to offer their very popular noodle soup from 6.30pm to 2am.You don’t go to this stall for the ordinarily priced offerings below S$5 – you go to luxuriate in the flavours and textures of large red leg prawns at S$7 per bowl, and when available, I recommend you opt for the king tiger prawns, 250g in size, priced at S$13 per bowl.Do the brothers’ cooking justify their reputation? The answer’s yes! As Teo Wah Ann knowledgeably said, while not divulging the secrets behind the soup: “It is important that we use sea prawns and deep sea prawns for the flavour of the soup, as they add that special punch!”And of course, pork bones go into the soup as well. Other ingredients used to make the stock include additional prawn heads, which have first been sautéed in oil to get a texture reminiscent of French bouillabaisse (seafood soup).Whole crabs are also stewed in the broth to add even more depth of flavour. I can tell from the choice of crabs that the brothers can really cook, because they have selected thin-shelled mud crabs, which have just grown new shells after moulting. It is easy to bite into the shells even if they have not been cracked well.The crabs contain rich roe, boiled till hard. I would have preferred the crabs less cooked, but I reckon that they cook them very well so that the crabs won’t turn bad easily.Priced at S$13 a bowl, this is a lovely dish to savour. Opt for the dry noodles, tossed in a concoction of chilli\xa0 — and I suspect some sort of dried seafood — which Teo Wah Ann, dismisses as just simple chilli powder.Adam Food Centre, 01-17, 2 Adam Road\nNearest MRT station: Botanic Gardens\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (10.30am to 4.30pm, 6.30pm to 11.30pm)Adam Food Centre, 01-17, 2 Adam Road\nNearest MRT station: Botanic Gardens\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (10.30am to 4.30pm, 6.30pm to 11.30pm)Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/heavens-indian-curry/:['Heaven’s Indian Curry is famous for its thosai and appam, and we were especially excited to try the latter.Also known as hoppers, these are bowl-shaped pancakes made from fermented rice flour, similar to thosai. However, for appam, the sides are crispy and thin, while the centre is thick, spongy and soft. Making good appam is definitely not an easy technique to master.We tried the plain (S$1.80 for two), cheese (S$1.50) and egg appam (S$1.50). They are served with shredded coconut and delicate, powdery brown sugar. All the appam is delicious and done really well, especially the egg version. The edges of the appam is paper-thin and lightly browned, with a literal melt-in-your-mouth texture. The spongy centre, which is just slightly sour due to the fermentation process, picked up the coconut and sugar accompaniments well. The combination is pleasing and very moreish.The egg appam stands out because of the runny yolk which added to the spongy, moist texture of the appam’s centre. The added fragrance of the egg makes the appam much more appetising.We also tried the egg thosai (S$1.50), which has a good texture and thickness (about 0.5cm). Soft and moist, but not oily, the flatbread mopped up the tasty dhal and fresh coconut chutney well. However it lacked a certain X-factor, especially when compared to the star dish, the appam.The stall also sells putu mayam at S$1.80 per set.Ghim Moh Market & Food Centre, 01-26, 20 Ghim Moh Road\nNearest MRT station: Buona Vista\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (6am to 1pm)Ghim Moh Market & Food Centre, 01-26, 20 Ghim Moh Road\nNearest MRT station: Buona Vista\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (6am to 1pm)Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

Not only is this eatery a part of the Singapore food heritage, the popiah here was simply shiok!In fact, it was rumoured that late President S R Nathan’s domestic helper came regularly to tapau (take away) popiah home.The skin is nice and translucent, yet is chock-full of filling without breaking. The sauce doesn’t ooze out either, which can make it messy to eat. The texture is chewy and left that wonderful sweet aftertaste upon chewing. The turnip filling had that savoury-sweet taste.It’s no surprise since they have added deshelled Sri Lankan crabmeat into the filling. You can’t really see the meat, but you can definitely appreciate the crustaceans’ natural sweetness.Lastly, homemade crispy bits made from fish paste added a nice crunch to the popiah. Put them all together and you get a wonderful marriage of flavours and textures — chewy (skin), crunchy (crispy fish bits) and juicy (turnip). This is the beauty of an expertly rolled and firmly packed popiah.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/exotic-food-singapore/:['Hands down, Singapore is one of the best countries to visit in the world. Besides boasting a rich multicultural society, our city is also home to a diverse range of cuisines.\xa0We dare say it’s one of the top gastronomic destinations around the world, for our F&B scene is brimming with options ranging from Michelin-starred hawker stalls to excellent fine-dining restaurants.\xa0But beyond the usual local dishes that we know and love (yes, chilli crab, we’re looking at you), did you know that we’re also no stranger to a myriad of exotic food in Singapore? Imagine savouring a goat’s brain, crocodile foot and deer penis – they’re truly every adventurous eater’s dream.While bizarre, they’re certainly worth a try. After all, how can you call yourself a true-blue foodie if you’ve never tried these unique eats in Singapore?\xa0 \xa0First up on the list of exotic food in Singapore is none other than sup otak. The dish directly translates to goat’s brain soup — a hearty stew-like broth that boasts meaty chunks of goat’s brain. While it may look intimidating, its taste is quite flavourful, with a texture reminiscent of semi-firm tofu. It’s also simmered in a potent soup that’s stewed with spices and has a perfect blend of meatiness and oomph.\xa0Sup otak (S$$8.50 for small, S$16 for medium, S$24 for large) is sold at a dining place in Singapore with an interesting story: Haji M Abdul Rajak Mutton Soup & Sup Kambing. Located at Upper Boon Keng Market and Food Centre, it’s a hawker stall touting over seven decades of history.\xa0The establishment first sold mutton soup at a pushcart back in 1955, before it moved to its current location at the hawker centre in 1975. It has resided there since. Today, it’s famed for its soups and unique mutton cuts and innards – goat’s brains included.When it comes to exploring unique food in Singapore, turtle soups are a must to include in your itinerary. Tan Ter Seng Herbs Restaurant is a top spot to hit up for the best turtle soups in Singapore, what with its nourishing broths and tender turtle meat.\xa0This family-run restaurant is one of the last few standing eateries serving turtle soups in Singapore. Founded in 1946 by cook-entrepreuner Tan Ah Sai, he brought the trade of turtle soup to our sunny shores when he migrated from China to Singapore.\xa0He created his own original recipes, which feature freshwater softshell turtle meat that’s simmered in a soup for over twelve hours daily. The result is a rich, herbaceous broth that’s chock-full of collagen and heart.\xa0The restaurant is best known for its claypot turtle soup (from S$31.10), which is prepared with over twenty different herbs and spices. Alternatively, the double-boiled turtle soup (from S$17.90) is another popular item on the menu. When it comes to exotic food in Singapore, you’d want to check The Dragon Chamber’s crocodile foot (S$66) off your bucket list.\xa0Also named ‘The Dragon’s Claw’, this one-of-a-kind dish is a Singapore-farmed crocodile foot that’s braised in a herbal sauce. It’s beautifully plated, in which the ginormous paw rests atop a bed of kale and is served in a sizzling pan. It’s no wonder it’s the star of the menu!We hear the texture of the dish reminds one of pig’s trotters, thanks to its juicy, gelatinous skin. Moreover, not only does crocodile meat taste like chicken, but it also boasts medicinal properties!On the hunt for eateries dishing up unique seafood in Singapore? Then, you should make a beeline for Soon Heng Food Delights’ fried shark lor mee (S$5). The dish spins a unique twist to the traditional lor mee, incorporating fried shark nuggets instead of the usual fried fish fritters.\xa0Situated at Tanjong Pagar Plaza Market and Food Centre, the hawker stall is where you can relish tasty shark meat in Singapore. It’s helmed by an elderly couple, Madam Chua and Mr Tang, who mentioned in other reports that their dish was inspired by the previous stall owner who sold shark meat fritters. They then decided to use the unusual protein as toppings for their lor mee.\xa0It’s a smart business move, as Soon Heng’s fame is largely attributed to this exotic, albeit local, dish. Diners would travel all across the city just to have a taste of its fried shark lor mee!\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Junction Westgate opening with promos; will house 23 tenants, including new halal teppanyaki\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHawker Hustlers: Hipster hawker Ray Yeo of Bei-Ing Dimsum Club on reinventing dim sum and his love for all things Japan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s not just sup otak at Haji M Abdul Rajak Mutton Soup & Sup Kambing, there are other signature cuts of mutton available, too. Next up on our list of recommended exotic food in Singapore is sup lidah (S$11 for small, S$14 for medium, S$16 for large), also known as goat’s tongue soup.\xa0If goat’s brains aren’t your thing, sup lidah is a great start for beginners. Served in a piping hot bowl of peppery soup, the dish is packed with tender and succulent slices of goat’s tongue. It has a chewy, QQ texture and isn’t heavy on the gaminess.Slurp on the soup with a side of bread (50 cents), and the combination is absolutely delish. You’re missing out if you haven’t tried crocodile soups in Singapore. We recommend checking out 大幸运山瑞 Very Lucky Turtle Soup if you’re craving unique seafood in Singapore.\xa0Tucked away on the second floor of Berseh Food Centre, it’s a hawker stall that’s spearheaded by Uncle Chu, who has been manning the stall for over 40 years.While the eatery is famed for its signature soft-shelled turtle soup, one dish truly stood out from the crowd — the stewed crocodile tail (S$25 for small, S$30 for medium and S$40 for large).\xa0Served in a steaming claypot, the soft, melt-in-your-mouth chunks of crocodile meat have been simmered in an aromatic concoction that’s brewed with Chinese herbs. This is a go-to order among regulars, and we totally see why. While pig trotter jelly may not be as unique of a dish as compared to other exotic food in Singapore, it’s also not all that commonplace. You can find it at 老两 Lao Liang Pig Trotter Jelly & Shark Meat – a reputed hawker stall that has operated for more than five decades.While it also serves an intriguing shark meat dish that’s served cold, it’s best known for its pig trotter jelly (S$5 for small, S$8 for medium, S$10 for large).\xa0For the uninitiated, pig trotter jelly is a Teochew delicacy that’s unique to the hawker culture in Singapore. It sees diced meat and collagen-rich skin soaked in an umami-soaked broth that solidifies into a savoury aspic when refrigerated. The jelly-like meat cubes are best enjoyed with a tangy chilli sauce. This one’s for the adventurous eaters only: Deer penis. You heard us right – deer penis, also known as lu bian, is one of the most unique eats in Singapore.\xa0The organ is typically used in traditional Chinese medicine for its therapeutic properties, and it is also known to be an aphrodisiac. However, the restaurant recommends that male diners try this dish, as it’s said to improve male virility.\xa0Deer penis (S$35) is sold exclusively at Imperial Restaurant as a preorder item. Fret not, as the dish isn’t the least bit intimidating as it sounds. It comes in a fragrant broth that’s brewed with slices of deer penis, herbs, a dried seahorse and more.Note that you’ll have to call up the restaurant for reservations a day in advance.As mentioned, besides pig trotter jelly, diners can also look forward to the shark meat (SS$8 for small, S$10 for medium) that’s sold at 老两 Lao Liang Pig Trotter Jelly & Shark Meat. You’ll be fooled by its appearance, for it bears an uncanny resemblance to fish slices.\xa0Upon popping it into your mouth, you’ll be surprised by how fresh and tender the shark meat is. The flesh is also slightly rubbery and firm in texture. To best savour the flavours of the meat, do pair it with the homemade plum sauce that accompanies the dish.

And of course, there is a long waiting time. We recorded a good 45 minutes from the moment we ordered until our dish arrived.Was the wait worth it? Yes! Eng’s unique rendition of this simple but familiar noodle dish is innovative and, in its own way, very delicious.One of the best parts is its thicker yet “QQ” (springy) noodles. It is the perfect canvas for the other key ingredient: Eng’s fiery, red-hot chilli sauce.So red that it almost blends in with the red plastic plate, the chilli is so fiery that it set off a stinging sensation in our mouths. It is also strangely addictive. We subdued the sting with ice-cold drinks, and went back for more. If spice isn’t your thing, you can request a mildly sweet, soya-sauce-based sauce instead.The dumplings are meaty and compact. We enjoyed five pieces in our dish.

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/oyster-omelette-singapore/:['Ask any man or woman on the street what they think is the most underrated hawker dish locally, and I’m sure quite a few answers will pop up. To us, this honour goes to the fried oyster omelette in Singapore, a decadent hawker classic that is also referred to as “orh luak” or “orh jian”.You might be confused by the naming convention of the oyster omelette at certain stalls. Most stalls sell both fried oyster (蚝煎), and oyster egg (蚝蛋). There are differences, though, so it comes down to your personal preference on how you’d like your omelette to be.The latter usually contains no starch and is more eggy and fluffy, while the former has the addition of starch to produce a myriad of textures, ranging from moist and gooey to gratuitously crispy. This (the starchy kind) is the more popular rendition and is usually what is referred to when talking about “oyster omelette” in Singapore.\xa0Whether you like your omelette starchy or crispy, you might find it tough to find a good plate of fried oyster omelette in Singapore, especially since the last few years have seen a spate of closures among stalwarts who specialised in the dish.Hence, we’ve curated a list of the stalls where you can get the best fried oyster omelettes in Singapore, including both ends of the textural spectrum, for those looking for a plate of briny indulgence.Far East Plaza, 02-10/11/12/13, 14 Scotts Road\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (11am to 9pm)Why visit? If you’re looking for a place with hawker classics done extremely well, yet can be enjoyed in a nice air-conditioned setting in Orchard, Maddie’s Kitchen is a must-visit.\xa0This cosy eatery in Far East Plaza not only serves —\xa0in our opinion — the best oyster omelette in Singapore, it also aces classics such as seafood soup and hor fun, with quality comparable to other popular hawker and zichar stalls.Price range: $$Crowd favourites: Getting the oyster omelette (from S$11.80) is imperative at Maddie’s Kitchen if you enjoy your orh luak crispy. The rendition here crackles with a biscuit-like consistency and comes topped with large, succulent oysters.If you need some carbs to go with it, then pair it with the pork chop rice (S$6.80). It is drenched in a deluge of delicious, comforting Hainanese curry that might rival that from other famous brands. Berseh Food Centre, 01-32, 166 Jalan Besar\nOpen: Wednesday to Sunday (6pm to 12am)Why visit? Located in the underrated Berseh area, Lim’s Fried Oyster was considered somewhat of a hidden gem only known to the discerning hawker connoisseur just a few years ago.That has since changed — it’s now widely known as a must-visit for anyone on the hunt for the best oyster omelette in Singapore.

If that’s not indicative of quality, we’re not sure what is.Price range: $Crowd favourites: While most fans would concede Song Kee doesn’t use the biggest oysters in its fried oyster dish (from S$5), many swear by the expertly executed texture that balances both fluff and crisp.435A Hougang Avenue 8\nOpen: Wednesday to Sunday (11am to 7pm)Why visit?

The food centre has no shortage of popular stalls, but Ang Sa Lee remains a hot favourite among the night owls that frequent the spot.Price range: $Crowd favourites: This stall fries up a moist and starchy fried oyster (from S$5), which acts as perfect foil to other frequently ordered items at Chomp Chomp, such as satay, sambal stingray and sugarcane juice.Old Airport Road Food Centre, 01-28, 51 Old Airport Road\nOpen: Thursday to Tuesday (11am to 11pm)Why visit?

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/teo-heng-porridge-stall/:['It is easy to miss out on this stall since it is tucked away in a corner on the ground floor of Hong Lim Food Centre, but regulars will know that it is arguably one of the best Teochew porridge stalls in Singapore.It is also one of the oldest stalls having been in existence. It was handed to Leow Yer Kim (born 1925) in the 1940s, but it was already helmed by two generations prior — Yer Kim’s grandfather started the stall, then it was handed over to his uncle, then to Yer Kim.Teo Heng Teochew Porridge is now run by the fourth generation — “Ah Yong” and sister “Ah Lan” run the stall at Hong Lim Food Centre, while older brother “Ah Heng” run another outlet at Amoy Street Food Centre.Every element of this Teochew classic is done well here, right down to overall light flavours and the porridge which has the right proportion of broken rice bits and lots of ahm\xa0(porridge water).The\xa0whole fish option (ang go li, ikan kurau or whatever Ah Yong can get from the market) is a main highlight as it is done differently from what other Teochew porridge stalls do it — which is steamed then left cold.Here, it is gently poached in a cauldron of stewed kiam chye (preserved mustard leaves) only upon your order and comes supremely fresh and sweet every time. The accompanying soft kiam chye on top\xa0 is also nice and lightly salty.The older generation will order the smaller rabbit fish (pek tor he) instead, especially during the fish’s spawning season when the milt and roe in the fish is abundant. It’s a must-have during Chinese New Year as it is believed that it brings good luck for the rest of the year.Other highlights include cold squid with innards, perfectly steamed to a soft chewiness and served with a salty sweet plum sauce.\nIt also has stuffed tau poks (S$1.50 each), which is a little unusual — shredded duck meat, fishcake, pork skin and pork fat braised in lor (soy gravy) and cucumbers are stuffed into toasty tau pok and eaten as it is.Eaten with chilli, it is a wonderful mix of soft and crunchy textures, fat and braised flavours.Teo Heng Teochew Porridge’s range of lor ingredients is also extensive — duck, pork belly, intestines, pig skin, tau kwa (hard tofu) and tau pok (beancurd puff) — and everything is nicely stewed, from the moist meats to the clean intestines.The flavouring of its lor has a light soy savouriness with a bit of sweetness to round off the taste.The braised eggs are also a highlight — they are done Japanese-style with a reasonably soft yolk centre.Teo Heng also offers two types of chilli sauces — the traditional sour chilli with minced garlic and a grounded chilli version, which is sour but a little sweeter.Tau cheo (preserved soy beans) is also available but you’ll have to ask them for it. They are best eaten with the fish and fishcake dishes.The stall used to sell whole steamed lobsters, but as of late, we have not seen it on offer — it’s either been phased out or only sold during special occasions.Its handmade fishcakes are nicely done with no fillers and have a lovely soft bite but we would have preferred a little more lard and herbs mixed in.The only small niggle to an otherwise perfect Teochew porridge stall.Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/derek-cheong-gopizza/:['“Hey, are you Derek from MasterChef?”That was how Derek Cheong met the CEO of GoPizza.It’s no surprise that heavyweights in the F&B industry are familiar with the spirited 25-year-old – he was crowned the winner of the television programme MasterChef Singapore’s second season back in 2021.He impressed both the audience and judges with his mastery of Asian flavours, and is now a sought-after private dining chef.Two years after Cheong’s victory, the regional CEO of GoPizza, Kelvin Sia, recognised him outside a pizza restaurant one day. The two struck up a conversation and Sia pitched becoming a franchisee for the famous Korean pizza chain.\xa0It was a decision Cheong didn’t take lightly. After all, he always saw himself as a fine dining chef. But armed with a desire to liven up local hawker culture, he took a leap of faith and went the unconventional route of setting up his own pizza store at Pasir Ris Hawker Centre.This collaboration marks his first foray into the hawker scene — and a successful one at that. Today, Cheong dishes up novel Indian-style pizzas that encapsulate his love for the cuisine and its complex flavours.Besides being a master baker at GoPizza, Cheong has worn many hats in his culinary career.His parents were hawkers who sold rojak and satay at hawker centres. Having grown up around food, it was inevitable that he, too, developed a love for cooking when he was 18. He started off following recipes from YouTube and cookbooks published by professional chefs.\xa0After famously taking the crown during the televised cooking competition, the former engineering student from Nanyang Technological University took a leave of absence of two years, then eventually decided to leave school to pursue his culinary career full-time.While most might find it a rash decision, it was a choice he never regretted.\xa0He landed a commis chef gig at French establishment Mirazur’s three-month residency in Singapore.Mirazur is a three-Michelin-starred restaurant and was ranked first on the World’s 50 Best Restaurants list in 2019.“What I learnt there — regarding the operation and business aspects — were incorporated into my private dining business, as well as knowledge and techniques of ingredients,” he says.\xa0Not only did his stint give him insight into the ins-and-outs of a professional kitchen, it also allowed him to experiment with a repertoire of ingredients and cooking techniques. Cheong then launched an artisanal chocolate brand, Kakkow, where chocolates are made using unconventional ingredients such as vegetables, legumes and fungi.A post shared by Kakkow - Artisan Chocolates (@kakkowsg)He also founded a private dining and food consultancy concept, Flavourium, where he could explore his interests and more flavours through his dishes. A post shared by Flavourium (@flavouriumsg)“As an artist, I always love to create and innovate new stuff. I do get sick of cooking the same thing over and over again,” Cheong adds. He calls himself a “see-mood” chef — a trait that helps him hone his craft, push the boundaries of his cooking and dish up new unique recipes.\xa0Under the Flavourium brand, he hosts tasting menus inspired by international cuisines at his home in Pasir Ris. With only three sessions a week from Friday to Sunday, the place is usually fully booked out two months in advance and sees eight to 10 diners at a time.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHawker Hustlers: Hipster hawker Ray Yeo of Bei-Ing Dimsum Club on reinventing dim sum and his love for all things Japan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15 best fish head curry in Singapore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet this 28-year-old 2nd-gen zi char boss and her struggles to keep family-run business alive; made S$50 sales during pandemic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite his experience in cuisines of all types, Cheong wanted to introduce Indian-style pizzas to the GoPizza store in Pasir Ris. It’s the only branch in Singapore that focuses on pizzas inspired by Indian cuisine.\xa0“My philosophy in food is that it has to be umami-driven,” he explains. He also doesn’t see any other chef making such pizza recipes.“There’s a story behind every dish in India,” he muses. “I really enjoy the complexity of flavours in Indian cuisine.”The reception so far has taken Cheong by surprise.\xa0“We see an increased number of Indian customers that come and watch a Chinese guy make pizza,” he jokes. “It’s quite heartwarming and they introduced [the store to] all their family and friends.” His customers have also commented that his dishes are authentic to Indian cuisine.The reception from the public has been wonderful and the residents who pop by Cheong’s hawker stall are incredibly supportive. This motivates him to create better, bolder dishes, where he can let his creativity take flight.Certain days are busier than others and his parents occasionally help out at the stall to manage the crowd.\xa0Says Cheong: “(It’s) not like a nine-to-five job. You can’t take off on your birthday because (as a hawker) you’re celebrating someone else’s birthday.” We were excited to try Cheong’s unique, fusion dishes, which epitomise classic Indian dishes that we know and love, but in pizza form.\xa0All the pizzas are made from scratch and baked in-house.\xa0The Chef’s Specials series (all priced at S$10.90) are Cheong’s top recommendations from the GoPizza repertoire — and of course, includes his own Indian-style creations. These come in a plethora of flavours, such as mushroom masala, palak paneer (spinach cottage cheese curry), butter chicken and more.For those who prefer simpler flavours, there are also classic options to choose from, such as the\xa0 Hawaiian (S$8.90) and Four Cheese Maniac (S$12.90).\xa0Though they may not be the stars of the show, the side dishes also make for the perfect accompaniment to the pizzas. Think Madras curry wings (from S$8.90), Chicken 65 (from S$8.90) and mushroom pakora (fritters, S$7.90), all of which are Cheong’s creations.We loved the butter chicken pizza, which was rich, creamy and chock-full of butter chicken cubes.Composed of GoPizza’s signature pizza dough base and a new topping-and-gravy combination by Cheong, the pizza reminds us of biting into a pillowy naan dipped in a savoury butter chicken curry — so delicious.\xa0The palak paneer pizza is another decadent dish that you can’t sleep on. It’s aromatic, herbaceous and oh-so-addictive. You can’t help but reach for a second slice. Despite the challenges of working at a hawker stall, Cheong is all about the constant pursuit of culinary excellence. He has plans to expand the menu and include seasonal specials in the future.\xa0He also dreams of helming his own Michelin-starred restaurant, where he can focus on other cuisines that he’s passionate about, such as Indian and African.\xa0For now, besides his work on GoPizza, he’s focusing on his food consultancy and private dining business.Cheong is still churning up new dishes on the sidelines, such as a specially designed menu for the new Surrey Hills Grocer Cafe at Raffles City, and a recent four-hands dinner series with Law Jia-Jun from Province in May.If there’s one thing he wishes to convey to aspiring chefs, it’s for them to consistently expand their knowledge of different techniques and ingredients.\xa0According to Cheong, “You’ve got to have an undying thirst for knowledge to always learn new things and develop your palate.” For more eastside eats, check out So Lemak or the pig organ’s soup at Koh Brother’s Tampines outlet.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/honbo-taste-test/:["Burgers might be quintessential American fare, but its reach is pervasive as chefs and chains around the world dole out their own renditions.\xa0Diners in Singapore are blessed with a host of local outfits offering a slew of quality and affordable burgers, such as Three Buns, Wildfire Burgers and Project Burgs. In recent years, however, foreign franchises have also landed in Singapore, making the food-mad city its home.These include Shake Shack, Five Guys, Eggslut, and now, Honbo.\xa0The latest international brand to land in Singapore, Honbo — unlike its counterparts — is not American. It’s a Hong Kong chain that serves not just regular steakhouse burgers, but also more… grounded burgers that are literally smashing (more on that later).To the uninitiated, the name “Honbo” is just another quirky moniker. For locals in its hometown of Hong Kong, however, they know that Honbo is simply Cantonese for the word “hamburger”.That is exactly what founder Michael Chan had sought to perfect when he returned to Hong Kong from America — a simple, straightforward American burger. Honbo quickly gained popularity and was most recently crowned the Eater’s Choice for Best Burger in 2021 by Lifestyle Asia Hong Kong.\xa0Six years and six outlets in Hong Kong later, Honbo decided to make Singapore its first overseas destination.A welcome addition to the F&B offerings in Chijmes, Honbo stands out as the only burger specialty store amongst its predominantly Japanese neighbours.\xa0Reminiscent of an American diner, the space is casual and comfortable, with light beats that aren’t too intrusive. With burgers priced from S$15 to S$28 on Honbo’s menu, they are a great option for any occasion. However, while delectable, they may not offer the best value for your money.We went for the extremes, from the signature Honbo (S$18), a basic smashed burger bearing the name of the eatery, to The Gold Standard (S$28), what I call Honbo’s all-in-one burger. Both tasted as you would expect, which is not bad at all.\xa0Decked with two thick 4oz beef patties, two slices of cheese, some bacon and complete with Honbo’s standard array of toppings, the sheer scale of The Gold Standard takes the prize.\xa0Try to fit all that in a single bite and you would be rewarded with a mouthful of pure satisfaction. The flavours are balanced, while the bacon slices and iceberg lettuce offer a textural contrast to the palate.Honbo is a smashed burger, featuring a thinner patty that is hand-smashed under the griddle to give a crispier texture, compared to its juicier, meatier sibling. This offers a refreshing change to the more commonly seen steakhouse burgers.What is common between the two burgers is the bun. The oh-so-fluffy buns. This is hands down the highlight of our meal.\xa0The potato milk buns are fragrant, soft and pillowy. They maintained their structure even under the weight of The Gold Standard and would immediately bounce back when pressed. They are also not too buttery, so their flavour does not get in the way of the rest of the burger.\xa0It comes as no surprise that the buns are artisanal, based on an exclusive recipe developed by renowned baker, Eric Kayser. Honbo isn’t alone in hyping up the quality of its buns, but it’s certainly The One that stood out for me. We capped off the meal with a glass of apple pie iced tea (S$7), homemade in-store with freshly juiced apples, cinnamon syrup and black tea.\xa0It was not too sweet, which apple juice tends to be, but I imagine that the distinctive cinnamon flavour — to augment the “pie” in its name — could be a hit or miss for people, depending on personal preferences.In addition to Honbo’s burgers, we had the chilli fries (S$15) — because why stop at regular fries — and the coleslaw (S$5) for balance (IYKYK).While the fries, when enjoyed by themselves, stood out for being fully filled with potato, making for a satisfying bite (I am looking at you soggy, empty fries), both side dishes were nothing to write home about.\xa0The coleslaw was crispy, watery and tangy, as one would expect, but the portion was small. Meanwhile, we found ourselves struggling to taste any of the chilli, cheese or beef toppings in the chilli fries.\xa0But here is a pro tip: Order the chilli crunch fried egg add-on (S$2.50) and mix it in with the fries, letting the bright yellow yolk flow through the dish. Now we are talking. For me, the patty is the soul of any burger — it’s the climax and the highlight. Honbo went the extra mile to grind its patties in-house from USDA prime-grade American beef for the full depth of flavour; alas this was ultimately a miss for my tastebuds.\xa0Cooked to medium doneness, the thick patties in The Gold Standard were still not as juicy as I had hoped. Meanwhile, the smashed patties in the Honbo did not differ all that much from their thicker counterparts. Yes, there was less to bite into, but they were neither more crispy or more caramelised as the hype made them out to be.Finally, we did not manage to try some of the chain’s signatures, such as the Flagrant Smash sauce imported from Hong Kong or the much raved sweet potato fries (S$8). I would understand if it were Sunday (as inventory dwindles before the next shipment), but to be out of stock right at the start of the weekend (Saturday lunch) is very unfortunate.According to Chan, we don’t know this yet, but we will be missing the taste of Honbo soon and will be dying to return for another bite. Let’s see if that checks out!Is it conducive to conversation? Definitely! With the diner-style seating, spacious design and light music, it is great for catching up with friends.Is a reservation necessary? Not to worry: We headed down during peak Saturday lunch time but there was barely a queue, you will be ushered to your seat in no time.How to get there? You may walk for six minutes from Bras Basah MRT station (Circle Line) or from City Hall MRT station (North-South Line/ East-West Line).\xa0HungryGoWhere paid for its meal at this restaurant for this review.

But if you’re craving something a lil’ different from the usual ice cream and waffles, then a comforting bowl of tang shui (traditional Chinese dessert) in Singapore certainly won’t disappoint.\xa0Directly translated to “sweet soup”, tang shui or tong sui refers to refreshing, old-school Chinese desserts that span the likes of red bean soup, tang yuan (glutinous rice balls) and black sesame paste.

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/from-scratch-sourdough-bread/:['From Scratch is a series exploring the origins of foods that are popular in Singapore and the work that goes into making them.\xa0Soft, fluffy with a slight tang. These are the key characteristics of a good sourdough loaf.\xa0Some may surmise that the sourdough bread hails from Germany, a bread Mecca, or from France, home of the iconic baguette.\xa0Truth is, sourdough bread predates either country, and has its origins rooted in ancient times.\xa0Its creation was a wonderful coincidence, really.\xa0It is believed that microorganisms accidentally entered the bread dough of ancient Egyptians. This created wild yeast that could naturally leaven its bread.\xa0Despite being thousands of years old, naturally leavened breads in Singapore rose to popularity only in the past few years.\xa0A lot of the success could be attributed to the Covid-19 circuit breaker, which saw the rise of the home baker, notes co-founder of Starter Lab, Min Siah, 43.\xa0The bakery specialises in wholesome, naturally leavened breads, as well as sandwiches that feature its famed house sourdough.\xa0With its current prominence and success, you may be surprised to find that Starter Lab had humble beginnings.\xa0In 2016, co-founder Siah had left a flourishing corporate role and moved to Bali, a popular tourist destination in Indonesia. It was there that she brought Starter Lab to life with her co-founder, who has since left the business.\xa0The bakery was operating from a small hole-in-the-wall space and food markets. From there, it grew slowly and steadily with the support of international and local fans.“A lot of people from (places) like Singapore, Australia, Hong Kong, Jakarta would come buy our bread and say things like, ‘this is amazing!’. They would buy 10 loaves, bring it home, slice it and keep it in the freezer,” recounts Siah.\xa0After its success in Bali, Starter Lab came to Singapore in 2019 when Siah saw an opportunity to reach a bigger market.\xa0“Our market (in Bali) was mostly Westerners,” says Siah. Singapore, being a cultural melting pot, was the perfect spot to hone the appreciation for sourdough bread.\xa0Her leap of faith paid off.“(Starter Lab Singapore) did so much better than we expected when we first opened and launched,” recalls Siah. “I think bringing the ‘Bali vibe’ really helped.”With the advantage of greater space and better equipment, the bakery was able to grow its product range to include more pastries and baked foods. It also expanded its client base to restaurants as well, supplying sourdough to the eateries on a wholesale basis.\xa0Siah’s co-founder, who previously worked at the famed Tartine Bakery, brought its baking techniques to Starter Lab in Bali. These included aspects such as what type of flour was mixed into the starter, what kind of mixing technique was used on the dough and the shape of the bread.\xa0Theoretically, one could easily bake sourdough at home, given that the science and technique behind it are the same. However, the reality is much more complicated.“(There are) so many things to look out for. We always say this business is built on just four ingredients and it should seem simple, but it’s quite complex,” says Siah.\xa0“We look out for everything from the temperature in the environment, to the temperature in the water, the baker’s hands, (and even) how happy the baker is that day.” As the baker needs to feel the dough and adjust the approach accordingly, baking sourdough relies heavily on the baker’s expertise.\xa0“We used to send our bakers (from Singapore) to Bali to do something like a boot camp training, because the conditions there are so much tougher,” she tells HungryGoWhere.“Bali has a similar daily climate, but the bacteria are completely different. The ovens are gas and have different hot spots. If you can manage that and create such amazing products, then you’re ‘sweet’ when you come back to Singapore.”\xa0The entire process to bake the loaves takes a long time – 36 hours, to be exact.\xa0“People (ask) what’s the secret ingredient? Is it love? It’s not actually love. It’s time,” says Siah.The day starts as early as three in the morning for the crew, and ends in the late afternoon. After the bread is done baking, the loaves are dispatched from the factory to the main Starter Lab outlet, Little Farms and its wholesale restaurant clients, including the Michelin-starred Restaurant Jag and Osteria Mozza.In all, the bakery produces 3,000 loaves weekly at its factory, with just 10 bakers in-house.True to her free-spirited nature, Siah says there are no concrete plans for Starter Lab, though she aspires to grow the brand locally and regionally. Something on the radar in the near future would be hosting more bread-making workshops and collaborating with local and international bakeries to share knowledge. \xa0\xa0“That is the whole point of bread baking, right? One is to bake bread with people, to bring people together. The other one in the bread community is collaboration to share knowledge,” Siah adds.\xa0\xa0Sourdough contains no commercial yeast. Instead, you have a starter — also known as the “mother” — that is made up of flour and water. It helps to create a light fluffiness in sourdough-based bakes.\xa0“It’s just four ingredients: Water, starter, flour and salt. With that, you can create something that is really wholesome for your body and delicious as well, with a complex taste to it,” says Siah.\xa0The starter is fed a mixture of water and flour. Once incorporated, it is left alone to allow it to become active.\xa0Signs of an active starter that is ready to be used include bubbles at the surface of the starter and the starter doubling or tripling in height.\xa0Once the starter is active, it is mixed with flour, water and salt. The result is a sticky mass of dough that is left to rest, or what is more commonly known as autolyse. During this period, the gluten in the dough will develop, so the dough becomes more extensible.\xa0Afterwards, the dough is hydrated and left to proof.\xa0Once the dough has rested for a few hours, it is cut and shaped into a ball before going into the banneton, a bread basket that will allow the dough to keep its shape as it rises. The banneton is placed in the chiller for an 18-hour retardation process in which the bacteria break down the gluten.\xa0It comes out of the chiller having developed a more complex flavour, open crumb structure, and a bubbly and springy texture.\xa0The bread is scored to allow air to escape when it’s baking, preventing the bread from ballooning up.\xa0Finally, after 36 hours, it goes into the oven and is baked. The result is a warm, fluffy bread that’s soft on the inside with a crisp crust. Many bakers consider the open crumb structure, presenting itself as large but even holes throughout the interior of the bread, as a mark of a “successful” sourdough loaf.\xa0The sourdough loaf is best eaten within a few days of baking since it’s non-processed. But you could slice and freeze your bread to lengthen its shelf life.\xa0To heat it up, simply toast it again. A handy tip is to wrap the frozen sourdough slice in aluminium foil and sprinkle a bit of water inside before heating it up in the oven.15 Lichfield Road\nOpens: Wednesday to Sunday (8.30am to 4pm)This pet-friendly cafe has recently taken the Gen Z social media pages by storm.

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/from-scratch-bubble-tea-pearls/:['From Scratch is a series exploring the origins of foods that are popular in Singapore and the work that goes into making them.Whether you call them bubble tea pearls or boba, one thing is for sure — we all love the way they’re delivered into our tummies.\xa0Most of us have come to know bubble tea as a handshaken tea-based drink, with the dark tapioca pearls (or bubbles) that give the drink its name nestled within the liquid.It may have had its origins in Taiwan, but it has since grown to capture the hearts of beverage drinkers across the globe, especially among communities with a strong Asian diaspora.Singapore was not immune to its charms, of course. In the early 2000s, a wave of bubble tea shops took hold in the heartlands, with students and youth among their most ardent fans.At the moment, bubble tea is enjoying a revival of sorts, with major international names making their presence felt. And it’s set to expand even further, to the tune of about US$4.3 billion (S$5.9 billion) internationally over the next five years, notes Crystal Wee, co-founder of bubble tea chain Playmade, citing recent studies.This new wave has brought fresh takes on old recipes.There’s a veritable smorgasbord of tea flavours, types and toppings so bubble tea drinkers have their every need met.In making pearls, bubble tea chains have broken the mould. Gone are the traditional, factory-made tapioca pearls. In their place, unique flavours and premium ingredients have emerged.And now, pearls are no longer unique to just bubble tea. Boba can be found in cakes, pastries, desserts, and even — at one point — hotpot.Playmade’s co-founder Amanda Poo, 34, was never a fan of those black, run-of-the-mill tapioca pearls. Yet, on a trip to Taiwan, she was pleasantly surprised by OneZo’s housemade specialty pearls.\xa0OneZo is billed as the first-ever bubble tea brand to handcraft its tapioca pearls in-house.She loved it so much that she raved about it to her friends and relatives back home, including Wee, 36, her husband’s cousin.Despite having no experience in F&B, the pair took a leap of faith. They joined forces and embarked on a month-long training programme in Taiwan to become boba masters.\xa0The Playmade chain was thus born in 2017 with its first store at the Tampines 1 shopping centre.\xa0It started out with OneZo’s signatures, such as pink cactus, black sesame and burnt caramel pearls. It later worked with the parent brand to create its own varieties.Since then, Playmade has been broadening its offerings.\xa0A new concept, Playground by Playmade, serves Taiwanese cuisine, including iconic dishes such as egglets (egg or bubble waffles), Taiwanese chicken rice and sandwiches. At present, there are two outlets at Ang Mo Kio Hub and Seletar Mall.The egglets, in particular, come with a surprise. Peel them apart to uncover your favourite pearls ensconced in each spherical segment. Some Playmade stores, such as the one at VivoCity mall, have also begun selling this since 2021.Wee says Playmade is bringing back its buckwheat pearls — a fan favourite — in December, and has plans to launch its 18th and 19th outlets at Suntec City and Bukit Panjang Plaza early next year.\xa0The brand will also open its first overseas outpost in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in the first quarter of 2023.Since it burst onto the scene in 2017, Playmade has been making its mark for its boba offerings.\xa0“We are trying to be more innovative and creative by playing around with our flavours,” says Wee.\xa0“The chrysanthemum pearl flavour is something we created. We also have more unique flavours, such as mochi, watermelon and some fruit series.”Besides these, Playmade’s R&D team has also put out strawberry, watermelon and peach pearls as well as “funky” ones, such as carrot and, most notoriously, wasabi and mala.Where does the inspiration for these creations come from, though?For the chrysanthemum pearls, Wee took inspiration from the packet drinks that Singaporean hosts serve their guests. “When you visit someone’s house — green tea. Second (to that) is chrysanthemum tea. Chrysanthemum has a very fragrant, flowery taste to it.”\xa0For those who are unfamiliar, green tea is already a popular component of many bubble tea drinks.The chrysanthemum series ended up being one of Playmade’s top-selling pearls and drinks.By contrast, its grape-flavoured pearls were born out of necessity. Wee says Playmade had faced supply chain issues during the pandemic and certain ingredients had not arrived in time to meet its needs.“Shipping over ingredients became a little bit tougher than before. I thought to myself: ‘Okay, we need to use ingredients that are available locally.’”At that point, Wee was into Yakult, the probiotic drink, and experimented with her favourite flavour — grape. The grape Yakult drink series and corresponding grape pearls thus came into being.“We stick to our company values of (the pearls) being natural. We also make them by hand — fresh, on the spot daily — for our customers to see.\xa0“We use no colouring and preservatives — only natural ingredients.”Boba flour and water are poured into a mixer, together with the main boba ingredient, which hinges on the flavour being made.\xa0Today, we are making pink cactus pearls, so pink cactus juice — imported from Penghu, Taiwan — goes into the mix. The result is a sticky lump of dough.The dough is removed from the mixer, placed on a kneading surface and coated liberally with tapioca starch, so that it doesn’t stick. This also ensures that the pearls have a smooth texture and finish. It’s then kneaded by hand.Once kneaded, the dough is carefully fitted into a pearl-making machine, which cuts and rolls the dough into its iconic bubble shape.The pearls are popped into the freezer to give them that “extra bounciness”, says Wee, before going into a pot to be boiled. The pearls are then rinsed thoroughly with water and soaked in housemade sugar syrup before being served.\xa0Once made, they have a shelf life of three hours, to maintain peak texture and freshness. If they’re not sold by then, the pearls harden and must be tossed out.Multiple stores islandwide\nOpens: Operating hours vary across stores\xa0This Taiwanese brand’s pearls are made in-house daily, with a different flavour taking the spotlight each day.

Here are three eateries in Singapore where you can get a taste of Argentina.\xa027 Club Street\nOpen: Monday to Thursday (12pm to 3pm, 6pm to 11pm), Friday (12pm to 3pm, 6pm to 12am) and Saturday (5.30pm to 12am)One of the more well-known Argentinian kitchens in Singapore, Bochinche is located along the trendy Club Street. If you’re looking for an authentic Argentinian dining experience, this may be one of the closest you’ll find in Singapore.Its meats are cooked with traditional asado technique, a method of barbecue that’s deeply linked to Argentina’s identity. It is heavily centred around the gathering of friends and family over a meal, so be sure to order its Heavenly Meat Board (S$230) for sharing between two to four persons.\xa0Aside from that, you’ll find more traditional Argentine dishes that aren’t easy to find, including a dish called provoleta (S$26), a grilled provolone cheese dish served with tomatoes, honey, herbs and pimento.\xa0Though it’s on the pricier side, opt for its weekday set lunches that start from S$45.What to order: Classic Provoleta Cheese (S$26), Argentinian doughnut (S$19), Heavenly Meat Board (S$230)Ion Orchard, 55-01, 2 Orchard Turn\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (12pm to 3pm, 6pm to 10.30pm)Known for its gorgeous panoramic views above Ion Orchard, Fire at 1-Atico is a space that’s sure to leave your date in quiet awe.\xa0Similar to Bochinche, the restaurant adopts an asado cooking technique, using wood-fired cooking to add a unique smoky flavour to its cuisine.The restaurant recommends its provoleta ‘chapa’ (S$38). Its provolone cheese dish is served on a cast iron skillet with fugazetta, an Argentinian-style pizza that is stuffed with a copious amount of cheese. The cheese in the skillet is topped with capers, sage and shallots for that extra bit of flavour.Another popular Argentine dish to try is its housemade chorizo sausage ‘choripan’ (S$32), an elevated grilled Iberico chorizo (sausage) with fig compote topped with choripan croutons.

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/hong-kong/:['Hong Kong is undoubtedly a foodie’s paradise. Dubbed “Asia’s World City”, the bustling, cosmopolitan city is home to a multitude of beloved establishments serving traditional dishes, street snacks and fusion fare.\xa0But while choosing from a dazzling array of delicacies in Hong Kong can be exciting, it’s tough to decide which eatery to make a beeline for when you have so little time.\xa0If you ask us, the must-visit spots are iconic cha chaan tengs — also known as Hong Kong-style cafes — and dim sum places! You can’t miss out on these local gems, for they offer tourists the ultimate gastronomic experience that’s unique to the city.\xa0Let this piece be your guide to where to have dim sum in Hong Kong and cha chaan tengs to visit in the city.46-50 Des Voeux Road West, 2/3 F, Sheung Wan, Hong Kong\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (6am to 11pm)The sister outlet of renowned Lin Heung Tea House (which sadly shut its doors last year), Lin Heung Kui is an award-winning dim sum parlour that transports diners back in time to old Hong Kong. Despite being the newer outlet, the eatery has already clinched a Michelin Bib Gourmand award, and for a good reason.\xa0Here, you get a taste of nostalgia, for steaming baskets of dim sum are served in old-school pushcarts by old-timers. Names of the dishes are belted across the room in Cantonese, and you have to be quick on your feet to grab what’s available on a passing trolley.Choose from an array of local delights, such as leaf-wrapped glutinous rice (HKD30 or S$5.18) or radish cake (HKD26). For those who prefer a heartier meal, the pork rib noodles (HKD56) are worth a try. 11 Pok Fu Lam Road, Sai Ying Pun, Western District, Hong Kong\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (5am to 2.30pm)If you’re on the hunt for a dim sum spot that’s less touristy, then Saam Hui Yaat is right up your alley. Not only does this hole-in-the-wall eatery serve good ol’ dim sum favourites at affordable prices, but it also boasts a fascinating backstory.\xa0For the uninitiated, Saam Hui Yaat directly translates to “three minus one”. The name originated when three owners founded the business in 1978, and one of them eventually backed out. He still works at the establishment to this day, dishing out quality delicacies.\xa0The owners begin work at 3am to painstakingly handmake their dim sum — a show of passion and dedication towards the craft and one of the reasons why their customers keep returning for more.\xa0We recommend the shrimp dumplings (HKD19) and steamed buns with barbeque pork (HKD19). The big steamed bun with chicken (HKD19) is wonderful for those with bigger appetites.Nan Fung Place, Shop 1-2, 2/F, 173 Des Voeux Road Central, Central, Hong Kong Open: Monday to Sunday (11.30am to 3pm, 6pm to 11pm)At Yum Cha, traditional dim sum dishes are reimagined into quirky, innovative twists that will charm both the young and old. Think: Hot custard molten buns (three pieces for HKD49) touting hilarious googly eyes, and adorable BBQ piggy buns (three pieces for HKD49) that are shaped like piglets.This restaurant is a fascinating breath of fresh air from the usual dim sum spots in Hong Kong, for it doles out a range of novel, Instagrammable dishes. One can expect a creative menu that features more than just cute buns, which includes the likes of deep-fried baby pigeon (HKD68) and baked egg tart with gum tragacanth (three pieces for HKD59).\xa0\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHawker Hustlers: Hipster hawker Ray Yeo of Bei-Ing Dimsum Club on reinventing dim sum and his love for all things Japan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEasties can now indulge in dim sum suppers at Swee Choon’s new 24-hour Changi Airport outlet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarkfield Building, Shop C, G/F, 8 Smithfield, Kennedy Town, Western District, Hong Kong\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (3am to 4pm)\xa0Sun Hing Restaurant is one of the best supper spots for handmade dim sum. The eatery has been an iconic fixture of Kennedy Town for half a century, serving mouthwatering delicacies from 3am onwards.\xa0Despite its late-night operating hours, this neighbourhood teahouse is always packed. Note that if you’re flying solo, you may have to share seats with other diners. The restaurant is also self-service. While the staff are hard at work rolling dough in the kitchen, you are expected to pour yourself hot tea or snag your choice of dim sum from nearby trolleys.You mustn’t miss out on the signatures, such as the shrimp dumpling with pea sprouts (HKD26) and the dried scallops and flammulina velutipes dumpling (HKD26).47-49 Parkes Street, G/F, Jordan, Tsim Sha Tsui, Hong Kong\nOpen: Friday to Wednesday (7.30am to 10pm)When searching for cha chaan tengs in Hong Kong, stopping by Australia Dairy Company is a must. This cafe has previously made waves online for its long queues and tantalising breakfast fare. Customers were willing to queue for up to an hour in line just to savour its morning delights, and understandably so.\xa0\xa0The famous joint specialises in egg sandwiches (HKD22), butter toasts (HKD16) and steamed milk pudding with egg whites (HKD30). Though seemingly simple, these are traditional dishes done right. They come served with flavour, oomph and a taste of the authentic cha chaan teng experience.63 Temple Street, G/F, Yau Ma Tei, Hong Kong\nOpen: Thursday to Tuesday (11.30am to 8.30pm)\xa0Are you a fan of Wong Kar Wai films? If so, then you’ll fall head over heels for Mido Cafe! It’s one of the oldest cha chaan tengs in the city that proudly bears the retro aesthetic of Hong Kong eateries in the 60s. Imagine formica flooring, vintage memorabilia and a menu that sees crowd-favourites from the past.\xa0The culinary icon holds a sentimental spot in the heart of many Hongkongers, for it’s been the go-to restaurant for Chinese-Western fusion food since the olden days. The noodles here are fantastic, such as the fried noodle Mido style (HKD78) and pork chop with noodles in soup (HKD52). The milk tea (HKD20 hot, HKD23 cold) also serves as a refreshing pick-me-up.\xa0334 Castle Peak Road, Cheung Sha Wan, Hong Kong\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (6am to 10.30pm)Conveniently located near Cheung Sha Wan MTR station, Sun Wah Cafe is the place to hit up if you’re hunting for a delicious bowl of noodles, prepared Hong-Kong style. While it isn’t as recognised as other bigger names among tourists, the eatery is popular among locals for its stand-out satay beef rice (HKD49) and chicken shredded hor fun (HKD51).\xa0If you want to chow down a snack or two, the cafe also has an in-house bakery dishing out traditional breakfast favourites. The buttered toast (HKD15) and char siew sandwich (HKD21) are our top picks! 830 Canton Road, G/F, Yau Ma Tei, Hong Kong\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (9am to 6.30pm)Diners who’ve missed Tai On Coffee & Tea’s baked goods: You’ll be thrilled that the famed cafe has finally reopened its doors (after shutting down last year)! Not just that, it has created a brand new menu, featuring modern fusion food.The design of the establishment remains true to its original interior back in 1969, preserving the essence of an old-school Hong Kong cha chaan teng. It’s the Tai On Coffee & Tea that regulars know and love. However, the only difference is the introduction of swanky coffee drinks and pastries on the menu.\xa0Choose from various innovative flavours of its freshly baked egg tarts, such as the taro coconut milk with sago (HKD32) or matcha with red bean mochi paste (HKD32). For desserts, you’ll be tempted by the classic coconut sheet cake (HKD28) and mixed berry matcha chiffon cake with raspberry sauce (HKD48).

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/holland-village-places-to-feast/:['A once sleepy residential enclave, Holland Village has had a longstanding reputation as a watering hole, thanks to the countless bars that would spill out onto the closed road.\xa0With the pandemic and a strict curfew on alcohol sale (that’s since been lifted), the area has seen more eateries open up, turning it into a more foodie-friendly place. From breakfast to supper, you can be sure there’s no lack of Holland Village food options for the hungry.\xa0Chip Bee Gardens, 01-74, 43 Jalan Merah Saga\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (7.30am to 7pm)A chain bakery you can depend on, Tiong Bahru Bakery at Chip Bee Gardens possesses more charm than its other eight stores islandwide — at least in my opinion. There’s a noticeboard with flyers and calls for babysitting jobs from the neighbours, small potted plants for sale and an al fresco seating area, where you can watch the world go by outside. You can’t go wrong with classic viennoiseries or, if you’re feeling fancy, a sandwich to munch on.\xa0What to order: Croissant (S$4.50), original kouign amann (S$6.30), TBB teh tarik — tea latte made with rooibos espresso and milk (S$7.80)\xa0Chip Bee Gardens, 01-56, 44 Jalan Merah Saga\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (7.30am to 8pm)Away from the main nightlife area, Baker & Cook has been feeding the hungry with freshly baked loaves and cups of caffeine since 2013, only one year after baker and entrepreneur Dean Brettschneider established the bakery here. Equal parts retail store and bakery, its display is always stocked with fresh loaves and Danish pastries, while in the chiller, you’ll find condiments such as dips and jams.\xa0What to order: Mixed berries danish (S$5), pecan tart (S$6.50), Danish rugbrod loaf (S$10.90)\xa027A Lorong Liput\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (11am to 9.30pm)\xa0Nakhon Kitchen is an affordable and no-frills Thai eatery that has reopened at Holland Village to somewhat muted fanfare. From a franchise with five stores, the cuisine served comes close to what you can find on the streets of Bangkok and in Thailand’s northeastern region. Authenticity is kept even for the spice levels, so be prepared for some heat in the food.What to order: Green curry (S$10), deep-fried pork with garlic (S$8), claypot vermicelli with prawns (S$18)\xa025 Lorong Liput\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (11am to 9pm)\xa0Pancakes for lunch? Why not? Hailing from Japan, this cosy cafe at the end of a street offers stacks of Japanese-style pancakes in savoury and sweet iterations. The draw: The seven-grain flour mix that comes from organic farms in Kyushu, including wheat from Oita and pressed barley from Saga.Raw sugar from the famed islands of Okinawa and Kagoshima also goes into the batter.\xa0What to order: Berry-licious pancake (S$18), croque madame pancake (S$22.80)\xa0Chip Bee Gardens, 01-52, 44 Jalan Merah Saga\nOpen: Tuesday to Friday (1pm to 10pm), Saturday and Sunday (12pm to 10pm)From the same people who brought you Creamier, Sunday Folks is known for its freshly churned soft-serve ice cream, Belgian waffles and cakes. Championing handcrafted sweet treats, it’s taken the care of sourcing quality ingredients and making everything from scratch, including getting coffee beans from Singapore roasters.Its beautifully packaged snacks such as the 55% Dark Chocolate Sea Salt Honeycomb make great gifts, too.\xa0What to order: Signature waffle with ice cream (S$11.50), affogato creation (S$9.50)\xa031 Lorong Liput\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (10am to 8pm)Its only cha chaan teng (Hong Kong-style cafe) in Singapore, Tai Cheong Bakery’s Holland Village store is where the 68-year-old Hong Kong import serves up Hong Kong-style breakfasts and piping-hot mugs of milk tea alongside egg tarts.For me, its savoury dishes are a hit and miss, so you’ll fare better with its signature egg tarts. Still, get a seat to pretend for a moment you’re back in a small, lively coffee house abroad where trays of warm, fragrant tarts and buns are carried out of the kitchen every few minutes.\xa0What to order: Egg tart (S$1.90), bolo bun (S$2.20), Hong Kong milk tea (S$2.50)\xa017D Lorong Liput\nOpen: Thursday to Saturday (6pm till late)Opened by the team behind Two Men Bagel House, this wine bar brings the same brand of cheeky and fun to Holland Village.

Situated on the quieter side of the area, the Holland Village food spot gets busy on weekends, when it churns out board after board of lightly charred thin-crust pizzas from the oven.Being part of the Da Paolo chain has its perks; there’s a selection of salads, pastas and antipasti, and the menu accommodates all dietary preferences.\xa0What to order: Margherita pizza (S$19), homemade crab cakes and avocado salsa (S$26), Da Paolo’s signature tiramisu (S$14)\xa021A Lorong Liput\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (1pm to 12am)Singapore’s most prolific pastry chef Janice Wong shows off her chops at her flagship dessert restaurant.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/oni-kimbap-singapore-aperia-mall/:['If you find yourself craving for a sesame-oil laden roll of kimbap after bingeing the latest Korean dramas on Netflix, good news — there’s a new-ish kimbap option right in town. Known as Oni Kimbap, it offers a wide variety of the well-loved snack.Beyond the usual rice-filled kimbaps, Oni Kimbap also serves up egg kimbaps, with shredded egg slices — instead of rice — for those of us who might prefer less carbs.\xa0They’ve also recently introduced soba kimbap for a limited time only. Yes, you read that right — noodles in a seaweed roll — and it’s still in kimbap form, no less. Oni Kimbap first began as a home-based business in July 2021. Its shop at Aperia Mall, a stone’s throw from Lavender and Bendemeer MRT stations, opened in May 2023 and marks its first physical dine-in location.\xa0The shop’s name is a nod to Esther Shin, 30, a native Korean who owns the brand with her Singaporean husband. Oni, or unni as it is more commonly romanised, is a Korean term typically used by a younger female to address an older female.Despite having a dine-in location, Oni Kimbap still stays true to its home-based roots and continues to offer kimbap pre-orders, with delivery or a self pick-up option.\xa0If you intend to head down to Aperia Mall, do note that Oni Kimbap shares a space with Aurora Asian Kitchen and Bar and that its entrance is located on the outside of the mall — on the right of the taxi stand, if you’re opting to arrive by car.\xa0Shin’s husband tells us that Oni Kimbap functions as a weekday dine-in pop-up. On weekends, it is self pick-up only, in part due to manpower constraints.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHawker Hustlers: Hipster hawker Ray Yeo of Bei-Ing Dimsum Club on reinventing dim sum and his love for all things Japan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Korean-Chinese chain selling jajangmyeon, Paik’s Noodle opens at Suntec City\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy Must-Eats with the Korean oppa from SG, Eric Youn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven for a specialty kimbap store, Oni Kimbap’s range of rice rolls is nothing short of extensive.\xa0When we visited in late August, we found a grand total of 19 different kimbap flavours — fifteen on its regular menu with a rice or egg base, and four new seasonal soba ones.\xa0This figure doesn’t even include the four new mentaiko ones it has just introduced for September.\xa0If you find the number of kimbaps and its base permutations (rice, egg or soba?) overwhelming, here’s what we recommend.\xa0For those gunning for the classic rice-based version, get its kani (crabstick) rice kimbap (S$9.90), a tried-and-tested best seller, and its cream cheese walnut rice kimbap (S$10.90).\xa0All of Oni’s kimbaps come chock-full of ingredients and its kani kimbap is no different.\xa0Even though it comes with a fair amount of crabstick meat and mayonnaise, it doesn’t feel overly cloying, perhaps owing to the generous amount of egg and crunchy vegetables in the roll.\xa0Now, cream cheese walnut isn’t a regular flavour (not even in Korea), but the combination of sweetness from the caramelised walnuts and savoury from the cream cheese somehow works extremely well in this instance.\xa0In fact, if we had to identify what makes Oni Kimbap stand out among the growing number of kimbap shops in Singapore, it is this walnut-cheese flavour and its wide variety of rice-less kimbaps.\xa0Its egg-based rice-less kimbaps — tuna, kani, bulgogi (beef), spicy tuna, sausage and teriyaki (from S$11.90) — are also apparently very popular among carb-conscious office-workers in the area.\xa0But we personally preferred its seasonal soba kimbaps, which come in kani, ebi (prawn), luncheon meat and teriyaki chicken (from S$12.90), as the al dente soba noodles provided more bite compared to the shredded egg.\xa0Another thing Oni Kimbap does differently is that it also offers dipping sauces alongside its kimbaps. Choose from stir-fried kimchi (S$1.50), garlic mayo, or sweet and spicy sauces (both at S$1 each), to go with your choice of kimbap.\xa0Or you can order spicy rice cakes or tteokbokki (S$5.90) and dip your kimbap into the tteokbokki gravy just like how the Koreans have it.\xa0\xa0Oni Kimbap also has other mains like bibimbap (from $9.90), and japchae — traditional Korean noodles (S$9.90) on its menu.\xa0But if we’re being perfectly honest, just head straight for the kimbaps. That’s where Oni Kimbap truly excels, whether it has rice, soba or egg. We’re definitely keeping our eyes peeled for what Oni Kimbap is going to put in their kimbaps next!\xa0For more ideas on what to eat, check out our ultimate Tanjong Pagar food guide or grab some pizzas to go from these places.\xa0You can book a ride to Oni Kimbap at Aperia Mall.\xa0Do explore the new GrabFood Dine-in service for awesome deals.Aperia Mall, 01-44, 12 Kallang Avenue\nNearest MRT station: Kallang and Bendemeer\nOpen: Monday to Friday (11.30am to 2.30pm)Aperia Mall, 01-44, 12 Kallang Avenue\nNearest MRT station: Kallang and Bendemeer\nOpen: Monday to Friday (11.30am to 2.30pm)AuthorSarah is constantly seeking out new coffee spots and cocktail bars around the world, and should probably drink more water while at it.© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/singapore-jiak-tanjong-pagar/:['If you work at Tanjong Pagar,\xa0 there’s a new affordable lunchtime option in the hood, in the form of Singapore Jiak at Frasers Towers.The 94-seater eatery is a casual food-court style spot opened by Akashi Group, the group behind London Fat Duck in Singapore, Akashi Japanese Restaurant and Akanoya Robatayaki at Orchard Rendezvous Hotel. Singapore Jiak features a total of four hawker brands — Teck Kee Fat Duck, Dunman Wanton Mee, Grandma’s and Ah Goh Fish Soup — located across three shop units on Fraser Tower’s second floor.\xa0Teck Kee Fat Duck is touted as the more casual, sister brand of London Fat Duck. It also uses Irish duck to retain the same melt-in-the-mouth flavours that the brand is known for.\xa0Its duck dishes are priced more affordably at S$8.50 for a roast duck rice or S$12 for an a la carte roasted duck dish. Teck Kee also sells pork and chicken mains starting from S$5.80.\xa0Jiak’s other brands — Dunman Wanton Mee, Grandma’s and Ah Goh Fish Soup — may not immediately ring a bell but all three have histories predating Jiak.\xa0The team behind Dunman Wanton Mee previously tossed up lard-laden wanton noodles at Wanton Seng, a familiar Amoy Street favourite.\xa0Though it’s been a while since we’ve had Wanton Seng’s wanton noodles, having our first bowl at Jiak felt like a welcome blast from the past.\xa0\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Junction Westgate opening with promos; will house 23 tenants, including new halal teppanyaki\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHawker Hustlers: Hipster hawker Ray Yeo of Bei-Ing Dimsum Club on reinventing dim sum and his love for all things Japan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIts mixed pork wanton mee (S$7.80) had a generous heap of pork lard, a good amount of springiness and was topped with the exact crispy roasted pork the brand was well-known for.\xa0Established in 2008, Grandma’s is an old local food name that is relaunching its physical presence through Jiak.\xa0Its signature grandma’s curry chicken nasi lemak (S$9.80) is plenty lemak and packs a spicy punch.\xa0Last but not least, Ah Goh Fish Soup is a homage of sorts to a popular staff dish at Akashi restaurant — a fish soup typically made using leftover bones from premium fish served up at the dining spot.\xa0Some might recall the popular Arcade Fish Soup, which occupied the space where Jiak currently sits. Ah Goh Fish Soup, by contrast, is more flavourful and almost veers on being a tad salty.\xa0For that reason we’d recommend having its fish soup with rice instead of on its own. You can choose between regular batang fish steamed or fried, (S$5.80) or garoupa (S$8.90).While we were checking the new place out, we spotted an in-the-works bar tucked away in the corner of Jiak.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/rex-steakhouse-singapore/:['Rex Steakhouse in Singapore may not immediately ring a bell, instead the name Riders Cafe might be more familiar to many old-school cafe aficionados. Known for its idyllic vibes, the cafe was tucked away on the outskirts of Bukit Timah, but closed in Feb 2023.If there are any fans out there who are missing the cafe’s comforting Western grub and wondering where else you can find the same hearty goodness, then you ought to check out Rex Steakhouse & Bar at Jalan Besar.The casual steakhouse is located beside Red Eye Smokehouse and both establishments are run by the same folks behind Riders Cafe.It was officially opened in July.Tapping the meat-grilling expertise of the Red Eye team, Rex Steakhouse is an intimate casual eatery that’s angling for a “neighbourhood steakhouse” approach.This focus translates into a simply done-up space with the cosiest ambience and a core concept that lasers in quality meats and tipples to the masses without the usual bells and whistles.As with any casual steakhouse, the menu here features a slew of simple but satisfying starters and sides to complement the hefty protein-based mains.A few good examples are the housemade beef samosas (S$16) that are filled up with smoky beef brisket, or the whipped burrata (S$20), a crowd favourite that’s whipped up into a delightful velvety texture that would hit the spot for cheese loversUltimately though, the highlights on Rex Steakhouse’s menu are undoubtedly the meatier dishes. This ranges from hefty big-ticket grills to smaller bites, such as the smash cheeseburger (S$17).While it’s not one we would crown as one of the absolute best burgers in Singapore, it is still a very tasty take on the iconic dish.Made from steak off-cuts, the patty is rendered juicy and well-caramelised on the surface from the smash-grilling. It’s then finished with cheddar and a rich sauce to give it that heavy-hitting classic-American-cheeseburger profile.Other than the food, Rex Steakhouse also has a dedicated bar churning out specialty cocktails.The concoctions are mostly simple and easy to drink, with pleasant flavour mixes such as the pandan sour (S$19).\xa0\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHawker Hustlers: Hipster hawker Ray Yeo of Bei-Ing Dimsum Club on reinventing dim sum and his love for all things Japan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTalad Thai Banana opens at AMK Hub with S$2 opening promotion for the first 100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Korean-Chinese chain selling jajangmyeon, Paik’s Noodle opens at Suntec City\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you’re up for something really unique, the establishment’s meat expertise also shines through in this unique twist on the classic old fashioned.The brisket old fashioned (S$22) features bourbon that’s fat-washed with beef brisket and served with bacon for a super robust and smoky profile.\xa0It’s a bit of an acquired taste but those who enjoy rich and smoky drinks would delight in this.As good as the burger was, the undisputed showstoppers had to be the assortment of steaks, which starts from S$32 for the trendy prime flat iron.But Rex Steakhouse offers quite a few different cuts on the menu and one of the recommended signatures is the King River wagyu MS 5+ picanha (S$42).The picanha is an off-cut that has become a rising star in recent times. Using fat-rich meat from the rump of the cow, it is meant to be remarkably tender if cooked well. As expected, the steak was executed expertly and wonderfully rich.In contrast, the Jack’s Creek wagyu MS 4+ zabuton (S$60) was much more potent overall. Similar to the picanha, the zabuton is a more unconventional cut that has started to see more public attention in recent years. It comes from the chuck of the cow and loosely means “cushion” in Japanese.\xa0The texture for this was more buttery and its taste profile was more complex, loaded with unique nutty undertones and more umami oomph. It’s an absolute flavour bomb.Each steak also gives you a choice of one sauce or butter, with a range of options to choose from. There’s compound butter, chimichurri bearnaise, horseradish aioli, bordelaise and dijon mustard. Additional condiments can be added for S$2 each.Beyond its tantalising array of steak cuts, Rex Steakhouse is equally proficient when handling other meats — best evidenced by the brick chicken (S$23).The name is derived from the cooking method: The chicken is pressed down on with a brick to ensure maximised skin contact with the blistering griddle.\xa0Due to the cooking method, the well-spiced chicken is made succulent and covered with a lightly crispy golden-brown layer of skin — probably one of the more impressive grilled chicken we’ve tried.For more ideas on what to eat, read our take on the best Katong laksa in Singapore, and places for some of the cheapest kopi and teh locally.\xa0You can book a ride to Rex Steakhouse & Bar for a wonderful steak dinner.Do explore the new GrabFood Dine-in service for awesome deals.3 Cavan Road\nNearest MRT station: Lavender and Bendemeer\nOpen: Wednesday to Thursday (5pm to 10.30pm), Sunday (5pm to 10.30pm)3 Cavan Road\nNearest MRT station: Lavender and Bendemeer\nOpen: Wednesday to Thursday (5pm to 10.30pm), Sunday (5pm to 10.30pm)AuthorEvan started off writing about food on Instagram, before joining outlets such as Buro and Confirm Good to pursue his passion.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/the-wizards-brew-chinatown/:['Hear ye, hear ye, fans of the wizarding world — there’s a new Harry Potter-themed cafe called The Wizard’s Brew in town and it’s got quite a bit of magic within its little nook to excite any Potterhead or wizardry fan.\xa0Tucked away in a third-storey shophouse along Trengganu Street, The Wizard’s Brew is a bit of a hidden spot with its street-level sign easily missed at first glance.\xa0Once you’ve finally found the right entrance (hint: it’s nestled between a British pub and a Thai restaurant), walk right up the stairs.\xa0You’ll come face-to-face with a doodled-on door and a suspicious-looking doorbell.You can opt to press the doorbell for an interesting greeting but feel free to step right in — there aren’t any dragons or three-headed dogs waiting behind.\xa0Once within the space, you’ll feel like you’ve been transported into a different realm, far above the bustling Chinatown crowd, with floating candles above you and mystical artefacts all around.Look closely and see if you can spot the Harry Potter references among the wall decor — it’s not quite in-your-face, which makes it accessible for non-Harry Potter fans to appreciate, too.Beyond its wizard paraphernalia and props, we loved how its interior was modelled to resemble a wizard’s den, complete with a cave-like entrance, leading up to its similarly styled bar counter.\xa0With its quaint interior, it could also easily pass for a bar in the quaint Harry Potter village of Hogsmeade — all that’s missing is a pint of Butterbeer.\xa0A post shared by HungryGoWhere (@hungrygowhere)The dessert-bar’s menu has a good mix of specialty cocktails and unique desserts, with the menu items meticulously curated to provide both a visual spectacle and an immersive experience.\xa0Take for example its rum-based Phoenix Fire cocktail (S$22), which comes with orange juice, lime juice, grenadine and rum.\xa0Using a combination of rum and cinnamon powder, the crew managed to conjure up an almost-Phoenix-like apparition to go with our drink.\xa0We also had Sparkulous (S$22), yet another rum-based cocktail, which is said to be a purple potion that turns pink and bubbly when a spell is cast nearby.\xa0It relies on the colour-changing properties of butterfly pea mixed with lemon juice to cause the colour change, followed by dry ice to produce the bubbling effect.It sounds technical when spelt out in this manner, but trust us — it’s actually quite a sight when performed in front of you.\xa0Its desserts are similarly photo-worthy.\xa0We opted for the Reaper’s Gold (S$16), a tiramisu dish topped with house-made Baileys pearls. It is served in a goblet that looked right at home in a witch’s lair. Its Flaming Cauldron (S$16) dessert also intrigued us. The tapioca and mango-passion cream dessert is served in a small black cauldron, topped with crimson flames and surrounded by small black “charcoal” logs.\xa0Both the flames and the logs were both edible — the logs are made of coloured tapioca and can be dipped into the cauldron, which contains a tangy mango-passion fruit dip. We loved the dip and only wished there was more to go around.\xa0The journey to The Wizard’s Brew felt like a magical escape, complete with even in-house wizards’ robes for top-tier immersion.\xa0We can see this space being a great spot for themed parties and special occasions.While the space is intriguing and plenty photogenic, The Wizard’s Brew has more to offer as a feast for the eyes rather than the tummy. If you’re looking for robust cocktails and decadent desserts, there are plenty of other options in the vicinity.Looking for more places around Tanjong Pagar to dine at?

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/hawker-hustlers-nakin-thai-food/:['Hawker Hustlers is a HungryGoWhere series spotlighting young and emerging hawkers with compelling stories. Read through all the way for an exclusive GrabFood promo so you can try their food, too.22-year-old Amita Eng of Nakin Thai isn’t your typical hawker. Bubbly and refreshingly unfiltered, she self-deprecatingly describes herself as a “Gen Z with a short attention span.”\xa0In contrast, Palmy Rapeepat Chanontree, her reticent 29-year-old Thai husband, behaves like an ultimate “boomer” (despite his age) — he’s someone who trawls social media for investing and house-cleaning tips.“You know the TikTok trend, where the guy is thinking about the stock prices and where to invest next, while the girl’s head is just filled with TikTok songs and dances? That describes our dynamics exactly… Sometimes it feels like there’s a big generation gap between us,” Eng quips.\n\nDespite their differences, the unlikely pair have somehow made it work, even starting their own hawker business in Clementi, which serves delicious and affordable restaurant-quality Thai dishes.\n\nCalled Nakin Thai, the stall opened in February this year. The dishes are cooked by Chanontree, a former restaurant chef who has been specialising in Thai cuisine for the last 11 years.Even before we meet Eng, her youthful energy shines through. For one, she peppers her texts with emojis and stickers.On the day of the interview, we catch our first glimpse of Eng squatting down inside the stall, busily applying make-up. She’s nervous and wants to make sure she’s presentable for the camera.But Eng quickly warms up. Born half-Thai (her father is Singaporean-Chinese and her mother is Thai), she had been studying tourism at the Institute of Technical Education when she decided she was better off gaining experience in the real world. She decided to drop out in 2020. \n\nThat year, Eng took up a part-time job as a waitress at casual halal Thai food chain Time For Thai’s now-defunct Simpang Bedok outlet. That’s when she noticed head chef Chanontree.\n\nHailing from Udon Thani, a city in northeast Thailand, Chanontree left his hometown at the age of 18 to pursue his studies in Sydney. But he was forced to drop out after a year when his older sister was diagnosed with cancer.\xa0After quitting his studies, Chanontree began working as a cook in Australia to help support his family back home in Thailand. He learned to cook Thai food at restaurants in Sydney’s central business district. Later, Chanontree landed a job at Time For Thai in Singapore, where he worked as a sous chef for three years. His sister is still undergoing treatment.“I thought he was very handsome,” she says with a cheeky grin. Thus, a whirlwind romance began. Within three months, Chanontree asked her if she was free to ROM — Singapore-speak for formally tying the knot.\n\n“It didn’t even feel like a proposal! Actually, I never got asked before, so I just said: ‘Okay.’But it was only when I was halfway through the paperwork, then it really hit me that I’m actually marrying another person,” recalls Eng.\n\nBut being a happy-go-lucky person, she decided to go ahead with it.\xa0“I thought: ‘Get married, then get married lor.’”Eng jokingly adds that she married Chanontree for his surname, as she found it charming. She explains: “Chanon sounds like chanom, which is milk tea…. So his surname sounds like milk tea tree.”During the course of their relationship, Chanontree always looked for Thai food options in Singapore — the spicier the better. That’s when the couple began mulling over the idea of opening a Thai food stall.They decided to name the stall Nakin. In Thai, it means “looks yummy” and it is also the name of a mythical creature that is worshipped in the region where Chanontree is from.\nTo prepare herself for the role, Eng took on various F&B and retail jobs such as waiting tables and cashiering.\xa0To save on costs, they sourced second-hand items, tapped on Chanontree’s networks and staff discounts from her father who works at a stainless steel company, and eventually spent less than S$10,000 on equipment.The stall opened with great fanfare. On opening day, the coffee shop was packed with office crowds from the neighbouring vicinity and curious customers, as well as her father who invited his entire office.\n\n “Everything was a mess,” recalls Eng. \n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Junction Westgate opening with promos; will house 23 tenants, including new halal teppanyaki\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHawker Hustlers: Hipster hawker Ray Yeo of Bei-Ing Dimsum Club on reinventing dim sum and his love for all things Japan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs time went by, the couple managed to iron out the kinks to come up with a system that works.\n\nStarting one’s own business is very different from working at a part-time job, acknowledges Eng. She had to learn how to run operations smoothly and navigate her way around challenges, even when she was out of her element. This includes handling situations such as a pipe breakage or gas leaks, and how to avoid being overcharged by contractors.\n\nThe most challenging aspect is the lack of work-life balance as a hawker. The pair are at the coffee shop from 9am to 9pm. Chanontree is in charge of cooking, while Eng handles front-of-house and cashiering. Even after they’ve returned home, she’s busy editing photos, drafting up social media posts and thinking up promotions to attract new customers.\n\nIn such a high-stress environment, it naturally stirs up conflict between the two.\xa0Eng has to bear the brunt of dealing with demanding customers, as well as contend with her husband’s perfectionist tendencies.\xa0Says Eng, “He’s the worst person to work with! He’s so strict about everything, even if the moo ping is a little burnt… To him, it’s about having standards.”Still, it’s this dedication to food that keeps customers coming back.\n\nEng recalls an incident where a customer disputed the amount of cashback he should have received via a third-party payment app. Annoyed, he declared that he would boycott the stall. A few days later, she spotted him with his family dining discreetly in a corner.We had the pleasure of trying Chanontree’s dishes, too, such as the signature lime spicy fish (S$18), creamy crab meat rice (S$10), fragrant basil pork rice (S$6), and moo ping (S$5 for three sticks).Customers can tuck into a great lunch deal (an S$18 set for two to three persons) comprising a spread of basil pork, red curry, moo ping, sambal kangkong or sweet and sour pork, tom yum coconut, fried chicken roll and stir-fried bean sprouts with rice.\nWith close to 7,000 followers on TikTok, one might expect that Eng would use it to drum up more publicity about the stall.\xa0She does this, and more. Using memes, filters and behind the scenes videos, she uses it to publicise in her work. There’s even a self-deprecating post about her not knowing “not to do marketing but im a gen z so im relying on this stupid trend (sic).” to promote Nakin.Her feed is also peppered with humorous observations, her “glow-ups”, and goofy antics where she annoys her husband.\nThe posts where her personality shines through resonate best with her followers, though — a video about a faux pas she made in a Jo Malone retail store net her a million views on the platform.“But I don’t have the energy or social battery to entertain all these thoughts (of social media)… If not, I would be a TikTok influencer right now, living the good life,” she says ruefully.Watching Eng and Chanontree banter, I ask what they like about each other.\xa0For Chanontree, he appreciates Eng’s maturity as she’s had to learn to grow up from a young age.\xa0As for Eng, she likes his street smarts. He’s much better at people relations, such as handling conflict and managing customers, and often he’s the one who would coach her on what to say, she says.\xa0\xa0“He looks very nice and innocent, but he’s actually the mastermind,” she says with a laugh.\xa0\nIt’s clear the pair’s relationship is going strong, despite work tensions and personality differences. After all, despite making a pact to get some time away from each other on their days of rest, they invariably find themselves drawn to each other. They end up spending the day together, relaxing or shopping.Asked about their plans for the business, Eng says: “For now, we are just going with the flow. We want to see the business grow and hopefully, be able to run a restaurant that everyone knows by name.”Good news for our readers who scrolled all the way to the end!

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/my-must-eats-nat-ho-seoul-korea/:['My Must-Eats is a HungryGoWhere series featuring Singapore’s public figures and their favourite food haunts. This week, we speak to local artiste Nat Ho, who is based in Seoul, Korea on some of his must-eats in his new city. It’s been slightly more than a year since actor-singer — and now-songwriter — Nat Ho packed up his bags and moved to Seoul, Korea.The 38-year-old moved to Seoul in August 2022 to pursue his songwriting career and also started learning the Korean language at Yonsei University from scratch.\xa0Ho frequently shares snippets of his new life in Seoul on Instagram, most of which he says revolves around school, studio, homework, gym, Muay Thai, friend catch-ups and the occasional cafe sojourn or attending events.\xa0Despite the hustle, he tells us over email that he definitely feels more settled now in Seoul. He adds: “I can see myself staying here for a long time. We’ll just have to see how things fall into place. I’m trusting the universe on this one”.With Korea — specifically Seoul — being a hot travel destination for Singaporeans, we thought we’d pick his brains for some hidden local gems in Seoul.Some of these are so local we couldn’t even find English information on them — props to Ho for sharing the Naver links for these so you can easily locate them on your trip there.\xa0My all-time favourite Singapore dish is Boon Tong Kee Chicken Rice, and while I have not found the equivalent of that here, dakhanmari (닭한마리, chicken stew) is a Korean dish that reminds me a little of that, especially during the colder seasons.\xa0Hongdae Chicken Hanmari (Naver map link) is run by the owner herself (and her daughter, I think), and she really takes pride in her food. Whatever you do, do not pour the raw cabbage into the soup — you’ll get her very annoyed! The raw cabbage is only to be eaten with the chilli sauce and mustard, and paired with the chicken.\xa0Pro tip: After finishing most of the chicken, put in the noodles last — it gives the soup a much thicker texture and by then the broth would have become super rich, so it is very flavourful!Level 1, 41 World Cupbuk-ro 16-gil, Mapo-gu, Seoul (Naver map link)Yonggang’s main specialty is 국밥 (gukbab or soup-rice, a rice and soup dish typically served with pork) and it is one of my go-to eateries in Seoul because it is very near to my recording studio. At the same time, it is healthy and delicious, so I’m there pretty often.It comes with a variety of side dishes and I liken it to a cheese board\xa0 — whatever side you pair it with changes the flavour profile of the main dish, so the different pairings give you a different kind of enjoyment.103, 91 Donggwang-ro 3-gil, Seocho-gu, Seoul (Naver map link)There are many tonkatsu (deep-fried pork cutlet) restaurants in Seoul, but this (IMHO or in my humble opinion) is the best I’ve found so far. I always order the special set — the fat-to-meat ratio is perfectly balanced. The doneness is also just right and the fat has a melt-in-your-mouth consistency.I don’t come here as often as I’d like, because it is far from where I live, but it is near my hair salon, so I normally try to schedule my appointments near lunchtime to get my tonkatsu fix.17-35, Supyo-ro 28-gil, Jongno-gu, Seoul (Naver map link)Tteulan is where I go when I need a moment of peace and tranquillity. It is a very traditional Korean tea and dessert cafe in the Ikseondong area. I particularly love this area because the buildings have a traditional Hanok-style facade, but on the inside, you can find very hip and Insta-worthy cafes, each one trying to outdo the other in terms of concepts and decor.\xa0Tteul An sticks to its traditional roots — its decor is warm and woody and it serves a variety of healthy teas and desserts, traditional Korean cookies and cakes.\xa0On its menu, it also lists the various health benefits each tea has and it feels very wholesome. I feel like my sense of balance is restored each time I visit this cafe.My number one go-to dish in Seoul is Korean fried chicken.\xa0While there are popular chains such as Kyochon and BHC, my favourites are a toss-up between Chicken Baengi and Chicken Bus. For Chicken Baengi, I love its garlic chicken and I like that it has a more homemade feel to it, rather than other more commercial (but still delicious) tasting options.\xa0Whereas for Chicken Bus, I like that they have interesting flavours such as black garlic chicken, as well as takoyaki chicken, which is a real indulgence. If you fancy, they even have a version of black garlic chicken with gold flakes.There are just way too many amazing dining options here in Korea. I’m truly glad that I am based here, and can take my time to slowly discover more. I’m definitely open to suggestions for this one!Born & Bred (Naver map link) was the last thing I ate that truly impressed me.\xa0It was a treat from one of my friends who was visiting, and we really enjoyed it.Service was amazing and the food was even better! The staff will cook the beef for you at the table till your desired doneness, and there is a wide selection of cuts with various levels of marbling. The decor and atmosphere of the place also felt really premium.Beef can be expensive in Korea, but this meal was well-worth it!For more Korean recommendations, read our guide to aesthetic Jeju cafes or explore Oni Kimbap, a new local kimbap restaurant.\xa0AuthorSarah is constantly seeking out new coffee spots and cocktail bars around the world, and should probably drink more water while at it.© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/frying-fish-club/:['There’s no doubt that fish and chips is one of the most iconic Western dishes around, in Singapore and globally.Despite how common it is — even found in kopitiams everywhere — locating a quality plate of authentic fish and chips in Singapore can be a difficult task, though.\xa0Thankfully, a new fish and chips specialist has appeared: Frying Fish Club, located just a few minutes away from Farrer Park MRT station. The fast-casual concept is slated to open officially on Sep 16.It’s found at the Owen Road space that formerly housed The Parlour Mirage, a Japanese-Mediterranean bar known for its skewers and extensive curation of craft beers.The craft-beer bar had planned on an overhaul of its concept and, due to the popularity of its fish and chips, arrived on the idea of a chips shop.Unlike its predecessor, Frying Fish Club focuses mainly on fish and chips — but with a Japanese-inspired twist.It’s really quite unlike your usual fast-food fish and chips.Instead of the usual cod or haddock, which are the norm in traditional English recipes, the new concept swaps the usual suspects out for shiro maguro (albacore tuna) as its focal point.Compared to cod or haddock, shiro maguro has a more robust natural umami and a firmer texture that ensures the insides are kept moist and tender even after deep frying.That touch of savouriness also goes better with the Japanese flavours that dominate the restaurant’s menu, compared to the milder flavour of the former two fish.Frying Fish Club serves up three different variations of their shiro maguro fish and chips: Signature (S$18.50), nori (Japanese seaweed, S$19.50) and spicy (S$19.50).\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTalad Thai Banana opens at AMK Hub with S$2 opening promotion for the first 100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Korean-Chinese chain selling jajangmyeon, Paik’s Noodle opens at Suntec City\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThree Little Coconut: Mr Coconut launches coconut-themed cafe in Punggol with croffles, tang shui & more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat sets the three types apart is not just the sauce. Each dish has a distinct flavour profile, since it’s prepared in varying batter styles and served with a set of curated sides.For example, the signature comes with battered shiro maguro with shoyu edamame (Japanese soybeans), fries and yuzu miso sauce.The nori variation features a nori-crusted fish, accompanied by fries and Asian slaw, whereas the spicy flavour comes feistily marinated with mala and is finished with fries and Japanese kani (crab) salad.All the aforementioned sides are also available on Frying Fish Club’s menu, which is also filled with other bite-sized treats including tako wasabi (S$8), pita & hummus (S$8) and oyster shooters (S$4 each) for oyster fans.If you’re not quite craving fish and chips, they also serve up other mains and, of course, craft beer.Three mains can be found on the menu, namely steak & hummus (S$24), grilled fish taco (S$18.50) and chicken namban salad (S$18.50).While not as heavily invested in the craft beer curation as its predecessor, there will be a selection of craft beers and libations to cater to all kinds of palates.\xa0That includes a refreshing lager, a boozier IPA, a potent stout and one rotating tap. Apart from that, there are also wines available both by the glass and bottle, as well as refreshing highball-style cocktails including gin & tonic (S$12) and whisky highball (S$12).Much like with The Parlour Mirage, which played host to many Web 3.0-based events, Frying Fish Club will continue to do the same.In fact, those who are interested in all things related to Web3 can even get their hands on an NFT series, which grants holders lifetime discounts at the gastrobar, amongst other exclusive perks.For more ideas on what to eat, read our story on rustic old-school bakeries that will bring you back in time or get to know all the dining hotspots that Tanjong Pagar has to offer.You can also book a ride to Frying Fish Club if you’re on the hunt for fish and chips in Singapore.Do explore the new GrabFood Dine-in service for awesome deals.140 Owen Road\nNearest MRT station: Farrer Park\nOpen: Monday to Thursday, Sunday (5pm to 10.30pm), Friday and Saturday (5pm to 12am)140 Owen Road\nNearest MRT station: Farrer Park\nOpen: Monday to Thursday, Sunday (5pm to 10.30pm), Friday and Saturday (5pm to 12am)AuthorEvan started off writing about food on Instagram, before joining outlets such as Buro and Confirm Good to pursue his passion.

Instead of the classic burgers you might have come to expect, you can now order up a smash burger.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Feuds: Saizeriya vs Milan Shokudo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMcDonald’s x New Jeans: Limited-time sweet & spicy McCrispy, Korean fried chicken style\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10 Suntec City dinner spots for every budget\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat’s right, the Ultra Burgers will be focused around smash patties — two in each burger, to be precise.Unlike your usual patties, these patties are smashed up against the griddle to encourage extra browning and crust.The patties are then blanketed with melted jack cheese and secret sauce for extra richness and sandwiched between fluffy, toasted brioche buns.Swensen’s will be offering these indulgent parcels in two permutations: the OG Ultra burger (S$16.90) and Classic Ultra burger (S$17.90).The former is a more dressed-down rendition, featuring two smash patties, jack cheese, brioche, white onions, and a secret sauce.Despite its simplicity, the OG Ultra is a more decadent burger that better showcases the distinct, encrusted texture of the patties.Besides the light crust, you’ll also be greeted to a smattering of pepper and beefy richness — though we thought the beef flavours could be amped up a touch.On the other hand, the Classic Ultra is buttressed by an ensemble of components, including tomatoes, lettuce, purple onions and gherkins.Everything comes together to add more layers of flavour to the burger and helps cut through the heaviness of the burger’s base of beef and cheese.In comparison to the former, this has a more well-rounded overall profile, especially with the gherkins’ tangy acidity and sweetness from the tomatoes\xa0providing a nice contrast.To complete the combo, each Ultra Burger is served with coleslaw and Swensen’s crispy golden fries — so be prepared to be filled up.For more ideas on what to eat, read our stories on the unique new fish and chips speciality eatery and the best spots to sin on crispy or starchy orh luak.Swensen’s is on the GrabFood delivery service and offers free delivery (up to S$3 off) with GrabUnlimited.\xa0Do explore the new GrabFood Dine-in service for awesome deals.You can also book a ride to the stores mentioned in the article.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/espoir/:['The first thing that caught my eye when I stepped into Restaurant Espoir was the Greco-Roman motif on its napkin rings — an ornamental pattern of classical architecture and the mosaics and fashions of its time.\xa0It was an invitation to dine in bourgeois luxury, what with the emerald walls and orientalist touches, such as the maneki-neko (the beckoning cat), exotic flowers, perfume bottles, and feathers set before a glass watercolour scene.Like the decor, the menu showcases flavours from many places. We have masak hitam (stewed meat in sweet soy sauce) and dendeng sitting on the same pages as uni (sea urchin), pearl couscous, shakshouka (Middle Eastern dish of eggs poached in spiced tomato sauce), Moroccan ribs, paella, risotto alla milanese (saffron risotto), and po’ boys (sandwich originally from Louisiana).It’s as if the team is trying to send me around the world from Southeast Asia to the Middle East to Northern Africa to Southern Europe to New Orleans. Some ingredient combinations sounded interesting, such as the kecap manis and coconut salmon, while others were a bit far out, like the crab with aged cheddar.Espoir translates to “Hope” — an homage to the shophouse the restaurant is located in, which used to be home to Anglo-Chinese School in 1886. From a food standpoint, that is an unusual choice given how abstract the theme is. The restaurant is also the sibling to The White Label, a French restaurant that is popular with the Muslim crowd.Overall, there were several cross-cultural flavours that were interesting to taste, though the main concept “modern European, Malayan influence” got lost amid the list of cuisines the team drew from. The dishes that kept within the theme were executed well.Its alcoholic-free cocktails are intriguing, though the Elixir (S$16) had a pervasive synthetic sweetness that prevented me from tasting the natural flavours of the elderflower and fruits listed.The service stood out as well. A staff member was excited to share about the ingredients and food, and I felt genuine delight as she told me about the uni and her favourite dishes.\xa0The team stumbled on some questions though, such as when I asked if the rose component listed in a beverage was from rose water (i.e. the hydrosol) or rose syrup. They did not know, even though some of their food items were inspired from Moroccan cuisine — and rose water is a ubiquitous Moroccan ingredient. That said, this did not detract from the sincerity.The squid ink paella (S$38) is a splendid fusion of modern European cuisine with a twist of Malayan influence. It features squid ink-infused rice, seafood, and an exotic blend of spices accompanied by a sweet and spicy masak hitam sauce.The first thing that caught my attention though was my favourite seafood ingredient — sea scallops — an uncommon choice even in paella de marisco. This is perhaps due to the precision required in cooking them, along with how paella is traditionally more of a communal dish served to many people. One of the scallops was stringy when cut due to overcooking, but the others were done perfectly. The prawns were also firm and tender without being chewy.In terms of the rice, I liked how the seafood flavour was on par with the sweet and spicy masak hitam without being excessively salty.That said, the socarrat wasn’t done well. The crispy bits were resigned to certain spots at the bottom. Still, this dish was outstanding overall from the other technical aspects. The smoky fragrance of the paella from the dried chilis was also easy to love when the dish hit the table.The pan-seared salmon with coconut cream sauce (S$34) was another dish that showed the harmony between Malayan flavours and European cooking techniques. I was wary to see the salmon served skin-side down — but there was nothing wrong with the crispy skin.\xa0This was probably done to showcase the deep caramelisation from the kecap manis glaze — a result from its thicker consistency unlike that of other glazes such as teriyaki and nikiri.\xa0The salmon itself was tender, moist, and flakey, and the vegetables had excellent char. The coconut cream also offered a contrast to the glaze.When it came to the pan-seared scallops (S$26), I was happy to see a good level of caramelisation matched with a proper level of done-ness. There was some variation in the degree of cooking in each scallop but none had real problems.\xa0Hokkaido scallops cook more quickly due to their relative fat content, which makes pan-searing tricky as one needs to get that sear in before they turn rubbery — a problem even one-Michelin-star restaurants struggle with.In terms of the puree, the butternut squash complimented the sweetness of the scallops, though it needed to be thicker\xa0 — I had to mop the plate to get it to cling to the scallop.One of the reasons that drew me to Espoir was the fact it had compressed watermelon (S$14), a dish I first came across in New Haven. It’s a simple dish where melon is compressed in a vacuum chamber to concentrate its sweetness. It can also be done without one, but it would take time.\xa0The version at Yardbird Singapore was good, though the whiskey masked the natural sweetness of the melon, which was why I wanted to try Espoir’s.Visually, Espoir’s deep ruby melon cubes were stunning against the pomegranate seeds, though I was surprised that the melon only made up 10% of the dish. That said, the natural sweetness in each piece was magical with the touch of soy.For dessert, I enjoyed the matcha moelleux (S$15). The cake revealed a rich matcha heart that’s made better with the tartness of quince. The earl grey ice cream was smooth and full of bright bergamot, which worked well with the bitter notes of matcha.\xa0One thing I didn’t like was the dry and somewhat hard exterior of the moelleux, though the pairing of the green and black teas made up for it — it taught me something new about the refreshing and profound combination of grassy and citrusy-floral flavours.I was disappointed by Espoir’s chicken cordon bleu (S$32). At this price point, the most difficult part of the chicken to cook — the chicken breast — should be treated with more care.\xa0It was dry and slightly overcooked — a discredit to the name of the dish. The basil cream offered a fragrant touch when it hit my tongue, but it got lost within the blankness of the cream.Overall, this dish was a missed opportunity to incorporate that Malayan touch, like a lighter and tangier sauce, to cut through the richness inherent in the traditional Swiss recipe.The smoked burrata (S$22) was not bad, and I found the burrata itself decent. What I look for in a burrata is that elastic skin which offers some resistance to the touch, giving way to clumpy parts of stracciatella that ooze out, slowly, without spilling out too quickly when cut.\xa0In Espoir’s version, there is some semblance of an elastic skin, though the curds were too stiff to flow out. The smokiness on the burrata was also too weak — it was overpowered by the smokiness of the dendeng.\xa0Overall, the combination of cherry tomatoes, peaches, caramelised onions, dendeng, and burrata was confusing, though I did enjoy the burrata with just the peaches and onions.The crab croquette (S$24) was not what I expected. Instead of a single piece stuffed with crab, I received three huge pieces loaded with filler. They tasted great though, if I reframed my expectations to see them as crab croquettes instead of the single crab-centred dish the menu had promised.The spices worked for me, particularly the oregano and lime paired with peppers. The kaffir lime in the mayo sauce was aromatic, though the creaminess undid the spices in the croquettes when used. If only I could have this seasoning in a Maryland-style jumbo lump crab cake.Going back to dessert, I was interested to see how Espoir’s flower pot (S$18, left) compares to Koma’s Bonsai (S$19, right). I love the mousse-like and crunchy components of the latter, though I did not appreciate the milkiness of its chocolate. Hence, I was interested in Espoir’s, given its use of 70% dark chocolate mousse.\xa0Unfortunately, this was not comparable to Koma’s, as the chocolate tasted like that of a supermarket milk bar. I had two spoonfuls, could not find the soursop, and stopped eating. Also, the broken pieces of coloured candy at the bottom seemed like an odd choice. In terms of the pastries, I tried the spinach and mushroom quiche (S$9) and found it to be lacking in mushroom flavour within the custard. The entremets reminded me of Cedric Grolet’s Fruit from afar, though their tastes and textures did not work for me.\xa0The pear whip in the Pear (S$9.50) tasted like a blank canvas — a critical issue considering its proportion in the cake. Moreover, the fruit pieces in the pear compote no longer had much texture to contrast against the other components.\xa0The Sakura (S$9.50) fared better, as the sakura whip had a stronger floral flavour and the cake overall had a more even distribution of components so I could get a decent set of textures and flavours with each bite.Overall, there are many things to love about Espoir, though its central theme “Modern European, Malayan influence” did not fully come through. Some details were missed, perhaps due to the desire of the team to draw from so many cuisines. My stance on fusion dishes is that they must be better than the sum of their parts, and Espoir did hit the mark on several.What stood out to me more was the personality of the chef in using so many diverse ingredients and combinations. Some were questionable, such as the tagliatelle surrounded by a moat of mentaiko cream, while others made me smile — like the pairing of Moroccan ribs with Israeli pearl couscous instead of the crumbly Moroccan type.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/paan-singapore-masterchef-amanda-chia/:['If you shed a tear when Masterchef Singapore fan-favourite Amanda Chia was eliminated over her less-than-desirable Italian pasta dish a few weeks back, here’s some good news! She’s back in the kitchen with new Italian treats.\xa0\xa0Chia, 24, has teamed up with her ex-hotel-chef boyfriend, Alex Ng, 25, to start a home-based Italian sandwich business called Paan.\xa0The shop’s name is a play on the Italian word for bread (pane) and the couple’s names, which both start with the letter “A”.\xa0Dubbed “walking sunshine in human form”, Chia captured the hearts of viewers with her always-positive demeanour, perpetual smile and heart for the underprivileged, which shone through in the show’s third episode.\xa0She and fellow contestants came together to cook zi char-style dishes for Dignity Kitchen staff and their families. Chia had also previously worked on a social enterprise project and had prior interactions with the organisation, so it was especially meaningful to her.\xa0A post shared by Mediacorp (@mediacorp)While her Masterchef Singapore journey may have ended prematurely, much to the chagrin of a fair number of viewers (just check out the online comments), Chia knew she wanted to continue cooking, bringing her food to more people and making them happy.Shortly after her elimination episode was filmed, Ng left his role as a chef with The Ritz Carlton, Millenia Singapore in July. Chia also happened to be on the cusp of completing her legal traineeship.Putting two and two together, the couple saw this as an opportune time to do something in food — something they are passionate about and bonded on — as a duo.\xa0Chia’s interest in Italian food was piqued when she headed to Italy to volunteer in 2019. There, she picked up time-tested recipes first-hand from nonnas (Italian for grandmother) when she signed up for Italian cooking classes.\xa0Speaking to us at their residence, she said: “After Masterchef happened, I realised it’s actually possible for me to pursue something I love, to do what makes me happy and find something that sparks joy. And that’s when I decided to do this (with Ng) and take that leap of faith.”\xa0Paan will begin its deliveries tomorrow on September 15, and its menu currently comprises four Italian sandwiches (three savoury and one dessert), made using schiacciata bread, and a soup.\xa0Schiacciata is a lesser-known relative of focaccia bread and is thinner, chewier and more crispy on the outside.\xa0On their choice of bread, Chia says they wanted “something a little bit different, denser and easier to have on the go”.\xa0Paan bakes its schiacciata fresh daily and makes the majority of the ingredients nestled within its sandwiches, such as its roasted pistachio spread, from scratch. We tried Paan’s entire menu and unanimously agreed that its mortadella pistachio sandwich (S$16) is the star of the menu.\xa0The sandwich is the perfect blend of sweet, savoury and salty, thanks to the generous spread of housemade roasted pistachio spread and apple jam chutney, which envelops the mortadella.We noticed too that, despite having a heavy hand with the sauces, the sandwiches never felt soggy and still retained their crispness even though we had set them aside for a while during our chat.On this, Chia said they tested their sandwiches extensively, even for travel, since it operates on a delivery-only model for now. If you’re in the mood for something more savoury and warm, try its cheesy meltdown (S$14.50), which features a cumin-flavoured gouda, among other cheeses, and a balsamic reduction. This is best paired with its tomato tango soup (S$6.50).\xa0The soup, which has hints of mushroom and paprika, tastes like it could have come out of an Italian nonna’s kitchen any day. It is a little thicker than what you might expect, moreish and serves as an excellent complement and dip to its cheese sandwich.\xa0Currently, given that it is home-based, Paan can only take up to 48 orders a day and offers just weekday lunchtime delivery.However, both are optimistic about increasing the number of orders and delivery slots, should they move to a central kitchen if things pan (or Paan) out.Paan is also looking at opening up self-collection and dinner delivery slots, as well as introducing new flavours in the months to come — which it’ll announce on its Instagram platform.\xa0Place your order with Paan through its preorder link.\xa0This was a hosted media tasting.\xa0Keen on more bakes?

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/high-bar-society-tanjong-pagar/:['Alcoholic ice cream and gelato flavours aren’t new, but High Bar Society, Singapore’s first alcoholic-gelato cafe and bar, hopes to raise the bar with its gelato that has up to 6% ABV (alcohol by volume).\xa0Helmed by chef Sharon Tay, whose other (non-alcoholic) gelato brand Momolato at Haji Lane might ring a bell, High Bar Society at Tanjong Pagar is the culmination of Tay’s year-long research and development process.\xa0Unlike most gelato shops, High Bar Society doesn’t have a flavour display right up front. Instead, it’s a sleek bar top that greets you — the first sign that High Bar Society isn’t quite your regular gelato shop.\xa0Step right in and you’ll come face to face with a well-stocked liquor shelf, accompanied by small High Bar Society ice cream canisters sitting beside the alcohol it draws on.At the time of our tasting, the cafe-bar had 18 different flavours on its menu. But we understand that the team has come up with a diverse mix of more than 20 flavours and will be introducing them over the next few months.\xa0There are the more predictable and familiar-tasting ones like Jonker’s Cream Dream (S$13), which combines coconut gula melaka with Baileys Irish cream and Teacher’s whisky.\xa0But if you’re there for something different, definitely try Goose Bumps (S$19), which has mao shan wang durian sorbet infused with Grey Goose vodka, and Ommm… (S$15), a simple, white chrysanthemum gelato concoction with the wildly-potent Jiang Xiaobai baijiu (or Chinese liquor).\xa0Having tasted close to a dozen flavours at the tasting, we daresay the 6% ABV does make a difference, given that the industry norm for alcoholic ice cream flavours (like rum and raisin) stands at about 1 to 3% ABV.\xa0\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTalad Thai Banana opens at AMK Hub with S$2 opening promotion for the first 100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Feuds: Saizeriya vs Milan Shokudo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6 easy cocktails you can do in 15 minutes for parties\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTay shares that consuming one full canister is equivalent to downing a regular can of beer.\xa0You probably wouldn’t feel the buzz as you’re enjoying all the gelato, thanks to the meticulously-thought-through flavour pairings, but trust us, it’ll hit you more than you think.Gelatos aside, those who prefer drinking your alcohol conventionally instead of eating them — good news: They have ‘gram-worthy cocktails too.\xa0We particularly liked the look of Barbie’s Pink Fro (S$23), a shimmery whisky highball topped with a sizable cloud of pink cotton candy.\xa0Each cocktail comes with a small serving of complementary non-alcoholic ice cream.As befitting a dessert shop, High Bar Society also has alcoholic milkshakes. Think chocolate shake with Patron XO liquor, or strawberry with Baileys Irish cream (both priced at S$18 for an alcoholic version, S$13 for a non-alcoholic one).A post shared by HungryGoWhere (@hungrygowhere)With a robust arsenal of alcoholic offerings that run the gamut from cocktails to boozy gelatos, desserts and milkshakes, High Bar Society serves as a great spot for those leisurely post-dinner tete-a-tetes.\xa0But only if your whole party is alcohol-loving.\xa0Else, you might be hard-pressed to find options for your sober companions apart from its virgin cocktail and milkshake options and coffee.\xa0This was a hosted media tasting.\xa0For more new bars in Singapore, read our piece on Spectre, a new local hidden bar with a focus on mental wellness and The Wizard’s Brew, a dessert bar with a touch of magic.\xa0You can also book a ride to High Bar Society at Tanjong Pagar.\xa0Do explore the new GrabFood Dine-in service for awesome deals.52 Tanjong Pagar Road\nNearest MRT station: Tanjong Pagar and Maxwell\nOpen: Monday to Friday (5pm to midnight), Saturday Sunday (5pm to 2am) 52 Tanjong Pagar Road\nNearest MRT station: Tanjong Pagar and Maxwell\nOpen: Monday to Friday (5pm to midnight), Saturday Sunday (5pm to 2am) AuthorSarah is constantly seeking out new coffee spots and cocktail bars around the world, and should probably drink more water while at it.© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/toms-palette-bugis/:['Artisan ice-cream cafes are a dime a dozen in Singapore nowadays, as trendy new spots continue to pop up every so often.But as far as ice-cream cafes are concerned, not many can top the fond memories dessert fans have of Tom’s Palette, a stalwart artisan gelato brand that’s been around for almost two decades.The iconic brand was founded in 2005 and operated out of a small unit in the rustic Shaw Tower, before the building’s redevelopment forced a move to its current location in 2020.In July, the gelateria announced plans for renovations of its Middle Road compound. Good news: It’s now ready to receive all the loyal fans who’ve been patiently waiting.Decked in hues of cream and teak, the revamped Tom’s Palette Bugis space is clean, modern and features an elegant communal table as the centrepiece.\xa0Besides the furnishing, the walls are now also adorned with a smattering of vibrant artwork that adds a touch of refinement, much like an art studio.A post shared by HungryGoWhere (@hungrygowhere)But here’s what we suspect fans will be most excited for: The new-and-improved Tom’s Palette now has an impressive spread of 36 ice-cream flavours to give ice-cream lovers a greater freedom of choice.These options borrow from the ice-cream expert’s library of over 200 unique creations, all crafted without preservatives or artificial flavouring.In case you’re unfamiliar with the brand, Tom’s Palette has garnered a reputation for being a creativity-filled maverick with the wackiest but most charming ideas. \n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTalad Thai Banana opens at AMK Hub with S$2 opening promotion for the first 100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Feuds: Saizeriya vs Milan Shokudo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of the unconventional flavours it’s become known for include a motley of Asian-inspired comforts such as white chocolate nori (Japanese seaweed), pipagao cough syrup, nasi lemak, chee cheong fun and so on — there are too many to list.For the grand reopening, fans can look forward to Tom’s Palette’s new menu, which includes a fresh slate of items.For example, the newest addition to its extensive flavour library is a simple but hearty maple pecan that combines pure maple syrup-soaked pound cake, toasted pecans and fior di latte mozzarella gelato.Prices for the gelato start at S$5.20 for a single scoop in a cup and S$6.40 for a single scoop in a cone.If you’re a waffle lover, crunchy Belgian waffles are also available at S$7.50 with a complimentary topping and free-flow gula melaka.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/gyu-san-charcoal-bar/:["Mention the words “wagyu beef” and “Orchard Road” in the same breath, and you’d automatically baulk at imagining how expensive that meal would be.\xa0 After all, how could one possibly find affordable options for premium Japanese beef in the heart of Singapore?Enter Gyu San Japanese Sando and Charcoal Bar (or Gyu San Charcoal Bar, for short), which is conveniently located at Forum The Shopping Mall along Orchard Road.\xa0It offers diners a taste of wagyu beef — known for its fatty, well-marbled texture — at an affordable price, with its signature A5 wagyu Japanese hamburg set going for a reasonable S$23.80. The set comes with free-flow rice and miso soup, too.Opened in August 2022, Gyu San Charcoal Bar is the sister outlet of Gyu San Japanese Butchery and Sando, which is renowned for its delectable Japanese sandos and premium wagyu beef selections.\xa0While you can order some of the latter’s famous katsu sandos and other menu items — the cosy eatery is located just next door to the moody Charcoal Bar, after all — we recommend going for the aforementioned signature hamburg set. This is because the highlight of your meal is witnessing firsthand the preparation of your wagyu hamburg that’s cooked a la minute.It’s quite an experience, as the ball of raw beef is pressed onto a binchotan grill in front of you in a unique open-concept island kitchen and bar, before it is presented to your table on a personal grill to keep warm.The establishment is helmed by ex-Akira Back chef Tomoyuki Kiga, and if that name rings a bell, that’s because he’s also the man behind Wagatomo, which delighted us on our last visit. In fact, some of Wagatomo’s signature dishes are also served at Gyu San Charcoal Bar, such as the A5 wagyu pizza.The eatery specialises in wagyu dishes, so it only makes sense that these offerings were done perfectly.From the hamburg patties to the juicy beef within our sando, the meat was tender and cooked just right. We particularly liked the fact that there were a number of spicy and non-spicy condiments (eight in total) to pair the patty with, each of which brought out a slightly different flavour to the meat.However, as portions are small, you might have to indulge in its free-flow rice and soup to fill up.If you’re not a big eater, this is the place for you. Bring some friends with you — the intimate and sleek ambience of Gyu San Charcoal Bar was cosy and comfortable, the perfect venue for friends to have a good conversation.But don’t plan on staying late (more on that later).Gyu San Charcoal Bar lived up to its claim for serving quality wagyu hamburg patties at an affordable price point. While small, the meat was grilled to medium rare-perfection, and it was so soft that I actually found it a challenge to pick it up with my chopsticks.\xa0The accompanying condiments (which you can help yourself to) are varied and delicious. We especially loved the shio lemon and ginger sambal sauces, which we thought were unique, and helped bring out the flavour of the meat.We couldn’t resist getting the shabu-shabu katsu sando (S$32), which saw generous portions of well-seasoned meat sandwiched between crispy bread.\xa0Additionally, we ordered the gyu tongue (S$20), which was very thinly sliced and well-executed. I really liked that our meats were placed on a personal grill right in front of us, to keep the food warm. The chawanmushi (S$5) also had a generous amount of ingredients and was incredibly flavourful.\xa0As for beverages, there was a decent selection of reasonably priced beverages. Alcoholic options were surprisingly affordable (S$10 to S$17 per glass on average), given the outlet’s location at Orchard.The serving portions for most of Charcoal Bar’s mains are a tad small. The hamburg set, while affordable and comes with free-flow rice and miso soup, is definitely not enough for a full meal, unless you’re a small eater. There’s only so much rice one can eat.\xa0My companion and I had to order a hamburg set each and the dishes we mentioned above before we were satiated.\xa0Some of the sides were a tad too salty, as was its miso soup. We also found the bread of the sando a tad dry, which was a shame, as the meat was near-perfection.\xa0Service-wise, we felt that the team could have done better with regard to communication.Case in point: At 9.59pm, we were told to leave as the restaurant was closed. This came as a surprise, as both Gyu San’s website and Google stated a closing time of 10.30pm.The staff began washing the kitchen and preparing to close up from as early as 9.20pm. Given that my last drink, a sake,\xa0 was served rather late, I had no choice but to gulp the remainder in seconds. The abrupt end to our evening, unfortunately,\xa0 made the visit less than pleasant.Overall, our experience, while good, did not fully live up to our hyped-up expectations. That said, Gyu San Charcoal Bar is still a very decent option if you need to satisfy a hamburg and wagyu craving.Is it conducive to conversation? Yes, although given its popularity, the place may be noisier during peak dining periods on weekends. Tables were comfortably spaced and the reggaeton was dialled up enough for you to gyrate in your seat without missing the banter.\xa0Is a reservation necessary? Yes, especially if you’d like a counter seat to get the full charcoal bar-grilling experience right before your eyes.How to get there? It’s a 10-minute walk from Orchard MRT station. Otherwise, booking a Grab ride may be more convenient.HungryGoWhere paid for its meal at this restaurant for this review.Still hungry?

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/zam-zam-restaurant-vs-victory-restaurant/:['In our new series Food Feuds, we visit competing local food stalls known for their rivalry and try to find out which one does it better.“Go to Zam Zam, it’s the best in town.”\xa0“Go to Victory, it’s just as good”.It’s difficult to have a discussion about murtabak without hearing about these two legendary eateries. Both Zam Zam and Victory are fail-safe supper joints for murtabak, briyani, and Maggi goreng, each running side-by-side from dawn all the way till 11pm every single day of the week.Both give off the scent of curry as you walk by, and enjoy a constant buzz from patrons, staff and cars driving past.For the purposes of this comparison, we’ll look at two of their signatures, the mutton murtabak and chicken briyani. But first, let’s dive into…\xa0Zam Zam Restaurant hired someone to slash his “rival”, a supervisor from Victory Restaurant.\xa0Murtabak is delicious and all, but really, a slashing over fried dough stuffed with meat, beaten eggs and onions (okay, maybe the Italians would understand)? It’s no secret that these two have been competitors for a long time — and we mean, really long.\xa0Zam Zam Restaurant was established in 1908, and Victory Restaurant came just two years later right next door.Needless to say, they’re pretty much the oldest murtabak specialty restaurants in town and have been going toe-to-toe. Their prices and menus are almost identical — in the spirit of competition, we suppose — but when it comes to the food itself, each has unique tastes and standards.\xa0697 to 699 North Bridge Road\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (7am to 11pm)Let’s start with the more well-known of the two. You could even say Zam Zam is the most popular Indian-Muslim restaurant in Singapore, beloved by tourists (I was sitting next to a pair of ladies from America who exclaimed that their teh halia was too sweet) and locals (office workers and Muslims who visit the Sultan mosque directly opposite) alike.Its bright yellow signboard and iconic pandan green shophouse along North Bridge Road is as iconic as it gets.\xa0Occupying a two-floor shophouse space, the seating and decor are simple, as you’d expect from mamak stalls. The air-conditioned second storey is slightly cosier.\xa0The menu here is huge, with murtabak, nasi briyani, goreng (fried dishes such as nasi goreng and Maggi goreng), as well as more stew-type dishes such as sup tulang, mutton soup, fish masala, and chicken kurma. A literal century is a lot of time to develop dishes, after all.For the sake of this article, we ordered the mutton murtabak and chicken briyani from both restaurants. Service is brisk and business-like (don’t expect any warm hospitality here) and the warm food came in less than two minutes — very quick even for an early weekday lunch.\xa0Roti: 4.5/5Look at the char on that thing, like the good leopard spotting of a good Neapolitan pizza. Zam Zam’s dough is fantastic and easily the best I’ve had. It is thin enough to give priority to the fillings, but retains a crispy top layer and chewy undercoat that’s satisfying to sink my teeth into.Fillings: 3.5/5The murtabak fillings come generously packed inside, with tiny shreds of scrambled egg, soft chunks of mutton, and lightly seared onions, though I feel the fillings could be better seasoned. The mutton, especially, was a little light on flavour and could just as well be beef or some other type of meat. I did like the fact that there are smaller bits for flavour as well as larger slices, which add texture to the dish.Curry Dip: 3.5/5The accompanying fish curry is pretty decent, not the watery kind you get at many places, but one that’s a bit thicker and ever-so-slightly grainy. It’s been cooked long enough that the spices (such as coriander, cloves and curry leaves) have infused deeply. It’s also only mildly spicy, so you can enjoy the extra flavours of the dip without overpowering the murtabak.Value: 4.5/5The murtabaks here are huge, even for the smallest portion that I ordered. The mutton version (there’s also chicken, beef, sardine, tuna, and deer) starts from S$7 and goes all the way to a gigantic S$21, though I only recommend getting the bigger ones if you’re sharing them with more than three friends. For the quality and generous amount of ingredients, I say it’s a real bargain.Final score (Murtabak): 80%Rice: 3.5/5Can we just take a moment to appreciate this magnificent portion (yes, it’s the smallest size)? It’s usually a given for briyani to have tons of rice, as basmati rice is much fluffier and lighter than the more common jasmine rice usually eaten in Singapore. It’s the process of cooking in a large vat that lets the aroma and spices imbue into the grains, which gives every bite a lot of oomph. Zam Zam’s rice is rich and flavourful, but I found it heavier and denser than Victory’s.Meat: 4/5\xa0There’s a huge piece of chicken cut from the breast and wing. Inside, the bright white meat is lightly marinated (traditionally with yoghurt, citrus juice and spices) so it’s relatively flavourful inside and not just on the surface. The skin is slathered in a sauce that’s made with red chilli, cumin, ginger, and garlic — it’s a solid chicken, but could be juicier.Curry: 3.5/5There’s some chicken curry accompanying the briyani that’s somewhat on the grainier side, which might be chunks of potato that have been cooked down. It’s a decent curry but a little blander than we hoped (perhaps more salt and sugar is in order?).Value: 4/5At S$8, the chicken briyani offers a lot of bang for your buck. For one, the portions are pretty massive, so you’ll be sure to leave with a bulging stomach. The rice and meat is fairly tasty as well, and I’d rank it amongst the better briyanis I’ve had in Singapore.Final score (Briyani): 75%\xa0701 North Bridge Road\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (7am to 11pm)Victory Restaurant has won over its market share of the murtabak pie, with a loyal following that’s been supporting the business for literal generations.\xa0Taking up the shophouse unit (albeit less distinct than Zam Zam Restaurant with its yellow cream colour) right next to its sworn rival, the layout of the eatery is more or less the same, with a front counter and stairs leading up to the air-conditioned floor on the right, and a modest dining area at the entrance.\xa0The energy here is palpably less bustling, with fewer newspaper articles pinned up on the glass window.\xa0The menu selection is slightly larger than Zam Zam’s, with things such as mushroom and pepper chicken murtabak, as well as a larger selection of gorengs, curries and masalas.There’s a terse welcome by the front-of-staff and I’m seated with my order placed in less than a minute. Just like with Zam Zam, the food arrived on the table in barely two minutes.\xa0Roti: 3.5/5Victory’s dough isn’t as crisp as its competitor, and the lack of any strong char marks means it hasn’t been on the pan for as long. The ‘skin’ is also thicker and more chewy, which I find more reminiscent of prata. I imagine there are many who prefer it this way though.Fillings: 4.5/5The onions are chopped more consistently than Zam Zam’s, so every bite is relatively consistent with loose scrambled eggs, onions and mutton. The tender meat though, is absolutely flavourful and richer in mutton flavour.\xa0Curry Dip: 3.5/5The chicken curry accompanying the murtabak is decent enough, though a little heavy on the curry powder taste. There are also small morsels of chicken inside and disintegrated potatoes. We think the murtabak is flavourful enough on its own, so dip it rather than drown your murtabak in this.Value: 4/5The murtabak (which also starts at S$7 and goes all the way to S$21) comes in a larger, more squarish piece than Zam Zam’s, though I have to point out the fillings don’t seem to be as ample as Zam Zam’s. Still, it’s quite a generous amount of food, for the price you pay.\xa0Final score (Murtabak): 78%\xa0Rice: 4.5/5Victory’s rendition checks almost everything I look for in good briyani rice: Fluffy, incredibly light, just slightly moist, but still full of flavour. It’s not as rich in mouthfeel as Zam Zam’s, but this way I’m able to finish the entire plate without the jelak feeling.Meat: 4/5As described above, the rice serves as a fantastic vehicle for the chicken and lets you taste the natural chicken flavour better. In terms of the meat itself, the marinade tastes very similar to that of Zam Zam’s, which is to say, full of masala spice. The meat is also slightly juicier.Curry: 4/5Victory’s curry is pretty different from its competitor — the appearance is yellower and the texture more cohesive and starchy, thanks to the copious amount of boiled potatoes. Love that there’s a medium-sized piece of mutton inside that’s soft and tender as well.Value: 4/5The chicken briyani here is competitively priced the same as Zam Zam’s at S$8, which again, offers massive value, especially with the incredible rice and curry side abundant with ingredients, though the chicken piece is slightly smaller than Zam Zam’s.Final score (Briyani): 83%\xa0The winner (Murtabak): Zam Zam RestaurantIt’s a close fight, and both are very good murtabaks, but ultimately Zam Zam wins for its excellent crispy murtabak. There’s just something about flavourful dough that’s charred but not burnt that adds a certain smokiness to the mix and makes each bite so satisfying.\xa0While Victory’s fillings are generally a tad more flavourful, Zam Zam’s murtabak holds its own and offers a better mouthfeel with its various textures. Curry-wise, both are around the same standard, adding a spicy and rich enough layer to the dish.\xa0The winner (Briyani): Victory RestaurantTurns out, Victory Restaurant’s briyani is just that good, mostly owing to the incredibly fluffy, moist and flavourful rice that absorbs the sauce from the chicken that much better.\xa0While the chicken from both sides were mostly comparable, I felt that Victory’s meat was slightly more tender and juicy. They also had an interesting and chunky mutton curry that gives more dimension to the meal.\xa0HungryGoWhere paid for its meals at both stalls for this article.Interested in more food feuds?

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/the-padangton/:['I don’t know what it is about food from the Malay Archipelago, but they make for really good cross-cultural Asian-Western mashups. Case in point: Satay hotdogs, buah keluak burgers, laksa pasta, and now, rendang Wellingtons, specifically at The Padangton.The Padangton started off as a pop-up at CelebFest Ramadan, which took place at Suntec City in April this year.\xa0After positive feedback and a bit of newfound fame on TikTok (where videos of its gorgeous lamb shank rendang encrusted in flaky and buttery pastry have garnered thousands of likes), the owners have upgraded to a brick-and-mortar restaurant along Jalan Klapa.The “padang” in its name refers to the West Sumatra capital of Padang, where the Minangkabau people first developed rendang (and also the popular nasi padang). As for “ton”, it comes from, well, beef Wellington.The rendang served here comes from a family recipe — one of the co-owner’s mothers is of Padang descent.The Padangton is a wonderful spot worth travelling down for, especially if you enjoy rendang and other Padang dishes. The lamb shank padangton, in particular, is unique and a whole lot of fun to eat.\xa0The dishes here are wonderful for sharing; plus, you’ll need several stomachs to try all of the dishes here.The lamb shank rendang padangton (S$27) is clearly the showstopper here. Slow-cooked in an authentic Padang style, you get tender and literal fall-off-the-bone soft lamb that’s all kinds of amazing.\xa0And of course, the puff pastry that makes a Wellington a Wellington, is delectable here, too. It’s crispy and flaky, but with enough heft to hold in the meat and its juices without getting soggy. Unlike the English classic, there’s no duxelle (a sort of mushroom pate) coating the meat.\xa0It’s less curry-like than what you’d usually get at a nasi padang stall, but the flavour is just pure rendang, beautifully cooked with a strong coconut flavour. It’s punchy with aromatics and spices, and there’s none of that typical gaminess of lamb.The beef rendang padangton (S$14.50) is another beast of its own. The mildly sweet rempah is more addictive than the lamb shank’s — you can taste the deep and succulent flavour of beef shin that’s rich with spices, chilli, and coconut milk.\xa0Encrusted in the golden pastry, it’s an incredible beef rendang pie that’s worth every dollar.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Feuds: Saizeriya vs Milan Shokudo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother one that’s good for sharing is the sushi pulut rendang padang (S$12.50 for eight). Savoury pulut is made with glutinous rice boiled in coconut milk and earthy turmeric and molded into sushi rolls filled with slow-cooked beef.\xa0The accompanying serunding (grated coconut cooked with chilli) is warm and sweet with just the slightest bit of heat. It’s incredibly tasty on its own, but you can dip this in more sambal ijo for a more complex flavour.The dish is supposed to be inspired by sushi — the green chilli and serunding presumably represents wasabi and seaweed topping, but I say the whole thing tastes a lot more like bak chang (Chinese rice dumplings).\xa0The padang drumlets sambal ijo (S$8.50 for six) makes for good sharing, but they’re so delicious I could wolf them down by my lonesome.\xa0The chicken drumlets are well-marinated and juicy, despite being baked instead of freshly fried. But it’s the sambal ijo, made from young green chilies, that does it for me.\xa0It’s milder than regular sambal, and also packs a different kind of heat. Rather than a burn, this delicious green chilli paste is tangy with a fresh zing that kept me coming back.For beverages, there’s Sprite, Coca-Cola, mineral water, as well as teh botol sosro (S$3), a relatively popular drink from Indonesia that’s a sweetened jasmine tea. Served chilled, it’s relatively refreshing — plus, the sweetness helps balance out the savouriness and richness of the dishes here.Everything we tried was delicious, but there’s an apparent lack of vegetables on the menu — nope, green chillies and specks of dried curry leaves don’t count.\xa0A simple salad, or even better still, some Padang-style boiled vegetables (papaya leaves, spinach or cassava leaves) would make excellent sides.Is it conducive to conversation? Absolutely!Is a reservation necessary? Only if you’re coming in a larger group.How to get there? The Padangton is a 7-minute walk away from Lavender MRT station Exit A or 9 minutes from Nicoll Highway MRT station Exit A.HungryGoWhere paid for its meal at this restaurant for this review.

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/my-must-eats-jae-liew/:['My Must-Eats is a HungryGoWhere series featuring Singapore’s public figures and their favourite food haunts. This week, we speak to actress Jae Liew about her must-eats in Singapore.\xa0If you haven’t heard from actress Jae Liew in a bit, it’s because the Tanglin actress has been busy. Specifically, busy with her move to Japan to teach English.\xa0Last we heard, she was also seen working on the set of I Not Stupid 3 before she left Singapore. But we digress. The 33-year-old moved to Japan in August out of a “want to contribute in a more meaningful way to the community and a curiosity around how much I can grow as a person”.Growing up, she had been deeply impacted by some of her teachers and was inspired by the love and passion they had for the subjects they taught.\xa0Conversing with HungryGoWhere over email, Liew tells us: “It’s a lofty goal that might sound ridiculous to some, but I want to try to give to others what my teachers gave to me.”She is upfront that her move has been stressful, what with the different systems and the language barrier. Even simple errands such as applying for a credit card is like “pulling teeth”, she adds.\xa0A post shared by Jae Liew | 柳胜美 (@jae7iew)That said, Liew remains optimistic about her time in Japan, having finally found a comfortable place to live after several weeks.\xa0We’re sure she thinks of her island home from time to time, so we asked her about some of her favourite must-eats in Singapore. (Though Liew warns that her foodie instincts have gone down a little since she lost part of her sense of taste after a bout of Covid.)\xa0Oyster sauce xiao bai cai. My helper used to make it for me at home and I loved having it.\xa0I tried to make it for my home economics exam once and the teacher told me that my version looked like hospital food. Your girl here nearly cried.I have yet to make it in Japan as I haven’t found oyster sauce (yet). I also actually started reducing my sodium intake when I hit my early 20s, so I rarely add oyster sauce to any of my cooking anymore.PS cafe. Best ambiance and a satisfying menu equals a happy me. I love the chill vibe, plants and monochrome decor, and not feeling like I need to rush when I’m there.Its Dempsey, Palais Renaissance and Ann Siang branches are my usual haunts. I like each for different reasons but Ann Siang remains my favourite for the nooks that provide privacy.Also, the cafe’s truffle fries are gorgeous.Oh, but I also enjoy Sushiro whenever I need a quick sushi fix. I love the ready availability of mentaiko sushi on its menu, its super cute point cards, and the little rewards.And Susan’s (Chan Eatery at Far East Plaza)… I’m not gonna argue with cheap and yummy “point-point food” (economic rice). No recommendation for specific food here cause everything is good, so just try everything.I’m not going to be able to stop listing places now, OMG.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15 best fish head curry in Singapore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Feuds: Saizeriya vs Milan Shokudo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChicken rice —\xa0 both white and roasted chicken!

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/ember-restaurant-singapore/:['Up-and-coming Ember Restaurant\xa0is a new spot you have to keep an eye out for, especially if you’ve exhausted all the popular hangout spots and run out of date ideas.Recently opened at North Canal Road, near Clarke Quay, the restaurant is the latest addition to the Fleursophy group’s F&B portfolio.If you’re unfamiliar with the group, it’s better known to cafe-hoppers as the mastermind behind florist Nicole’s Flower and viral Insta-worthy cafes such as Nico Cafe and Le Jardin.The association means that decor at Ember Restaurant follows the tried-and-true Fleursophy design philosophy: Stylish, elegant and filled with lush florals.But unlike its sibling establishments, the space comes enrobed in darker, sharper shades of colour to give it a classier and more mature aesthetic. A post shared by HungryGoWhere (@hungrygowhere)The moodier palette is then further complemented by an assortment of gorgeous autumnal-toned dried flowers to add to the mystique.\xa0Needless to say, the chic aesthetic and ambience looks like it would make for an immaculate date-night spot.As the name suggests, Ember Restaurant is committed to the art of open-flame cooking, which ultimately translates to a slew of delightfully smoky dishes throughout Ember Restaurant’s menu.Other than that, the kitchen team also seems keen on experimenting, especially with Asian flavours.As such, diners can expect to be treated to all kinds of smoke-tinged dishes that remind you of homely flavours.That includes Ember Restaurant’s signature bites such as the fried wanton-esque lobster ravioli (S$18) or the truffle naan (S$9), which comes served with a tangy cream cheese dip.But the one that stole our hearts was the Peranakan otah sando (S$14), which centres around a wonderfully silky otah that’s brimming with flavour and lemongrass fragrance.Fresh produce is naturally an important aspect of open-fire cooking, which means dishes such as the smoked cauliflower (S$18) are executed very well here.The dish features a sizable half-head portion of cauliflower. Every section of it was made tender and juicy, while the florets — rimmed with umami spice-rub — also came sporting a nice char.Steak lovers can look forward to the wanderer flat-iron steak (S$34). It uses the popular off-cut popularised by iconic London steakhouse Flat Iron and, locally, by casual dining outfit The Feather Blade by Proper Concepts.For this, Ember Restaurant serves up 250g of gloriously succulent beef, together with an earthy horseradish gremolata sauce and smoky roasted asparagus.\xa0All in all, it’s pretty good value for money, when you consider the quality and portion size.It comes with a cream cheese layer that’s fantastically creamy and tangy and a buttery crust to elevate it.Basically, everything you’d expect in a good cheesecake.For more ideas on what to eat, read our stories on other exciting places to add to your Orchard date-spot checklist and omakases that won’t break the bank for special occasions.Do explore the new GrabFood Dine-in service for awesome deals.You can also book a ride to Ember Restaurant.35 North Canal Road\nNearest MRT station: Clarke Quay\nOpen: Monday to Saturday (12pm to 4pm, 6pm to 10pm)35 North Canal Road\nNearest MRT station: Clarke Quay\nOpen: Monday to Saturday (12pm to 4pm, 6pm to 10pm)AuthorEvan started off writing about food on Instagram, before joining outlets such as Buro and Confirm Good to pursue his passion.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/soll-cafe-singapore-sunset-on-11/:['A new rooftop cafe, Sunset on 11 (or Soll Cafe, for short), has recently opened in the Havelock area — but its location is not where you’d expect a rooftop cafe or bar to be.Sunset on 11 is nestled in a rather peculiar spot: It oversees the quaint rooftop pool area of the Louis Kienne Serviced Residences.Unlike the swankier hotels that pepper the vicinity, the premises appear more like a private residence at first glance. So it’s natural that most wouldn’t venture to the area in search of a trendy brunch spot.But the serviced residences are actually quite accessible — it’s just a five-minute walk from Havelock MRT station.Plus, the #iykyk factor gives the Soll Cafe a much more relaxing and intimate vibe, great for an evening sojourn to catch the sunset.Fun fact: Soll Cafe is opened by actor Adam Chen, who grew up in the area. Chen has opened and shut several F&B concepts, including Birders.\xa0Diners are allowed free pool access, but do note that the pool area is only served by an outdoor shower for rinsing and there are no other showering facilities on the rooftop.By the pool, guests will not just be treated to a sweeping vista of the area, but also a wonderful sunset view when golden hour hits and the unobstructed pool area is inundated with sunrays.\xa0Besides the view, Soll Cafe also prides itself in its array of Western grub — mostly kept simple but hearty enough to fill you up.Hence, guests can expect the quintessential all-day brunch fare, including the eggs-ben-inspired eggs royale (S$18) that’s built around a saucy ensemble of housemade hollandaise sauce, poached eggs and smoked salmon.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Feuds: Saizeriya vs Milan Shokudo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoll Cafe also offers a slew of heftier and more decadent burgers for those with more voracious appetites.In particular, the signature Soll tall stack (S$24) is probably enough for two to share.\xa0The towering burger is stuffed to the brim with a beef patty, sauteed mushrooms, caramelised onions, crispy bacon, sunny side up, tangy blue cheese and creamy guacamole.The menu includes locally inspired creations, such as the HCG kick ass burger (fried prawn paste chicken patty, S$17) and espresso pork chop burger (S$18).The cafe staff also strongly recommends indulgent mains such as the truffle mac & cheese (S$17) that buries everything under a gooey house-blend of truffled gruyere and cheddar.Not a fan of the truffle scent?

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/arc-en-ciel-patisserie/:['For most, switching jobs mid-career can be incredibly daunting. The uncertainty and fear of transitioning to a new profession often stop us from biting the bullet to pursue a new career path.\xa0Not for Lin Jiawen, the bubbly chef-owner of Arc En Ciel Patisserie, though.\xa0The 39-year-old decided to take a leap of faith, gathering up her courage to try something completely new. She quit her corporate marketing job of nearly six years and enrolled herself in an 18-month pastry course at At-Sunrice GlobalChef Academy in Singapore.\xa0That was nine years ago, when Lin made her career switch in 2014. Today, she’s a successful pastry chef at Arc En Ciel Patisserie, a popular mousse cake shop situated along Neil Road.\xa0Pronounced as “ar-kon-see-ell”, which translates to rainbow in French, the dessert parlour embodies Lin’s dream of sharing “belly smiles” with diners through her pastries. It’s her ethos that the flavours in her food are as bold as the colours of a rainbow.Unlike many others in the culinary trade in Singapore, Lin never dreamt of becoming a pastry chef. She attributes the decision behind her sudden career change to a six-month sabbatical she took in 2013.\xa0During this time, she travelled solo around the world, where she gained a plethora of new experiences.\xa0For starters, Lin tried her hand at organic farming in Taiwan and Tennessee, as well as experienced life in various cities in the United States, such as San Francisco and New York.Though these farming experiences were out of Lin’s comfort zone, they taught her to push her limits and muster the courage to try new things.\xa0“I ended up doing things that I wouldn’t usually do,” Lin muses. “You only get one chance to do certain things in life, so (I thought) why not explore the things that you typically wouldn’t?”\xa0Lin has carried this YOLO (you only live once) mentality with her since then, which is how she eventually got into baking — an interest that she unexpectedly chanced upon after returning from her holiday. Upon returning from her trip, Lin decided to leave the corporate world, using her savings to support her during this break. It was an “extended holiday without the Monday blues”, she says. This gave her time to explore new activities, such as baking.“I realised that every time I gave the bakes to my friends or family, they were very happy,” Lin added. “So I decided to sign up for pastry school.”However, the journey to becoming a pastry master wasn’t easy. Compared to other fresh-faced classmates in the programme who were in their early 20s, Lin always felt that she was racing against time to make a name for herself.\xa0But despite all odds, Lin enjoyed her time in the kitchen, where she learnt how to make different types of pastries.\xa0“It makes me very happy when I see people eating the cakes that I make,” Lin says. “It gives me the satisfaction and meaning in life that I never had when I was in a corporate job.”As part of the curriculum at At-Sunrice, Lin clinched her first internship at French establishment DB Bistro & Oyster Bar by Chef Daniel Boulud. She worked there for a year, where she familiarised herself with the ins-and-outs of working at a busy restaurant.A post shared by db Bistro & Oyster Bar SG (@dbbistrosing)She recalls the job being extremely fast-paced, which served as a good training ground for her to cope with stressful situations.\xa0But Lin realised that restaurant life wasn’t cut out for her and her true passion lay in pastry making. After graduating from the course, she worked in the pastry department at gourmet cafe The Providore.\xa0She was also a pastry chef at Japanese patisserie Kki Sweets for half a year, where she worked with owners Kenneth Seah and Delphine Lau. Lin had also previously met the couple when they were working as food consultants for The Providore.Seah is reputed for his exquisite mousse desserts that are light as air.\xa0Lin describes Seah as an inspiration of hers, and that working with him prompted her to also specialise in mousse pastries.\xa0“I saw how beautiful his craft can be,” she says. “The way he made his cakes was very inspiring, and I was motivated to create flavours of my own.”A post shared by KKI 2020 (@kki_sweets)Through these work experiences, Lin got to create new dessert recipes and hone her culinary techniques — all of which equipped her with the confidence and skills to start her own home-based business, Arc En Ciel Patisserie, in 2020.\xa0The business boomed during the pandemic, but once the borders opened, Lin saw a drastic drop in sales. She figured that her customers preferred dining at a physical outlet instead.\xa0As such, Lin decided to move the current brick-and-mortar location at Neil Road in March this year. From the moment we set foot into Arc En Ciel Patisserie, we were immediately blown away by the charming, minimalistic landscape.\xa0Decked in brown trimmings, pebble stone flooring and lush plants, it’s a cosy space that’s modelled after Lin’s fondest memories in Paris.\xa0“I like to eat cakes in parks,” Lin explains. “Sometimes the cafes don’t have a space with tables where you can eat, so you have to take the cakes (to-go).”\xa0Fashioned after parks in Paris, the interior is inspired by her love for savouring sweets in a park. It’s her labour of love and the perfect place that transports diners to her happier days in the city of love. Lin’s pastries are inspired by her frequent travels to Japan and Paris. “My cakes are a combination of Japanese and French,” she says. “My flavours are more French-style because that’s where I get my inspiration from, but the technique of doing it is more Japanese.”This technique results in cakes that are lighter and fluffier in texture.\xa0In 2019, Lin took a trip to Tokyo, where she tried a host of mousse cakes by now-defunct patisserie Hidemi Sugino. Inspired by Chef Sungi’s gorgeous entremets, Lin was motivated to also create mousse cakes with unique flavours.\xa0One of her creations includes Elijah, a tangy lime-hued treat that’s inspired by the nostalgic childhood Solero ice cream.\xa0She certainly succeeded on that front, as her picture-perfect pastries are highly beloved by diners. But what makes her desserts special is that they’re named after people and places Lin has encountered on her travels.\xa0For her, it’s not just a cake — it’s a special memory of a time she holds dear in her heart.The current menu comprises six different cakes — Dali, Athena, Johanna, Claire, Bella and Charles, which will be available until mid-October. The inspiration for this series of pastries stems from a cake-eating experience she had in Paris five years ago.\xa0For instance, Dali is a chocolate cake that’s inspired by the flavours of a chocolate pastry she ate in Paris, created by Singapore’s most popular pastry chef at the moment — French culinary artist Cedric Grolet.\xa0“I ate his chocolate tart and it was so good,” Lin reminisces. “(I remember it was) at a restaurant in (five-star hotel) Le Meurice called Le Dali, hence the name of this cake.”\xa0Bella is one of the first cakes she made. Named after her love for Paris, it’s a tantalising mango and apple mousse cake with hints of mint.“When I came back from Paris, I was very inspired by the whole trip,” Lin smiles. “I called this cake Bella because Paris is ma belle ville — my beautiful city (in French).”The dessert menu at the cafe changes every three to four months according to the season’s best. This includes seasonal fruits, so this rotation spotlights summer fruits such as peaches and mangoes.\xa0Lin affirms that her pastry flavours here are one-of-a-kind. “I like to use interesting combinations in my cakes,” Lin says. “All my cakes are an artwork in itself.”We got to try three of her mousse cakes: Charles, Claire and Athena (S$11 each). The latter is our favourite, a decadent white forest pastry that features cherry, as well as white and dark chocolate.\xa0It’s recommended to pair Athena with the fragrant lavender citrus tea, which best complements the creaminess of the cake.\xa0Charles was also a treat to savour, which featured a creative combination of lime, banana and caramel. It’s also topped with crunchy walnuts.Lin mentions that it’s her favourite pastry among the six flavours, and we can totally understand why. With just the perfect balance of sweetness and tartness, it’s an addictive dessert that will have you reaching for a second bite. Come mid-October, Arc En Ciel Patisserie will welcome a menu change. Lin teases that the new launch will feature desserts boasting alcoholic, festive flavours — just in time for Christmas.\xa0She also has plans to introduce a night menu at the end of the year. It will be an elevated, up-scale concept that includes cocktail pairings.If there’s a piece of advice that Lin wishes to share with aspiring chefs, it’s to never give up. “The path to greatness is tough,” Lin encourages. “But hang in there and enjoy the environment that you’re in rather than thinking of it as a job.” For more eats in Outram Park, check out retro burger bar The Bank and our guide on food spots in the area.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/black-knight-hotpot/:['Even though Singapore doesn’t experience the four seasons, the final months herald the monsoon season, which is usually plagued by incessant rain and cold. If you find yourself craving those stomach-warming hotpot feasts during rainy days, then the new Black Knight Hotpot seasonal menu will be right up your alley.For those unfamiliar with the name “Black Knight”, the popular Taiwanese brand first opened in Taipei in 1981. Since then, it has amassed many fans, counting renowned celebrities such as singer-songwriter Jay Chou as one of them. It eventually made its Singapore debut in 2017.Its new Autumn-Winter release sees the addition of an array of comforting dishes to Black Knight Hotpot’s menu.This includes the house signature fish maw chicken pot (S$58) that contains a treasure trove of premium collagen-rich ingredients.\xa0Simmered with fish maw, kampung chicken, dry scallops and cordyceps, the broth is creamy and rich, making it the perfect wholesome nourishment during wet spells.Black Knight Hotpot will also be unveiling a new range of cold appetisers, including the six kinds in vinegar (S$18) that features a medley of prawns, century egg, organic fungus, cucumber, peanuts and jellyfish head.\xa0For the spice fans, there’s also the spicy but refreshing Chinese cucumber salad (S$6). It’s seasoned with soy sauce, rice vinegar, garlic, and green onions — a crunchy, tangy dish that packs a punch.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50% off at picturesque date spots, including Wildseed Cafe at The Alkaff Mansion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther than the new menu items, the most exciting new development at Black Knight Hotpot has to be the limited-time offer that gives up to 30% off the total food bill.Running from September 21 to October 31, the hotpot restaurant is offering an exclusive discount to the ladies only.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/review-apricus-coffee-food-co-brunch/:['As a food destination, Jalan Kayu is quite hard to place. Most Singaporeans know the street fondly for its 24-hour servings of roti prata, teh tarik and other delectable Indian-Muslim fare. The association is famously and stubbornly synonymous.\xa0This dogged affinity is perhaps why all other entrants find it difficult to establish a foothold along this 300m stretch of road. I would know, having lived at nearby Sengkang for nearly two decades.\xa0So you must forgive my ambivalence when a friend told me about Apricus Coffee & Food Co.\xa0“Another cafe?” I wondered aloud. “And at Jalan Kayu?”\xa0I was convinced it would be a fool’s errand. But a leisurely brunch one weekday at Apricus would soon change my mind.\xa0\xa0Apricus Coffee & Food Co opened in July, and is the brainchild of Kang Yi Yang and another Muslim co-owner.\xa0Kang is also the co-owner of The Populus cafe, one of Tanjong Pagar’s OG institutions of cafe fare, which opened at the height of Singapore’s cafe craze in 2016.\xa0Many fads and one pandemic later, the outfit still stands — a testament to the owners’ ability to evolve when circumstances demand it. Besides, the food’s great, too.\xa0At Apricus, the menu retains an air of familiarity with an all-day brunch menu that’s approachable and hearty with a touch of Mediterranean influences. Meats are obtained from a 100% halal-certified source.There are also enough vegetarian options to convince me that food inclusivity here isn’t a mere afterthought. And it shows.Take the Apricus aubergine & eggs (S$20) — a carefully crafted breakfast that will fill you up as well as a meat dish would. It comes with two panko-crusted thickly cut aubergines that have been carefully cooked so they still retain a satisfying bite. The panko is delicately salted, too.The Mediterranean influence is most apparent with this plate. The panko-crusted aubergines are served with a side of moreish baba ganoush, a Middle Eastern spread made of roasted eggplants, and creamy labneh (a type of yoghurt).Throw in two poached 64°C eggs and some locally grown pea tendril salad, and you’re guaranteed a great start to the day.But if you’re not on a vegetarian schedule, I insist you order the Norwegian salmon brown butter linguine (S$23) — an elevated classic duly upgraded with modern flavours.Here, each silky strand of linguine is coated with a toasty and creamy beurre noisette, made by cooking out water from unsalted butter while turning the milk solids brown. It’s a rich and deeply intense sauce that pools at the base of the pasta and demands bread to wipe clean.\xa0Perched on the ridges of the linguine is a slab of dukkah-spiced Norwegian salmon fillet that’s assuringly flaky with a pink centre and cooked to perfection. It also comes with a side of fennel and Granny Smith apple slaw for a delicate touch of acidity.For sides, you can’t go wrong with the charred Brussels sprouts (S$12) that would give the Apollo Coffee Bar rendition a run for its money.\xa0Here, the bitter char of the Brussels sprouts makes for a heroic flavour contrast to the sultry savouriness of every other umami-laden ingredient in the bowl, such as the pickled beetroot that complements everything so beautifully I could cry.For dessert, the peanut butter and jelly sundae (S$15) brings me back to my childhood days, when breakfast was a slice of bread spread with peanut butter and jam.\xa0This one comes served with The Populus’ signature towering Niko Neko roasted-rice soft serve, lightly scented and delicately sweet, swirled carefully on a brittle wafer disc. It sits on a faultlessly fluffy buttermilk waffle (+S$5), drizzled liberally with peanut butter and raspberry sauce.\xa0Throw in some strawberries and blueberries, and this would keep a distracted child (or adult) occupied enough for mummy and daddy to enjoy their salmon pasta.\xa0Alas, Apricus’ hot White 6 oz coffee with oat milk (S$7) proves that no food joint is perfect. That the negative came from the coffee is unfortunate, especially for an institution as storied as The Populus.\xa0The fault, I’m certain, lies in the preparation. The drink is made by frothing the double-shot espresso with the milk in the milk jug, which is the strangest coffee method I’ve encountered.\xa0A white coffee, regardless of milk type, is commonly made by pouring hot stretched milk over espresso. Frothing everything together renders the entire cup weak, bland, and worse, diluted. When asked, the barista told me this was intentional owing to the use of oat milk.\xa0As a home barista myself, I beg to differ.\xa0Is it conducive to conversation? Yes, but the eatery fills up fast during lunch. If you’re looking for an intimate conversation, go earlier or a few hours after lunchtime.\xa0Is a reservation necessary? Apricus Coffee & Food Co does not accept reservations.How to get there? Bus services 85, 86, 102, and 103 call at the nearest bus stops. From there, it’s a five-minute stroll to the cafe.Take note: Avoid the two-seat table in the middle of the cafe by the wall, above the drain cover. The smell of sewage wafts up the busier the kitchen gets.\xa0Book a ride to Apricus Coffee & Food Co. 248 Jalan Kayu\nOpen: Monday, and Wednesday to Sunday (9am to 6pm) 248 Jalan Kayu\nOpen: Monday, and Wednesday to Sunday (9am to 6pm) Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/bake-anthem-sin-ming/:['Nestled in the quaint and rustic neighborhood of Sin Ming lies Bake Anthem, a store that might seem a tad out of place in a HDB estate that’s more known for provisions than artisanal goods.\xa0Bake Anthem is a takeaway shop that sells a range of homemade sourdough loaves, and its gleaming display case of freshly baked sourdough breads is a marked difference from the old-school stores surrounding it.\xa0Case in point: It’s located next to stores selling religious goods, Chinese medicines and provisions. After all, the neighbourhood of Sin Ming, generally seen as the quiet sister of its trendy neighbour, Upper Thomson, is more popular for its coffee-shop offerings than “hipster” cafes or artisanal, boutique shops.Located along 24 Sin Ming Road, Bake Anthem is just a few doors down from the busy kopitiam that houses a slew of popular stalls including Sin Ming Roti Prata.We got a chance to chat with Bake Anthem’s co-owner Renee Wee, who gave us more insight into the bakery’s ethos and genesis.According to Wee, the six-month-old Bake Anthem was a passion project she created together with her husband, a baker with close to nine years of professional baking experience.\xa0They chanced upon the rather unlikely Sin Ming location and found it a suitable location for their goals. “We felt (it) had the potential to be molded into our vision of an artisanal sourdough bakery, especially due to the surrounding customer demographic,” Wee says.For the couple, Bake Anthem is a way to spread their love for sourdough, particularly among the older generation and critics, some of whom may have had patchy experiences with the distinctly tangy bread.“You know how a lot of people, especially the older generation, tend to think of sourdough as very hard on the outside and too sour? We wanted to explore different methods of making sourdough to broaden our customers’ perception of sourdough,” Wee explains.How they are doing that is by tempering their bakes and creating loaves that are more balanced in texture and taste — that is, not too tough on the exterior and sour in the interior.It took the pair some time to convince residents of the beauty of sourdough, though. Bake Anthem started out by giving free samples to passers-by to get them acquainted with its sourdough offerings.The reception and Bake Anthem’s reviews have been very positive. “We find it very interesting (to interact with customers) and we like to hear surprised customers giving feedback that our sourdough isn’t sour and hard,” Wee observes.Besides the goal of propagating a wider love for sourdough, the couple is also hoping to forge a more supportive work environment for their team.\xa0At present, the pair entrusts the majority of Bake Anthem’s operations to their competent all-women team, and pop in on occasion to check on them and provide support.Staff and the owners work out a set schedule, but the owners do not enforce strict hours as long as the work is done and the standard of the bakes is not compromised. This means there’s more flexibility for staff if they need to leave early or come in late due to family commitments.\xa0Being parents themselves, the couple understand the struggles of juggling family time especially in the usually draining — and sometimes toxic — F&B industry.“We don’t micromanage and we recognise that they are all experts in their own right. So they are free to plan out timings that best suit them, as long as the quality is still there,” says Wee.Everything at Bake Anthem is made from scratch using the trusty mother dough starter, endearingly nicknamed “Gary”.\xa0As everything is crafted with quality in mind, there are limited quantities for each day and there will be no new batches in the afternoon, even if certain batches don’t live up to expectations.The team takes pride in transparency, regularly updating social media and explaining to customers if certain varieties are not up to scratch for sale that day.Don’t worry though, there are more than enough varieties to cater to all customers.After all, Bake Anthem has a wide range of both sweet and savoury options on its menu, ranging from mini baguettes (S$2.60) to robustly flavoured loaves such as the jalapeno cheddar (S$13).Some of our favourites included the rich and nutty dark chocolate walnut (S$8.20) and the mixed herb olive (S$13), which has a fragrant and umami flavour profile that somewhat resembles classic Italian focaccia.Another standout is the cranberry walnut spelt (S$9.50) that blends the piquant berry with the fragrant walnut. This is also one of the couple’s favourites.However, don’t brush off the bakery’s simple classic loaves, too, such as the multi-grain (S$9.20) and flax seed (S$8.40).\xa0We enjoyed these the best, as the textural quality is more evident here.For one, the crumb (inner part of the bread) is less chewy and tangy, almost like a hybrid with our familiar local-style white bread. It’s light and fluffy, with just the right touch of moisture. The crust is less dense but still crunchy, reminding us of lightly toasted bread.Apart from the regular loaves, other bestsellers at Bake Anthem include the ciabatta (S$4.20), which was already sold out when we reached at 11am, and the focaccia (S$5.50).Despite the name, the latter is actually different from the beloved Italian classic. Instead, it’s an intriguing item that focuses on sustainability, using surplus ingredients as its components. So on certain days, you’ll get a mix of herbs and olives, and on other days, it could be a combination of cheese and tomatoes.When asked what their future plans were, Wee says it’s too early to tell. However, they remain optimistic.“We’ve received a lot of encouraging feedback from customers and friends alike. It’s seeing our brand reach grow bigger than we expected, getting support for our belief in transparency and receiving praise for our sourdough for its one-of-a-kind texture that really keeps us going.”For more ideas on what to eat, read our stories on where you can still find good old-school bakes in Singapore and the best hawker eats Tiong Bahru has to offer.Bake Anthem is on the GrabFood delivery service and offers free delivery (up to S$3 off) with GrabUnlimited.\xa0Do explore the new GrabFood Dine-in service for awesome deals.You can also book a ride to Bake Anthem to snag yourself some sourdough. 24 Sin Ming Road, 01-43\nNearest MRT station: Upper Thomson\nOpen: Friday to Wednesday (9am to 6pm)24 Sin Ming Road, 01-43\nNearest MRT station: Upper Thomson\nOpen: Friday to Wednesday (9am to 6pm)AuthorEvan started off writing about food on Instagram, before joining outlets such as Buro and Confirm Good to pursue his passion.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/mish-mash/:['Looking for a new date spot to spice up date-nights with bae? Mish Mash, the glitziest new opening in Singapore, might just be what you’re looking for.Opened by the prolific Proper Concepts, architect of thriving homegrown restaurants such as The Feather Blade and Rappu, this new gastrobar promises a night full of groove, booze and plenty of saucy innuendos.Unlike many of the more bougie establishments that litter neighbouring districts such as Outram Park, the modishly retro Mish Mash\xa0brings a much livelier and youthful energy.Mish Mash bar can be found along the bustling South Bridge Road, behind a semi-hidden entrance that slides open when a “press for champagne” button is triggered.Inside, you’re greeted by swathes of technicoloured neon lights and a glistening disco ball to set the mood.Looks aside, the music is also curated towards a more vibrant ambience; it cycles through everything from funk to house, depending on the time of the night.That energy is evident in the gastronomic and beverage offerings on Mish Mash’s menu as well.This means a menu filled with quirky fusion bites that aren’t easily pigeonholed into specific genres. They are also accompanied by a deluge of creative wine-based libations crafted by co-founder and beverage director Boo Jing Heng.\xa0Boo’s CV should be enough to convince most cocktail lovers. He’s the 2016 winner of the Diageo World Class bartending competition and a former principal bartender of Jigger & Pony, which is regularly ranked as one of the top bars in Singapore.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50% off at picturesque date spots, including Wildseed Cafe at The Alkaff Mansion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo sweeten the deal, Mish Mash is offering a persuasive one-for-one wine-cocktails promo for its opening month of June — no strings attached.So don’t be shy and bring a date along to enjoy the drinks and ambience. The bar’s wacky — and borderline salacious — drink names such as Bubble Butt (S$24) and Carnal Carnage (S$22) are a sure-fire ice-breaker.Go for the former if you’re into bubbly drinks. It’s one of Mish Mash’s tangy champagne-based concoctions, and features champagne, jalapeno pickles and lager.Mish Mash’s eclectic tipples also feature wines across the whole gamut, such as the red-wine-focused Cocoa Climax (S$24) and even a sake-forward Adam & Eve (S$24) for Japanophiles.The menu will be regularly updated, with new “vintages” (a playful moniker for the individual cocktail collections) planned quarterly.\xa0If cocktails don’t tickle your fancy, the bar carries various wines on the menu, too, with a diverse selection ranging from traditional reds to funky natural oranges.Feeling peckish? You can also dive into Mish Mash’s menu which features a… mish-mash of flavours from all over the world.The Moffles (mochi waffles, S$16), in particular, present an interesting savoury twist with smoked onion dip and ikura (salmon roe).When it comes to bigger plates for sharing, Mish Mash has pasta fanatics covered with the handmade squid ink tortellini (S$22) that comes with prawns and lobster emulsion.\xa0On the other hand, those who enjoy the theatrics of oozy cheese will relish the chance to cut into the fried Bari burrata (S$26), topped with pesto espuma and tomato chutney.If you’re feeling famished, then the heftier New Zealand lamb saddle tandoori (S$48) might be worth checking out for its imaginative marriage of edamame hummus and coin prata.For more ideas on what to eat, check out our articles on Kyoto food recommendations from popular content creator GirlEatWorld and HungryGoWhere’s huge first-anniversary giveaway.Book a ride to the new Mish Mash gastrobar in Singapore.198 South Bridge Road\nNearest MRT station: Chinatown\nOpen: Wednesday to Friday (6pm to 12am), Saturday (12pm to 3pm, 6pm to 12am), Sunday (12pm to 3pm, 5.30pm to 10.30pm)198 South Bridge Road\nNearest MRT station: Chinatown\nOpen: Wednesday to Friday (6pm to 12am), Saturday (12pm to 3pm, 6pm to 12am), Sunday (12pm to 3pm, 5.30pm to 10.30pm)AuthorEvan started off writing about food on Instagram, before joining outlets such as Buro and Confirm Good to pursue his passion.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/nico-cafe-wheelock-place/:['Looking for a chic new date spot in Orchard to impress? Then you’d definitely have to add the new Nico Cafe at Wheelock Place to your shortlist.Primed for its grand opening tomorrow, September 1, the natty brunch spot is the newest cafe by the Fleursophy Group. The group is the mastermind behind other Insta-worthy hotspots such as Le Jardin, Under der Linden and, of course, the original Nico Cafe outlet at Telok Kurau.Unlike its sibling cafes, the new Nico Cafe at Wheelock Place focuses heavily on a relaxing al fresco dining experience.\xa0It’s located right outside the stunning two-storey Zall Bookstore, with most of its seats found outdoors. But if you’re looking for a meal under the air-conditioning, the chic date spot also provides a handful of seats inside Zall Bookstore itself.However, most of its magic is found in the open, built around a wooden veranda amid a lush canopy of botanics and dainty overhanging light bulbs.Not just that: The outdoor garden is given a touch of fairy tale-esque whimsicality with cute trinkets and a wall array that’s studded with vintage books — a nod to its partner, Zall Bookstore.The menu at Nico Cafe is rather eclectic, featuring the gamut of classic cafe items including salads, toasts, sandwiches, pancakes, bakes, and reasonably priced donburi.One standout was, surprisingly, the nondescript plate of crispy chicken wings. The dish comes with six pieces and is available in either sweet and sour (S$8.90) or Szechuan mala (S$9.90).The simple dish comes well-seasoned, with enough umami and kick — but not too much — and with only the gentlest numbing heat at the end.

This includes home-baked cakes including tiramisu cake (with alcohol, S$10.90), pistachio dacquoise (S$10.90) and a pretty strawberry shortcake (S$10.90).If cakes aren’t your beat, then there are also the ever-popular waffles and souffle pancakes.\xa0You’ll find tried-and-tested ensembles such as waffles with ice cream (S$18.90) but also a crazier spin like the Chocolate Overload (S$24.90) that’s sinfully loaded with dark chocolate sauce, a 64% dark chocolate coating and dark chocolate ice cream.Caffeine addicts will also want to get in on some of the grand opening specials.

If you’re a fur parent, you probably love the idea of having brunch with your furkids at a pet-friendly venue; bonus points if the venue makes for a perfect photo-op, too. Did you know that there’s quite a number of pet-friendly bars you can head to, for those days when you just feel like chilling with a pint, but you don’t want to leave your four-legged best friend at home?If you’re thinking of grabbing a drink and vibing with your doggos, we’ve got you covered with a list of the most delightful pet-friendly bars Singapore has to offer.KAP Residences, 01-09, 9 King Albert Park\nOpen: Wednesday to Sunday (9am to 11pm) Why visit? The popular King Albert Park establishment serves up artisanal bakes in the day, but turns into an idyllic pet-friendly destination at night.

Do note that only KAP outlet, and not its Farrer Park outlet, is pet-friendly.Price range: $$Crowd favourites: Besides the range of craft beers on tap that are constantly on rotation, Yeastside is best known for its sourdough pizzas, which are only available from 4pm onwards.\xa0Expect all kinds of toppings ranging from the simple queen margherita (S$18, tomato sauce, mozzarella, fresh basil and olive oil) to quirkier creations such as the char-grilled chicken pesto (S$24, pesto, garlic-roasted tomatoes, chargrilled chicken, mozzarella and yellow onions).The Garage, Level 1, Singapore Botanic Gardens, 50 Cluny Park Road\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (8am to 10pm)Why visit?

If you’re planning to bring your furkids out to explore the Botanic Gardens, consider swinging by this pet-friendly bar for an aperitif or two after your adventure.Price range: $$Crowd favourites: Bistro-style bites are the establishment’s bread and butter, which means diners shouldn’t miss out on signatures such as the smoked chicken mayo pizza (S$28). More importantly, booze is made affordable with its daily happy hour from 6pm to 8pm, with two premium house cocktails going for S$30 nett. These include the Passionate (vodka, passionfruit, orange and grenadine).If you’re not fussed about what you’re drinking, head down between Mondays and Thursdays from 5pm to 8pm, where you can get S$10 house pour spirits and an even better deal of two house cocktails for S$25 nett.

Needless to say, you also get to enjoy good food and drinks.Price range:\xa0 $$$Crowd favourites: After three years, Raw Kitchen Bar will be host to a new concept in collaboration with homegrown brands Grain Traders and Bunker Bunker starting from Sept 28. The menu focuses on chicken rotisserie and is fittingly named “Coop Coop”.But many of its Bali-inspired all-time favourites still remain on the menu, including the fall-off-the-bone pork ribs with Warung glaze (from S$32) and intensely smokey Black Mamba (S$27) squid-ink fried rice.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/synthesis-bar-sebastian-ang/:['“Don’t judge a store by its front,” reads a neon sign at Mama Diam, one of Singapore’s most viral hidden restaurants.That seems par for the course for its owner Sebastian Ang. There’s more than meets the eye when it comes to the boyish 32-year-old, whose body of work is all about looking past facades.In the last two years, he has founded two secret bars in Singapore, both of which have gone viral on social media.At Mama Diam, Singapore’s well-loved mama-shop (provision-shop) culture is given its moment in the limelight.A 103-seat restaurant on Prinsep Street dishing up Singapore flavours with a twist, it’s Ang’s baby — one nurtured through the pandemic.It’s easy to miss if you weren’t in the know. After all, it’s tucked away behind the facade of a void-deck mama shop.\xa0The facade comes complete with a veritable hoard of nostalgia fodder — all the snacks, toys and magazines you remember from your childhood, faux-jade marbled tabletops, and even a mechanical horse ride for kids.Wend your way past the shopkeeper-slash-host — dressed on point in a white tee, sarong and a Good Morning towel. Slide the display bookcase to the side and you’ll enter a whole new world hidden within.The same idea is replicated at Synthesis, a bar in Suntec City concealed behind an old-school traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) shopfront.\xa0Besides showing a predilection for hidden bars, Ang’s concepts remind us of institutions that are slowly disappearing.“Nostalgia always catches your attention,” Ang says. “I always try to bring this emotion out, whether it’s the place, the way the food is done, or the music being played.”A post shared by HungryGoWhere (@hungrygowhere)Before Covid-19, Ang primarily organised events in the nightlife space and occasionally did odd jobs in F&B.Back then, he hadn’t considered the culinary arts as a full-time career and certainly hadn’t trained in it.\xa0But he enjoyed cooking, and honed his skills by making dishes for his friends and family.\xa0“I really like to cook. Where people — guys especially — like to play (video) games (in their free time), I will take the time to watch (cooking) videos. I had a passion for that.”His first foray into the F&B space as a business owner came during the height of the pandemic.\xa0His friend owned a karaoke pub on Neil Road and needed to pivot quickly to serving food so as to stay afloat. At that time, many nightlife businesses had to shut because of pandemic restrictions to curb social gatherings in enclosed spaces.\xa0“I went in, took the offer and renovated the office into a small kitchen,” says Ang. The space then became A Sticky Situation, a skewer bar named thus for the uncertain pandemic times Singaporeans were living in.The business, however, took a beating during the Covid-19 Heightened Alert phase, which prevented establishments from having dine-in customers. “Delivery was hard for us because the food we served didn’t travel well,” he adds.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50% off at picturesque date spots, including Wildseed Cafe at The Alkaff Mansion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAng then decided to focus on a new concept — the present-day Mama Diam.The previous occupant of the space, bistro and tapas bar Alps Cafe, could no longer sustain the rent and offered it to Ang.“(The previous occupant) believed in the idea, so he’s currently my silent partner.”Ang also has another partner, who owns Club FML, the pub next door to Mama Diam.“I always wanted a hidden bar and restaurant of my own, and I felt that (the current space) was very suitable because of the al fresco area.”He adds: “Prinsep has always been a place for cheap drinks and entertainment, so to have a cocktail bar in this area is something new.”Despite its present viral status, Mama Diam opened with the bare minimum.“I was in charge of food. We didn’t have HR, accounts or marketing. I did everything myself,” Ang says. “The R&D (for the menu) was done at home.”Money was tight, too.\xa0“I realised I didn’t have enough funds and couldn’t do it myself. So I took the proposal and went knocking on doors — friends, investors — to see who was interested to chip in.“We made this place happen with the least we could afford,” adds Ang. “Everything you see here was very basic. There was no interior designer.”He even did some of the carpentry measurements himself during the initial renovation.Mama Diam was originally conceived as a 7-Eleven-style convenience-store concept.\xa0That was before Ang learnt that an elderly couple who was running a mama shop in Clementi had plans to retire.\xa0“I popped by and saw them selling the shelves. I bought everything — that’s what’s outside (Mama Diam) now.“That was how the concept changed,” he adds. “It was like bringing their old mama shop into a new setting.”That’s when inspiration took flight.\xa0Says Ang: “Hidden bars — overseas and locally — are all modern-inspired. (I aim) for every establishment that I open to be locally driven.”And to his credit as well: Mama Diam has gained popularity, drawing a visit from Hong Kong rapper Jackson Wang in December 2022, in addition to being featured in a Singapore Tourism Board video campaign.“After that video went viral, business was really, really good,” says Ang. “So that’s when I thought: ‘Okay, maybe we should expand.’”After being approached by Suntec City’s leasing team, Ang worked with new partners to raise the capital needed to start Synthesis.For his second concept, Ang drew on his childhood memories with his grandmother, who used to work at a TCM medical hall in Kallang Bahru.Synthesis eschews the look of modern TCM halls, though. Instead, it favours those from the 1970s.“I want people to know how TCM halls used to look like. It’s more like a museum and is more educational. All the herbs outside are real,” says Ang.“We ventured into TCM cocktails to showcase the different kinds of herbs,” adds Ang, citing danggui (angelica root) as one such ingredient.Two months after its launch, Synthesis bar is still finding its footing, he says. A new, more affordable menu will be available in the next few weeks.Nonetheless, business seems brisk. When HungryGoWhere paid a visit late on a Thursday afternoon, the early dinner crowd had already filed in, with another seating scheduled for later that evening.Ang considers himself a hands-on boss who continues to oversee many tasks. These include developing new dishes, doing invoices and sitting in for staff appraisals.But if he’s learnt anything from his experience thus far, it’s to delegate more, so that he can focus on other aspects of the business.With two concepts under his belt, Ang is working on a third that’s slated for launch in August.\xa0Located above Mama Diam’s premises, it will be a coffee bar by day and a cocktail bar by night — one that’s inspired by the corridors between Housing and Development Board flats.Mama Diam will also be revamping its food and drinks menu next month.Check out our stories on other young entrepreneurs at Atas Butter and Cat in the Hat.

To celebrate that, the first 100 people to take a photo in front of the cafe’s mural and tag the brand’s Instagram page will receive a free chocolate or vanilla bomboloni!Of course, most of us wouldn’t be satisfied with just the simple chocolate or vanilla filling. Not when its airily soft sourdough bombos (from S$3.80) come in so many unique flavours.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Feuds: Saizeriya vs Milan Shokudo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome bestsellers include the fragrant earl grey milk (S$4.50), rich and tangy blueberry cheesecake (S$5.20), and indulgent seasalt maple (S$5.50).But if these aren’t unique enough for you, The Fat Kid Bakery also has a range of donuts with delectable savoury fillings.

The snack, also known as red tortoise cake, is a small round or oval-shaped pastry with a soft, sticky glutinous-rice flour skin wrapped around a filling in the centre.In 2021, after decades of drawing huge crowds at Everton Park, Ji Xiang launched its flagship store at 235 Victoria Street in Bugis, on the watch of the couple’s son and the outlet’s second-generation owner, Mr Kelvin Toh.Ji Xiang makes its products by hand in-store daily with no preservatives, to ensure each kueh gets that delicate chewy skin.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50% off at picturesque date spots, including Wildseed Cafe at The Alkaff Mansion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15 best fish head curry in Singapore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile there, you can find a variety of classic (S$1.60) ang ku kueh flavours, if you need a taste of nostalgia to get you through a stressful day.There are the quintessential peanut and sweet bean flavours, but you can also switch things up with options including salted bean, coconut, corn and yam.Aside from these favourites, Ji Xiang has also put a twist on the classic snack with a line of premium (S$3.50) flavours.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/328-katong-laksa-vs-janggut-laksa/:['In our new series Food Feuds, we visit competing local food stalls known for their rivalry and try to find out which one does it better.Who in Singapore hasn’t heard of Katong laksa? It’s one of the many versions of laksa that can be found on our sunny island, together with the tamarind-spiked Penang assam laksa and the curry-like Sarawak. But unlike the other two, the Katong variant is the only one that can be considered homegrown.Inspired by the Peranakan’s nyonya laksa, Katong laksa has a bright orange shrimp stock that’s mellowed out, aromatised with coconut milk, topped with ingredients such as prawns, blood cockles, fish cake, and served with spicy sambal. It’s then garnished with daun kesum flakes (also called laksa leaf or Vietnamese coriander).The dish’s defining characteristic? Thick rice vermicelli cut into short two-inch pieces that you can slurp up with a spoon — no chopsticks needed.Katong laksa is so coveted that it’s now available all across the country (we’re not that big of an island, but still…) as enterprising cooks try to replicate the dish, but it’s generally accepted that authentic Katong laksa still comes from the stalls in the Peranakan quarter.You’d perhaps heard of the time when Gordon Ramsay faced off against a certain laksa stall and lost.That was 328 Katong Laksa, which quickly rose into new-found popularity among an international audience.\xa0Yet, they only came into existence in 1998, 35 years after Janggut Laksa sold its first bowl of noodles.\xa0The history goes like this: Janggut Laksa’s founder Ng Juat Swee (the name comes from his nickname Janggut, or beard in Malay) would go around Marine Parade peddling his laksa from metal buckets on a pole slung over his shoulders.\xa0The Fujian native moved to Singapore in his teens and married a Peranakan, thus explaining his knowledge of nyonya laksa.He was the first to cut the noodles up so that customers could eat his laksa easily, with just a spoon. He eventually upgraded to a tricycle, and in the late 1950s rented a coffee shop space at 49 East Coast Road together with his younger brother Ng Chwee Seng. They called it Marine Parade Laksa.\xa0When Janggut passed away in 1986, his family closed the stall and the space was taken over by the current owner of 328 Laksa, Nancy Lim, who used to work at the stall under Ng Chwee Seng.Janggut’s family restarted the business two years later, first just up the street near Roxy Theatre, before moving it to its current location of Roxy Square in 2000 and adding several more outlets in Queensway, Ang Mo Kio and Paya Lebar.For the sake of this article, I’ll only talk about the food from the main Roxy Square outlet.The point is, both 328 Katong Laksa and Janggut Laksa come from the same roots, though the former has since tweaked its recipe over the years. What we get now is two vaguely similar bowls, each with their own merits.51 East Coast Road\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (9.30am to 9.30pm)Long regarded as the benchmark for good Singapore laksa, 328 Katong Laksa is popular among both tourists and locals for serving up reliable and delicious bowls of laksa.The East Coast Road outlet has been around since the 1990s. 328 is clearly the more commercial (they currently have four outlets islandwide and are open to franchising) of the two brands in question, but this original outlet still has nostalgic vibes — just ignore the plethora of celebrity endorsement-style photos on the wall — especially if you sit outside, along the side of the road. The shop was relatively empty when I visited on a weekday afternoon, but I’ve seen the place packed during weekends. Service was brisk and I got my laksa within minutes.Noodles: 4.5/5The noodles here are firm and ever-so-slightly chewy and cut very consistently so as to fit easily into the spoon. I’ve had laksa noodles that are either too hard or too mushy and this is definitely not one of them. This is important as the rice noodles need to be of the right consistency to cling onto the broth.Toppings: 3.5/5The partially butterflied prawns come fairly large, as do the plump blood cockles, though I noticed the prawns didn’t taste particularly fresh and sweet. The savoury fish cakes are sliced into perfect rectangle strips — in fact, the individual ingredients seem to be just the right size to make each collective bite satisfying.Soup: 4.5/5What a great broth: Thick (but not overly so) and flavourful with savoury-salty crustacean goodness from the fried hae bi (dried shrimp). It’s also balanced out well by the coconut milk and a hint of spices and herbs (turmeric, galangal) to give the soup a complex body that’s very enjoyable.Sambal: 4.5/5While I’m not a fan of how 328 Katong Laksa packages its sambal in plastic packets (presumably so tourists or those who can’t take much spice can choose how much they wish to add), this is some incredible stuff. There’s an instant whiff of intense spices, and it adds a very robust shrimpy onion flavour to the dish once mixed in. It’s very spicy and sure to warm your belly.Value: 3.5/5Their bowls start from S$7, with a bigger one available for S$9, so it’s not the cheapest bowl of laksa out there (prices here have shot up over the years). The pricier bowl doesn’t have much more ingredients than the former, but it sure has a lot of noodles. Most diners will be happy with the smaller size.Final score: 82%\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Junction Westgate opening with promos; will house 23 tenants, including new halal teppanyaki\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHawker Hustlers: Hipster hawker Ray Yeo of Bei-Ing Dimsum Club on reinventing dim sum and his love for all things Japan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoxy Square, 01-64, 50 East Coast Road\nOpen: Monday to Friday (10.30am to 4.30pm), Saturday to Sunday (9am to 4.30pm)The one that started it all! We wish Janggut Laksa had stayed in its beautiful shophouse, but this location isn’t so bad either — at least there’s air-conditioning.It’s amusing to see their sign plastered all across the coffeeshop, but it’s well-deserved. Janggut Laksa has made its fair share of appearances on both the news and food media for being the progenitor of the famed Katong laksa.\xa0There were two people in front of me in the queue, despite being 3pm on a weekday afternoon. Only one person — a long-time employee (not the daughter of Janggut, as she’s usually based at the Queenstown outlet) and a very sweet lady — was manning the counter, but she was quick to scoop up a hot bowl of laksa for me.Noodles: 4/5The rice vermicelli was cut short in the typical style, making it easy to eat with just a spoon. The noodles are softer, and a little more haphazardly cut than 328’s, but still offers a nice chew and size that’s easy to slurp up with a spoon.Toppings: 4/5You get plenty of bean sprouts and fish cake in each bite. The handful of prawns and qi hum, while slightly smaller than those at 328, are sweeter, fresher, and firmer to the bite. The blood cockles have that slightly metallic taste (from high amounts of iron) and ocean flavour that makes it such a delicacy.\xa0Slivers of daun kesum, more loosely chopped than 328’s, add a more pronounced lemony, spicy and tangy flavour compared to the dried ones at the other shop.Soup: 3/5The yellowish broth is visibly less thick and oily than 328’s (and most places in fact) – more like a savoury, thin milky broth than the creamy, gravy-ish soup I’ve come to associate with laksa. It means that it’s a lot more drinkable, but also less fragrant and rich. The umami crustacean flavour is there, thanks to the minced hae bi (dried shrimp), but I wished it could be a bit more lemak with a stronger and sweeter coconut flavour. The difference is especially stark as I had both bowls back-to-back.Sambal: 4/5The deep red sambal here is quite decent, partially sweet and shrimpy, a tad salty, and so fine it quickly blends into the broth. It’s not particularly spicy though, so help yourself to more sambal at the counter if you want a stronger kick.Value: 3.5/5Starting from S$5.50 for a small bowl, Janggut is a fair bit more affordable than 328 Laksa, though I still recommend getting their medium (S$6.50) or large bowl (S$7.50) as the small one might not be enough for most people. My medium size bowl had enough ingredients in every bite to make for a satisfying meal, with four to five prawn slices and a good spoonful of cockles and sliced fish cake.\xa0Final score: 74%The winner: 328 Katong LaksaAs commercial as it is and despite the fact that it’s been around for a shorter period of time, 328 Katong Laksa wins by a good margin on delivering a consistent, solid bowl of nyonya laksa that’s as lemak and mass-appeasing as it gets.Having said that, Janggut Laksa has its fair share of loyal customers, with short queues forming even at 3pm on a weekday. They must be doing something right, even if their laksa feels a bit less satisfying to me — mostly because of the broth, which is what makes laksa… laksa.\xa0HungryGoWhere paid for its meals at both stalls for this article.For more ideas on what to eat, check out our top bak chor mee or Chomp Chomp Food Centre picks.Both stores are on the GrabFood delivery service and offer free delivery (up to S$3 off) with GrabUnlimited.Alternatively, you can book a ride to 328 Katong Laksa and Janggut Laksa.Do explore the new GrabFood Dine-in service for awesome deals.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/hill-street-tai-hwa-pork-noodle-vs-tai-wah-pork-noodle/:['In our new series Food Feuds, we visit competing local food stalls known for their rivalry and try to find out which one does it better. First up, it’s the battle of the bak chor mee — our beloved minced meat noodles — between Hill Street Tai Hwa and Tai Wah.Six dollars for a Michelin-starred meal? Take it with a pinch of salt: The award is not all that matters in Singapore, where high quality chow — that one might even call ‘artisanal’ in other ahem, fancy Western countries — are all over the place in hawker centres and kopitiams around the island.\xa0However, it’s a fact that one stall, Hill Street Tai Hwa Pork Noodle, still holds that honour. Its winning formula? The iconic combination of springy egg noodles, minced meat, wontons, and a savoury chilli sauce spiked with black vinegar that creates the now-iconic bak chor mee.I say feud, but it’s really a sort of healthy competition (don’t get me started on a literal blood-sprinkled rivalry between two murtabak joints — that’ll come in a later article) between family members.\xa0The history behind Hill Street Tai Hwa Pork Noodle in Singapore goes back to 1939, when Southern Chinese immigrant Tang Joon Teo started Tai Wah Teochew Minced Pork Noodles at the Taiwah Coffee Shop on Hill Street. Together with his two sons, he was recognised as the first to create what we know now as the Teochew bak chor mee, marked by his signature vinegar sauce.Essentially, they moved several times over the course of the war and for decades after — to a coffee shop on Cecil Street in the 60s and later, Marina City Food Court, in 1979.The older child, Tang Chay Seng, took over the stall while the younger son, Tang Chai Chye, opened another branch on High Street Centre, which later moved to its present location at Hong Lim Food Centre in 2003.It’s all a bit convoluted, but essentially, both brands come from the same family and inherited the same recipe from the late Mr Tang, and you can expect similarities in their recipe and offerings, with a few tweaks here and there.Tai Hwa Eating House, 01-12, 466 Crawford Lane\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (9.30am to 9pm)Hill Street Tai Hwa Pork Noodle, which has been situated at Tai Hwa Eating House on Crawford Lane since 2004, is by far the more popular of the two, mostly thanks to the One Michelin star that it first received in 2016.Fun fact: It’s now the only hawker left with the honour, ever since Hawker Chan soya sauce chicken lost its star two years back.The original, smaller stall is located at the extreme right of the coffeeshop, though it has since opened another one on the opposite end, manned by Mr Tang’s daughter. Expect to wait any time of the day: We queued for a good 15 minutes, even during an early weekday morning.\xa0Coming early has its perks as you might be able to witness the elder Tang Chay Seng in action — the stall is usually manned by his cook, who’s been with him for more than a decade.Noodles: 4.5/5The cooked-to-order mee pok is boiled — to borrow the term from Italian pasta — till al dente, which is more than I can say for a lot of minced pork noodles I’ve had in other places. It’s firm with a lot of ‘oomph’, and as it’s a bit thicker than the usual mee pok, it helps soak up the accompanying sauce even better.\xa0The undesirable alkaline taste (from lye water) that’s common in egg noodles is completely absent here, which is more than I can say for many other minced pork noodle spots. If I had to nitpick, it’d be that the noodles weren’t as springy or ‘QQ’ as the ones at Tai Wah.Sauce: 3.5/5Hill Street Tai Hwa’s sauce is generally well-balanced, with a bit of chilli heat and sourness from rice vinegar.I’ve been here multiple times, and for some reason, the sauce I had during my latest visit was a tad saltier and less vinegary than I remember. It’s still pretty nuanced and goes great with the noodles, but just a tad salty. Toppings: 4.5/5Tai Hwa’s secret is in the toppings: the minced pork comes in well-formed, chunky pieces and remains fresh and juicy. The liver is brilliant, cooked just enough to be tender without being grainy. The small meatballs are compact but soft and bouncy (though not in that overly processed way).\xa0Enter the ti poh (dried sole fish), one of the favourite ingredients of Teochew cooking. Fried till a cracker-like texture, it’s enveloped in sauce and gives a deep umami flavour to the dish. The lard is crispy and good as well.If you get the bigger bowls, you’ll get three wontons that are filled with soft minced pork — it has a less substantial and tasty bite than I’d like.Soup: 4.5/5Soup at coffeeshops are often just an afterthought: A bland and flavourless sidepiece. Well, not here.\xa0Hill Street Tai Hwa’s soup not just complements the noodles but also stands out in its own way — rich with porky, seaweedy umami and slightly tangy, thanks to bits of dong cai (pickled cabbage) that also add some crunch.Value: 4.5/5The smallest bowl available here starts at S$6, which isn’t that expensive for bak chor mee of this standard (even the ones at regular kopitiams start from five bucks these days).\xa0You get a good amount of ingredients, too, just fewer meatballs and no wontons. You can top up for the S$8 or S$10 bowl for a more substantial portion of noodles and toppings, which I’d say is totally justifiable for food this special.\xa0Final score: 86%Hong Lim Market and Food Centre. 02-16, 531A Upper Cross Street\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (7.30am to 7.30pm)Located on the second floor of Hong Lim Food Centre, Tai Wah Pork Noodle was for the longest time overshadowed by the Hill Street store.\xa0It’s since gained a bit of attention after getting a Michelin Bib Gourmand in 2018, which it has retained ever since, now boasting queues of up to an hour during lunch time.There are multiple outlets islandwide, including Ang Mo Kio, Changi and Hougang, but this outlet is the only one with the award.During our visit there, the proprietor Tang Chai Chye (younger brother of the Hill Street store boss) would help take orders and prepare portions, while his eldest son handled the cooking.Be prepared to wait around 5 minutes per bowl as each order is cooked individually (we had to wait more than 15 minutes, even though we visited early in the morning). Needless to say, its recipe bears a lot of similarities to the other famous stall, while maintaining several key differences.Noodles: 5/5Tai Wah’s mee pok noodles come thinner than Tai Hwa’s and are smooth with just the right combination of springiness and bounce — aka the much-coveted ‘QQ-ness’. Despite its slipperiness, it had no trouble picking up every bit of the gravy. These noodles are very satisfying to slurp up.Sauce: 4.5/5I felt that Tai Hwa’s chilli sauce was a little salty, so I was pleased that the one here was largely more balanced in terms of savouriness, spiciness and vinegary kick. It also had a hint of sweet oiliness from the lard oil, which helps to coat every strand of noodle.Toppings: 3.5/5While Tai Hwa has all of its toppings on top of its noodles, Tai Wah only has minced meat, sliced meat, liver, and sole fish in the bowl, while dumplings and meat balls go inside the soup. For the sake of comparison, I’ll count all of them as toppings.The crunchy sole fish, fried to golden brown, comes in thinner slices, with a deep savoury flavour — no complaints here. There are little clumps of tender and minced meat that go well with the noodles. On the other hand, the sliced meat was overcooked and a tad tough, and the liver more grainy than tender.The soup toppings are awesome. You get three small but dense meatballs that are deliciously juicy and give way with just a little bite. The wontons are also tightly packed with marinated meat filling that’s very toothsome.Soup: 3/5The soup at Tai Wah is okay, but not great. The sole fish and small clump of seaweed adds a mild fishy umami, while cloudy bits of minced meat colour the broth. Otherwise, there’s not much complexity in the flavour, especially when compared to Tai Hwa’s.Value: 3.5/5Like Tai Hwa, Tai Wah’s bowls are priced at S$6, S$8, and S$10. The stall is generous with its variety and hearty portion of ingredients. The noodles and soup toppings are especially delicious and worth the price and queue, even if the other toppings were not particularly satisfactory.Final score: 78%The winner: Hill Street Tai Hwa Pork NoodlesWhile both Hill Street Tai Hwa Pork Noodle and Tai Wah Pork Noodle dish up an above-average bowl of bak chor mee, the win goes to Tai Hwa in terms of overall execution. There’s a reason why it has been able to hold its Michelin star for years, after all.\xa0The well-cooked noodles, toppings, sauce, and soup all come together harmoniously for a mostly mouthwatering noodle-slurping experience, even if the combination of sauces was not as balanced during my latest visit.As for Tai Wah Pork Noodle, while I love its springy noodles more for its better bite, layered sauce, as well as the chonky wontons, it doesn’t quite make up for the tough pork slices and liver, and a slightly lacklustre soup.\xa0Then again, it might just be a matter of preference — I know many who still prefer Tai Wah’s rendition of bak chor mee.HungryGoWhere paid for its meals at both stalls for this article.Interested in more local foods?

As long as you’ve made a reservation, you can ring the team upon reaching Beach Station for a ride to its venue.\xa0\xa0A post shared by HungryGoWhere (@hungrygowhere)As with any beach club, Tipsy Unicorn has got a good amount of beanbags, daybeds and cabanas for you to soak in the sun, and even private suites on its second floor.Its stripey purple beanbags, which are located on the property’s sandy beachfront right on Siloso Beach, do not come with a minimum spend and are for walk-ins only.But if you’re looking for something more luxurious, the minimum spend for its daybeds starts at S$200, and goes up to S$3,000 for its biggest private suite, which comes with a private jacuzzi.\xa0Tipsy Unicorn takes reservations for its daybeds, cabanas and suites. You can find the latest price list for its daybeds, cabanas and suites on Tipsy Unicorn’s website.\xa0If you’re out for a fun day in the sun, chances are that food is likely an afterthought.\xa0But not at Tipsy Unicorn — it has a full-fledged menu with starters, sides, robust mains, and photo-worthy desserts.\xa0Fans of Tipsy’s F&B offerings will be glad to know that even with the change in environment, familiar favourites such as its XO fried carrot cake (S$16) and moonlight truffle beef hor fun (S$28) are firmly on the menu.\xa0Owing to its beach club setting, the Tipsy Unicorn kitchen headed by chef Alvin Tan is also introducing more seafood-focused dishes, such as grilled prawns gem salad (S$24), seafood paella (S$42) and spicy salmon crispy rice (S$16).You’ll also find sharing-friendly beachside snacks, such as Tipsy’s signature wok-fired beef cubes (S$24) and Szechuan mala karaage (mala-flavoured fried chicken, S$16), as well as new menu items such as the spiced lentil tarts (S$18).If you’re looking for something more aligned with its unicorn theme for the ’gram, its menu doesn’t disappoint.\xa0For menu items with a difference, try its sunchoke soup (S$14), an artichoke cream soup with rainbow croutons, or the show-stopping Mystical Unihorn (S$18), a chocolate-based dessert with a fiery presentation.Thirsty? Tipsy Unicorn serves up specially curated cocktails such as its new sake sangria (S$22 for a glass, S$86 for a jug), or even tropical drinks such as the pomegranate mojito (bacardi, mint syrup, pomegranate juice, pomegranate vinaigrette, S$22).All things considered, this new Sentosa hotspot feels like it’s got a bit of everything and it’s easy to plan for a whole day here, especially since it’s even got fitness classes, a Puma concept store, and music acts in the mix.\xa0Just remember two things: Sunblock, and that the place has a vomit penalty of S$1,000 if you puke in the pool.\xa0\xa0Looking for more ideas on where to go or what to eat?

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/eat-3-bowls-compass-one/:['Popular local Taiwanese eatery Eat 3 Bowls has opened a new outlet at Compass One — the brand’s first foray into a commercial mall and the north-east.The quaint, casual eating space, located at the mall’s basement level one, opens officially on Oct 2, Monday.\xa0\xa0\xa0With the launch of Eat 3 Bowls Compass One, the brand is introducing several new items to its menu:\xa0Fans of the Taiwanese eatery can continue to expect favourites such as the Eat 3 Bowls signature trio combo (S$12.90), comprising braised pork rice, oyster intestine mee sua and chicken rice, and its braised pig intestines (S$7.50) on Eat 3 Bowls’ Compass One’s menu.\xa0News of the Compass One outlet came shortly after it announced the permanent closure of its well-loved Crawford Lane outlet on Sept 24, much to the sadness of long-time regulars.Eat 3 Bowls has another outlet at MapleTree Business Park in Pasir Panjang, which opened in early 2021, but most still associate the brand with its iconic Crawford Lane outlet, which has a retro Taiwanese school theme.While Eat 3 Bowls’ Compass One spot gives off modern-minimalist vibes, we couldn’t help but wish it brought some of that old-school charm to its first mall outlet.\xa0You’ll still be reminded of Taiwan, though — a huge illustration of the country’s map greets you immediately when you enter the space.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tried and rated 30 stalls selling wanton mee in Singapore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10 limited-time GrabFood Dine-in deals to stretch your dollar at your neighbourhood malls\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12 best hawker stalls at Chomp Chomp Food Centre\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA post shared by HungryGoWhere (@hungrygowhere)Eat 3 Bowls’ new crepe and sandwich additions add much flavour and variety to its already extensive menu, and at very affordable prices.We enjoyed its Taiwanese cold noodles (S$5.90), a welcome reprieve in hot, hot Singapore, though the sesame sauce dressing tasted a tad short of authentic. It just didn’t quite have the aromatic nuttiness of the usual ma jiang mian (sesame noodles in Chinese) bowls you’d find in Taipei.\xa0Definitely also try its hashbrown egg crepe roll (S$5.50), which resembles the McDonalds’ breakfast wrap but with a very yummy sweet garlicky sauce.\xa0We were told that these menu items will be introduced first at Compass One, and may be added to the Pasir Panjang outlet over time — so if you’re craving for its latest dishes, dining at Compass One might be your best bet. For now.That said, snagging a dine-in spot at this outlet might be challenging given its limited seats, especially in its opening month and with the new menu offerings.But hey, that’s the great thing about mall-based eateries — at least you get to wait in cool, air-conditioned comfort.\xa0\xa0This was a hosted media tasting.\xa0Why not read a couple of other food stories while you wait?

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/singapore-hawkers-awards-2023/:['Just last week, nine hawkers received deserved plaudits at the Singapore Hawkers’ Awards, organised by The Federation of Merchants’ Associations, Singapore (FMAS) and supported by the National Environment Agency (NEA).Running a hawker stall is a demanding and, oftentimes, thankless job — toiling away in hot and cramped spaces, devoting long hours of the day just to feed us our favourite foods.Naturally, it’s always heartwarming to see their efforts and dedication recognised. First introduced in 2021, the Singapore Hawkers’ Awards is relatively new compared to the likes of the Michelin Bib Gourmand, but it also shines a light on the more under-the-radar hawkers and not just the most popular names.The award acknowledges these hawkers’ contribution to the local hawker scene in three aspects: Heritage, enterprise and mentorship —\xa0 a new category introduced this year.This year’s Singapore Hawkers’ Awards celebrates three storied brands found in different regions of Singapore, acknowledging the importance of heritage hawker establishments as a country with a UNESCO-recognised hawker culture.D’Authentic Nasi Lemak, a brand known for its lemak rice and highly customisable nasi lemak, is the youngest of the three, having been around for 27 years. In contrast, Tian Nan Xing Minced Pork Noodle is a fourth-generation run pioneer that has been around for an impressive 100 years and known for its soupy bak chor mee.Similarly, Michelin-approved Hoo Kee Rice Dumpling is recognised for its 40 years in the business at Amoy Street Food Centre, dating back to the 1980s. However, its heritage can be traced back even further — back to its roots as a street stall in 1948, also operating at Amoy Street.Taman Jurong Market and Food Centre 02-108, 3 Yung Sheng RoadBesides heritage, the Singapore Hawker’s Awards also highlights innovations in a fast-paced industry, choosing to spotlight three businesses that have embraced technology to improve the quality of life for both themselves and customers.Both Butternut and New World Congee have leveraged on efficient equipment to streamline operations, such as specialised congee cookers and dough-rolling machines. Butternut even uses a high-speed oven to speed up the cooking process for its signature super-thin pizzas to a stunning 1 minute and 20 seconds.On the other hand, Grandma Ban Mian chose to tap digitalisation to grow and diversify its business by venturing into the e-commerce space. Besides serving its hearty ban mian at its Amoy Street Food Centre stall, its signature chilli and ban mian instant packets can also be found online and conveniently prepared at home!Geylang East Food Centre 01-12, Blk 117 Aljunied Avenue 2Debuting in this year’s Singapore Hawkers’ Awards, this new category acknowledges the contributions of mentors, who have dedicated their time to support and guide aspiring hawkers through programmes such as NEA’s Hawkers Development Programme.The recipients include Tham For Moy, owner of popular Bedok nasi lemak stall Hon Ni Kitchen. As one of the first participants to join NEA’s programme in July 2022, she has imparted more than two decades of experience to many aspiring hawkers, with as many as seven eventually striking out on their own.Other recipients included two similarly experienced hawker owners, including Kang Kaiming from the underrated Geylang gem Ming Yun Famous Fried Hokkien Prawn Noodle, a stall which has been in operation for over 40 years.\xa0The other was Sze Si Wei, who heads Snow Mount at Clementi 448 Food Centre, one of the most popular char kway teow found in the west of Singapore — best known for its cockles-filled rendition.For more ideas on what to eat, read our stories on where to find authentic and hearty Vietnamese delicacies in Singapore and Haidilao’s tantalising new free-flow promo!Hoo Kee Rice Dumpling and Butternut are on the GrabFood delivery service and offer free delivery (up to S$3 off) with GrabUnlimited.\xa0They can also be found on GrabFood Dine-in.You can also book a ride to the winners of the Singapore’s Hawker Awards.AuthorEvan started off writing about food on Instagram, before joining outlets such as Buro and Confirm Good to pursue his passion.

True pizza fans would have heard of Chooby Pizza, as this snazzy joint has been making its rounds on social media for its naturally-leavened, Napolitan-style slices. The pizzeria has a slim menu of only six flavours, and with good reason.\xa0Each sourdough pizza goes through a rigorous process to ensure top-notch quality. It’s first hand stretched, then proofed for 24 hours before baking in a wood-fired oven. Throw on a multitude of fresh ingredients, and the result is an irresistible, umami-filled bread.\xa0Price range: $$Crowd faves: You can’t go wrong with the margherita (S$16 for a whole), a timeless delight slathered in San Marzano tomato sauce and sweet Fior di latte cheese.

Magic happens at 800 degrees Fahrenheit, which is how this halal-certified pizzeria got its name. Here, each pizza is carefully prepared in its open-concept kitchen, before it is sent into an 800 degrees Fahrenheit wood-fired oven.\xa0The wood fire and high temperature infuse an addictive smokiness into the crust and ingredients, the result of which is a beautiful creation that delivers a slightly-charred, crisp crust and a soft centre. Pizzas at 800 Degrees Woodfired Pizza are served in 10” and 14” sizes, which make them wonderful as sides or for sharing with friends.\xa0Price range: $$$\nCrowd faves: Laden with alfredo sauce, juicy ribeye steak and rich mozzarella cheese, the Philly cheesesteak (S$22 for a slice, S$34 for a whole) is a showstopper.

We encourage you to go big and bold with your choices.\xa0Price range: $$$Crowd faves: Each flavour offers a sensational experience of its own, but we’d go for the All’ Amatriciana (mother sauce, smoked bacon, Thai chilli flakes and red onions, S$25 for a whole) for that fiery goodness.\xa0\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Junction Westgate opening with promos; will house 23 tenants, including new halal teppanyaki\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50% off at picturesque date spots, including Wildseed Cafe at The Alkaff Mansion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCross Street Exchange, 01-108, 18 Cross Street\nOpen: Tuesday to Thursday (11.30am to 2.30pm, 5.30pm to 10pm), Friday (11.30am to 2.30pm, 5.30pm to 10.30pm), Saturday (11.30am to 10.30pm), Sunday (11.30am to 10pm)Why visit?

Located conveniently in the heart of town, Wolfrik’s Pizzeria serves gourmet pizzas made with premium Italian flour at value-for-money prices. This is much welcomed, as finding cheap, quality establishments can be a challenge, especially with rising inflation and GST hikes.

Daniele’s Pizza is a cosy spot spearheaded by Italian-born chef Daniele Colaiacomo, who has worked at various pizzerias in Rome as well as at Al Forno and Pete’s Place in Singapore. Judging by the gorgeous leopard spotting on its bread, you can see Colaiacomo knows what he’s doing, and takes pride in the art of pizza making.\xa0His hand-stretched dough is fermented for at least 48 hours, before it’s coated with Fior di latte cheese for a light and chewy texture. Pizzas here stay true to his roots, with his creations inspired by the flavours of Italy.Price range: $$Crowd faves: If you’re a solo diner on a hunt for good ol’ fashioned pizzas, we recommend the mini pizze capricciosa (S$14 for a 10” pizza).

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/the-coffee-code-singapore/:['Mentioning “The Coffee Code” will probably not ring a bell with most Singaporeans.\xa0But what if we told you it’s actually one of Malaysia’s popular trendy cafes?Unlike the viral JB cafes more commonly seen on social media, this is a brand that would be more familiar to those who’d lived in or visit East Malaysia regularly.In fact, The Coffee Code has already established itself in five major cities on the island of Borneo: Kuching, Bintulu, Miri, Sarikei, and Sibu where it’s headquarteredBuilding on its success, the brand has begun a wave of expansion out of East Malaysia, which sees The Coffee Code landing in Singapore at Neil Road.\xa0More new outlets are on the way, slated for Johor, Selangor, Brunei and Kota Kinabalu.Its first local outpost can be found along Neil Road, located in the buzzy Outram Park neighbourhood.\xa0Guests are greeted with a stylish garden-like al fresco area at the entrance. While inside, the cafe provides cosy space for laidback coffee dates, bathed in warm lights and splashed in a blend of dainty pastels and earth tones.One noticeable thing when browsing The Coffee Code’s Singapore menu is how varied the waffles’ toppings and flavour permutations can be.Besides that, the cafe also offers a rather intriguing alternative to their unique flower-shaped waffle’s usual plain base: Black rice (+S$1).Toppings wise, there are the usual sweets including Banana Crush (S$14) and Berries Love You (S$17) but the stand-out has to be the unique savoury options, such as the signature Bak Kwa (S$18).As weird as it sounds, it totally works — the sweet chicken bak kwa (dried meat), chicken floss and cornflakes meld together coherently for a gratifying sweet-savoury profile.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTalad Thai Banana opens at AMK Hub with S$2 opening promotion for the first 100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Feuds: Saizeriya vs Milan Shokudo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatisserie Cle brings its well-crafted pastries to new River Valley flagship for fifth anniversary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther than the waffles, The Coffee Code also puts up a few lighter bites on the menu, including the pulled beef quesadilla (S$14) and breadsticks (S$13), which are meant for sharing and served with both sweet cream and savoury cheese sauce as dips.If you’re hankering for a more substantial plate, then don’t hesitate to dive into the classic Big Daddy breakfast (S$24).The hearty dish will quickly fill you up with an ensemble of silky scrambled eggs, mushrooms, baked tomatoes, sausage, and turkey bacon.Yes, it uses turkey bacon and not pork. One thing to note about The Coffee Code is that, while not halal-certified, it uses no pork or lard so it’s Muslim-friendly!In our opinion though, the tea-based sweets and desserts were the real highlights at The Coffee Code. In particular, the hojicha oat latte (S$6 hot, S$7 cold) was tasty and well-balanced.The roasted tea itself was rich, fragrant and toasty while the oat milk added malty undertones to accentuate those base notes.According to the staff, the Uji matcha and Uji hojicha soft-serve ice cream are also one of the items they strongly recommend every customer to try. Both are available as a cone/cup (S$6.50), affogato (S$8) or parfait (S$12).As they had promised, our parfait’s hojicha soft-serve came with a smooth and velvety texture. Not only that, it wasn’t too saccharine and had a nice discernible toastiness — it goes well with the cornflakes and strawberries too.This was a hosted tasting.For more ideas on what to eat, read our stories on other exciting new cafes to check out and where to find the fluffiest bomboloni in Singapore.Do explore the new GrabFood Dine-in service for awesome deals.You can also book a ride to the stores mentioned in the article. 37 Neil Road\nNearest MRT station: Maxwell\nOpen: Monday to Thursday (11am to 10pm), Friday and Saturday (11am to 11pm), Sunday (10am to 10pm)37 Neil Road\nNearest MRT station: Maxwell\nOpen: Monday to Thursday (11am to 10pm), Friday and Saturday (11am to 11pm), Sunday (10am to 10pm)AuthorEvan started off writing about food on Instagram, before joining outlets such as Buro and Confirm Good to pursue his passion.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/ah-lim-chicken-rice-bedok/:['Hawker Hustlers is a HungryGoWhere series spotlighting young and emerging hawkers with compelling stories. Read through all the way for an exclusive GrabFood promo so you can try their food, too.Picture this: Your chicken rice is served in the form of cutesy onigiri (along with cheery smiles and sporting Elvis Presley-like hair), or in inventive variations such as squid ink chicken rice or rojak fried chicken rice.\n\nOne might never imagine the humble chicken rice dish could be cooked any other way. But a chat with the young hawkers at Ah Lim Chicken Rice might open your mind to the possibilities of this iconic dish.Founded by three brothers in May, Ah Lim Chicken Rice operates out of your ordinary coffeeshop in Bedok North Street 1, next to the popular So Lemak.The Lims have a deep and personal connection to the chicken rice dish.Since childhood, the boys grew up enjoying the chicken rice cooked by their mother. They also have family connections to Wee Nam Kee Chicken Rice, one of Singapore’s most famous chicken rice chains.\xa0The brothers were so passionate about sharing the family recipe that they set out to create their own version of the dish, from the composition of the spice blend in their rice to the addition of monk fruit to their soy sauce chicken.There weren’t any plans to go commercial then — they just wanted to improve their home cooking.But it was only during the Covid-19 lockdowns that they came up with the idea to start the stall, taking the time to R&D and fine-tune their plans.\n\nIn May this year, the stall was born, marking the brothers’ first business venture together. \n\nThe brothers harness their individual strengths to help elevate the business.\n\nEldest brother Kelvin Lim, 40, runs an egg wholesaling and takeaway packaging business on the side. With his wealth of contacts in the food distribution business — hawkers, restaurants, caterers and the like — he naturally handles operations and delivery. He strikes us as the strong and silent type.In contrast, the second brother, Melvin Lim, 37, is chirpy and affable. He hails from a business management background at Singapore Management University and is in charge of marketing. A passionate foodie and home cook, he loves to wax lyrical about the craft behind cooking.\xa0\xa0The youngest, Alvin Lim, 32, did stints at the family business, Wee Nam Kee, as well as Michelin-starred restaurant Labyrinth. He is a graduate from the Culinary Institute of America and plays a pivotal role in terms of menu design and quality management.“Being young and versatile, we like to create fusion food… People these days want to try what’s new and trendy,” explains Kelvin.Upon our arrival at the stall, we’re greeted by a spread of beautifully plated chicken rice dishes, complete with the sauces carefully arranged on a black stone slate — more like what you’d see in a fine dining restaurant rather than a hawker stall in the middle of the heartlands.We’re treated to the Triple Prosperity meal (S$8.80), comprising generous mounds of rice paired with all three types of chicken (steamed, soy and roasted), a ramen egg, vegetables, braised tau kwa (beancurd) and a bowl of soup.Lunch reminds us of a wine tasting and appreciation session. As we dig in, the trio walks us through each ingredient.Melvin lights up as he enthusiastically shares about their craft behind the quintessential national icon.“The soul of chicken rice lies in our aromatic fragrant rice… Delivering good rice is not by chance. It is a massive effort to understand (that) and source for good ingredients,” he explains.At first glance, the rust-coloured rice already looks different from most versions.\n\nAh Lim uses Thai hom mali rice that has aged for more than a year. As compared to new grains, aged rice is more dehydrated and can absorb more liquid. When cooked, more flavour will be locked into each grain.\n\nAccording to the brothers, its low amylose content also results in fluffy and well-seasoned grains. The rice is then delicately cooked over a slow fire in a complex and secret spice-blend recipe, consisting of a blend of more than 10 ingredients, which gives the grains a nicely caramelised rust colour.As for the chicken, it’s delicately poached in a rich chicken broth to deliver the most intense natural flavours. The stall uses whole chickens that are heavier and weigh 1.8 to 2kg, which make them more expensively priced than the usual chicken sold at the market.\xa0A homemade fragrant oil is glazed over the chicken to give it an additional texture and shine. \xa0\xa0We move on to the accompanying sauces, tasting each one at a time.\n\nThere’s the classic garlic chilli sauce, as well as a soy sauce that’s been infused with pandan and coriander — a “match made in heaven”, jokes Melvin.\n\nAdding another burst of colour to the plate is its fragrant ginger sauce. Here, the brothers use fresh old ginger paste. While some prefer young ginger, which is generally sweeter, the Lims prefer using old ginger, which delivers a spicier note with a stronger aroma. \n \nTo achieve the deep orange colour of their egg yolk, they source the eggs from chickens that have been raised on carrot feed.We’ve never experienced chicken rice in such an artisanal fashion. \n\nBut by taking a step back and savouring each component, we find ourselves developing a renewed appreciation for this simple dish.\xa0 \n\nWe’re also reminded of the likes of other innovative hawkers such as Ben Tham and Gwern Khoo of award-winning A Noodle Story. They came up with a Singapore-created dish that showcases the best of Japanese ramen and Hong Kong wonton noodles.\n\nFor the team, it’s a delicate balancing act between premium fare and affordability.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Junction Westgate opening with promos; will house 23 tenants, including new halal teppanyaki\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50% off at picturesque date spots, including Wildseed Cafe at The Alkaff Mansion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven the older demographics of the area, people tend to prefer to stick to tried-and-tested recipes and are “extremely sensitive to price”, explains Kelvin.\n\n“We do struggle to present a boutique type of chicken rice experience at a coffee shop,” adds Melvin.\n\n“Sometimes we’re a bit torn on whether to cut the quality of our ingredients and sell it at cheaper prices. But we want to slowly educate people that despite the hefty price tags, we believe you deserve nothing short of a good chicken rice experience,” he says.If you’re not feeling in the mood for something so hearty, you can opt for the stall’s individual chicken rice (S$4.20), with its bestselling steamed chicken or roasted chicken meat, which is not too shabby either.\n\nThe team also introduced chicken porridge (S$3) and noodle options such as chicken noodles (S$5).Chicken rice was invented by Hainanese chefs who immigrated to Singapore in the late 19th century. Over the years, local influences have caused chicken rice to evolve into the dish it is today.\n\nEating the poached chicken by itself can be a little plain, so the Lims were keen to experiment and take the dish further.\n\nThat was how the idea for squid ink chicken rice came about, thanks to a collaboration with their friend, a seafood distributor. By “adding the ocean into the chicken rice”, the black juice provides a briny and salty taste that is balanced by the aromatic fragrant rice, they say. \n\nThey also tried making a rojak fried chicken rice, with a tangy rojak sauce that balances out the oiliness of the chicken rice and a cream biscuit crumb for their fried chicken cutlet.\n\nBut perhaps the most appealing option to the masses would be the chicken onigiri (three pieces for S$10). Each piece is painstakingly made by hand, with Japanese pearl rice grains.And they have adorable names, too: Pearly (steamed chicken), Blaze (roasted chicken) and Toffee (soy sauce).\n\nAt present, the onigiri is only available for pre-orders on Saturdays for dine-in or takeaway. There is also a specially curated party box, which contains 12 onigiris.Even before assembling, there is plenty of prep work to be done. The corn and rice has to be cooked, and all the seaweed, cucumber slices and eggs have to be sliced by hand.\xa0You can’t assemble it immediately either — there has to be a sweet spot after the rice has slightly cooled and you can assemble the beak and hair.\xa0For our team, they have prepared a special onigiri version with torched raclette cheese and mentaiko sauce.“It’s very tedious and laborious. If we do onigiris on a weekday, my staff will kill me!” jokes Melvin.\xa0 As they plan to hire more workers, it might be possible to sell the onigiris on weekdays, too.As with most hawker businesses, challenges abound. The brothers contend with everything from high rental prices and stiff competition from other popular chicken rice stalls in the Bedok area, to rising food prices and the long hours of being a hawker.\n\nHowever, Melvin says they plan to open more stores once they’ve streamlined their processes. They hope to use this store to glean experience on how to improve their operations, shop design, menu offerings, taste of food, selection of suppliers, and more.\n\nOf late, they are observing a growing appreciation and desire to support younger hawkers. Riding on this, they hope to partner with tour agencies or the tourism board to roll out a chicken rice food tasting experience in the future.The earnestness and passion of the Lim brothers left so much of an impression that I returned with my family that very weekend to support their stall and ordered a hearty meal. On what keeps them going, it boils down to their sense of pride and ownership over the local culture.Says Kelvin: “We can always cook for ourselves at home. But we love hawker culture and we believe it needs to be reinvigorated. Through our (story), we hope that there will be more success stories of young hawkers who are willing to come out and take a risk.”Good news for our readers who scrolled all the way to the end!

With a vibrant collection of over a thousand single-estate fine harvest teas and exclusive blends, it’s a go-to for many tea aficionados.\xa0In what the brand calls “tea gastronomy”, it has brought back nostalgic brand-favourite dishes at five TWG Tea locations: Swissotel The Stamford, Takashimaya, Ion Orchard and its two stores at Marina Bay Sands.Prices for the TWG Tea promotion start from S$58 and vary across each store, which offers a different, specially-themed menu.\xa0You’ll find the fan-favourite Maine lobster and avocado timbale entree a constant across all five menus, but a different main course and dessert depending on where you’re dining at.\xa0For example, you can tuck into pan-seared Hokkaido scallops with a decadent lobster emulsion at TWG Tea’s Swissotel Stamford outpost, while its store at Ion Orchard shopping mall dishes out a New Zealand king salmon in matcha beurre blanc sauce and creamy coconut rice.This latest TWG Tea promotion will run until Oct 29.We had the pleasure of trying the exquisite anniversary set at its flagship Tea Garden store at Marina Bay Sands, which revolved around the theme of savouring the pleasures of time. Here, a two-course meal of a main, dessert and tea will cost S$75, while the three-course menu, which includes the starter, is S$105.Before our meal arrived, we were treated to a cup of Nuwara Eliya Op black tea. For those unfamiliar with this loose-leaf tea, it’s an ambrosial harvest from the hills of Ceylon.\xa0We were pleasantly surprised by the light notes of citrus that perfumed the drink. The tea was also tinged with a gentle smokiness that balanced the tea perfectly.\xa0Light and refreshing on the palate, it made for a wonderful drink to kickstart our meal. Artfully assembled with vivid shades of pink, orange and green, the first dish to arrive was the colourful Maine lobster and avocado timbale (S$32 ala carte).Accompanied by spicy mayonnaise, crunchy bread chips and onion pickles, the seafood starter boasts a harmonious melding of textures.\xa0The lobster is fresh and pairs impeccably well with the vinaigrette, which is infused with the brand’s exclusive green tea blend, Love Me tea. The end result is a delicate sauce that’s scented with sweet-smelling lime blossoms and verbena. The menu includes braised wagyu short ribs infused with warm black Shen Nong tea. The latter pays tribute to the mythical Emperor Shen Nong, who is said to have introduced tea to China.\xa0\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50% off at picturesque date spots, including Wildseed Cafe at The Alkaff Mansion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe hearty dish comes with a deluge of ingredients: Blanched asparagus, shiitake mushrooms, Vichy carrots and crispy bread croutons.

The beef is also fork-tender and melts in your mouth with every bite. No meal is complete without dessert, and our personal favourite item from the menu is the Singapore Surprise cake.\n\nWe understand that this is usually only available upon request for those in the know.It’s a pretty vanilla cream treat — reminiscent of creme brulee — that’s infused with vanilla bourbon tea, a caffeine-free South African red tea blend.\xa0Touting a thin caramelised sugar crust, the pastry is then decorated with an assortment of fresh berries and a scoop of strawberry sorbet ice cream.\xa0Boasting both sweet and tart flavours, we were blown away by how luscious the cake was. Truly, it was a fantastic ending to our heavy meal. Drinkwise, the mocktail (S$16) is a good choice to go for, if you’re not a fan of liquor. A nod to its anniversary celebration, the beverage comprises a base of a black Happy Birthday tea — also from the brand’s collection — that’s layered with creamy green apple puree.\xa0Look forward to notes of sweet red berries and vanilla, attributed by the fragrant black tea. This is definitely a drink that both the young and old will enjoy, thanks to its addictive, fruity aftertaste. For those looking to imbibe, perhaps the cocktail (S$22) will please. The drink is a modern interpretation of TWG Tea’s Timeless tea, a black tea comprising floral hibiscus notes. The beverage is also topped with sparkling white wine for extra razzle dazzle.\xa0These drinks are available at all five TWG Tea locations mentioned above.To taste the lavish TWG Tea promotion menu, we suggest coming down early, for there are limited sets served daily.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/pilot-kitchen-havelock/:['When we first came across the name Pilot Kitchen, our team had assumed that the restaurant would be aviation-themed or that its crew were made up of former pilots.Turns out it was neither, though you’ll see the aviation motif crop up occasionally on Pilot Kitchen’s marketing materials or at its premises at Havelock 2, a mixed development in the heart of town.Instead, its name refers to the restaurant’s focus on experimentation. The restaurant is essentially a testbed — much like a pilot episode for a television show — for its chefs to play with new ideas, challenge tradition and break new culinary grounds.\xa0Tucked surreptitiously away in the basement of a quiet building next to the bustling Clarke Quay, four young chefs man the fort at Pilot Kitchen — Bryan Wai, Sebastian Kok, Sean Koh, and Phang Wei Jun.\xa0When we say young, we really mean young — Phang is 20 and awaiting National Service enlistment while the other three are 25.Talking to them, however, you’ll feel like they’ve done this for years, though the restaurant will hit its first year mark only in December.\xa0Their boyish playfulness also emerges from time to time during the interview and even during their prep for dinner service — moments that they’ve endearingly termed: “Chinatown underground”.“Because we’re in Chinatown, and we’re underground,” Kok quips without missing a beat.Its obscure location gives it a somewhat #IYKYK vibe, but the guys behind Pilot Kitchen are anything but tight-lipped.\xa0On the contrary: Stepping into Pilot Kitchen feels like you’re entering their inclusive hangout, where you’re invited to sample their thoughts, ideas and personalities on a plate, candid and unfiltered.\xa0Did we mention the restaurant doesn’t even have a door?\xa0Pilot Kitchen started in partnership with Wong Jing Kai, 34, who some might recognise as the man behind Scaled by Ah Hua Kelong, a modern seafood restaurant in Jalan Besar.\xa0Wai had dined at Scaled in early 2021 and struck up a conversation with Wong, during which he expressed an interest in trialling a private-dining concept.\xa0According to Wong, hearing about Wai’s ideas back then “reminded me about why I started (Scaled) myself in the first place” and felt he was in a position where he could guide them, while learning and growing alongside them.\xa0With Wong’s experiences and resources in tow, Wai then roped Koh — a fellow gym bro — in to explore this idea.\xa0The duo held private tasting sessions in the thick of the pandemic, which helped them determine that what they had in mind then — a course-by-course menu structure — was a bit too rigid.\xa0They wanted something more casual, intimate and fun and that’s how the idea of Pilot Kitchen was born.\xa0“Kai wanted us to be able to create food that was expressively ours,” Koh says.\xa0Mutual friend Kok later joined the team as a result of a cold call on Wai’s Instagram, while Phang is cousins with Joel Phoon, 25, a former chef with the team.\xa0Throughout the whole interview, the guys are quick to quash any mentions of hierarchy in the kitchen, or who’s head chef.\xa0“We’re a small kitchen so everyone shares very similar responsibilities,” states Wai.\xa0When asked to describe the vibe in the kitchen, Kok was quick to chime in: “Fun. Behind the scenes, (it can be) a bit chaotic. A lot of stupid things happen.”Surely there would have been some hesitation about coming together to work in the kitchen with friends?“For sure,” Wai confides. “But at the end of the day we all have special relationships with each other. (Working together in the kitchen) can be heated, but because you understand the person, it’s easier to work around it.”Perhaps it’s because of their friendship and dynamic in the kitchen that the dishes on Pilot Kitchen’s menu have an eclectic combination of elements that somehow work.“We take ingredients that are familiar, put them on a plate and turn them into something that’s a little new,” Koh explains.Take for example, its homemade milk bun (S$8). At the time of our visit, we were served fluffy, wholesome milk buns with a housemade butter and whipped with Teochew porridge staples — yes, you read that right — such as cai po (preserved radish) and gan lan cai (olive vegetable).\xa0It’s since been changed up to a Japanese curry base with hints of miso — just as umami and goes great with the delicate sweetness of the buns.\xa0And then there’s hasselback and crack (S$14), potatoes sliced hasselback-style, seasoned with a Moroccan spice blend of ras el hanout and doused with a generous amount of Big Mac-inspired sauce — several words you wouldn’t have imagined in a together in a sentence, much less a dish.\xa0But for us, the star was clearly the beef short ribs (S$68), a non-typical cut to use for steak, served with Indian gunpowder spice, a side of tzatziki (Greek cucumber-yoghurt dip) and Spanish-style padron peppers — again a smorgasbord of multiple cultures in the most unexpected permutation.\xa0And it’s not just the savoury ones that get the inventive treatment — its dessert menu comprises a butter cake (S$12) made with a savoury camembert ice cream and a garnish of fried shallots. There’s almost no way of knowing what to expect from the crew’s exploration of flavours unless you make a visit yourself.Food aside, the casual demeanour of the quartet, Wong (who you’ll see at the restaurant from time to time) and its front of house staff also make for a very relaxing evening — so much so that you’d almost feel like you’re at a friend’s.\xa0Every chef doubles up as a front-of-house crew member when needed and conversations with customers are the norm rather than the exception.Kok describes it best: “We’re all very chill. The vibes here are immaculate.”And just like a good friend, the crew never shies away from bad or honest feedback.Not that there was any, judging from its just-as-immaculate five-star rating on Google, at the time of publication.\xa0So it seems like the guys have gotten their food and service down pat, but what’s next?Wai tells us that they see Pilot as a platform for young chefs to “be pilots of their own culinary journeys”, and a space for them to learn, grow and “build their own brands”.\xa0One can only hope that this exploration brings this hidden gem (and their inventive dishes) to greater heights, with plenty more #ChinatownUnderground moments peppered in between.\xa0For more insights into the minds of up-and-coming chefs, check out our interview with Lin Jiawen of Arc En Ciel Patisserie and the dynamic couple behind Nakin Thai.\xa0Do explore the new GrabFood Dine-in service for awesome deals.You can also book a ride to Pilot Kitchen at Havelock 2 for dinner.

But for us, the winner was the soy sauce chicken noodles served with slices of tender meat.\xa0For something lighter on the stomach, its dumpling noodles (S$3) are a comforting choice that’s equally delicious.Its beef brisket sells out fast, so arrive early to avoid disappointment. And steel yourself for long queues, as the meats are prepared and sliced upon order.What to order: Soy sauce chicken noodles (S$4), signature beef brisket noodles (S$5)Chinatown Complex Food Centre, 02-168, 335 Smith Street\nNearest MRT station: Chinatown\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (9am to 7pm)Chinatown Complex Food Centre isn’t short of Michelin-approved stalls and 168 CMY Satay is certainly another for the books. If CMY sounds familiar, it’s actually an acronym for Chun Man Yuan, one of Singapore’s largest satay suppliers.\xa0The stall doles out cooked-to-order satay grilled over a charcoal fire, leaving us with slightly charred meaty chunks that are tender and juicy.\xa0Its peanut sauce is served on the side with a dollop of pineapple puree. Chunky and nutty, the sauce is elevated by the sweetness and flavour of the tangy fruit. It also helps balance the heaviness of the peanut sauce.What to order: Pork satay (70 cents per piece), beef satay (70 cents per piece)\xa0Chinatown Complex Food Centre, 02-123, 335 Smith Street\nNearest MRT station: Chinatown\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (no fixed rest days; 11am to 6pm, or earlier if sold out)Hakka Fun HamCha and Yong Tou Fu opened in 2018 and is manned by a Malaysian couple, Michelle Yee and Alan Kok.Specialising in traditional Hakka delights, the ham cha (otherwise known as leicha or thunder tea rice) and yong tau foo here are family recipes passed down from Kok’s and Yee’s mothers respectively.\xa0\xa0Give their Hakka ham cha with puffed rice a go if you love added crunchy textures in your food.

It’s little wonder, then, that Chinatown Complex Food Centre, a Cantonese enclave, is the place to find this dish.\xa0Said to be the pioneer stall that created the steamed fish head in hot sauce, Seng Kee 119 Steam Fish Head is one of the stalls in the food centre that sell this. The meaty snapper fish head comes doused with Seng Kee’s special hot sauce.The fresh and tender meat is pleasantly paired with a savoury, sour and spicy blend — a fermented bean sauce that leans toward the sweeter side.What to order: Steamed fish head in hot sauce (S$18)\xa0Chinatown Complex Food Centre, 02-32, 335 Smith Street\nNearest MRT station: Chinatown\nOpen: Tuesday and Thursday (11am to 6.30pm), Saturday (10am to 5pm)Some might know of Hill Street Fried Kway Teow in Bedok, but the truth is this stall in Chinatown and that stall have no relation to each other. This Hill Street Fried Kway Teow stall may receive less media attention, though it has its following of die-hard fans.\xa0\xa0Founded in the 1970s, a husband-and-wife duo has been running the stall since. In the capable hands of Tan Chiang Boo and his wife, the stall sees queues that can stretch up to 30 minutes or more — but it’s worth the wait.Offering a wetter version of fried kway teow, rice and yellow wheat noodles are evenly coated in savoury, sweet sauce with pork lard. The fried noodles are also dished up with cockles, lup cheong (Cantonese wax sausage), lard, and chives — what some may call the definitive ingredients of a hearty plate of fried kway teow.\xa0What to order: Char kway teow (from S$3.50)\xa0Chinatown Complex Food Centre, 02-96, 335 Smith Street\nNearest MRT station: Chinatown\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (7am to 2pm)Opened by an ex-Raffles Hotel dim sum chef, Chef Leung’s Authentic Hand-Milled Rice Noodle Rolls doles out handmade chee cheong fun (rice noodle rolls) that’re hot in demand — as evidenced by the long queues during mealtimes.Diners can choose from five flavours — original (S$2.80), pork (S$3.50), char siew (S$4), prawn (S$4.50), and tuna (S$4.50).Chef Leung also sells Hong Kong-style congee as a wholesome breakfast option.

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/chong-pang-market/:['While Chong Pang is often seen as the lesser-known side of Yishun town, its hawker centre, the Chong Pang Market & Food Centre, is well-loved among residents there.\xa0Chong Pang City was the first neighbourhood centre to be established in Yishun New Town. It was named after Mr Lim Chong Pang, a prominent businessman and community figure. Now what’s interesting is that he was the son of Mr Lim Nee Soon, also very much a well-respected community leader, whom the entire Yishun is named after.\xa0Chong Pang is now a bustling heartland city centre, home to residents young and old. While Chong Pang food is synonymous with the famous nasi lemak and fried chicken wings, the hawker fare to be found at Chong Pang Market and the adjoining Chong Pang hawker is not to be forgotten.Now that we have that bit of history lesson out of the way, let’s find out what mouthwatering fares await us in Chong Pang Market & Food Centre.\xa0Here are 15 stalls that you should certainly pay a visit to if you ever find yourself at this beloved Chong Pang hawker centre.Chong Pang Market & Food Centre, 105 Yishun Ring Road, 01-161\nOpen: Sunday to Friday (9.30am to 8pm)Why visit? While there are more than enough hawkers competing for the title of best duck rice in Singapore, Chuan Kee Boneless Braised Duck brings an unfair edge to the competition: Its duck porridge is equally good, if not better!\xa0The duck rice at this Michelin Bib Gourmand stall is served with a thick gravy lathered over braised duck meat, tau kwa, sliced hard-boiled egg, peanuts and yam rice. The braised duck meat is tender and well-marinated while the yam rice leans towards the dry and salty side. We must give special mention to its herbal soup and tangy chilli as well — they truly complete the dish.\xa0The duck porridge is simple but the perfectly slight sweetness of the duck gravy is brought out by the perfectly textured congee. The same tender meat, egg and peanuts are also included, and the congee is able to coax the meat to melt in your mouth.\xa0Price range: $Crowd favourites: Any person with functioning tastebuds will face a dilemma: Should I have its duck rice set (from S$3.80) or the duck porridge (S$3.80)? We say make some space in your stomach so that you can try both!\xa0\xa0Chong Pang Market & Food Centre, 104 Yishun Ring Road, 01-177\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (6am to 4pm), Closed on MondayWhy visit? At Xiang Xiang Fishball Noodles, you can look forward to a tasteful bowl of fishball noodles with generous ingredients at a very affordable price. With a loyal following, you can expect a wait of up to 30 minutes. However, as we know, good things are worth waiting for.\xa0The stall is known for its powerful chilli sauce, large and bouncy fishballs, and a good amount of beansprouts sprinkled atop its noodles that add a nice crunch and texture.Price range: $Crowd favourites: The mixed bowl (from S$3.50) allows a taste of both its fishballs and meatballs, along with a beancurd roll and slices of fishcake paired with your selected noodle choice. You can opt for either dry or soup, but we’d go for the dry option for that extra flavour and chilli kick.\xa0Chong Pang Market & Food Centre, 105 Yishun Ring Road, 01-166\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (9.30am to 2.30pm, 5.30pm to 10pmWhy visit? With a signboard declaring its establishment all the way back in 1986, Old Chong Pang Wu Xiang certainly stands out. However, what’s even more eye-catching are the rows of neatly arranged ngoh hiangs, fishcakes, century eggs, chinese sausage, prawn crackers, beancurds, spring roll, and more — the list goes on and on. It’s hard to believe that many of its offerings are freshly handmade each day.The best part about the stall is how you get to select just what you want; these are then fried upon order. Enjoyed alongside a simple plate of bee hoon and its special savoury chilli dip, this old school dish is a special not to be missed.Price range: $Crowd favourites: A huge plate of different picks for sharing amongst a group would be the best because you get to try them all! Ingredients are priced from S$1.20.\xa0Chong Pang Market & Food Centre, 104 Yishun Ring Road, 01-128\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (7am to 3pm)Why visit? This unassuming store front hides a delectable bowl of bak chor mee. While the ingredients are rather standard for a bak chor mee, two things stand out when you order from Yeo Fa Teochew Mushroom Meat Noodles.\xa0Firstly, its braised mushrooms are tender and succulent, having absorbed the gravy to perfection after stewing for some time. Secondly, the vinegary sauce stands out, achieving the balance between savoury and sour.\xa0Its soup version of the same dish is reminiscent of a warm and homely bowl of noodles. The pork and garlic flavour of the soup broth is unmistakable, and this goes great with the mushrooms and seaweed that are served together in the same bowl.Price range: $Crowd favourite: We’d say go for the soup bak chor mee (from S$3.50) for something different from the usual. But if you do not fancy soup, the dry bak chor mee (from S$3.80) packs a punch as well.Chong Pang Market & Food Centre, 105 Yishun Ring Road, 01-146\nOpen: Tuesday to Saturday (5pm to 9.30pm)Why visit? Guan Heng Cooked Food serves up a pretty mean bowl of mushroom and minced meat noodles as well, but its is most popular for its satay bee hoon. Often referred to as the “Chong Pang Satay Bee Hoon”, this plate of lean pork, cuttlefish, tau pok, cockles, kang kong and bee hoon slathered with its thick signature satay peanut gravy is a popular choice among the heartlanders.\xa0What gels these all together is the gravy — savoury yet sweet, with crunchy bits of peanut adding to the texture of the entire dish. Not only that, it’s very generous with its ingredients, which are fresh and tasty. What a treat!Price range: $Crowd favourites: Given how satay bee hoon (from S$4) is a rather rare find these days, this is definitely a dish to try should you visit Chong Pang Market. Every mouthful is a burst of flavour. You won’t regret it!\xa0Chong Pang Market & Food Centre, 105 Yishun Ring Road, 01-176\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (3.30am to 1pm, 3.30pm to 9.30pm)Why visit? Congee and handmade noodles by day, satay by night. While Xu Zhong Xing Satay also boasts a very solid breakfast, its star dish is its satay as the stall name suggests — sold only from 3.30pm. The stall has been a stalwart at the food centre for more than 30 years, and its satay is said to be one of the best around, lending strong support to the Chong Pang good food that this area is known for.\xa0The satays are chunky, juicy and tender, grilled beautifully with the right amount of char and smokiness. The flavour from the well-marinated meat bursts through with each bite. Paired with its thick and rich peanut sauce dip, this is a great choice for dinner or supper.Price range: $Crowd favourite: A mix of the different meats can never go wrong. Take your pick between pork, chicken and mutton (S$0.80 a stick). And what’s a classic plate of satay without a ketupat (S$0.80 a piece), raw onions and cucumbers to go along as well!\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Junction Westgate opening with promos; will house 23 tenants, including new halal teppanyaki\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHawker Hustlers: Hipster hawker Ray Yeo of Bei-Ing Dimsum Club on reinventing dim sum and his love for all things Japan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xa0Chong Pang Market & Food Centre, 105 Yishun Ring Road, 01-154\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (6.30am to 8.30pm)Why visit? Besides the fish soup options as suggested by its stall name, the offerings at Nee Soon Fish Head Mee Hoon also include different variations of congee as well as a number of noodle soup options. The variety is huge, and you’ll truly be spoilt for choice here.\xa0If you are looking for hand-pulled mee hoon kway or ban mian, this is the place to be. Served with lean pork, minced pork, vegetables and a clear yet flavoursome pork and anchovy broth, it is a wholesome meal that will warm your belly and heart.\xa0Other meal options include sliced fish soup, seafood soup, tom yum seafood soup, and fried fish head bee hoon, among others. It is helpful to note that its dishes are more healthy-tasting and the broths are not too salty, which is great for diners who are more health-conscious.\xa0Price range: $Crowd favourites: On days where you are looking for a lighter and healthier meal, a warm hearty bowl of sliced fish soup (S$4.50) would be perfect. The stall is generous with its fish and the fish slices are thick and fresh.\xa0\xa0Chong Pang Market & Food Centre, 105 Yishun Ring Road, 01-125\nOpen: Monday and Wednesday to Sunday (10am to 8.30pm)Why visit? There is just something special about a piping hot bowl of soup, especially on rainy days. Now imagine a flavourful, peppery broth that has the perfect tinge of sourness to it, with your favourite pig innards, meat and preserved vegetables. Or a herbal, gingery broth that has a distinct mutton flavour, with tender mutton balls and ribs.\xa0The very simply named Pig Organ Soup & Herbal Mutton Soup serves up both types of soups, as well as other variations, and you can choose to have that with either rice or mee sua (wheat vermicelli). Its special chili rounds up everything nicely.\xa0Price range: $Crowd favourites: Both types of soups are tasty, hearty and comforting in their own right, but the herbal mutton soup (from S$7.50) seems to be the more popular choice.\xa0Chong Pang Market & Food Centre, 105 Yishun Ring Road, 01-140\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (7am to 3pm)Why visit? Kway chap is a dish with traditional Teochew origins that has made its way as a comfort food into the heart of Singaporeans. If you find yourself at Chong Pang Market and are craving a bowl of rice noodles (kway) doused with a herbal broth (chap) served with a mix of fatty pork, innards, and other sides, then this is the place to visit.\xa0The kway at Ho Heng Kway Chap is soft and smooth, topped with a fried garlic, shallots and coriander for added oomph, while the chap here is on the lighter and healthier side with lesser sodium.\xa0The fatty pork is tender, the innards are clean, and these are usually served alongside a side of tau kwa, tau pok and braised egg. Best part is, it’s fully customisable based on your preferences.Price range: $Crowd favourites: Depending on your group size, place an order for a set of mixed ingredients (S$4 per person), along with a bowl of kway (S$0.50 / S$0.80).\xa0\xa0Chong Pang Market & Food Centre, 104 Yishun Ring Road, 01-141\nOpen: Monday and Tuesday, Thursday to Sunday (6am to 2pm)Why visit? Now here’s a stall with a constant queue and as we know, in Singapore, a queue usually means good food. Offering a range of prawn noodles, pork rib noodles as well as chicken feet noodles, Tian Ji Shu Shi is very much a hot favourite among many.\xa0For an affordable price, you can get a generous amount of noodles well-seasoned with ketchup and chilli for its dry option. If you prefer the soup option, its prawn broth is not too heavy on the palate, yet still retains a good flavour from the sweetness of the prawns. Most importantly, its ingredients are fresh — you can tell by how the tail of the prawn slips out of its shell perfectly with a little tug.Price range: $Crowd favourites: The dry supreme prawn noodle (S$5) would be our pick, since it comes with more prawns that are bigger and juicier, compared to the standard prawn noodle (from S$3.50). Or you could have the best of both worlds and go for its pork ribs & prawn noodle (S$5).\xa0Chong Pang Market & Food Centre, 104 Yishun Ring Road, 01-143\nOpen: Monday and Tuesday, Thursday to Sunday (9:30am to 9:30pm)Why visit? Another stall in Chong Pang food centre that has a snaking queue, Pin Xiang is where you’d be able to find all kinds of fried delights. Think oily, wok-hei plates of goodness such as fried carrot cake, fried oyster omelette, fried kway teow (local and Penang-style), and fried mee goreng.\xa0Psst, we think this is better than another Michelin-recommended carrot cake and char kway teow stall in the same food centre. Pin Xiang’s servings are generous, and noteworthy mentions are the chai poh (preserved radish) that it uses in its fried carrot cake as well as the fresh cockles in the fried kway teow.Price range: $Crowd favourites: The white carrot cake (S$3) has rave reviews. It is crispy and eggy, fried beautifully with a touch of wok hey and topped off with a spoonful of savoury chai poh to finish it off.Hungry for more carrot cake? How about exploring the best hawker stalls for carrot cake around Singapore?\xa0Chong Pang Market & Food Centre, 105 Yishun Ring Road, 01-171\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (11am to 9pm)Why visit? If you are craving traditional Malay fare, this is the place to check out in Chong Pang Market. At Haji Ali Cooked Food, you will have the option of old-school delights such as lontong, gado gado, mee siam, nasi lemak, mee rebus, and mee soto.\xa0Besides these, it serves up a solid plate of nasi padang as well, alongside the standard dishes that cannot go wrong, such as rendang, begedil (fried potato patties), sambal goreng and more. Not only is the food here yummy, its prices are wallet-friendly, too.Price range: $Crowd favourites: Lontong (S$3) is the go-to dish of many of its customers, and for good reason. The rice cakes are made from scratch, and are soft and chewy. They taste especially delicious when soaked in sweet and fragrant vegetable curry. The bowl is then topped with a dollop of sambal chili and a heap of serunding kalapa (fried grated coconut) for a multidimensional mouthfeel.\xa0Chong Pang Market & Food Centre, 105 Yishun Ring Road, 01-168\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (6.30am to 1pm)Why visit? Bai Nian Niang Dou Fu has a few outlets around Singapore, each with its own loyal following. Here at Chong Pang Market, it is no different. The selection of ingredients in each bowl of soup is fixed, so that makes ordering simple and fuss-free.\xa0You will find a mix of handmade rolls and balls made out of fish, prawn or pork, as well as the usual yong tau fu staples such as beancurd and bitter gourd. The soup brewed out of soy beans and anchovies is sweet, clear and light, reminiscent of a good home-cooked meal. You can choose to have this with bee hoon for no extra cost.Interestingly, the stall also sells pretty good chicken wings, too, so you can choose to have them along as a set or order them separately.\xa0Price range: $Crowd favourites: A bowl of niang dou fu starts at S$5.90 but a set with chicken wings will be S$7.30. Some have commented that the niang dou fu serving is a tad small, so if you are hungry, do get the chicken wings to go along!\xa0Chong Pang Market & Food Centre, 105 Yishun Ring Road, 01-170\nOpen: Wednesday to Monday (7am to 6.30pm), Tuesday (2pm to 6.30pm)Why visit? What makes ayam penyet different from other fried chicken is how the chicken has been pressed in a pestle and mortar so that the chicken is softer. Super Penyet’s chicken has a layer of crispy skin, while the meat inside remains moist and flavourful.\xa0The fried chicken is served with a plate of coconut milk rice, slices of refreshing cucumber and the stall’s signature homemade sambal chilli that goes perfectly with the chicken. It also serves up other variations such as nasi goreng (fried rice) with its signature fried chicken, or a choice of ikan penyet (fried fish) instead.Price range: $Crowd favourites: You can’t go wrong with the classic plate of nasi ayam penyet (S$7.50). The flavours of the crispy, juicy chicken and the sambal chilli are enhanced by the simple yet tasty rice.\xa0Chong Pang Market & Food Centre, 104 Yishun Ring Road, 01-158\nOpen: Friday to Tuesday (5am to 9pm), Thursday and Wednesday (5am to 2pm)Why visit? Sometimes, it’s not just about the taste of the food but also the feels that the food can bring. This wonton noodle stall that has been around for years is exactly that — old-school, nostalgic and heartwarming.\xa0Hoe Soon Noodles serves fuss-free plates of noodles that have a nice bite to them, and these are accompanied by a good amount of char siew and wontons generously packed with filling. The noodles rest on a rich sauce that has a hint of ketchup in it. If you are up for spice, opt for the addition of chilli, which adds an additional layer of depth to the sauce.\xa0Price range: $Crowd favourites: The wonton noodles (from S$3.50) is a simple and traditional plate of noodles, but has a firm spot in the hearts of many of the stall’s regulars.\xa0\xa0On the hunt for more local food?

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/chilli-crab-singapore-commentary/:['When was the last time you ate chilli crab, anyway? Maybe it’s time to revisit the Singaporean icon after the recent Alaskan king crab controversy and take matters into our own clawsIn the same year that the original inventor of the chilli crab passed away in February 2023 (Cher Yam Tian — her sons are Roland and Richard Lim, who continue her legacy at Roland Restaurant), we have yet another controversy over the dish: Chilli crab prices.\xa0A bunch of Japanese tourists called the police in September after they were hit with a S$1,322.37 bill for their seafood meal at Paradise Seafood, which included S$938 alone for a 3.5kg Alaskan king crab.Deja vu.In 2014, a Filipino family of four paid S$1,186.20 for their seafood meal at Forum Seafood Village at Boat Quay. Back then, the Alaskan king crab cooked chilli crab-style totaled S$707 for a 3.39kg specimen.\xa0In 2011, a Scottish expat having lunch with a friend racked up S$1,107.32, including — yup, you guessed it — S$546 for a 3kg Alaskan king crab.\xa0\xa0What a bunch of, well, premium crab. The hapless tourists all said the same thing — that they didn’t know about the different kinds of crabs, didn’t realise the eventual price tag of the whole crab, and that they had only wanted to sample the chilli crab that’s lauded as the national dish of Singapore.\xa0The resulting sticker shock would surely leave a bad taste in anyone’s mouth.Chilli crab is one of Singapore’s national dishes, one that most first-time visitors would seek out. But chilli crab in Singapore is not an everyday dish the same way chicken rice, laksa and satay can be enjoyed regularly. One of the reasons is that we pay a high price for seafood in Singapore, and especially for crustaceans.\xa0These are all imported, and include delicate flower crab from Southeast Asia, briny snow crab from the north oceans, giant spiky Alaskan king crabs, Dungeness crab from North America, and of course the densely packed mud crab from Sri Lanka (although cheaper, more watery ones from Indonesia abound).\xa0The warm water Sri Lankan mud crabs are our preferred crab, its earthy and meaty yet sweet-tasting flesh well-suited to the spice aromatics of Asia.Today, you can expect to pay an average of $10/100g for dine-in crab at reputable seafood restaurants, and yes, you have to order the whole crab, not portions of it. That’s about $100 for a modest 1kg Sri Lankan crab — even before service and GST charges.\xa0And naturally you wonder if these weights are a little inflated — whether the crabs are kept in water or rounded up to the nearest kilogram. After all, used to buying and cooking mud crabs from the wet market over the years, I’ve definitely noticed that my restaurant crabs can be up to 20% smaller than the purported weight I’m paying.\xa0I also question — when was the last time you actually ate chilli crab? A quick poll of 10 friends revealed that only one had tucked into the dish in the last three years.\xa0Even when you do have a craving and want to eat it — where do you go? Every restaurant selling chilli crab in Singapore has its own recipe and style. While doing anonymous reviews at a magazine some years back, I sampled all the famous ones, and found that no two tasted alike.\xa0Some gravies were eggier while others had no egg at all; some were tomatoey with hardly a hint of chilli, while one verged on tear-inducing. Some used orange juice or vinegar for the piquancy. Meanwhile lemongrass made inconsistent appearances and one or two were so sweet you would think it could have been served as a dessert.Why, we writers pondered, wasn’t black pepper or XO beehoon crab crowned the national dish? What is it about the chilli crab sauce that provokes such loyalty?The answer I believe lies in a sauce that influential Australian food blogger Nagi Maehashi (recipetineats.com) dubs as “the mother of all flavour bombs”.\xa0Indeed, just looking at her well-tweaked recipe makes my mouth water: Ginger, garlic, red onion, tau cheo (soy bean paste), sambal belachan, fresh chilli, ketchup, tomato puree, egg, and vinegar. It hits every primordial taste bud (sweet, salty, sour, spicy, umami) and then some. That’s why other crab preparations have not reached this level of well-rounded satisfaction.\xa0I say, it’s about time we reclaimed the chilli crab in Singapore as our own, not just the province of restaurants.\xa0The ingredients are pretty much pantry staples within reach in most home kitchens. If we are to save the reputation of the dish, as well as our own love for the national icon, we should make it a full-on patriotic challenge to cook it at home at least once a year.\xa0Let’s learn everything about crab, all of it. Bring on the tutorials, the careful forays to the wet market, the woks, the mantous (store bought is fine) and the bibs.\xa0In fact, let’s declare a National Chilli Crab Day, and welcome our tourist friends to tuck in — Alaskan crab definitely optional. \xa0 For more ideas on what to eat, read about this hidden gem restaurant run by four young chefs and where to find fluffy bomboloni in Singapore.Do explore the new GrabFood Dine-in service for awesome deals or book a ride to enjoy chilli crab in Singapore.

Finally, a sweet chilli paste, typically sambal, is served on the side, and can take the dish to another level.The ideal texture and flavour of this Teochew delight is very much up to one’s preferences.

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/carrot-cake-singapore/:['It’s tricky to describe to foreigners what carrot cake in Singapore tastes like. After all, there are no carrots and it’s certainly not a cake. Confusing monikers aside, carrot cake — or chai tow kway — is one of our most loved local dishes. It’s a stir-fried dish that looks simple but often involves hours of preparation of the radish cake base beforehand.Carrot cake in Singapore comes in white and black versions and some stalls offer a mix of both on one plate. White carrot cake is ideal for anyone who loves eggs and a crispy mouthfeel, while black carrot cake is for those who prefer a more flavourful sweet-savoury dish, as it’s fried with soy sauce.\xa0A dash of chilli and a sprinkling of chopped spring onions complete this tasty dish. Best of all, it doesn’t matter where you live in Singapore, as there’s always someone cooking up a good one at a hawker centre nearby.Here are 15 places for delicious carrot cake in Singapore.Kampung Admiralty Hawker Centre, 02-18, 676 Woodlands Drive 71\nOpen: Friday to Wednesday (6am to 2pm, 4.30pm to 8pm)Bukit Panjang Hawker Centre and Market, 01-23, Bukit Panjang Ring Road\nOpen: Friday to Wednesday (4.30am to 4pm)Why visit?

Thankfully, the fried carrot cake the duo serves up is just as delectable.\xa0Price range: $Crowd favourites: The black carrot cake and white carrot cake are available in three portion sizes (from S$3). The white is crispy on the outside and not overly greasy, while the black version is a good mix of sweet and salty, thanks to the crunchy chye poh (preserved radish). You won’t go wrong with either of these options. If you really can’t decide, get the mixed carrot cake (from S$4) for the best of both worlds.Ang Mo Kio Central Market and Food Centre, 01-09, 724 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 6\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (8am to 4pm)Bedok Food Centre and Market, 01-49, 216 Bedok North Street 1\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (4.30am to 1pm)Why visit?

After all, it steams its own carrot cake instead of getting it factory-made. Bonus: Its white carrot cake is served with plump prawns (from S$4).\xa0Price range: $Crowd favourites: Pop by here for supper the next time and try the black carrot cake (from S$4). While it’s served without prawns, the dish has a nice, smoky caramelised flavour.301 Ubi Avenue 1, 01-305\nOpen: Monday to Thursday and Saturday (8am to 8.30pm), Friday (9.30am to 9pm), Sunday (11am to 8.30pm)Why visit?

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/tiong-bahru-market/:['We can’t deny that hawker centres are local icons. They are a unique aspect of Singapore culture, housing a myriad of beloved local foods under one roof. Tiong Bahru Market and Food Centre, in particular, is incredibly popular among locals and tourists alike, thanks to its easily accessible location — Tiong Bahru MRT station is a short walk away — and large variety of stalls.\xa0Situated at 30 Seng Poh Road, the historic building was previously known as Seng Poh Road Market in 1951, and was built to house the large number of street hawkers who had served the community at Tiong Bahru.Today, it houses a market on the ground floor and a hawker centre above it. It’s not uncommon to see long queues at many of the stalls here. And Tiong Bahru Market’s Michelin recognition — many of its stalls have received a Michelin recommendation\xa0 — has given it a boost in recent years, cementing its status as a food haven.Here’s a rundown of 15 hawker stalls at Tiong Bahru hawker centre that will keep you going back for more.30 Seng Poh Road, 02-31\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (8am to 2.30pm)Why visit? Why have regular prawn noodles when you can have them with pork ribs too? Each bowl from Min Nan Pork Ribs Prawn Noodle comes with fresh-tasting prawns, tender pork ribs and fragrant noodles. Fans of spicy food will love this especially, as the stall’s chilli sauce has a nice kick. You can also add extra ingredients, such as prawns, ribs, meatballs, fish cake, vegetables and noodles, if you prefer a heavier meal.Price range: $Crowd favourites: The soup version comes with an aromatic and rich broth, but the dry version (S$5 or S$6), which comes with two prawns and two ribs, is the hot choice here, for the piquant chilli sauce is best enjoyed when mixed with its dry noodles.30 Seng Poh Road, 02-18/19\nOpen: Monday to Saturday (5am to 7pm), Sunday (5am to 3pm)Why visit? Tiong Bahru Pau has been serving up fluffy, handmade bao (steamed filled buns) since the 1960s so you know you’re getting good quality food here. It’s also known as one of Tiong Bahru’s best food finds.\xa0You can get a variety of steamed buns and dim sum options. The char siew pau (S$1.20) is filled with juicy pork that is just the right touch of sweet and savoury, and the siew mai is generous in size. It’s the perfect stall to pick up a snack at the start of the day as it has one of the earliest Tiong Bahru Market opening hours, or if you’re still feeling peckish after a meal at the hawker centre.Price range: $Crowd favourites: No surprise here, it’s the handmade buns. Apart from the char siew pau, other varieties include dou sha pau (red bean paste bun), lian rong pau (lotus paste bun) and da rou pau (big pork and chicken bun).30 Seng Poh Road, 02-01\nOpen: Tuesday to Friday (10.30am to 2.30pm; 4.30pm to 6pm), Saturday (10.30am to 6pm)Why visit? Expect long queues, not just because this stall has received the Michelin Bib Gourmand for several consecutive years, but because the food is genuinely delicious.\xa0A big reason why the hokkien mee tastes so good is because it’s cooked to order in small batches. The third-generation owner of Hong Heng Fried Sotong Prawn Mee has kept this traditional cooking method of preparing each plate separately in his wok, which means you’ll get a piping-hot fresh plate of noodles every time.Price range: $Crowd favourite: There’s only one dish served here, the Hokkien mee (from S$4), but that’s all it needs. The stock is full of flavour and the noodles are fried with just the right amount of char (or wok hey, as we call it). There’s a decent amount of prawns and squid, too. Accompanied by its homemade sambal, it makes for a satisfying and tasty meal.30 Seng Poh Road, 02-67/68\nOpen: Friday to Wednesday (8.30am to 2.45pm)Why visit? Often named as one of the best curry rice stalls in Singapore, this stall started operating in 1946 at another location in Tiong Bahru. The fact that it still has snaking queues is a testament to its popularity.\xa0You won’t be waiting long though, as the queue moves quickly, but you might want to pop by early as it does tend to sell out its popular dishes quickly. Pick from a variety of items, such as curry chicken, braised pork or sotong, to add to your rice — the heap of ingredients are then drenched in its thick, days-old (yay, extra flavour!) curry.Price range: $Crowd favourites: The pork chop and sambal sotong are some of its most popular dishes. Or go for a pork cutlet, curry chicken and cabbage ensemble with rice, which will set you back just S$5.80.30 Seng Poh Road, 02-20\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (7am to 3pm)Why visit? More than five decades of experience means customers are getting food that has been tried and tested for many years — and much loved, too. 7 Original Tiong Bahru Fishball’s secret to such delicious fishballs is the fresh wolf herring fish it uses, more commonly locally as ikan parang or sai tor her.\xa0Also, no flour is added during the cooking process. Fishballs here are “QQ”, which means they come with a nice bounce. Choose from a few types of fishballs or fishcakes, plus items such as otah or ngoh hiang (fried meat rolls).Price range: $Crowd favourites: The fried fishballs (S$1 for four pieces), of course. Other popular items include fried bean curd roll with fish paste (S$1.50 per piece) and four-colour roll (stuffed with crab stick, S$3 per piece).30 Seng Poh Road, 02-29\nOpen: Tuesday to Saturday (9.30am to 2.30pm; 5pm to 7.30pm), Sunday (9.30am to 2.30pm)Why visit? This Tiong Bahru hawker has come a long way since it began in 1955, with accolades such as the Michelin Bib Gourmand in 2019, 2020, 2022 and 2023. Pigs’ organ soup might not be for everyone, but if you love it, you’ll know a good one when you taste it. Needles to say, this is one of them.\xa0Koh Brother Pig’s Organ Soup’s specialty is Teochew-style clear soup, with freshly-made broth each day that’s simmered for hours. The salted mustard vegetables provide an intense flavour and there is none of that foul smell, as the innards are meticulously cleaned before cooking. Go early as the stall often sells out before closing time.Price range: $Crowd favourites: The hearty pig’s organ soup, comprising a hearty assortment of such as liver, tripe, intestines, meatballs, and lean meat in a lightly-seasoned clear broth (from S$4.80), is the one to try. But do consider getting the glutinous rice with intestine (S$3.50), too, if it’s available.30 Seng Poh Road, 02-58\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (9am to 5pm)Why visit? Nasi lemak is a popular dish in Singapore but The CoCo Rice serves this local favourite with a twist. Opened in 2021, it offers a range of authentic blue pea nasi lemak kukus sets, served in an Instagram-worthy presentation.\xa0The blue pea rice is fragrant, the anchovies are crispy and the fried chicken whole leg with herbs and spices is bursting with flavour. It’s not your usual hawker centre nasi lemak, especially in terms of price, but this halal-certified stall is certainly worth a try.Price range: $Crowd favourites: Don’t leave without sampling the signature fried chicken whole leg with spices (S$7.90), which is served with a large chicken leg that’s crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. Seafood lovers can go for the sambal prawn with sambal petai (S$9.90).30 Seng Poh Road, 02-60\nOpen: Friday to Wednesday (9am to 8pm)Why visit? Whether you love pork, chicken, char siew or duck, you’ll get to savour them all at Tiong Bahru Lee Hong Kee Cantonese Roasted, as long as you like your meat roasted. Meats are juicy and charred well — it’s no wonder there’s always a long queue during meal times.The meat is served with rice or noodles and the stall will drench your dish with its signature sauce to complete the meal. You can mix your meats, too, or order additional items such as tofu or braised eggs.Price range: $Crowd favourites: For a good sampling of everything, get the three-kind combo (S$8) of char siew, roast pork and roast duck. You can also just have one type of meat at S$5 a plate. The char siew is especially well-loved — succulent and fatty, it offers a satisfying bite with white rice.30 Seng Poh Road, 02-66\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (11.30am to 8pm)Why visit? Gourmet burgers at a hawker centre? Why not! Founder Fabian Tan got his culinary training from At-Sunrice and opened this stall in 2020.\xa0Skirt & Dirt specialises in cheese skirt burgers, using top quality beef cuts and an in-house burger sauce. As its name suggests, a crunchy cheese skirt extends out dramatically from the bottom of its beef patty. Other offerings include cheesy chicken katsu burger (S$7 with fries), and western mains such as BBQ chicken with a choice of two sides (S$7.80).Price range: $Crowd favourites: The cheese skirt burger (S$9 with fries), of course. The crispy cheddar crust is a sight to behold — and also very tasty, with a sharp and savoury finish. The fish crisp with tropical salsa burger (S$7 with fries) is also interesting, with a sweet and savoury finish.30 Seng Poh Road, 02-1530\nOpen: Thursday to Tuesday (11am to 9pm)Why visit? What better way to end your meal at Tiong Bahru food centre than with a refreshing local dessert?\xa0Ice kachang or ice jelly are perfect choices for sweltering days, while warm treats such as red bean soup, green bean soup, split mung bean (tau suan) and ginko nut barley will help to digest your meal. Tian Tian Yuan Dessert House serves up delicious renditions of these delights, and more.Price range: $Crowd favourites: The cheng tng (S$3) is its signature, and comes with a variety of ingredients, such as red bean, green bean, chestnut, barley, sago, dry longan, persimmons and winter melon. Also try the random jelly bowl (S$3), which comprises a colourful assortment of pearls, jellies, sago and more.30 Seng Poh Road, 02-55\nOpen: Wednesday to Sunday (7am to 1pm)Why visit? The secret to good tau suan (split mung bean dessert) is having the right consistency. Tiong Bahru Tau Suan does it right, as its tau suan is neither diluted nor too starchy, with beans that aren’t too mushy.\xa0Its dough fritters are super crispy, a perfect accompaniment to the bean mixture. Only three desserts are served here — tau suan, pulut hitam (black glutinous rice pudding) and bubur terigu (white wheat sweet porridge) — so you know each bowl is of the highest quality. The desserts sell out fast, so go early to avoid disappointment.Price range: $Crowd favourite: Needless to say, its tau suan (S$2) is a must-try. It’s not too sweet and sticky — every bite hits the spot.30 Seng Poh Road, 02-82\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (10am to 4pm)Why visit? No hawker centre in Singapore is complete without a good chicken rice stall. And this Michelin bib gourmand-recipient, which has been in operation for more than 30 years, is certainly an excellent one.\xa0This isn’t its only impressive accolade though – Tiong Bahru Hainanese Boneless Chicken Rice is also a favourite of Hong Kong actor Chow Yuen Fatt. Run by two brothers, the stall opened in 1988 at this food centre and has since expanded to several outlets islandwide. The fluffy rice is bursting with flavour — it pairs excellently with either steamed or roasted chicken, which are fragrant with a dash of sesame oil.Price range: $Crowd favourite: The steamed chicken rice (S$3.50 for normal, S$4.50 for chicken drumstick) is the more popular option, with tender juicy meat under a silky, gelatinous skin — but if you want to try something different, order the chicken wing rice. There’s also an array of side dishes, such as soy sauce vegetables and bean sprouts.30 Seng Poh Road, 02-54\nOpen: Monday to Thursday (11am to 3pm; 5pm to 8.30pm), Friday (11am to 3pm)Why visit? There’s something about Western food at hawker centres that we can’t get enough of. Tiong Bahru Hot Plate Western Food is particularly well-loved, thanks to its affordable prices, large portions and the wide variety of options.With a uniquely Singapore mix of sides, such as baked beans, fries and coleslaw, served with meat, it’s comforting old-school food at its best.Its meats are grilled or deep-fried and the crinkle-cut chips they come with are crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. As the stall’s name suggests, most dishes here are presented on sizzling hot plates, so you know they’re served warm.Price range: $Crowd favourites: The grilled chicken chop (S$6), served on a hot plate, is popular, thanks to its juicy meat and slightly charred exterior. For a bit of everything, the mixed grill (S$10) is a hearty option with beef steak, grilled chicken, a sausage and egg with the usual sides.30 Seng Poh Road, 02-05\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (5.30am to 8.30pm)Why visit? Yet another stall at Tiong Bahru Market that has been awarded the Michelin Bib Gourmand — in the years 2021, 2022 and 2023 — this brand was established in 1958 and is now helmed by the third generation. You might say Jian Bo Shui Kueh is thriving, with more than 20 outlets all around Singapore.\xa0The secret to its awesome-tasting shui kueh (also known as chwee kueh, a Teochew steamed rice cake) is its crunchy chai poh (radish) topping and signature dried prawn chilli that’s freshly prepared in the morning. Both are rich in flavour and a whiff of their aroma as you walk by the stall is enough to get you to join the queue.Price range: $Crowd favourites: Best had for breakfast or as a snack, the only decision you have to make here is how many pieces of shui kueh (five pieces for S$3) you want to order. If you want variety, the stall also has other snacks such as chee cheong fun and steamed yam cake (both from S$3).30 Seng Poh Road, 02-48\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (11am to 7pm)Why visit? It might call itself a “soup republic” but that isn’t the only thing on the menu at Hing Hing Soup Republic. There are some hearty soups to be enjoyed at this Tiong Bahru Market food stall, such as ABC soup (S$4.50), lotus root with peanut and pork rib soup (S$4.50) and black chicken soup with ginseng (S$6.50).\xa0But you can also order rice dishes such as steamed Chinese sausage rice (S$4.50), steamed minced meat rice with salted egg (S$4.50), or claypot rice with chicken (S$6.50), if you’re hoping for a more filling meal.Price range: $Crowd favourites: Its signature dish is a mini Buddha jump over the wall (from S$9). Otherwise, the steamed minced meat rice with salted egg (S$4.50) and any of its comforting soups are popular choices.Still hungry?

It comes with the usual trifecta of minced pork, pork slices and pork liver, but the secret ingredient is the braised sliced mushrooms, which add a burst of umami to the dish.\xa0\xa0Hong Lee Coffeeshop, 7 Eunos Crescent\nOpen: Daily (6.30am to 7.30pm)Why visit? With a name like that, you can expect long queues outside the Famous Eunos Bak Chor Mee stall, but it’s well worth the wait. Currently in its fifth generation, this family-run business harks back to the 1920s when the founder would peddle his bowls of noodles on the streets of Chai Chee, carrying his makeshift kitchen on a bamboo pole.\xa0Price range: $Crowd favourites: As a bak chor mee purist, owner Ler Jie Wei believes that bak chor mee (S$4.50) should only come with noodles, pork dumplings, minced pork, and a pork and garlic broth. To that end, the soup here is rich and flavourful, and is further enhanced by the addition of fried garlic and pork lard. Paired with its QQ mee kia noodles, you can’t help but slurp every last bit up!\xa0\xa0Block 85 Bedok North Road, 01-07\nOpen: Daily except Thursday (11am to 11pm)Why visit?

For an extra fiery kick, top your bak chor mee with chopped red chilli.\xa085 Bedok North Street 4, 01-08\nOpen: Thursday to Tuesday (3.30pm to 12am)Why visit? Located right next door to Xing Ji, this stall serves both the dry and soup version of bak chor mee. When it first opened, Seng Hiang Bak Chor Mee sold you tiao (fried dough sticks) in the mornings and char kway teow in the evenings, but decided to pivot to selling bak chor mee instead as it was too much work to prepare the greasy noodle dish within the confines of a small stall.\xa0Price range: $Crowd favourites: If you prefer your soup to be robust and full of flavour, you’ll love the bak chor mee (from S$3.50) at Seng Hiang.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/tambi/:['From the whisperings of the culinary world, Tambi emerges — a bold nexus of Korean and Indian flavours.\xa0The narrative is undeniably alluring: Two Michelin-starred chefs, Sun Kim from Meta and Mano Thevar from Thevar, join forces to craft a menu that dares to harmonise two of the world’s most vibrant cuisines.Sun Kim of Meta: A temple of refined Korean flavours, Meta offers a palette that’s sophisticated and subtle. The meticulous layering — be it the nuanced textures in the tuna with dashi jelly and avocado or the cold and refreshing spice kick in the milmyeon — is testament to Kim’s commitment to honour tradition while pushing boundaries.\xa0There’s a control and precision to Meta’s offerings that echo the disciplined heart of Korean culinary artistry.Mano Thevar of Thevar: Journeying south, Thevar is a party painted with bold flavours. Mano doesn’t merely cook; he crafts experiences with colour. The beetroot and apple pani puri, with its glittery mauve shell, announces itself despite its minimalist presentation.\xa0Meanwhile, the Amadai with crab rasam melds two proteins without calling undue attention to the scales — brittle and not stiff — thanks to the flawless execution of the Matsukasa-Yaki technique. Indian flavours come alive with a modern gaze.The chefs’ distinct aesthetics also extend beyond the plate. While Meta brings forth the serenity of the Great Joseon era to the present with curves of cream and lilac, Thevar contrasts with its mercurial swirls of liquid gold and obsidian slates.Given the distinct styles each chef brings to the table, I was eager to see how Tambi, aptly named “Little Brother” in Tamil, would evolve — considering it’s the brainchild of two culinary icons whose original restaurants were once neighbours with each other on the same street.Navigating the world of Korean-Indian fusion, Tambi strikes moments of culinary brilliance juxtaposed with missed potential. The distinctive styles of both chefs shine in dishes such as the pajeon, a testament to the harmonious possibilities of Korean-Indian collaboration.Nonetheless, a deeper dive into the menu reveals that not all dishes fully embrace this fusion spirit, with some leaning heavily into either Korean or Indian influences and others, such as the banana tart, veering off-theme entirely.While it’s understandable that familiar flavours from both cuisines, such as the gochujang, curry powder and kimchi, play a role in bridging the fusion gap, there’s room for Tambi to further innovate and transcend these default choices.The dining experience had its beverage bumps — namely, the mandatory drink policy and the unavailability of the only interesting non-alcoholic drink, the 6 + 8 Jukes (S$14).\xa0That said, it’s worth noting the guava-sparkling water replacement drink stood out with its refreshing floral sweetness, even if the negroni (S$18) felt underwhelming as it was more of an ice cube with cocktail than a cocktail with ice.\xa0The prawn tosai pajeon (S$28) is testament to the beauty of fusion when done right. Traditionally, a jeon is a simple Korean pancake primarily made from wheat flour.\xa0At Tambi, the chefs innovatively used a tosai (or dosa) batter made from fermented rice and lentils. This helps circumvent the gluten’s softening effect from wheat, giving the jeon a delightful crispness from circumference to centre.In another unique twist, the tosai batter’s thickness ensures the jeon maintains a slightly chewy core, allowing diners to savour the lingering, earthy notes of lentils and veggies.\xa0While Anju (a contemporary Korean restaurant at Tras Street) offers an excellent crispy jeon (S$26) through its use of a kakiage-like technique, it compromises on this chewy middle.\xa0Tambi’s approach, by contrast, preserves the essence of a jeon while still achieving the sought-after crispness.Not all was good, though. The prawns in Tambi’s jeon were mushy, with a few leaving an unpleasant taste. The accompanying sothi, typically paired with tosai, felt heavy when combined with the pancake-like jeon. Perhaps a traditional soy-based dip would work better.For traditional jeon aficionados in Singapore: Popular chain Ajumma’s offers a crisp jeon (S$16) as well, though it loses its texture quite rapidly. It’s worth sampling for a contrast before diving into Tambi’s rendition.Moving on, we turned to Tambi’s pork belly nasi goreng (S$20). This dish was a work of precision. The curried crust enveloping the pork belly sang of finesse, releasing a satisfying plume of smoke when sliced. Also, the expertly rendered fat ensured the meat was flavourful without veering into overwhelmingly rich territory.Nonetheless, the rice stirred some debate. While my companion yearned for the drier texture synonymous with nasi goreng, I was enamoured by Tambi’s rendition — rice moistened with a sauce that provided depth.\xa0In my view, this dish struck a delicate balance. It mirrored the subtleties of a kimchi fried rice, but with a more refined touch that’s free of the usual greasiness.The accompaniment, a sunny side up, was no afterthought. The absence of crisp edges on the perfectly cooked egg was evidence of the team’s meticulous approach to even the simple things.\xa0The busy egg warmer in the middle of the open kitchen also underscored Tambi’s commitment to the minutiae that often elevate a dining experience.Riding the wave of curious flavours, I opted for the biryani (S$10) next, only to be met with an eyebrow-raising reaction from the staff.“You do realise it’s essentially rice?” he queried.To which I said: “But it’s stuffed with fruit and nuts, isn’t it?”My palate, having relished Thevar’s tamarind black chickpea rice, held certain expectations. True, Tambi’s rendition was drier and not as intricate as Thevar’s version boasting pistachios and romanesco — but it certainly held its own. Unlike other biryanis, no curry was needed here. The moment the lid was lifted, the sweet aroma of hay bales and spices was simply a delight on its own.For dessert, I was perplexed that the banana tart (S$18) was the only option in a Korean-Indian restaurant. I couldn’t fault it though, as the fragrance of the warm pie crust melded beautifully with the creamed coldness of the banana chantilly.\xa0But considering its premium price and petite size, I couldn’t help but yearn for more substantial dessert offerings that fit the fusion theme I came for.\xa0Tambi’s prawn Maggie goreng ($26) was… exactly what it claimed to be. No surprises there, besides the lack of it. Thankfully, the choice to use homemade noodles over those hydrogenated palm oil-infested instant ones spared my stomach some distress — a silver lining for anyone reminiscing about college late-night snacks.But here’s the rub: The noodle’s texture? Think instant. Mushed, clumped, the kind of stick-together that screams “processed”. A salt and curry powder overload rendered it unpalatable. Even a valiant effort with a whole lime couldn’t rescue the dish.\xa0Interestingly, a Tambi staff member proclaimed it as his favourite dish when asked. His reasoning?\xa0“I’m a simple guy.”Well, to each their own.\xa0Intrigued by the promise of fusion, I sampled Tambi’s bibimmyeon (S$22, cold spicy thin noodles), keen to detect any nuances reminiscent of Kim’s famed milmyeon (cold wheat noodles with spiced broth) at Meta. While Tambi’s rendition was commendable, it fell short.For me, the epitome of a cold Korean noodle strikes a harmonious chord between spicy, savoury, tangy, sweet, and fresh. It’s a standard unerringly embodied by Meta.Tambi’s noodles, however, lacked that icy chill to complement the heat. While they leaned heavily on the spicy and acidic notes, some natural sweetness would have brought much-needed balance.Considering the price and the portion, I was looking for a richer tapestry of flavours. A touch of cold broth, perhaps from a traditional stock or dongchimi water, combined with a fruit element, could have elevated this dish — and allowed it to retain its character without transforming it into a milmyeon.However, it’s worth noting that Meta is a fine dining Michelin star restaurant, and so it might be remiss to expect the same standards from Tambi, which is positioned as a more casual eatery.On the brighter side, the inclusion of roe added a delightful textural contrast to the dish.The corn ribs (S$18), laced with gunpowder spice and paired with a feta dip, tantalised our taste buds. Still, the essence of indulging in corn on the cob is to relish that succulent burst with each bite, a sensation I found missing in Tambi’s rendition as there wasn’t enough moisture.\xa0A dollop of butter would have improved the mouthfeel tremendously. Consequently, we resorted to slicing the kernels from the ribs to enjoy the dish.***Overall, our dining experience at Tambi vacillated between pleasure and perplexity. While the promise was a seamless blend of Korean and Indian cuisines, there were moments when the essence got lost in translation.\xa0The availability of two pork-infused rice dishes — one predominantly Korean and the other unmistakably Indian — was emblematic of this divide. Instead of a harmonious blend, it felt like a choice between two worlds.Also, the absence of any fusion Korean-Indian desserts made the experience unfinished. I’m thinking of a saffron and rose water sulbbang (Makgeolli bread) or a plated Korean-inspired kesari-based entremet dessert. Ending on a banana tart just felt trivial.Nonetheless, Tambi’s current offerings do contain sparks of culinary genius. With two gifted chefs at its helm, I remain optimistic about its evolution.\xa0The melding of Korean and Indian flavours has immense potential — while the choreography is still in progress, I await the day they reveal their masterpiece. For now, the dance continues.Is it conducive to conversation? Absolutely. Thanks to the open kitchen, we could also chat directly with the chefs, which made for an interactive dining experience.Is a reservation necessary? Yes.How to get there? Alight at either Telok Ayer or Tanjong Pagar MRT stations if you’re taking the train.HungryGoWhere paid for its meal at this restaurant for this review. Still hungry?

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/cedric-grolet-singapore/:["London, Paris and Singapore now have more in common. These are the only cities worldwide where one — with some luck and determination — can indulge in the creations of Cedric Grolet. Crowned World’s Best Pastry Chef in 2018, the 38-year-old Frenchman Cedric Grolet has since launched four eponymous patisserie — with Singapore being his latest and only Asian outpost — while multiplying his Instagram following tenfolds to more than eight million.Time and money are usually two ends of a spectrum: What you save with money, you often pay with time. Yet, with queues forming at 6am and bakes starting at S$8, Cedric Grolet is asking for both. So what gives? Quality? Experience? Or perhaps, pure disappointment?Since launch, Cedric Grolet Singapore has drawn queues upwards of two hours as “pilgrims” in the likes of restaurateurs, socialites, and professional and amateur bakers from across the region descended on the 40-seater to meet the chef himself and to experience the photogenic trompe-l’oeil (illusion) treats that Grolet is known for in the interwebs.\xa0The patisserie sits on the ground floor of the recently opened Como Orchard, some 150m away from the hustle of Orchard Road.\xa0Before laying your hands on the sweet treats, expect to brave one of three queues — online dine-in reservations that are usually booked out weeks ahead; online click-and-collect, which avails you to the life-like fruit and flower pastries, but excludes viennoiseries such as the croissant; or the snaking walk-in queue without guarantee as to what you might walk away with.While long queues are common to all of Grolet’s outlets, some pastries are Singapore-exclusive, such as the lychee and dragonfruit (a nod to the tropical climate).Stepping in, you will be greeted by a short flight of black spiraling steps that eventually opens into the glowy, white dining space overlooking the kitchen and counter display. Adorned with flower motifs on the walls and ceiling lamp shades reminiscent of flower petals, the cosy interior serves as a warm welcome to Cedric Grolet Singapore.\xa0The monochromatic theme, alongside soft music, bright lighting and low-set seating, calms the senses for a slow, carefree dining experience. Attention to detail extends to the engraved cutlery, gold foil-imprinted napkin and even mini madeleines for those in line.\xa0All that sets the stage for good things to come — and rest assured the team definitely delivered.As part of the Sweet breakfast set (S$60), we were treated to a croissant (S$8 ala carte), a waffle flower (S$26 ala carte) and two beverages (one hot and one cold).Baked to golden perfection, the croissant did not disappoint visually and on the tongue. With a flaky exterior and chewy body, a cross-section of the croissant reveals the immaculate execution of dough lamination within.\xa0Have it on its own to savour the buttery aroma or dip it in cappuccino to let the soft doughy body shine. Meanwhile, cocoa-lovers can opt for the pain au chocolat (S$12 dine-in, S$10 takeout) featuring dark chocolate folded between the eye-watering layers of dough with the same glossy top.What sets the viennoiserie apart is in its gentle flakiness (not piercing crunchiness), its fluffy, chewy body (not empty airiness), buttery taste profile (not flavourless) and how it is not oily to the touch, suggesting a well-proofed dough. These bakes retain their crispness even as they cool to room temperature.As we swept the remaining crumbs off the plate, the waffle flower was promptly served alongside a generous dollop of vanilla chantilly. We were ready to be disappointed; instead we were pleasantly surprised.The crunchy exterior of the waffle coupled with the warm doughy filling contrasted well with the light chantilly cream. Specks of vanilla could be seen in both the waffle and the cream, yet the flavour was not overpowering. It didn’t taste artificial nor was it sweet, it was just a pleasant inviting aroma that draws you in with each bite.With the Mid-Autumn Festival fast approaching, the mooncake (S$28 dine-in, S$26 takeout) was introduced as a seasonal special.\xa0It is, of course, a trompe-l’oeil, so in place of lotus paste and baked skin, Grolet adopted a base of peanut praline for the dark roasted profile that contrasts with the banana filling (using fresh bananas) for a touch of sweetness and acidity. It is topped with light peanut ganache and encased in a thin powdered chocolate shell.\xa0It was smart, interesting and an eye-opener. The interplay of flavours and textures, as well as the silkiness of the ganache, stood out. Finally, the lychee-in-a-lychee lychee fruit sculpture (S$28 dine-in, S$26 takeout) was an absolute delight. With minimal refined sugar, the velvety coconut ganache complements the flowy lychee gel (of fresh lychee) for a refreshing experience and ultra smooth mouthfeel. Altogether, the dessert is well balanced and lightweight, leaving you satisfied without feeling guilty.\xa0There is no doubt that each of the creations were delightful and brilliantly executed. They call for great skills, given the challenge to minimise sugar in the recipe (and use all-natural ingredients).\xa0The bakes shine not in the outburst of flavour, but in the delicate balance that comes together to form a whole, and in the interplay of textures. Yet the steep pricing, subtle flavour profile and the niche technicalities might mean that the team is speaking to a limited audience.\xa0Cedric Grolet has his sights on “artisanal pastry, not industrial pastry”, so it never was and never will be your everyday bakery.\xa0As the establishment aims to do good by its bakes, pushing limits and imagination, consumers sometimes become collateral damage — long queues, staff who were persistently unsure of what’s available and popular items that quickly sell out without a predictable baking schedule. Nonetheless, this is the price for a taste of Parisian excellence here in Singapore, and it’s probably worth the occasional indulgence.\xa0Meanwhile, Singapore has its share of internationally recognised pastisser, you can find them round the corner at eponymously named Janice Wong (three-times Pastry Chef of the Year), Tarte by Cheryl Koh (2016 Asia’s Best Pastry Chef) and Le Matin (by ex-Noma pastry chef Mohamed Al-Matin). Is it conducive to conversation? Yes, this is perfect for a slow afternoon chat over coffee and pastries.Is a reservation necessary? Reserve online to secure a seat. While walk-ins are available, do expect queues.\xa0How to get there? It’s a six-minute walk from Orchard MRT station.HungryGoWhere paid for its meal at this restaurant for this review. Still hungry?

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/paaru-singapore/:['When that Japanese food craving hits, there are plenty of options in Singapore, from affordable sushi chains to curated omakase experiences. But there’s something about the atmosphere that we just can’t recreate here, unless we take that seven-hour-long flight to Japan. That is, until we visited Paaru パール.Paaru is one of the latest additions to the Japanese food scene in Singapore. Its Japanese-inspired decor and vibes made us feel like we just stepped into a traditional Japanese home. While its menu is rather small, Paaru ensures that only quality seasonal Japanese ingredients are used, and each item it presents is exquisitely prepared and plated.Paaru is nestled within 195 Pearl’s Hill Terrace, a former police barracks turned independent arts enclave that’s home to art studios, film labs, boutique retailers and cafes.True to its name, reaching Pearl’s Hill Terrace does involve quite a bit of walking (or hiking, if you’re taking public transport). Do note that even if you use a ride-hailing service, the driver will not be able to drop you at the building’s lobby, as there is no grace period for the carpark at 195 Pearl’s Hill Terrace. However, once you find the lobby, there are clear signs and maps that will help you find Paaru.Just six weeks old at the time of our visit, Paaru already has a very healthy customer base and snaking queues, despite not having a large social media presence. Probably because the team behind Paaru also opened two other successful cafes in Singapore, Punch and Gather.If you didn’t know, Paaru パール is derived from the Japanese word for pearl. Is it a coincidence that they are located at 195 Pearl’s Hill Terrace? We think not.\xa0Jokes aside, we recommend visiting during off-peak hours, or if you can, in the morning. My companions and I visited on Sunday afternoon and only managed to get a table about 1.5 hours later. Once inside, we noticed Paaru uses lots of dark wood in its interior design, from the tables to its seating and the wood panelling on the walls — all of which contribute to a homely and zen vibe. However, it might come across as a little dim.There’s also an open kitchen with a granite farm table, a large drinks counter, and a wide window view overlooking rocks and trees that reminded us of Japanese gardens. The space isn’t big; we estimate that it can seat around 30 people at a time, which is probably why waiting times can be long.\xa0Unfortunately, Paaru only accepts walk-ins and uses an analog system of queue numbers. Upon reaching, you should head directly to the entrance and write your details down. Even though it was a rather long wait, the staff at Paaru do their best to make it more comfortable by providing water, stools, and even a fan.Once inside, the service at Paaru was quick and efficient — the staff were attentive and we didn’t have to wait long for our food. The menu selection, however, leaves something to be desired. I expected a wider variety of Japanese-inspired brunch dishes to fit with Paaru’s theme, but the menu felt limited and the portions were small.\xa0That said, the prices were fairly reasonable for the size and quality of ingredients.In my opinion, no cafe meal is complete without some eggs, so we tried Paaru’s eggs on shokupan (S$11 for poached eggs, S$13 for scrambled), and added a portobello mushroom (S$5). Shokupan is a Japanese milk bread that is known for its subtle sweet taste and pillowy texture — you’ll see this bread featured in all of Paaru’s mains. I’ll be honest, the picture doesn’t do it justice. Dredged over a thick slice of shokupan, the scrambled eggs were light and well-seasoned. My companions and I never tried shokupan before, but the bread was soft, fluffy, and had a subtle sweet taste that we enjoyed.\xa0The best thing on this plate, however, was the portobello mushroom. The grilled mushroom was well-prepared and added a burst of umami to the dish. Another winner on the menu is the simply named chicken sandwich (S$16). Between two thick slices of toasted shokupan, you have shredded chicken breast with wilted spinach, parmesan, and house dijon.\xa0Though seemingly ordinary, this hearty sandwich was flavourful and well-balanced. The tangy dijon mustard brightened up the filling that would otherwise have been too cloying.Paaru also serves other lighter all-day breakfast options, such as the fruit salad (S$10), bircher muesli (S$14), and shokupan with homemade jam (S$8).One of Paaru’s most popular dishes is the French toast shokupan (S$12), so of course we had to try it.\xa0The dish came with kuromitsu, cacao nibs, sea salt, and fresh cream. Kuromitsu, also known as “black honey”, is a Japanese sugar syrup that’s similar to molasses and is used in many Japanese desserts. Overall, the flavours worked together but after a while, the toast got a tad soggy and was too sweet for my liking. I would’ve preferred the kuromitsu served on the side so I could adjust the sweetness of the dish.\xa0\xa0However, my companions and I thought the cacao nibs added an interesting crunch and bittersweet flavour to the dish.\xa0For drinks, we ordered the white coffee (S$6), iced black coffee (S$6), and iced mocha (S$7.50). While the white coffee was rich and aromatic, the iced black was on the acidic side, and the iced mocha was a little too bitter. We were excited to visit Paaru and although there were a few hits and misses, our visit to Paaru gave us a little escape from the busy city life. We would love to come back, but only if the wait times weren’t so long.Is it conducive to conversation? Yes, unless you’re at the communal table.\xa0Is a reservation necessary? No, Paaru does not take reservations.How to get there? Walk up to Pearl’s Hill Terrace from the back of People’s Park Complex (nearest MRT station is Chinatown, exit C).

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/east-coast-lagoon-food-village/:['Opened in the late ’70s, the breezy East Coast Lagoon Food Village, located along East Coast Parkway, is Singapore’s only seaside hawker centre.\nAlthough there are many hawker centres scattered all over our island, the vibe for this particular one is decidedly different — there are families dining after a day at the beach, groups of friends replenishing their energy after engaging in water sports, or cyclists popping in for some much-needed hydration and a snack before continuing on their journey.Even the decor has a resort feel, with Balinese-style architecture and seating in courtyards. The East Coast Lagoon Food Centre is often buzzing, thanks to its mix of seafood offerings, local favourites and food gems such as satay stalls.It’s easy to fill up on a good meal here, then wash it down with fresh coconut or sugarcane juice. You can then digest your meal with a walk around the lagoon or simply watch the waves crashing in the nearby sea.Here are 14 stalls to try at the East Coast Lagoon Food Village.East Coast Lagoon Food Village, Stall 32, 1220 East Coast Parkway\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (4pm to 9pm)Why visit? The famed Geylang 29 Charcoal Fried Hokkien Mee stall was first opened by hawker Alex See more than two decades ago. The East Coast Road stall is known for its cooking its signature noodles over a red-hot charcoal stove, serving a delectable plate of Hokkien noodles that has the perfect wok hei.\xa0In 2016, See handed his business to his youngest daughter, Penny, who runs it with her husband. Penny’s sister, Lilian, in turn opened a same-named hawker stall at East Coast Lagoon Food Village, the outlet we’re referring to here. Using the same recipe and cooking techniques passed down by her father, you can be sure that the noodles produced here are infused with umami seafood flavour and as flavourful as the original outlet.Price range: $Crowd favourites: Needless to say, its popular Hokkien mee (from S$6), which is served with juicy prawns, chunky squid rings and lard, is a must-order. Don’t forget to squeeze the lime for extra zest. The stall also sells pork belly satay (S$1.50 each, minimum six sticks).East Coast Lagoon Food Village, Stall 45, 1220 East Coast Parkway\nOpen: Thursday to Sunday and Monday and Tuesday (5pm to 12am), Sunday (12pm to 12am)Why visit? A favourite among regulars of the hawker centre, Hwa Kee Barbeque Pork Noodle is highly sought after for its barbecued char siew (pork) that is tender and charred at the right places.\xa0The meat rests on bouncy and flavourful noodles, then the dish is drizzled with its housemade sauce. What’s in the special sauce? We’re not sure, but it has the right mix of sweet and savoury. Some have commented that when eaten together, each mouthful is a perfect symphony of flavours. This is a good spot for supper, as it’s open till midnight.Price range: $Crowd favourites: You can’t go wrong with its signature wonton noodles (from S$5). You can also opt for the wonton hor fun (from S$5). Still hungry? Get some fried wontons (from S$3) to accompany your meal.East Coast Lagoon Food Village, Stall 42, 1220 East Coast Parkway\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (11am to 8.30pm)Why visit? First opened in 1963, Han Jia Bak Kut Teh has garnered a loyal following, with some regulars frequenting the spot for more than two decades. It serves a comforting bowl of bak kut teh (meat bone tea) with rice, which you can accompany with sides such as beancurd and braised egg. There are also other types of soups, such as pig’s stomach or kidney soup, if you prefer.The stall might serve old-school flavours but it has very successfully adapted to the 21st century, having introduced an app of its own. Download it to get information on ongoing promotions and earn loyalty points, too.\xa0Price range: $Crowd favourites: Its bak kut teh (S$6.50) is extremely popular, of course. If you love pork leg, the one here is cooked in a special sauce made with a blend of herbs and spices so you’ll get a rich flavour. Go for the lean option if you prefer a healthier choice but we won’t judge if you choose the fat version — both are priced at S$6.90, with extremely tender meat. Set meals, where you can enjoy a combination of favourites with rice, are available, too.East Coast Lagoon Food Village, Stall 17, 1220 East Coast Parkway\nOpen: Daily (4pm to 10pm)Why visit? Soon Huat Teochew Satay Beehoon has been around since 1960, and its thick, flavourful bowl of beehoon has earned it a fan base. It has another outlet at ABC Brickworks food centre in Jalan Bukit Merah, if you’re located more centrally.\xa0If you’ve never had satay beehoon before, it’s exactly what its name suggests — gloopy peanut sauce (the same one that usually accompanies satay) is doused over rice vermicelli and a variety of other ingredients such as vegetables, cuttlefish, pork, pork liver and cockles. With the beehoon soaking up the mildly spicy, sweet and nutty peanut sauce, and ingredients that are tender and fresh, each mouthful is a delight.Price range: $Crowd favourites: Apart from satay beehoon (from S$6), other dishes available here include satay pork rib noodle and cuttlefish kang kong beehoon. You can add extra ingredients to your dish, such as prawns, lala, pork ribs and cuttlefish. The stall also sells satay beehoon paste in packets, so you can take some home and attempt to recreate the dish on your own. East Coast Lagoon Food Village, Stall 15, 1220 East Coast Parkway\nOpen: Thursday to Tuesday (4.30pm to 9pm)Why visit? There are some dishes at hawker centres that are ideal for sharing and oyster omelette\xa0– or orh luak – is one of them. Song Kee Fried Oyster has one of the longest queues at this East Coast Park food court, and one mouthful of its oyster omelette will tell you why.Not only does the dish have fresh, juicy oysters, it is perfectly fried to present a texture that balances both fluff and crisp. Do be prepared to wait up to 30 minutes for your plate during peak hours.Price range: $Crowd favourites: The fried oyster omelette (from S$5) is a little egg, not too starchy, and comes with a touch of crust at its edges. Enjoy it with the delicious lime-infused chilli on the side. You can also request for it to be fried more if you prefer it more crispy. The stall also sells oyster egg, which comes without starch, from S$7.East Coast Lagoon Food Village, Stall 14, 1220 East Coast Parkway\nOpen: Monday to Thursday (3pm to 10.45pm), Friday (3pm to 11pm), Saturday (12pm to 11pm), Sunday (12pm to 10.45pm)\xa0Why visit? We love our chicken wings in Singapore and there’s nothing quite like getting our fingers dirty as we dig into a plate of glistening, juicy, golden brown wings.\xa0The secret to the delicious chicken wings at the family-run Ah Hwee BBQ Chicken Wings & Spring Chicken lies in its marinade which is made up of 20 ingredients, including five spice powder, Chinese wine and ginger. A pack of wet wipes are a must!Price range: $Crowd favourites: The chicken wings (S$1.30 each) are tender and perfectly grilled, with a crispy skin that will make you want to keep coming back for more. If you want more flavour, dip them in the chilli that’s served with the dish.East Coast Lagoon Food Village, Stall 43, 1220 East Coast Parkway\nOpen: Thursday to Tuesday (4.30pm to 11.30pm)Why visit? There are two important ways to judge a good stingray — it has to have a non-rubbery texture (soft, flaky fish that easily peels off the bone is the best!) and it has to come with a delicious sambal that has a tangy heat. Stingray Forever BBQ Seafood passes this test with flying colours.\xa0Regulars flock to the stall for its stingray, but you can also get other delicious seafood here, such as calamari (S$15), chilli crab (market price) and BBQ sea prawn (S$16) and crayfish with butter garlic (market price). You can also order fried rice dishes and vegetables to complete your meal.Price range: $Crowd favourites: Try its hottest stingray (S$18) or sambal squid (S$13). If you’re not big on spice, try the sweet & sour stingray T-bone, a new dish they introduced this year.East Coast Lagoon Food Village, Stall 40, 1220 East Coast Parkway\nOpen: Monday, Wednesday to Friday (12pm to 10pm), Saturday and Sunday (8.30am to 10pm)Why visit? Carrot cake is a must-order dish for sharing when you’re at a hawker centre with friends. A crowd favourite in East Coast Lagoon Food Village is Lagoon Famous Carrot Cake, which has been serving customers for more than 50 years. It is now run by the son of the original stall holder.Fun fact: It used to be called Lagoon Carrot Cake, but added ‘famous’ to its name because, well, it’s now really well-known. It’s not just its chai tow kway that’s acclaimed though, it also serves popiah, which won the ‘Best of the Best’ accolade in the City Hawker Food Hunt.Price range: $Crowd favourites: The crispy carrot cake (from S$4) lives up to its name, with a soft interior and crunchy exterior, while the sweet delicious carrot cake (from S$4) is a black version that isn’t overly sweet and comes with prawns. You could also try black and white mixed carrot cake (from S$6) for a taste of both. The award-winning popiah (S$2.20 per roll, two for S$4.20, three for S$6) is a must-try, too — it boasts a thin skin enveloping fresh, savoury-sweet ingredients.East Coast Lagoon Food Village, Stall 46, 1220 East Coast Parkway\nOpen: Thursday to Tuesday (12pm to 9pm)Why visit? This stall only serves four dishes but it does them so well, you’d be hard pressed to decide which one you want to order. Choon Hiang is run by a second-generation hawker and has been in operation for more than 40 years. Whether it is the fried Hokkien mee, fried kway teow, fried rice or mee goreng — they are all stir-fried to perfection with a charcoal fire that imbues each dish with a smoky aroma.Price range: $Crowd favourites: The fried Hokkien prawn mee (from S$4) and fried kway teow (from S$4) are this stall’s most popular dishes. The Hokkien mee is bursting with flavour and has generous servings of prawns, too. It’s more wet than dry but not too gooey, and it has a fragrant wok hei. The dish is especially delicious when you mix in its chilli. As for the kway teow, it has a nice texture, with ingredients such as cockles, bean sprouts, Chinese sausage and fish cake.East Coast Lagoon Food Village, Stall 33, 1220 East Coast Parkway\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (4pm to 8.30pm)Why visit? Lagoon Leng Kee Beef Kway Teow was first opened by a Mr Chan more than 40 years ago, and it’s now run by his son. It only serves the traditional Teochew beef kway teow, which is the soup version.\xa0It’s comfort food that can be a nice reprieve from the other greasier options at East Coast Lagoon Food Village. The dish’s highlight is its light, flavourful soup, which is made by simmering beef bones for hours. The beef cuts are also really tender. Make sure you dip the meat into its accompanying tangy chilli.Price range: $Crowd favourites: Regulars swear by its beef kway teow (from S$6), which they say taste exactly the same from decades ago. Do note that you might have to wait a while at peak times, as each bowl is prepared fresh.East Coast Lagoon Food Village, Stall 29, 1220 East Coast Parkway\nOpen: Wednesday to Monday (10am to 6pm)Why visit? Often listed as one of the best duck rice stalls in Singapore, Zuo Ji Duck Rice is known for its extremely tender meat and thick soy-based sauce that’s flavoured with star anise. It often sells out fast, so go early to avoid disappointment. You can also call to place your order, then pay when you pop by to pick it up.Price range: $Crowd favourites: For something simple, go for the duck rice (S$3.50) that comes with slivers of duck breast and cucumber atop rice, drizzled with sauce. Or go for the duck porridge (S$3.50) if you want something warm and comforting. You can add on other items, such as braised beancurd, innards, hard boiled egg and peanuts, if you’re feeling peckish.East Coast Lagoon Food Village, Stall 55, 1220 East Coast Parkway\nOpen: Wednesday to Sunday (1pm to 8pm)Why visit? No meal at this East Coast Park food village is complete without satay. And Haron Satay, which is more than 40 years old, is one of the best ways to enjoy these bits of juicy chargrilled meat on sticks. The portions are generous and the meat is crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. Pair your satay with the fragrant peanut sauce for a sweet-savoury finish.Price range: $Crowd favourites: Regulars say the chicken and mutton satay, at 90 cents per stick (minimum 10 sticks), are must-tries, as they are tender with a slight char. Don’t forget the ketupat (rice cakes), at 50 cents each.East Coast Lagoon Food Village, Stall 7, 1220 East Coast Parkway\nOpen: Friday to Wednesday (11am to 7.30pm)Why visit? Some might say that chicken rice is our national dish and there’s always at least one stall selling it at every hawker centre. At this East Coast Park food centre, Leng Heng Chicken Rice is known for serving meals with tender chicken and flavourful rice, at affordable prices. A plate of steamed or roasted chicken rice or noodles will set you back just S$4.Price range: $Crowd favourites: You can try other chicken rice variations here too, such as lemon chicken rice (S$4) and Thai-style chicken rice (S$4).East Coast Lagoon Food Village, Stall 11, 1220 East Coast Parkway\nOpen: Tuesday to Friday (3pm to 11pm), Saturday and Sunday (1pm to 11pm)Why visit?

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/toast-box-coffee-house/:['Local Nanyang coffee chain Toast Box has launched a brand-new dining concept: Toast Box Coffee House, which opened earlier this week.\xa0Tucked away at a quaint corner along Seng Poh Road, the latest outfit by BreadTalk Group occupies the space that once housed Old Tiong Bahru Bak Kut Teh.\xa0This marks the brand’s 76th outlet in Singapore.\xa0The 100-seater store is a blast from the past. It’s fashioned after old-school kopitiams that used to dot the highways and byways of Singapore’s streets. Toast Box Coffee House pays tribute to the local coffeeshop scene. Its premises are impeccably styled with curated vintage memorabilia and design elements that hark back to Singapore’s yesteryears. Just look to the store’s green glass accents, rustic rattan and wooden elements that evoke a sense of nostalgia among diners young and old.  Besides the usual Toast Box mainstays of toasted bread, fresh kopi and more, Toast Box Coffee House also serves up an extended range of food and drink offerings.\xa0Diners will find outlet-exclusives dishes that bring together familiar traditional Nanyang specialities and British-inspired fare, including treats such as old-school Hainanese pork chop rice and claypot Hokkien prawn mee. Coffee connoisseurs can look forward to Toast Box Coffee House’s in-house coffee bean retail counter. It’s the only Toast Box outlet in Singapore that allows diners to choose their own blends.There are six types of roasted coffee beans available, which include two Nanyang kopi roasts and four single-origin options.\xa0The latter includes the rich Sumatra Mandheling roast — which undergoes a 12- to 24-month aging process — as well as the Honey Processed Handpicked, which features robusta beans cultivated from Toast Box’s adopted plantation in Lampung, Sumatra.\xa0If you aren’t sure of which flavour profile to go for, don’t hesitate to chat with the friendly kopi masters manning the fort.The outlet also plays host to First Street Teochew Fish Soup, a popular hawker brand under BreadTalk Group. The family-run stall is widely recognised for its hearty fish soup, prepared Teochew-style.The main draw is its fresh fish slices, which are cooked with a secret recipe. They’re also simmered for 30 seconds, giving them a soft and tender texture.\xa0The beloved hawker eatery has rolled out a new menu that you’ll find only at Toast Box Coffee House.\xa0Soup-wise, there is the exquisite Chinese pomfret fish soup (S$16.90), which sees a sweet and tender pomfret in a refreshing, full-bodied broth. Alternatively, the garoupa fish soup (S$12.90) spotlights its namesake garoupa, a premium catch that is prized for its nutrient-rich flesh.\xa0Our favourite of the lot is the Chinese pomfret in Teochew-style (S$28.90). Alongside slices of fish, the dish is adorned with a medley of ingredients, such as marinated minced meat, Chinese mushrooms and silky tofu.\xa0The broth is also prepared with sour plum, which lends a welcome tanginess to the soup. Besides the fish soup, diners can also look forward to a wide range of dishes.The old-school Hainanese pork chop (S$9.80 ala carte, S$11.80 with a medium-sized drink) is a treat to savour, with its crispy and succulent pork loin slices atop a bed of fluffy rice. The protein is dressed in a sweet Hainanese sauce, which complements the savouriness of the dish perfectly. The claypot Hokkien prawn mee (S$7.80 ala carte, S$9.80 with a medium-sized drink) is a comforting option best enjoyed on a rainy day. Imbued with a smoky wok hei flavour, chonky prawns, fish cake slices and fried pork lard sit atop an umami-laden prawn broth.\xa0Here’s a tip: Enjoy the noodles with the fiery homemade belacan chilli sauce for an infusion of spice and zest. Perennial breakfast favourites that you mustn’t skip out on are, of course, the traditional toasted bread that Toast Box is known for (S$2.60 ala carte, S$6.60 with two eggs and a medium-sized beverage).\xa0You’ll find that Toast Box Coffee House has put its own twist on old-school flavours, introducing modern takes such as toast with black sesame and lemon curd. Both are rich jams that go well with the crispy, toasted bread.\xa0For dessert, indulge in the deluge of old-school kuehs and cakes on the menu. The former touts selections such as kueh dadar (S$4.20 for three pieces) — a sweet pandan crepe chock-full of grated coconut and palm sugar — and kueh sago gula melaka (S$2.80 for three pieces), a decadent treat smothered in coconut shavings.\xa0The tea cakes (S$2.80 ala carte, S$4.80 with a medium-sized drink) are not to be missed, either. Layered with buttercream, it comes in a slew of flavours: Roasted peanut, black sesame, almond and more.There are also new concoctions to be had at Toast Box Coffee House. Definitely order the iced grass jelly teh or iced grass jelly coffee (S$3.50 each), which are injected with fresh tea and coffee brews, respectively. Teeming with QQ sago pearls, the iced teh sago and iced kopi sago (S$3.20 each) are unique riffs on boba drinks.This was a hosted tasting.For more eats, read our articles on what to eat at Tiong Bahru Market and popular spots for Vietnamese fare.\xa0For the latest on the food scene, check out our articles on The Coffee Code and TWG Tea’s 15th anniversary menu.\xa0Book a ride to Toast Box Coffee House’s new dining concept at Seng Poh Road. 58 Seng Poh Road\nNearest MRT station: Tiong Bahru\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (7.30am to 9.30pm)58 Seng Poh Road\nNearest MRT station: Tiong Bahru\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (7.30am to 9.30pm)AuthorPhyllis is a sweet tooth with a love for all things dessert.

VivoCity, 02-145/146, 1 HarbourFront Walk\nOpen: Daily (11.30am to 2pm, 5pm to 9pm) Why visit? Singapore’s love for all things spicy and numbing continues with Yao Yao Sauerkraut Fish, which hails from Shenzhen.

Save some space for desserts — the classic tiramisu (S$5) and the caramel panna cotta (S$3.50) are worth all the extra calories. VivoCity, 01-167, 1 HarbourFront Walk\nOpen: Daily (11.30am to 3pm, 5.30pm to 9pm)Why visit?

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/ji-xiang-ang-ku-kueh-vs-poh-cheu-kitchen/:['In our new series Food Feuds, we visit competing local food stalls known for their rivalry and try to find out which one does it better.Oftentimes when someone tells me they don’t like ang ku kueh, their reason is that it’s too sticky or oily, or overly sweet. This is when I reply: “You just haven’t tried the good stuff yet.”\xa0A well-made ang ku kueh, named for its classic red skin and turtle shell shape, is smooth and delicate. Rather than sticky, it’s supposed to be soft and pleasantly chewy, opening up to reveal fillings that range from traditional peanut or sweet mung bean to more modern flavours such as durian and corn.The best ang ku kuehs are, of course, made by hand to control the thickness, or rather thinness, of the dough, which are affected by daily fluctuations in temperature and humidity.Machines can’t do that, which is why these two extremely popular ang ku kueh brands have been handcrafting their kueh for almost four decades now.Nothing serious here — just a little friendly competition is all. Interestingly, both Ji Xiang Ang Ku Kueh and Poh Cheu Kitchen, while completely unrelated to each other, first started in 1985 during Singapore’s very first recession.\xa0Both have since won plenty of awards and recognition, and are now always mentioned in the list of top ang ku kueh spots in the country. Queues throughout the day are almost guaranteed.\xa0It’s hard to mistake one for the other though, because there are many fundamental differences between each brand’s kueh.235 Victoria Street\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (7am to 7pm)Ji Xiang Confectionery is the brainchild of Toh Poh Seek, who started his business from his HDB flat at Everton peddling peanut and sweet bean paste ang ku kueh to provision shops and hawkers around the neighbourhood.Its popularity soon led to the setup of a dedicated space at 1 Everton Park three years later in 1988 — a mainstay up till today that’s plainly known by regulars as “Everton Park ang ku kueh”.Now, they have another seven outlets islandwide, with the bulk of operations shifting to the flagship store in Bugis. There, you’ll see multiple kueh makers rolling up 10 different fillings before shaping their kueh in pink plastic moulds.Generally, Ji Xiang’s ang ku kueh are flatter and the skin thinner, easily sliced open to reveal a typically more compact filling than Po Cheu’s.\xa0For this article, we try all of its classic flavours, as well as two premium ones (minus the almond and pistachio flavour) to match the flavours available from the other brand.Peanut: 3.5/5Ji Xiang’s peanut filling has a slightly bitter taste to it, like peanuts that have been roasted a tad too much. Still, it has a nice natural peanut flavour (it’s less sweet than Poh Cheu’s). It’s more loosely packed, and I like the texture better.Sweet Bean: 4.5/5The sweetened mung bean paste is smooth and moist, and sweetened just enough to bring out the desirable bean flavour. A very solid and classic ang ku kueh flavour. Salted Bean: 3.5/5In terms of texture, Ji Xiang’s salted bean paste is more compact and ground to a finer consistency. Flavour-wise, it’s a tad saltier than Poh Cheu and doesn’t seem to have quite the same finesse in terms of complexity. It’s still pretty well done though.Corn: 2.5/5This is a little weak on the corn flavour, and in fact not too much different from its regular sweet bean. Only the tiny bits of corn inside give any indication that it’s a corn ang ku kueh.Coconut: 2.5/5Ji Xiang’s coconut ang ku kueh, while very pretty, is a little on the wetter side with a light coconut taste. Not liking the texture too much, which feels almost soggy, but okay in a pinch.Yam: 4/5If you like the sort of yam paste that’s on the drier, more compact side, yet still full of pure yam flavour, this is a good choice for you. I personally like the oilier and smoother kind of paste (think orh nee), but it’s still a good one.Black Sesame (S$3.50): 5/5This costs more than two regular ang ku kuehs, but it’s so scrumptious. The charcoal grey skin is peppered with whole sesame seeds, and when you cut it open, it reveals a mass of coarse black sesame paste, like very chunky peanut butter, but grinded to a grainier consistency.\xa0The black sesame flavour is very, very pure, sweetened just enough to bring out the flavour of the sesame. I’ve never given a full rating before, but this is just delightful.Durian (S$3.50): 4.5/5Another premium flavour, the black durian ang ku kueh is filled with top-quality mao shang wang durian pulp — no additional sweeteners and all natural. It’s hard to go wrong on this one because it’s all about the quality of durian flesh, which is rich and bittersweet with an aromatic aftertaste.Value: 4/5Ji Xiang offers very good value with most of its flavours going at S$1.50. The premium flavours, such as the black sesame and durian, are a tad pricey at S$3.50, but the execution is excellent.Final score: 75.5%\xa0127 Bukit Merah Lane 1, 01-222\nOpen: Tuesday to Saturday (8am to 6pm)Poh Cheu was founded in 1985 by couple Neo Poh Cheu and Lim Kim Noi, and unlike Ji Xiang, they also started out selling other traditional handmade creations such as soon kueh and abacus seeds, alongside their ang ku kueh.\xa0Poh Cheu was also awarded a Michelin Plate in 2019 — the first ang ku kueh shop to be awarded the honour. It has retained its original coffee-shop stall from the 80s, and remains the only outlet.\xa0The stall offers 13 different flavours, with interesting new age ones such as coffee, pineapple, green tea, and mango. Poh Cheu’s kueh is rounder than Ji Xiang’s and the skin slightly thicker, with a more springy texture.Peanut: 3.5/5Poh Cheu’s peanut filling is fairly similar to Ji Xiang’s, except that it is a bit on the sweeter side, and the peanuts are more compact. A safe and solid option.Sweet Bean: 3/5The filling is sweeter and a bit on the chunky side, and I could taste clumpy bits as I chewed, compared to the relatively smooth sweet bean paste from Ji Xiang. Altogether decent, but would like to taste a bit more of the bean rather than too much sweetness.Salted Bean: 4.5/5The salted bean flavour is a classic, and Poh Cheu executes its version flawlessly. The pasty salted mung bean is reminiscent of a good tau sar piah from Hong Kong, with a touch of pepper to add a whole dimension of flavour.Yam: 4.5/5Now that’s what I’m talking about — a solid yam ang ku kueh oozing with soft and sweet yam paste, with a touch of lard inside like a good orh nee dessert. Creating fillings to replicate classic desserts seems to be a thing here (see black sesame flavour).Black Sesame: 4/5The skin is a pretty warm grey speckled with crushed sesame seeds. The filling is an oozy sesame paste — slightly thicker than what you’d get at the dessert stall, but just as rich and sweet. It’s not as premium as Ji Xiang’s, but done very well at a fraction of the price.Coconut: 3.5/5The coconut flavour from Poh Cheu is slightly better than Ji Xiang’s — crunchy, sweet and not as ‘moist’ in the mouth. If I had to choose between the two, it’d be this one.Corn: 4.5/5One of its newer flavours. I was prepared to be disappointed after tasting Ji Xiang’s corn flavour, but Poh Cheu does a very good rendition with larger pieces of sweet corn inside. There’s an instant fragrance of corn aroma on the first bite — this is sure to satisfy corn lovers.Durian: 2.5/5\xa0Poh Cheu’s durian can hardly be compared to Ji Xiang’s. They use a sweet bean paste flavoured with durian rather than actual durian pulp. As a result, there’s barely a hint of durian flavour when I compare both side by side. Not the best flavour Poh Cheu has come up with.Value: 4.5/5Final score: 76.5%The winner: Poh Cheu KitchenIt’s a single percentage point difference, but Poh Cheu Kitchen tops this by a hair.\xa0Take this verdict with a pinch of salt, because as you’ve seen above, both brands have very different styles of ang ku kueh, which will be favoured by different groups of people.\xa0Ji Xiang tends to rely on a similar kind of pasty filling and uses less sugar to let the natural flavours of the ingredients shine, while Poh Cheu’s kueh are on the sweeter side, and have a more varied type of filling (from chunky to pasty to absolutely smooth).\xa0Comparing the same flavours from both brands side by side, we have favourites from each brand — and you probably will, too.\xa0Either way, there’s no denying both stand out from those mass-produced ones in commercial factories. Now, let me head back to those leftovers in my kitchen…HungryGoWhere paid for its meals at both stalls for this article.Ji Xiang Ang Ku Kueh and Poh Cheu Kitchen are on the GrabMart delivery service and offer free delivery (up to S$3 off) with GrabUnlimited.Alternatively, you can book a ride to Ji Xiang Ang Ku Kueh and Poh Cheu Kitchen.\xa0Do explore the new GrabFood Dine-in service for awesome deals.

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/wanton-mee-singapore/:['Wonton noodles, or what most refer to as “wanton mee” in Singapore, is a relatively simple dish that comprises noodles, meat-filled dumplings and char siew (BBQ pork).\xa0While it might seem uncomplicated, it’s undeniably a hot favourite among diners here when it comes to comforting noodle dishes in Singapore. It’s a dish that provides a comforting feeling of nostalgia to countless Singaporeans who’d grown up with it.Wanton mee can be served in a few ways, either as a lighter version with the noodles served in broth, or a dry version where the noodles are accentuated with sauce (usually dark sauce) and chilli.One thing’s for sure, the dish, though seemingly straightforward, requires all of its elements to be done to perfection for a holistic, faultless dish.That’s why, if you try asking any Singaporean which stall is their favourite, each would have their own opinion on where to find the best wanton mee in Singapore.\xa0Always on the lookout for a comforting bowl of the beloved noodles ourselves, we decided to try 30 stalls scattered throughout the island and rate them, to make your decision easier.Here’s our guide on wanton mee stalls in Singapore, according to different regions. Sunshine Plaza, 01-53, 91 Bencoolen Street\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (10am to 9pm)Why visit? Parklane Zha Yun Tun Mee House is one of the many rustic eateries hidden inside Sunshine Plaza. The unassuming store has been around for decades, a familiar sight well-known to print-shop regulars and students in the area.Rating: 3/5Our thoughts: The crispy fried wanton that came with the fried yun tun mee (S$5) was the highlight. Unfortunately, the char siew was dry and it was an altogether average meal. We will probably only go back specifically for the fried wanton and not the wanton mee itself.Block C, Jackson Square, 11 Lorong 3 Toa Payoh\nOpen: Monday to Friday (8am to 4pm), Saturday and Sunday (8am to 3pm)Why visit? This industrial area hidden gem has built up quite a cult following for itself. Opened by Michelin-starred chef Ang Song Kang, Chef Kang’s Noodle House is a stall you have to check out when hunting for the best wanton mee in SIngapore.Rating: 4/5Our thoughts: The noodle with char siew and wanton (S$7) not only came with copious amounts of fried pork lard and pieces of juicy and tender char siew, the accompanying wanton is also generously stuffed with chestnut and a generous meat and prawn filling. However, the texture of the noodles wasn’t as good as expected — producing a starchy and sticky mouthfeel.Whampoa Food Centre, 01-28, 91 Whampoa DriveWhy visit? Although it bears “Hougang” in its name, Hougang Ming Ji Wanton Noodle can be found all over the island these days. Its widespread availability is what made us want to check it out to find out its key to thriving in the competitive hawker scene.Rating: 3.5/5Crowd favourites: What we liked most about this stall is its springy and flavourful noodles. Each bowl of its signature noodle (S$5) came with a variety of sides besides wanton: Think chicken feet and pork ribs. While the sides were mostly average in quality, it makes for a filling and hearty meal. Seah Im Food Centre, 01-50, 2 Seah Im Road\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (6am to 2pm)Why visit? While not typically one of the usual suspects when one thinks of the best wanton mee in Singapore, Kowloon Wanton Noodle is a good option for those in the Harbourfront vicinity. The stall specialises in both old-school wanton mee and soya sauce chicken noodles for those looking for a light lunch.Price range: 3/5Our thoughts: Overall, we thought the bowl of wanton mee (S$4) was pretty good, delivering a good rendition of what you’d expect from the dish. Though the noodles and char siew were average, we enjoyed the flavourful wanton and how the lighter soup paired well with the dumplings’ savoury profile.Yue Hua Coffee Shop, 118 Depot Lane\nOpen: Monday to Friday (6.30am to 2.30pm), Saturday (7am to 1.30pm)Timbre+, 01-06, 73A Ayer Rajah Crescent\nOpen: Monday to Friday (7.30am to 6pm), Saturday (8am to 2pm)Why visit? Wong Kee Noodle is a beloved stall by residents and foodies alike, and is frequently mentioned when we talk about the best wanton mee in Singapore. Regulars swear by its tasty, quality offerings that are consistently good. Another unique selling point: It has an intriguing variety of noodles besides the usual yellow ones, such as tomato and spinach noodles.Rating: 3.5/5Our thoughts: Between the char siew dumpling noodle (S$5.50) and char siew dumpling spinach noodle (S$6.30), we thought the latter stood out more, though it was on the drier side and needed a splash of soup to moisten it up.\xa0We opted for shui jiao (Chinese boiled dumplings) here instead of wanton — a decent offering that was spruced up with black fungus instead of watercress in its filling. Char siew lovers would also appreciate the stall’s version — its meat was delicious, enhanced by a rich sauce.Naifu Coffee House, 01-193, 151 Bishan Street 11\nOpen: Wednesday to Sunday (6am to 1pm)Why visit? This unassuming stall is located in a tiny corner coffee shop that converts to a zichar eatery at night. Be prepared to wait for about 15 minutes, as Xing Hua Wanton Mee gets really crowded in the mornings, thanks to a throng of regulars residing in the area.Rating: 4/5Our thoughts: It feels like an old-school dish cooked by your grandpa, where everything is just right and well-balanced. We loved everything from the light and slightly peppery sauce that coated the springy noodles, to the slivers of char siew that had a nice bite and were not too dry. Even the wantons, often overlooked, were nicely filled with tender meat.654 Yishun Ave 4, #4\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (7am to 7pm)Why visit? Tanjong Rhu Wanton Noodles is an inescapable name when hunting down the best wanton mee in Singapore. This prolific brand can be found all over the island, which means we’d definitely need to try it to see what the fuss is about.Rating: 3.5/5\xa0Our thoughts: One of the things that jumped out for us is its chilli, which packed a fiery punch. This addition gave the signature wanton mee noodles (S$4) a nice spicy profile — especially delicious when combined with the springy egg noodles and crispy fried wantons. The soup served on the side was bland, but the wanton was tasty.10 Marsiling Industrial Estate Road 1\nOpen: Monday to Saturday (6am to 4.30pm)\xa0Why visit? Woodlands is not usually known to be a food enclave, but don’t knock it just yet! One Ton Mee in the Woodlands industrial area serves up a pretty decent plate of wanton mee if you’re hankering for some comfortable noodle-y goodness.Rating: 3/5Our thoughts: The bowl of wanton noodles (S$4.50) we had were on the saucier side, where every bite of the springy noodles were coated in sauce. The wanton came in a good size — however, it had a peculiar sweetness that differed from your usual wantons and the char siew turned out to be a tad dry and tough.Kampung Admiralty Hawker Centre, 02-06, 676 Woodlands Drive 71Why visit? Meng Ji Noodle House might not be a well-known wanton mee option, but for those living in Admiralty, it serves a decent plate that’s generous in portion. It’s among the more eye-catching stalls at Kampung Admiralty Hawker Centre, thanks to its big signboard.Rating: 3/5Our thoughts: If you have a wonton noodle craving, this would be an acceptable option. Its wanton noodles (S$3.50) is standard fare, with the usual ingredients. The noodles were springy and the char siew was decent and less dry than most; however, its wantons were pretty run-of-the-mill and on the smaller side.Yishun Park Hawker Centre, 01-12, 51 Yishun Avenue 11\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (9am to 8.30pm)Why visit? One Mouth Noodle is a bit of an outlier among the wanton mee stalls in Singapore — here, the owner starts every day by painstakingly making the egg noodles from scratch. There is little wonder then, that you’d find a steady line of customers patiently awaiting their turn to order at this Yishun stall during peak hours.Rating: 4/5Our thoughts: As far as noodles are concerned, One Mouth Noodle’s handmade egg noodles easily beat out most of its competitors in Singapore. Done up Hong Kong-style with a light sauce, the toothsome al dente bite of the sleek noodles is readily apparent.The crowd-favourite char siew wanton noodle (S$5.50), while slightly pricier than most, comes with an array of well-caramelised and luscious meat slices, making each mouthful a textured, flavourful one. Another highlight: Its umami soup on the side.Blk 313A Sembawang Drive\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (6am to 1.30pm)Why visit? Purportedly based on a family recipe that dates back to 1946, this hidden gem in Sembawang dishes out nostalgic bowls of old-school wanton mee. Wah Seng Kee Traditional Wanton Noodle also gives diners the option for jazzed-up noods that come with chicken feet.Rating: 3.5/5Our thoughts: Wah Seng Kee’s signature noodle (S$5.50) was pretty indulgent — it’s loaded with char siew, chicken feet and fried wanton, along with a bowl of wanton soup. Except for the average char siew, the rest of the components were all enjoyable, especially the crispy fried wanton.\xa0Ultimately though, the best part of the ensemble was the noodles, which were springy and not alkaline while nicely bolstered with a touch of umami chilli.\xa0Chong Pang Food Centre, 01-158, 104 Yishun Ring Road\nOpen: Friday to Tuesday (5am to 9pm), Wednesday and Thursday (5am to 2pm)Why visit? This wanton mee stall is a familiar sight to many who live in the area, having been in Chong Pang Food Centre for more than three decades. Many regulars say they’ve been eating noodles from Hoe Soon Noodle since young, which makes it an interesting option to check out, especially given the lack of wanton mee in the hawker centre.Rating: 2/5Our thoughts: The tangy sauce blend was intriguing but the stall’s wanton noodle (S$3.50) was decidedly average as a whole — its noodles were clumped up while the char siew was the classic “thin and dry” variety you usually find in old-school wanton mee.45 Joo Chiat Place\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (6am to 3.30am)Why visit? If you’re staying in the east, Fei Fei Wanton Mee should be a name you should note down for future supper sessions, as the popular spot is open until 3.30am.\xa0Previously located at 72 Joo Chiat Place, the stall, which opened in the 1940s, moved a few stalls down the road in April. We’re not sure why, but the shift has resulted in mixed reviews, so we were curious to see whether its noodles still hold up to standards.Rating: 3/5Our thoughts: Unfortunately, the wanton noodle (S$6) didn’t impress, with dry char siew and noodles that tasted rather bland. However, we still appreciated the texture of its springy egg noodles and the generous wantons in the soup.182 Joo Chiat Road\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (7.30am to 9pm)Why visit? Dating back as far as 1962, Ang Moh Wanton Noodles started as a pushcart run by a man who looked like an “ang moh” (local slang for Caucasian) before it went on to become one of the most beloved establishments in the area.\xa0Today, it’s still a go-to spot for those hankering a good ol’ plate of old-school Singapore wanton mee.Rating: 3.5/5Our thoughts: One great thing about the signature dry wanton noodles (S$6) here is how generous the stall is with its dumplings. At the same time, we also enjoyed how delicate the noodles were. Unfortunately, the char siew was rather dry, which meant it wasn’t as enjoyable as it could be.287 Tanjong Katong Road\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (11am to 9pm)Why visit? A best wanton mee compilation can’t do without a mention of Eng’s, one of the most well-known Singapore wanton mee brands. It’s also one of two parties embroiled in a prominent food feud.This Eng’s is the one located at 287 Tanjong Katong Road and it uses the green bowl — the brand can also be found in a few locations around the island.Rating: 4.5/5Our thoughts: This was a great bowl of wantan mee (S$5.50) and we loved both the texture of the noodles as well as the juicy char siew and wanton. Spice lovers would also be enticed to try this stall since the fiery chilli is well-known for its potency.\xa0\xa0Yong Li Coffee Station, 01-140, 3136 Bedok North Avenue 3\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (8am to 8pm)Why visit? Kok Kee is one of the most legendary names in our hawker scene. Established in 1985 by a pair of sisters, many who grew up eating fro the stall have extolled it as one of the best wanton mee in Singapore. However, gentrification and a spate of recent expansion has us wondering how it fares these days.Our Rating: 2/5Crowd favourites: Overall, we didn’t think the wanton noodle (S$7.80) from this Bedok branch of Kok Kee was worth the higher price tag. Not only were the noodles on the soft side, the sauce was also rather sweet. The serving size was smaller than expected, given the price.59 New Upper Changi Road\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (7.30am to 8pm)Why visit? This prolific wanton mee brand was first opened at Yishun in 2021 to much fanfare. The reason? It’s helmed by a seasoned former Crystal Jade executive chef. Its wanton noodles are different, done Hong Kong-style instead.Rating: 3.5/5Our thoughts: We felt that the highlight of the HK shrimp wanton noodles (S$5), which came with springy noodles submerged in a pool of flavourful pale gold broth, was the accompanying ingredients.\xa0Each bowl gives you an assortment of fried and steamed wanton, char siew and vegetables. The steamed wanton has a nice springy texture and there’s a decent tenderness on the char siew.Bedok Shopping Complex, 312 Bedok Road\nOpen: Wednesday to Monday (9am to 9pm)Why visit? This renowned standalone stall at Bedok is one of the most popular food options in the east. The secret to its flavourful noodles is a family recipe that has been passed down for generations. Wanton Noodle House also serves tender braised pork and carrot cake — both of which are tasty in their own right.Rating: 3/5Our thoughts: The wanton char siew noodle (S$5.70) arrived springy and coated in a sauce that featured a good balance of savoury-sweetness. However, the wanton was average and the servings were smaller than expected, given the relatively high price.If you aren’t looking just for wanton mee, we liked that the stall also serves a selection of sides, including carrot cake and ngoh hiang.Jurong West 505 Market & Food Centre, 01-14, 505 Jurong West Street 52\nOpen: Thursday to Monday (7am to 2pm)Why visit? Apparently run by owners who are affiliated to the famous Kok Kee brand, which many consider to be one of the best wanton mee in Singapore, Wai Kee is deemed a hidden gem by residents there. It is a good wanton mee option for those who find themselves in the Jurong West area.Rating: 3/5\xa0Our thoughts: Our order of char siew wanton mee (S$4) featured very chewy noodles, watery sauce and thinly sliced char siew. While the sauce may be slightly watery, it was tasty and complemented the noodles well.Taman Jurong Market & Food Centre, 03-172, 3 Yung Sheng Road\nOpen: Wednesday to Sunday (5:30am to 2:30pm)Why visit? One of the more popular stalls at Taman Jurong Food Centre, Ying Ji Wanton Mee is known for its large portions and lean meat. It’s one spot in the west that you definitely need to visit if you’re craving for old-school wanton mee.Rating: 3.5/5\xa0Our thoughts: As with many traditional versions of the dish, the char siew was the sweet and chewier type. Its noodles were thicker than usual and we liked how the wanton soup was packed with flavour. The stall was also very generous with its servings, considering prices start from S$4. Taman Jurong Market & Food Centre, 02-105, 3 Yung Sheng Road\xa0Why visit? Despite its name, Kallang Airport Wanton Noodle isn’t actually located at Kallang. Instead, it can be found at a few locations all over the island. There are two outlets in the west alone, to serve those living in the area. Regulars say the wonton noodles here are above average, comprising tasty char siew and wanton.Rating: 3.5/5\xa0Our thoughts: We enjoyed the established brand’s signature wanton noodle (S$4), thanks to its springy and flavourful noodles, crispy fried wanton and char siew that skews towards the fattier side. Sunshine Place, 475 Choa Chu Kang Avenue 3Why visit? The rustic and far-flung Sunshine Place (don’t mistake it for Sunshine Plaza) is not a mall found on many bucket lists.\xa0But for those looking to expand their food options in Choa Chu Kang, did you know about this rustic standalone shop that is quite popular with residents?Rating: 2.5/5\xa0Our thoughts: This stall’s wanton mee, available from S$3.80, sadly fell short. To be fair, the wantons, while small, were juicy and the noodles were acceptable, sporting a soft bite that feels different from the usual factory-made yellow noodles.However, the char siew was too thin and the portion too little, which meant the noodle-to-meat proportion was too imbalanced.Prestige Centre, 02-02, 71 Bukit Batok Crescent\nOpen: Tuesday to Friday (11.30am to 3pm, 6.30pm to 9pm), Saturday and Sunday (11 to 3pm, 5.30pm to 9pm)Why visit? Laifaba is a hidden gem among many wanton mee fanatics, who are willing to make the trek to its rather obscure location for its delicious noodles. It first gained popularity when it opened at The Scarlet Hotel, amassing many fans due to its special “bu jian tian” (Chinese for “never see the sky” and refers to meat from the armpit) cut of char siew.\xa0It has since moved to an industrial building in Bukit Batok. Besides the top-notch food, the old-school decor and personable service are also why we think it’s a must-visit.Rating: 5/5Our thoughts: In our view, Laifaba could be the best wanton mee in Singapore, though its signature noodles (S$11.90) can be pricey. The signature char siew was succulent and can be ordered leaner, fattier or mixed, based on your preference.\xa0The noodles were chewy and mixed in a tasty gravy, and each bowl came with a lava egg. That said, the accompanying pork collar broth was the component that stole our heart. Akin to a lighter Beauty in the Pot collagen soup, we couldn’t help but ask for seconds.TK Food House, Block 272 Bukit Batok East Avenue 4Why visit? One of the more popular stalls in the Bukit Batok region, Man Xiang is a roasted meat specialist offering an array of meats such as char siew, roast pork and roast duck. While you can have your meats with rice, the stall also serves a great plate of wonton noodles.\xa0Rating: 4.5/5\xa0Our thoughts: To us, this place serves up a great plate that’s well worth its price tag of S$3.80. Not only do you get fatty and flavourful char siew that stole the show, it also came with an assortment of plump wanton.\xa0Although the noodles did turn out to be slightly saltier than we would have liked, it was enjoyable as a whole, as the ingredients blended well together.51 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 5, Stall 5\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (7am to 4pm)Why visit? Unlike the usual traditional local-style noodles, Soi 19’s signature stands out from the other wanton mee in Singapore as it’s prepared Thai-style. This Ang Mo Kio outlet is the original flagship outlet that was established in 2012, and it often boasts snaking queues during peak hours. However, it has since opened another three outlets, including one in Jurong.\xa0Rating: 3/5Our thoughts: This bowl of Thai wanton mee (S$5.50) comes with a variety of ingredients, such as sausage, chunks of char siew and fried and boiled wanton, to complement the star — the springy noodles. The sauce skews slightly towards the sweeter side, which means it can get cloying and you might find it hard to finish the entire bowl.Ang Mo Kio Central Food Centre, 01-21, 724 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 6\nOpen: Thursday to Sunday (7am to 2.30pm)Why visit? It’s a rare sighting these days, but this old-school wanton mee stall at Ang Mo Kio Central offers a bowl at just S$3! Hong Chong is a popular fixture in this area, for it’s known for its flavourful noodles, wallet-friendly prices and crispy pork lard.\xa0Rating: 5/5Our thoughts: The wanton noodles (S$3) were hearty enough for a meal. It’s a good bowl that features springy and flavourful noodles, alongside a smattering of well-marinated and delectable char siew. Its accompanying soup gets a thumbs up, too.266 Compassvale Bow\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (9.30am to 6pm)Why visit? Those staying in the Buangkok area would have probably heard of this stall. Not only has it garnered plenty of commendations from those living in the estate, this quaint stall actually attracts quite a number of foodies who come down just to try its Hong Kong-style noodles.\xa0Rating: 3/5Our thoughts: We found the noodles in the char siew wanton noodles (S$4.50) slightly chewy and thicker than usual, with a nice “QQ” texture. The char siew was well-marinated but slightly on the sweeter side. The star of the show? It had to be pleasantly sweet and juicy shui jiaos. Chomp Chomp Food Centre, 01-12, 20 Kensington Park Road\nOpen: Thursday to Tuesday (4.30pm to 12.30am)Why visit? Chomp Chomp is probably more known for decadent supper classics such as sambal stingray or oyster omelette. But did you know the popular hawker centre also houses one of the more well-known wanton mee in Singapore? Swee Heng Wanton Noodle is a go-to among residents here, who frequent it for the friendly service and comforting noodles that hit the spot.Rating: 4/5Our thoughts: We can safely say this is one of the better options on this list and will satisfy any wanton mee craving. The char siew is nice and smoky, while the noodles were perfectly cooked till they had that “QQ” bouncy texture. The sweet-savoury sauce rounds up the dish nicely.681 Hougang Avenue 4\nOpen: Thursday to Tuesday (7am to 2pm)Why visit? As Singaporeans, we always go where the queue is. In the case of Li Fatt Wanton Noodle, this under-the-radar stall is constantly plagued with long queues during peak hours, which means we had to try it for ourselves.Rating: 3.5/5Our thoughts: While we’re not sure whether it’s worth the queue, we do know that this stall serves up a pretty solid plate of wanton noodles (S$4) to satisfy any craving. The noodles were very springy and the char siew was lean, but still very tender.\xa0262 Serangoon Central Drive, 01-89\nOpen: Friday to Wednesday (7.30am to 6pm), Thursday (7.30pm to 2.30pm)Why visit? No, this isn’t in Chinatown. Located in a nondescript coffee shop, Noodle Delight Chinatown Famous Wanton Noodle is one of the more popular eateries in Serangoon Central. It helps that this stall is located just five minutes away from Nex, which makes it one of the more convenient spots for those living in the North-East to get their noodle fix.Rating: 3.5/5Our thoughts: Honestly, at S$3.50, there were no real faults to this stall’s rendition other than the dry char siew, which is rather common for the old-school style of Singapore wanton mee. Ultimately, the noodles were springy and the sauce was comfortingly nostalgic. There was even pork lard! Have it with its chilli for an extra kick.Amanda Lim, Denyse Chua, Fu Yao, Jacelyn Lee, Lynn Chua, Phyllis Leong, Shihan Chen, Victoria Bok, and Joy Fang contributed to this article.\xa0HungryGoWhere paid for its meals at these eateries.

It’s a tasty rice dish touting short-grain Nanatsuboshi rice, succulent and tender grilled pork loin slices imported from Japan, as well as a sweet and savoury butadon no tare (sauce). The dressing is the brand’s claim to fame — it is simmered for hours in an old-school cauldron to produce a rich and aromatic flavour.\xa0Price range: $$Crowd favourites: Savour the signature Obihiro Meibutsu Japanese Pork Loin Don (S$11.80 for regular, S$14.80 for large) and Obihiro Meibutsu Japanese Pork Belly Don (S$14.80) for an explosion of juicy, umami goodness with every bite.

It’s acclaimed for its loaded burgers that are chock-full of creamy scrambled eggs.\xa0Founded in 2011 by chef Alvin Cailan, the eatery initially started out as a humble food truck in Los Angeles. In the span of two years, his sandwiches gained immense popularity. The casual takeaway concept then launched its first brick-and-mortar location in New York.\xa0Today, the brand can be found across different parts of the globe, which span the likes of Japan, Korea and Singapore. The local outpost is brought in by SPC Group, a South Korean holding company that’s behind other big brands, such as Shake Shack and Paris Baguette. The Suntec City outlet is the brand’s second in Singapore.Price range: $$Crowd favourites: The most iconic item on the menu is its Fairfax sandwich (S$12). Comprising cage-free scrambled eggs, caramelised onions and a whole lotta cheddar cheese, it’s a dinner option that all will enjoy.

Suntec City Fountain Court, B1-170/171, 3 Temasek Boulevard\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (11am to 10pm)Why visit: Satiate your katsu cravings at Tonkatsu ENbiton, the purveyor of yuzu pork tonkatsu. The Japanese restaurant fries its cutlets to crisp perfection, resulting in a light, airy crumb that gives way to a tender body.\xa0For the uninitiated, yuzu pork refers to pigs bred in Kagoshima, Japan, which are fattened with feed containing yuzu fruits. This creates an excellent meat quality that’s richer in nutritional value, such as increased vitamin C, citric acid and fat with a higher melting point — thus leading to a better retention and amalgamation of flavours.\xa0Besides its renowned yuzu pork tonkatsu sets, this Suntec City dinner spot also offers a deluge of other Japanese dishes. Think an award-winning A4/A5 Miyazaki Gyukatsu (wagyu beef), sandos and ramen.\xa0Price range: $$\xa0Crowd favourites: Those who prefer a leaner cut of pork should opt for the signature yuzu hire katsu set (S$23). Despite lacking a soft layer of marbled fat, the fillet bursts with umami and is incredibly succulent. If you’re not feeling pork, the Kaisen Mix Fry set (S$25) will please with its decadent seafood fare, boasting Japanese oysters, prawns, scallops and more. Suntec City Tower 4, 01-651, 3 Temasek Boulevard\nOpen: Monday to Friday (11am to 10pm), Saturday and Sunday (10am to 10pm)Why visit: One of the stalwarts of affordable Japanese dining in Singapore is Hoshino Coffee, a speciality coffeehouse that has charmed the hearts of Singaporeans with its aromatic hand-drip brews and luscious souffle pancakes.\xa0Set foot into the restaurant, and it’s as if you’re transported into another land — the cosy joint is brimming with old-world charm, complete with a rustic setting, twinkling chandeliers and snazzy mahogany accents.\xa0The menu is a marriage of East meets West, with unique dishes incorporating both Japanese and Western flavours. You’ll be spoiled with the wide variety of mains available, which includes spaghetti, rice dishes and steak.\xa0Price range: $$Crowd favourites: The omu souffle curry rice (S$17.80) is our go-to order when we visit this joint.

Suntec City Tower 4, B1-107, 3 Temasek Boulevard\nOpen: Sunday to Thursday (11.30am to 10pm), Friday and Saturday (11.30am to 10.30pm)Why visit: For families seeking a wallet-friendly, all-you-can-eat Suntec City dinner option, consider heading to Dookki — an authentic Korean topokki buffet restaurant tucked away in the basement of the shopping mall.\xa0Its witty namesake translates to “two meals” in Korean, which ties in with its enticing concept of allowing diners to tuck into two types of dishes in one sitting Korean topokki hotpot and kimchi fried rice.\xa0Here, the hotpot is the main attraction, where you can customise your sauce alongside a host of toppings. You’re also entitled to 1.5 hours of complimentary drinks and unlimited ingredients, chiefly the crowd-favourite topokki. You then get to end the meal with a serving of hearty kimchi fried rice.Buffet prices here are unbeatable, as it only costs S$20.80++ per person for both weekdays and weekends. If you’re bringing a younger one along, the meal will set parents back at S$12.80++ per child between 110cm and 130cm.\xa0Price range: $$Crowd favourites: Definitely order the topokki, also fondly known as Korean rice cakes. They come in a slew of flavours, such as original, cheese and sweet potato. We suggest simmering the chewy morsels in the stock base, for it soaks up the savoury flavours of the rich broth perfectly. Suntec City Atrium (Convention Centre), 02-305, 3 Temasek Boulevard\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (11am to 10pm) Why visit: Originating in Japan, Tempura Makino is an acclaimed tempura speciality restaurant that crafts its crispy tempura “tsudoage-style”. This means that the tempura is made solely to order and served one by one.\xa0The dishes are prepared with premium ingredients, with the flour, dashi and dipping sauces specially imported from Japan. The batter of the tempura is also whipped with an Okinawan egg, which results in a light batter that has the right amount of airiness and crunch.Bonus: The eatery doles out free-flow homemade yuzu daikon to go with your meal.Price range: $$Crowd favourites: We like the prawn and vegetable tempura set (S$18), which introduces a medley of well-loved veggies such as butternut pumpkin, eggplant, Maitake mushrooms and others. Those who enjoy donburis should get the unadon (S$23.90), which has crispy grilled eel atop a fluffy bed of rice. \n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50% off at picturesque date spots, including Wildseed Cafe at The Alkaff Mansion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuntec City Fountain Court, B1-111, 3 Temasek Boulevard\nOpen: Monday to Friday (11.30am to 2pm, 5pm to 9pm), Saturday and Sunday (11.30am to 9pm)Why visit: Most will be familiar with Tai Er, a reputed establishment widely recognised for its Chinese sauerkraut fish. However, its sister brand, Beautiful Lai Grilled Fish (Lai Meili),\xa0 deserves equal recognition.While we’re no strangers to Chinese-style grilled fish dishes, what sets this Sichuan-style eatery apart from the rest is its signature green pepper grilled fish (from S$55). The drool-worthy platter features a tender and succulent Leiocassis fish as the base, which is sourced directly from the Yangtze River in China.\xa0The grilled fish is also prepared with freshly picked Sichuan pepper and peppercorns that elevate the flavours and robustness of the broths.

Each set also feeds up to three persons.\xa0Price range: $$$$Crowd favourites: Besides the green pepper grilled fish, there are options for a cheese tomato (S$58) and crab roe and garlic (S$58) flavour.

And Hokkaido restaurant Eat at Seven – Kuro Hanabi is a head-turner when it comes to hotpot dishes with a twist.\xa0It’s known for its popular motsunabe, a stew in Japanese cuisine touting wagyu beef innards. Fret not, the dish isn’t as scary as it sounds — instead, the inclusion of offal presents enhanced textures and savouriness to the broth.

Suntec City Fountain Court, B1-130, 3 Temasek Boulevard\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (11am to 3pm, 5pm to 9.30pm)Why visit: Pizzas are great for sharing, and it helps that they typically boast a generous sprinkling of flavour-packed toppings and are decadent, cheese-filled triangles.

Fried chicken, of course — and the famous Yardbird at MBS agrees, because it’s spicing things up in a big way until the end of October.Hailing from the US, Yardbird Southern Table and Bar is one of the most well-known restaurants in Singapore, especially for those seeking decadent and authentic American-style fried chicken.Yardbird is best known for its viral chicken & waffles dish, which is served with cubed watermelons at the side.Currently, the restaurant is celebrating its annual Fried Chicken Month.Running until Oct 29, the promo celebrates the brand’s iconic 100-year-old recipe with a medley of creative limited-time specials at S$38.It started off the first half of the month with a 27-hour brined Louisiana hot chicken with crumbled blue cheese and later, a chilli-lime fried chicken. It is presently serving the tangy mustard-based Carolina BBQ until Oct 22.For the final week, Yardbird at MBS is planning to finish the Fried Chicken Month with aplomb: We’re talking about the bodacious Reaper x Szechuan special that will be available from Oct 23 to Oct 29.The limited-time special will feature Yardbird’s special concoction of smoked Carolina Reaper and Szechuan pepper, alongside fried ginger and spring onion.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTWG Tea turns 15: Savour luxurious three-course anniversary menus from S$58\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTexas Chicken now 24/7 in Singapore & launches two new breakfast burgers, available from 4am\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5 pieces for S$9.90: KFC’s popular Chicken Tuesday promo is back\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut this isn’t going to be just your run-of-the-mill spice combination.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/simei-kopitiam/:['It’s 11am, barely lunchtime in the quaint Simei neighbourhood, but there’s already a noticeable buzz around the new Simei Kopitiam Corner, which reopened on Sept 28, just yesterday.\xa0And for good reason.The newly revamped Kopitiam Corner outlet, located at 248 Simei Street 3, has reopened with several well-known and loved brands — including Hwa Heng Beef Noodle and Munchi Pancakes — much to the delight of east-siders.Arguably the most recognisable of the lot, Hwa Heng Beef Noodles branched out to Simei as the team realised that its current Jalan Besar outlet was slightly inaccessible for its predominantly elderly crowd.\xa0Its Jalan Besar outlet opened in 2022 after it closed at Ion Orchard’s Food Opera food court in 2017.\xa0Hwa Heng Beef Noodle’s new and second location at Simei’s Kopitiam Corner puts it right next to the nearest MRT station (Simei), making it convenient for any beef-loving aficionado to get their fix.\xa0As someone who grew up having the Hwa Heng Beef Noodle at its Scotts Square outlet, a bowl of its dry sliced beef noodles with beef balls (S$9.90) brought me right back to my childhood.Not much has changed about the taste — the robust thick brown sauce has the right amount of starchiness, coating the noodles perfectly, and while inflation may have caused prices to rise, the portions were still generous and hearty.\xa0While some might prefer chunkier slices of beef, I personally loved the generous amounts of thinly sliced beef buried within my noodle dish — ensuring that I could enjoy a side of beef with every mouthful of noodles.\xa0The soup — where do I even begin? It’s clear but packs a flavourful punch, and while you’ll definitely smell the beef, the soup has zero gameyness. The beef balls (five in a single serving), were bouncy yet dense and served as a good complement to the beef slices.\xa0If you love all things beef, there’s a promotion on its signature mixed beef noodle with tendon (S$9.90, U.P.: S$12) till the end of October.\xa0Other stalls with promotions include Hua Dee Hong Kong Roasted Delight, which is selling its three-flavoured chicken rice at S$1 each, limited to three packs per purchase. The stall hasn’t mentioned when this will end, but word has it that it’ll run till the end of this weekend.\xa0A post shared by HungryGoWhere (@hungrygowhere)There’s also Confirm + Chop, a Western food stall that is awarding you with one free fried chicken wing. Just place an order, have them repeat your order and then reply with the words “confirm plus chop” to receive the freebie.\xa0Munchi Pancakes, known for its fluffy classic and unique min jiang kuehs, had yet to open officially at Simei’s Kopitiam Corner as of Sept 29, but we’re sure with all the hype surrounding the space, it’ll open sooner rather than later.For more neighbourhood eats in the east, check out our guide to East Coast Lagoon Food Village and must-try hawker stalls in Tampines.\xa0Do explore the new GrabFood Dine-in service for awesome deals.\xa0You can also book a ride to Simei’s Kopitiam Corner.248 Simei Street 3, 01-136\nNearest MRT station: Simei\nOperating hours vary according to respective stores 248 Simei Street 3, 01-136\nNearest MRT station: Simei\nOperating hours vary according to respective stores AuthorSarah is constantly seeking out new coffee spots and cocktail bars around the world, and should probably drink more water while at it.© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/sodeng-korean-restaurant/:["When someone mentions “KBBQ,” the scene of a group of friends hanging out and grilling their own marinated beef, pork, or chicken meat comes to mind.\xa0But, duck? The novelty of experiencing duck prepared in this manner piqued my curiosity to investigate what Sodeng Korean Restaurant is all about. \xa0\xa0Sodeng opened its doors in June 2023, with a dedication to bring authentic Korean flavours to the overcrowded KBBQ scene. It imports unique banchan (korean side dishes) from an award winning kitchen in Korea.\xa0As for its unique protein offering, Sodeng sources its tender, fresh duck from Malaysia and serves it on the same day, given its delicate nature. We were told the duck is less fatty in Malaysia, and it has indeed impressed us with its freshness, juiciness, and the complete absence of any gaminess.We were seated towards the rear of the restaurant alongside two other groups in a cave-like space that was cosy and snug. The bright red tables provided a vibrant modern ambience to the setting.\xa0The comfortable atmosphere was further complemented by the well-trained service staff who provided useful pairing recommendations for meats with banchan. Bonus: They also performed theatrics while serving alcohol.\xa0Sodeng Korean Restaurant offers an entertaining, delicious and hassle-free Korean BBQ experience with quality food. We enjoyed every bit of our visit, from the unique duck offerings and the substantial and tender beef ribs, to the dedicated staff who were committed to making sure customers have a good time.\xa0We were already making plans for our next visit before we even left — we need to share this memorable dining experience in Sodeng with our other makan kakis. \xa0\xa0The fresh plain duck (S$35 per person), was served without any seasoning but garnished with chives, onions and Korean water celery, which is like our local kangkong. The waiter recommended that we start with duck paired with its house-salted peppercorns.\xa0The subdued spiciness and fragrant pepper notes accentuated the freshness of the duck without overpowering its natural sweetness.\xa0The next recommendation was duck accompanied by white kimchi, Korean herring and squid paste, alongside the familiar kangkong. The red pepper in the herring and squid paste were familiar flavours in Korean cuisine, and the saltiness and umami from the seafood and the clean, tart kimchi was a delightful interplay of flavours.The third and my personal favourite combination — one that truly won my heart — was the duck with perilla leaf and pickled daikon. It was refreshing and mild, but allowed each individual unique flavour to stand out while forming a cohesive partnership with the robust grilled duck.\xa0While the duck was already amazing, the standout dish of the night was the woo-dae galbi (S$42 per person), featuring a charcoal-grilled, 72-hour marinated prime rib. Each bite was a melt-in-your-mouth experience, with the perfect balance of beefy richness and caramelisation from the grill. It is a must-try.\xa0Only 30 servings are available daily, as the beef is marinated with natural ingredients and served at its peak condition at 72 hours. Any unconsumed beef will be thrown out after 96 hours, a testament to Sodeng Korean Restaurant’s quality standards, so be sure to secure your reservation in advance.\xa0The intense marination paid off, as the meat was oh-so-tender, while imparting a pleasant sweet note that was balanced by inherent beefy robustness of the galbi.\xa0We were once again provided options to pair the meat with, and this time, the suggestion was for us to try it with melted mozzarella cheese and sweet condensed milk. It is a curious interplay of sweet and salty flavours.\xa0The outcome wasn’t unpleasant, although it did slightly obscure the distinctive taste of the beef. Once again, the perilla leaf and daikon pairing was the winning combination for me.As the name suggests, the charcoal-grilled pork collar (S$27) was fired up on the grill before it’s served to us, then given a second round of cooking on the lid. The result is a toothsome meat filled with rich smokiness, also known as wok hey.Overall, every meat option was unique in its own distinctive profile and did not overshadow one another. If I had to rank, I would place beef in the top spot, followed by duck, and then pork, although I must emphasise that all of them were undeniably delicious.We loved that the staff did all the grilling for us, relieving us from the hassle of cooking. It also allowed us more time to keep the conversations going, and ensured we got the best flavours from the quality meat.\xa0The duck kimchi stew (S$17) was one of the richest soups I have ever tried. Made with homemade duck broth and enhanced by the aged kimchi, it was bursting with flavour and left me craving more.Concluding any KBBQ experience with bokkeumbap is a common tradition and the pot lid stir-fried rice (S$17) absorbed the flavours of the duck, pork, and beef we ordered, ensuring that nothing goes to waste.\xa0Any leftover pieces on the lid, together with egg, cheese, green onion, and seaweed, were combined, and made into a cute heart shape — a lovely end to a lovely meal.\xa0\xa0I struggled to find things to nitpick on, but of all the items we had, the spicy kimchi cold noodles (S$17) was the least memorable. It was a refreshing palate cleanser with al dente noodles and a balanced kimchi flavour, but when put alongside all the other dishes that delivered robust flavours, this dish naturally fell by the wayside.\xa0Also, the pricing is slightly on the higher end, and the duck portions may not be enough for bigger eaters.\xa0Is it conducive to conversation? Yes.Is a reservation necessary? Recommended.How to get there? It is a short walk from Telok Ayer MRT stationHungryGoWhere paid for its meal at this restaurant for this review. Still hungry?

Hence, it’s no surprise that her bakes are a feast for both the eyes and the palate.Its signature entremet — The Beehive (S$15)\xa0— is modelled after one. It comprises a jelly made of lemon, thyme and lychee, lemon sponge, honey parfait and yuzu mousse.Meanwhile, if you’re looking for something on the sweeter end, we recommend Pink Guava & Pear (S$12). The best fruit duo, the two fruits are transformed into pink guava cream and jelly, cubed fresh pears, and elderflower liqueur pear mousse. It’s fruity, light, and one portion is simply not enough.Click\xa0here\xa0to read our full review.Tigerlily PatisserieLocation:\xa0350 Joo Chiat Road\nTel: 8887 0988\nOpening hours:\xa0\nMonday: Closed\nTue-Sun: 9am-5pmA literal hole-in-the-wall, Kohi Roasters & Coffee Bar hails from Indonesia (despite being named after the Japanese translatoin for coffee).On the hopper, its self-roasted Aka Blend underscores a juicy acidity, with a syrupy finish.An espresso-based\xa0coffee starts from S$4 for an espresso, and we recommend an iced black (S$7) for this blend.For a more unique drink, its kohito (S$7.50)\xa0might be more satisfying instead — a refreshing iced black topped with milk and mint.Kohi Roastery & Coffee BarLocation:\xa0283 Joo Chiat Road\nOpening hours:\xa08am-6pmYou might be tempted to go straight for its signature kouign amann (I wouldn’t blame you), but you might want to try some dishes that are exclusive to Crane Road.Indulge in a hearty\xa0Breakfast Croffle (S$22). An airy and crispy\xa0croffle, and one of the best I’ve had, it’s paired with candied bacon, portobello mushroom, a fried egg, and a robust herb ranch sauce.For something less “brunch-y”, and more “lunch-y”, the croffle also comes as a Pull My Pork Croffle (S$22)\xa0—\xa0topped with Mexican pulled pork, pickled jalapeño, avocado, sour cream, and coriander.Click\xa0here\xa0to read our full review.Tiong Bahru BakeryLocation:\xa07 Crane Road\nOpening hours:\xa07.30am-8pmHere’s a local roaster that isn’t all about the coffee.Kings Cart Coffee Factory also serves a selection of hearty brunch dishes such as the classic\xa0Bacon Eggs Benedict (S$21) and Asian-inspired pastas such as the Mentaiko Carbonara (S$23)\xa0and\xa0Tom Yum Goong (S$24).Its self-roasted house blend, which is low in acidity and chocolatey, can also be experienced in interesting forms of coffee. Deviating from the typical espresso-based coffee, Kings Cart Coffee Factory provides an array of interesting drinks, such as the signature Coconut Latte ($S9), topped with coconut cream and gula melaka, and the\xa0Figs & Peach (S$9), sweetened with peach-infused concentrate and fresh figs.Kings Cart Coffee FactoryLocation:\xa0328 Joo Chiat Road, 01-05\nTel: 8814 8445\nOpening hours:\xa09am-6pmThe\xa0ice-cream\xa0store that everyone knows and loves, Apiary has opened an outlet in the east!The quaint ice cream shop, which features a selection of homemade ice cream and waffles, is most well known for its Sicilian Pistachio — intensely nutty, slightly astringent. But, the Blue Milk, which is a milk-flavoured ice cream dyed with blue pea flower, as well as the Hojicha, are also highly-acclaimed.A single scoop costs S$4.20, while premium flavours such as the Sicilian Pistachio costs S$5.50.ApiaryLocation:\xa081 Joo Chiat Road, 01-01\nTel: 6980 6979\nOpening hours:\xa012-9pmJoo Chiat is home to the most famous kouign amann, entremets and pistachio ice cream.

Featuring an airy matcha chiffon, it’s light in terms of flavour and texture, a stark contrast to the creamy and bittersweet matcha ganache.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/gyutan-tan-orchard/:['Has the unusual thought of “I wonder what cow’s tongue tastes like” ever occurred to you? Because if you did, you might want to pay a visit to Gyutan-Tan’s newest Orchard outpost.Some people might not know this but beef tongue, or gyutan, is considered a delicacy in Japanese cuisine — usually grilled up yakiniku style.As with most off-cuts, it’s not a common order, even at the more authentic izakayas in Singapore. But those who are in the know are well aware of how delectable good beef tongue can be.Created to spread a love for beef tongue to the masses, Gyutan-Tan is a unique concept that specialises in the less-seen dish.\xa0It originally opened in Tanjong Pagar late last year, but Gyutan-Tan can now also be found in Orchard, too, with the recent opening of a second outlet at Ngee Ann City.Diners can expect the same beef tongue specials but with some brand-new outlet-exclusives, including a dainty afternoon tea set!The menu at Gyutan-Tan’s Orchard outlet will feature a few exclusives.\xa0For those new to beef tongue, we recommend trying out the Combo Gyutan (S$30).Featuring a medley of charcoal-grilled premium- and regular-cut beef tongue, you can get the best taste and texture, straight from the charcoal grill.Each sliver of tongue is lusciously grilled and rich in beefy umami while sporting a delicate bounce; the premium cuts also come punctuated with luxurious fattiness that adds more oomph.Besides the meat, Gyutan-Tan also provides you with a choice of homemade sauce (original, ponzu Oroshi, Korean, negi shio or lemon pepper) and an array of accompanying palate cleansers to cut through the heaviness. Said palate cleansers include pickles, light soup and tororo — a pile of sticky, grated yam that is clean and mild in flavour — that pairs well with the rice.Though if straight beef tongue doesn’t quite appeal to you, the outlet-exclusive Gyutan-Tan don set (S$26) is a good alternative: The Japanese rice bowl comes with braised beef tongue that is mixed in with tender slices of shabu beef.If you’re craving something very heavy and saucy, the Gyutan curry (S$26), another outlet exclusive, is an equally reliable choice, featuring braised beef tongue drenched in a pool of Japanese curry.That said, even though the flavourful curry helps mellow out the more intense, beefy taste of the braised tongue, we found the curry slightly too salty and can be jelak.It’s not all just beef tongue, though.A new Orchard-only addition to Gyutan-Tan’s menu is its afternoon tea, which runs from 3pm to 5.30pm.It’s great for those looking for a chill, Japanese-inspired high tea sesh while shopping in the area.The highlight is an afternoon tea set (S$42 for two) that features a wooden serving tray loaded up with goodies, including Japanese-style desserts such as fruit sandos and savouries such as the mini gyutan sliders.Other than that, the afternoon tea menu also includes another interesting addition: A matcha fondue (S$20) served with fruits and confectioneries.The components are meant to be dunked into a pot of silky matcha white chocolate until they’re coated in the sweet treat. The mochi and sponge cake were our favourites, especially the cake, which soaks up the matcha flavour very well.During afternoon tea hours, the menu will also feature the entire selection of desserts and a few select snacks from the regular menu, as well as a tea-time exclusive: Sandos.The sandos are kept simple but hearty with options such as roasted gyutan and caramelised onion sando (S$16), as well as an affordable teriyaki chicken sando (S$10) which comes with a succulent grilled chicken thigh — pretty good value for the price.For more ideas on what to eat, read our stories on must-try Japanese buffets in town and the only wanton mee guide you need, with 30 stalls tasted and rated.Gyutan-Tan is on the GrabFood delivery service and offers free delivery (up to S$3 off) with GrabUnlimited.\xa0Do explore the new GrabFood Dine-in service for awesome deals.You can also book a ride to Gyutan-Tan’s new Orchard outlet at Ngee Ann City for an afternoon tea sesh.

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/fishball-noodles/:['Nestled in the heart of Singapore’s vibrant culinary landscape lies a humble yet irresistible delight: Fishball noodles. To the uninitiated, it may seem like a simple dish, just fishballs swimming in broth, accompanied by different types of noodles.\xa0But the Singaporean foodie knows that crafting the perfect bowl of fishball noodles is an art, requiring a symphony of flavours and textures that are tricky to balance.So, what makes an unassuming dish of fishball noodles such an obsession for Singaporeans?Well, apart from being the everyman’s dish, it packs a punch at an affordable price and is also highly customisable.\xa0You can have your fishball noodles dry, or with soup, and tap into a wide selection of noodles from mee kia and mee pok to yellow noodles, kway teow and even bee tai mak and bee hoon.No matter what your preference is, fishball noodles are the quintessential Singaporean comfort food.

Each dumpling is painstakingly hand-rolled by Mr Chua using fish meat and tapioca flour, and daintily folded to look like ingots.\xa0Made from a chewy fish paste skin lined with juicy minced pork on the inside, the dumplings come as a savoury treat that elevate your bowl of fishball noodles.\xa0Toa Payoh Kopitiam, 01-523, 125 Lorong 1 Toa Payoh, 01-523\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (7.30am to 7.30pm)Tampines North Kopitiam, 01-02,\xa0 610 Tampines North Drive 1\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (7.30am to 7.30pm)Why visit? Married couple Jeevan Ananthan, and his wife, May Leena Krishnan, quit their corporate jobs as an investment banker and digital marketer respectively to start Lina Fishball Noodle in August 2019.\xa0While the stall initially garnered skepticism for being run by a young Indian and Indian-Chinese couple, its delicious fishball noodles and bak chor mee, complete with housemade fish dumplings and fishballs, has since garnered a hoard of regular patrons.Lina Fishball Noodle has come a long way, weathering the pandemic, relocating to a bigger stall in Toa Payoh Kopitiam, and even setting up a central kitchen. In August 2022, it opened a second outlet in a Kopitiam outlet in Tampines North.Price range: $Crowd favourites: While the stall has added other items to its menu, including laksa and chicken cutlet noodles, its signature bowl of fishball noodles (S$5.50), complete with housemade fish dumplings and fishballs, is the highlight here.Do note that costs are higher at its new Tampines outlet, so you should expect to pay an average of S$0.50 more per bowl, compared to the Toa Payoh outlet.\xa0West Coast Market Square, 01-152, Blk 726 Clementi West Street 2\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (5am to 9.30am)Why visit?

Since the store only opens early in the morning, the soup noodles (S$4) would be our recommendation for a hearty meal that keeps you full until lunch.\xa0But be prepared to wait for up to 20 minutes, as snaking queues are common even in the wee hours of the morning when the stall opens at 5am.\xa059 Mei Chin Road, 02-38\nOpen: Sunday to Thursday (7am to 2pm)Why visit?

Taking the reins over from his father, Mr Goh and his wife, Mdm Keo have been in the business for 37 years, using the same Teochew-style bak chor mee recipe that Mr Goh’s father had spent 50 years perfecting.The owners believe in using fresh ingredients, so it’s no wonder their bowls of noodles are so highly sought after. Furthermore, even as Singapore’s inflation rate skyrockets, the couple have kept their prices very affordable, with everything at their stall, from fishball noodles to laksa, starting at S$3.50 per bowl.\xa0Price range: $Crowd favourites: The dry meepok fishball noodles (from S$3.50) are a highlight here, with the lard and chilli made in-house.

Ah Hua Teochew Fishball Noodle is founded by Lim Jia Hua, fondly known as uncle Ah Hua, who is an experienced noodle and fishball maker. Featuring handmade fish dumplings and homemade traditional fishball noodles made from a recipe by Uncle Ah Hua’s father, each bowl is authentic and deliciously old-school.When business got tough a few years ago, Uncle Ah Hua’s daughter, Jean Lim, stepped in to help run the stall and work on marketing efforts. The father-daughter duo have since injected some spunk into their menu, with their traditional noodles now being served alongside trendier items, such as mentaiko balls and fried prawn rolls.Price range: $Crowd favourites: Ah Hua’s homemade Fuzhou fishball with rice noodles (S$6) may look simple, but it packs a punch, bursting with flavour from the tender minced meat, her giao (fish dumplings), and fish rolls wrapped around carrot and cucumber. For an authentic experience of Teochew noodles, skip the soy sauce to savour the nuanced flavours, and add a bit of bird’s eye chilli for that extra zest.And whether you have the signature noodles dry or with soup, the fried prawn rolls are a must-try at this stall, though they are on the pricier side, at S$10 for eight pieces.\xa0Cheng San Centre, 01-2495, 532 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 10\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (8am to 8pm)Why visit? One of the few fishball noodle stalls that are halal-certified, Top 73+1 Fishball Legacy has been around for eight years, having grown into a hotspot for the Muslim community to get their halal fishball noodle fix.\xa0Its founder, Mr Tang, had learned the traditional way of making fishball noodles from his father, who learnt it from a 73-year-old hawker way back (hence the name of the stall). But beyond the typical Chinese audience, Mr Tang wanted to share the taste of his cooking with many beyond his culture and was hence inspired to open a halal-certified eatery.Price range: $Crowd favourites: Handmade and scooped using the traditional hand-and-spoon method, Top 73+1 Legacy’s fishballs are recognisable for their extra large size. They are also perfectly QQ and bouncy to the bite. Its fishball noodles (S$5) are a must-try, for the\xa0 tender XL fishballs are second to none. We recommend that you opt for dry noodles because the flavourful soup will be served on the side.\xa0Ghim Moh Market & Food Centre, 01-36, Block 20 Ghim Moh Road\nOpen: Friday to Wednesday (6am to 11am)Why visit? If the perfect fishball is on your foodie bucket list, you have to check out Thye Hong Handmade Fishball Noodle. Yet another time-honoured brand, Thye Hong’s fishball noodles has been satisfying its patrons at Ghim Moh Market and Food Centre since 1977.\xa0The stall’s founder, Wee Pong Sai, used to run the stall with his brother before the latter retired. Wee starts each day at 5am, mincing fresh fish and mixing it with flour before moulding them by hand into fishballs and fishcakes. Unlike most stalls that fry their fishcakes, Thye Hong slices and boils them, allowing them to tenderly burst with a subtle sweetness under its light salty taste.Price range: $Crowd favourites: Thye Hong is a stall that does the traditional bowl of dry mee pok (S$4) really well. The noodles are cooked to perfection, and are flavourful and springy. They are served with a generous amount of lard oil, crunchy pork lard and chilli, accompanied by a light soup with handmade fishballs and fishcakes. Early birds might want to hit the stall early as the fishballs usually sell out before 10am.\xa0Mei Ling Market and Food Centre, 02-05, 159 Mei Ling Street\nOpen: Friday to Wednesday (5.45am to 3pm)Why visit?: Located in the same food centre as Hup Kee Teochew Fishball Noodles, Xin Lu Teochew Fishball Noodle boasts a strong customer base from its 50 years of history. Apart from being a frequent feature in television documentaries and food blogs, this humble stall is well-known for its flavourful old-school rendition, catering to those with a stronger palate.Its soup is the star of the dish, garnished with a generous amount of tung choy (preserved water spinach). The smooth and bouncy fishballs are the perfect complement, soaking up the deeper flavours of the broth.Price range: $Crowd favourites: To get the best of both worlds, order the dry noodles (S$4.50) to enjoy the savoury flavours of the stall’s sauce, which carefully balances a mix of chilli, lard and vinegar for a multidimensional mouthfeel. Enjoy its special homemade chilli sauce that introduces a tangy, refreshing kick to the dish. The soup on the side comes with five fishballs — a generous amount given its price tag.\xa0\xa0Amoy Street Food Centre, 01-14, 7 Maxwell Road\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (7am to 3pm)Why visit? Started in 1958 by Ah Ter’s dad, Ah Ter Teochew Fishball Noodles is now run by the third generation, Gilbert Lim, who gave up his previous job as a trader to take over the reins from his father, Ah Ter. Lim has been running the business for more than 20 years now.Fun fact: Gilbert was voted the Most Handsome Hawker in 2005 by The Straits Times! But his looks are not the focus here — the food he makes is the main attraction, and with good reason.Price range: $Crowd favourites: A signature bowl of soup noodles starts at S$6, but we recommend going for the S$8 portion for your money’s worth of soup and an additional side of two prawns and extra meat. There is also a S$10 large-sized portion for big-eaters out there.Foodies on a quest for the perfect fishball noodles should know that Ah Ter’s handmade fishballs are a standout, thanks to their smooth and bouncy texture. The noodles boast a nice springy texture and are topped with ground pork, pork liver slices, seaweed and pork rinds. The broth is rich in its gutsy flavour, from being simmered with pork ribs for hours.\xa0Maxwell Food Centre, 01-26, 1 Kadayanallur Street\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (7am to 4.30pm), Saturday (7am to 3 pm)\xa0Why visit? The grandson of Ah Ter Fishball Noodles, 22-year-old Marvin Khan, trained for a year at his grandfather’s stall before opening his new business, Hock Lai Seng Fishball Noodles at Maxwell Food Centre earlier this year.Just like those who came before him, Khan uses only the freshest ingredients and goes the extra mile to perfect each bowl of noodles. For starters, the tasty soup is cooked with pork bones for at least four hours a day, creating a concentrated broth.\xa0Rather than blanching the noodles in hot water, he tosses the noodles in the rich broth, allowing it to soak in its essence while retaining their chewiness. Dry noodles are also tossed in a unique sauce blend of vinegar, sambal, ketchup and mushroom braising sauce, and crispy pork lard is added to give a crunchy texture to each mouthful.Price range: $Crowd favourites: With such high expectations from the stall’s passionate chef, it’s no surprise that each bowl of noodles is an all-around winner. Customers get to choose from eight types of noodles in either S$4.50 or S$6 portions.\xa0While it does sit on the pricier side, it is worth the indulgence, as each bowl comes with generous toppings of fishballs, sliced fishcakes, meatballs, prawns, and pork and liver slices that elevate the dish. In fact, we recommend adding on another S$2 to get an upsized portion with two larger ang kar (red leg) prawns.\xa0Bugis Junction, 01-71/72, 200 Victoria Street\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (8am to 8pm)Why visit? Opened in 2021, 25-year-old Douglas Ng started Fishball Story at Golden Mile Complex to sell fishball noodles using his grandmother’s recipe. The stall has since moved several times, first to the modern hipster hawker centre Timbre+, and later to NUS and Geylang before settling down in Bugis Junction.Despite having moved around quite a bit, Fishball Story has managed to maintain its standard, churning out solid bowls of fishball noodles and winning over customers wherever it has moved to.\xa0The fishballs, and the chilli-scallion-studded slices of fishcake, are housemade, with a uniquely light grey and rough-hewn texture on the outside, while maintaining a delightful QQ texture to the bite. The noodles are also accompanied by robust seasoning and crispy cubes of lard to munch on.\xa0Price range: $Crowd favourites: Try the premium fishball noodles (S$6.90), where you get to sample a mushroom ball, prawn ball, fishball and fish dumpling in a single bowl.Looking for more hawker eats?

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/cheap-kopi-singapore/:['Is it still possible to find cheap kopi in Singapore? We love kopi for its affordability and potency as a perk-me-up, but truly, cheap kopi has become a scarcity.“The fishball noodles used to cost 50 cents only.” Many of us have heard this — and its countless variations — all-too-often while growing up. There’s no doubt that Singapore’s many hawker dishes have always provided some of the best price-to-quality tastiness in the country.\xa0Alas, the number of affordable hawker stalls has started to dwindle with time and modernisation. Even those nostalgic cups of Milo and affordable kopi at drink stalls have become victims of rising costs. Being suckers for affordable food though, we couldn’t help but embark on a mission to find coffee stalls across Singapore that still serve affordable kopi.After taking in recommendations from our followers and friends, we’ve found these seven hawker spots in Singapore that still readily serve cheap kopi or teh at one dollar or below.3 Yung Sheng Road\nOpen: Hours vary for different stallsWhy visit? Taman Jurong is probably one of the most beloved hawker haunts in the West. It’s known for being a treasure trove of hidden gems including Michelin Guide-approved stalls such as Feng Zhen Lor Mee and Tai Seng Fish Soup.And now, the cherry on top: It’s one of the few hawker spots left serving good and affordable kopi at just 80 cents a pop!Price range: $What we had: Caffeine fiends would no doubt relish in the value of the kopi (80 cents) from Nam Hong Coffee Stall. Not only does the fragrant cuppa cost less than a dollar, the stall is also rather generous with the portion.To pair with it, we grabbed a bowl of fishball noodles (S$4) from Leng Huat Fishball Noodle. Bouncy fishballs and fragrant soup — just an old-school comfort.Blk 48 Tanglin Halt Road\nOpen: Hours vary for different stallsWhy visit? Another old-school icon that had mostly gone under the radar until recent developments, which sees it destined for demolition in 2024.Besides a plethora of old-school favourites such as Wei Yi Laksa and a legendary min jiang kueh stall, you can also get affordable kopi and other drinks here.Price range: $What we had: Instead of kopi, we opted for a cup of classic, no-frills teh-O from Wang Wang Coffee House for just S$1.Apart from the teh-O, we also scored a bowl of dry signature Teochew noodles (S$4.50) from Lao Cai Shi Rou Song Mian. It was simple, homely and loaded with ingredients — though could use a touch more richness.6 Jalan Bukit Merah\nOpen: Hours vary for different stallsWhy visit? If there’s one hawker centre everyone needs to visit in the southwest of Singapore, it’s ABC Brickworks Market & Food Centre, located just down the road from IKEA Alexandra.\xa0Those who have visited know the Bukit Merah mainstay to be a food haven chock-full of goodies, which range from western-food maestro Wow Wow West to traditional-dessert darling Jin Jin Dessert.Price range: $What we had: For that old-school taste, the popular Hylam Street Old Coffee gives you the best bang for your buck. S$1 for a robust cup of kopi? Now that’s a cheap kopi.As if that wasn’t enough to invigorate us, we also decided to nourish ourselves with the black herbal chicken soup (S$6) from Ah Er Lao Huo Tang, a crowd favourite known for its traditional Chinese soups.It turned out to be a great decision since the flavourful and wholesome soup proved to be the perfect counter for the rainy weather.11 Telok Blangah Crescent\nOpen: Hours vary for different stallsWhy visit? Mostly frequented by the residents and those working in the area, Telok Blangah Crescent Market & Food Centre is a bustling enclave in the south of Singapore.Besides playing host to some of Singapore’s most beloved cult favourites — including Hai Kee Char Kway Teow, known as one of the best in Singapore — it also houses one of the most affordable kopi stalls you can find in Singapore.Price range: $What we had: As mentioned before, Hock Guan Drink Stall probably sells one of the most affordable kopi around, with options generally under S$1, depending on your drink order. Fragrant and nicely sweet — this was our favourite cuppa throughout the search and cost us 90 cents.Our accompanying dish was the mee hoon kway (S$5) from Jiak Song Mee Hoon Kway. Rather than the usual silky delight, the handmade noodles came with a unique tinge of wok hei and is also supplemented by a generous glut of ingredients.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Junction Westgate opening with promos; will house 23 tenants, including new halal teppanyaki\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHawker Hustlers: Hipster hawker Ray Yeo of Bei-Ing Dimsum Club on reinventing dim sum and his love for all things Japan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n56 Jln Benaan Kapal\nOpen: Hours vary for different stallsWhy visit? Candidly, if you asked us if we’ve been to Jalan Benaan Kapal Food Centre before this, the answer is a resounding “no”. That’s how big of a hidden gem this sequestered compound is.\nThe “ulu” hawker centre is decidedly rustic and is chiefly patronised by regulars due to being in a rather under-ventured part of Kallang near the Singapore Indoor Stadium. Despite its relative inaccessibility, it is also the long-time location of one of Singapore’s best affordable kopi establishments.Price range: $What we had: A large number of newcomers who make the voyage down to Jalan Benaan Kapal Food Centre do it for one tenant in particular: Kang Siang Coffee Stall.\xa0The stall has been in operation for over five decades but endeavours to keep prices low for its greying regulars — a cup of aromatic kopi costs just 90 cents and is made with plenty of heart from the genial owners.58 New Upper Changi Road\nOpen: Hours vary for different stallsWhy visit? When talking about Bedok food destinations, most people generally focus on the bustling Bedok Interchange Hawker Centre or well-known supper hotspot, Bedok 85 Market.\xa0But a lucky typo on the digits would lead you to yet another classic Bedok hawker mainstay: The Marketplace @ 58. This underrated spot is located to the far east of Bedok and serves both residents in its estate as well as those who stay in the neighbouring Tanah Merah.Price range: $What we had: There isn’t much to elaborate on the cheap kopi we got from Jom Minum but for S$1, the fuss-free kopi-O is more than adequate to soothe your caffeine cravings.Of course, a visit to The Marketplace @ 58 couldn’t do without a bowl of the hearty lor mee (S$4) from Jia Cheng Lor Mee, one of our favourites in the east.\xa0Nothing quite like some braised gravy and a slew of fishcakes, braised lean meat, egg, and golden crunchy bits for the most sinfully tasty lunch.608A Tampines North Drive 1\nOpen: Hours vary for different stallsWhy visit? Tampines GreenWeave is a surprising addition to this list, which is mostly filled with old-school establishments within mature estates.\xa0Normally, you’d be hard-pressed to find truly affordable food options in swanky new BTO estates but as fate has it, Tampines GreenWeave surprisingly offers the most affordable option out of all the cheap kopi entries in this curation!Price range: $What we had: The unnamed drinks stall here doesn’t do anything flashy but at 70 cents for a solid dose of kopi-O, there should be very few complaints.To cap off our visit, we got ourselves a sambal fried rice with egg ($7) from Mini Wok. This is one for the chilli lovers: Its sambal sported the right amount of spice and the ratio of ingredients was great, yielding mouthfuls filled with goodies for a shiok experience.Lynn Chua contributed to this article.For more ideas on what to eat, read our stories on the best eats found at the ever-bustling Tanjong Pagar and which cool new openings in Singapore you need to check out in the month of September.Taman Jurong Food Centre and ABC Brickworks Market & Food Centre are on the GrabFood delivery service and offer free delivery (up to S$3 off) with GrabUnlimited.\xa0You can also book a ride to the hawker locations mentioned in the article for a cup of affordable kopi or teh.Do explore the new GrabFood Dine-in service for awesome deals.AuthorEvan started off writing about food on Instagram, before joining outlets such as Buro and Confirm Good to pursue his passion.

However, you can differ based on your preference of meat texture — the rosu katsu set (S$23), for instance, uses a fattier pork loin, while the hire katsu set (S$23), uses a leaner pork fillet.\xa0Shaw Centre, 02-05/06/07, 1 Scotts Road\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (11am to 9pm)Why visit? A meal at three-Michelin-starred Les Amis, one of Orchard’s most prestigious restaurants, isn’t cheap.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/cafes-singapore-commentary/:['I remember when the third wave coffee movement landed on our sandy shores, fresh off the hands of Melbourne’s uber cool, well-dressed baristas.\xa0In just a few years, Singaporeans were inundated with pretty-looking coffee shops with the obligatory Kinfolk magazine on the tables. Getting your cup o’ joe, brewed from single-origin beans, became less of a chore and more a well-documented activity.For many, including myself, checking out the different cafes in Singapore on the weekends turned into a hobby. It felt like a rite of passage as a young adult to dive into a book while sipping on a drink or catching up with friends as we tucked into our smoked salmon eggs benedict — an extravagant pair of wobbly poached eggs under a blanket of pastel yellow hollandaise sauce.\xa0Brunch was all the rage and it seemed as though we couldn’t get enough of elaborately decorated French toast, sourdough smeared with butter, scrambled eggs, and limp spinach leaves. It was an occasion to dress up for, whether or not you posed for photographs. Not to mention travelling to Melbourne just to do the same.\xa0At the time, it didn’t matter if the cafe food in Singapore wasn’t up to the mark. We were well aware that we visited these cafes for the aesthetic. It was all primarily for the ’gram.Still, it didn’t take long for the novelty to wear off. It didn’t help that the quality of brunch food in Australia seemed miles better than what we could get here. After multiple instances of mediocre-standard French toasts and breakfast eggs at the cost of S$20 and upward, I put my foot down and decided that enough is enough.\xa0\xa0Truth is, apart from the well-dressed interiors, decently attractive wait staff, and trendy music, cafe food is nothing to shout about. Heck, I could make the same at home with the right ingredients (except for poached eggs, which I have yet to master).\xa0While there are cafes that have discovered their niche in the market, the majority kept on dishing out the same food with the occasional edible flower garnish. It quickly grew repetitive. Much like the vendors at the pasar malam or night markets, it became commonplace to find the same options over and over again.\xa0And, I get it. Why reinvent the wheel? Although I had stopped patronising cafes, many still did (and still do). You’ll be hard pressed to find a seat on the weekends, the time of the week when many cafes are packed with diners waiting for their artfully topped latte and artisanal sourdough sandwich.\xa0And god forbid that you accidentally walk in the way of an Instagram influencer taking their preened shot.\xa0I fear for the jaded consumer (like me), variations of the same dish of an inconsistent quality just don’t cut it anymore. We want something new and exciting; dishes that show they’ve had some creative thought put into them and not a regurgitation of what already exists.\xa0Cafes offering the staples (good coffee and baked goods easy for a grab and go) may have found a following, typically comprising people who live in the area nearby. Those that depend on novelty, however, would need to find ways to keep customers coming back. Cue the seasonal rotation of Chinese New Year or Christmas pastries.\xa0Still, I wonder how many cafes can last in the long run, especially against our local tradition of the kopitiam and kaya toast. It’s a uniquely Singaporean morning experience to head down to the neighbourhood coffee shop, wait for the soft boiled eggs to cook (a fun gamble of guess-timation) before cracking them open into shallow saucers — all this while sitting among a group of old men furiously huffing on their morning cigarette.\xa0Trust me, ask any Singaporean who has immigrated abroad and you’ll find that kaya is a rare commodity they might do anything to get their hands on.\xa0In all my travels, I’ve found that no amount of avocado toast hits the spot compared to a hot mug of teh-O or Milo and the crunch of crisp browned thin slices of white bread coated with kaya. This is food that speaks to our soul, plus it doesn’t hurt that it won’t burn a hole in my wallet.\xa0My hope is that our younger generation falls in love with the fuss-free ways of the kopitiam amid the lure of the shiny and new. I hope that they, too, can romanticise the experience of traditional sock coffee, one without fancy ceramics or plateware but poured lovingly from well-worn hands.\xa0This isn’t to say that I’d never step foot into a cafe again. Life is made all the richer with variety and novel encounters. But until someone has the ingenuity to step out of tried-and-tested methods, I’ll be here waiting.\xa0Want more?

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/goodyear-seafood-village-tampines/:['Tucked away in a quiet corner of industrial Tampines lies GoodYear Seafood, a zi char and bak kut teh restaurant that’s been around for 17 years.At its helm is Geraldine Peh, its 28-year-old lady boss and second-generation owner.Despite her young age, she’s seen the business through some of its worst times, including the all-too-recent Covid-19 pandemic, which struck in early 2020.\xa0As we know, many businesses — especially those in the F&B industry — saw a drastic decline in sales. Most eateries experienced difficulties making ends meet — with some even on the brink of closure.\xa0“During Covid-19, I made less than S$50 in sales a day,” recalls Peh. On some days, the eatery only made S$10. “Whatever I managed to earn, it all went back into the business.”\xa0She grappled with paying her employees’ monthly salaries while having to foot the escalating costs of ingredients, bills and worker levies.\xa0She had also refused to mark up the prices at the restaurant in order to keep prices affordable for her regulars.\xa0Despite the setbacks that Peh encountered during the pandemic, she remained optimistic throughout.\xa0Sure, there were many times when she wanted to throw in the towel, but GoodYear Seafood Village is her father’s pride and joy — and she wanted to make him proud.Peh’s entrepreneurship journey began seven years ago when her father requested that she take over the family business. He had another business in heavy machinery and could no longer manage both ventures at once.\xa0So she shelved her dreams of opening a cafe, took up his offer and decided to keep her father’s business legacy alive — even if she had no prior experience managing a restaurant.Peh was only 21 years old when she took over the reins at GoodYear Seafood Village in Tampines.With a father who was passionate about cooking in the kitchen and a family business to inherit, you would think that Peh was trained in the culinary arts from a young age. On the contrary: Peh actually hails from the pastry industry.\xa0“I was always very interested in cakes,” says Peh. “I’ve wanted to be in the pastry line since I was young.”After graduating from secondary school, she attended The Shatec Institutes to learn the art of pastry-making. She also worked as a pastry chef in The St Regis Singapore hotel in 2012.\xa0On why she chose not to further her career as a patissier, Peh says: “When my dad needed me to take over his business, I thought: ‘Why not try something different?’”\xa0Moreover, she didn’t want to disappoint her father and was determined to carry on his work. But helming the restaurant was no easy feat.As a new business owner, Peh had her hands full familiarising herself with the daily operations, managing the accounts and getting to know her staff.Says Peh: “Coming in as a young girl, I was working with a lot of older people. There was much to change and I had to make the business better.”These are employees who have been around since her father’s management. To this day, they still work faithfully alongside Peh.“In the beginning, I was very scared,” she admits. “I was afraid that people would leave because it’s so hard to find good chefs and great waitstaff.”She also had to pick up cooking skills in the kitchen. “I had no culinary skills at all,” Peh laughs. “I had to watch YouTube and shadow our chefs to learn their cooking techniques.”\xa0Peh also brought in trendy recipes to attract new customers, namely crispy salted egg fish skin (from S$15).\xa0Peh counts among her proudest accomplishments learning how to cook Pontian bak kut teh (from S$7.80) from a family friend.For the uninitiated, Pontian-style bak kut teh comprises a robust herbal broth that’s simmered for three and a half hours.\xa0The family friend, who had worked at GoodYear for four years, taught Peh the ropes to making the dish from scratch. She then incorporated the beloved pork rib dish into the restaurant’s menu — now one of the eatery’s main draws.It took her two years before she got the hang of things. Armed with newfound confidence and experience, she was optimistic about the future of GoodYear Seafood Village. However, things hit a snag when Covid-19 hit more than three years ago.\xa0As you may recall, safe-distancing measures at that time prevented large groups from gathering together and at one point, dine-in was restricted, too.Zi char is all about communal dining and the lack of big groups eating in meant less revenue for GoodYear.At the height of the pandemic, food delivery and takeaway orders were the norm for F&B businesses. Often, Peh found herself having to make deliveries in person.She also turned to social media, reaching out to various influencers to promote the restaurant. Peh even handed out flyers to passersby.\xa0To add to Peh’s troubles, there was also a road closure outside GoodYear Seafood Village. The road was under construction, which made the restaurant incredibly inaccessible by car. There were also no nearby car parks or bus stops and customers gradually stopped returning.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Junction Westgate opening with promos; will house 23 tenants, including new halal teppanyaki\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50% off at picturesque date spots, including Wildseed Cafe at The Alkaff Mansion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Many people told me to close the business,” says Peh. “But it’s not just about shuttering the restaurant — I have to think about my staff who stayed with me all the way. How can I let them go during such a tough time?”\xa0It was another three years before the car park was reinstated — it opened again earlier this year in February.Since then, business has yet to pick up. Peh believes many of her former regulars have forgotten about the business or might have thought they have closed.To this day, hitting daily targets continues to be a struggle. Peh also hasn’t taken home any income in the past year and relies on her savings to fund the business and herself.\xa0But she has no intention of closing the restaurant. “It’s not an option for me to shutter the business,” she says, tearing up. “I don’t want to fail my parents and staff.”Amid such turbulent times, there are still plenty of happy moments that Peh holds on to fondly. For instance, she gets to celebrate significant occasions with her staff, such as their birthdays.\xa0“I’m with my staff almost every day as I try to be present,” Peh says, smiling. “You struggle, I struggle — through the good times and bad times.”\xa0Her employees are also her pillars of support — they constantly encourage her to persevere and never give up. Some loyal staff have stayed with Peh for more than six years. You’ll find Peh behind the stove, dishing up bak kut teh for her customers, while her head chef oversees the zi char menu at the restaurant.\xa0For zi char-style items, highlights include the assam fish head (S$28), golden garlic spiced pork (from S$20) and Chef’s Big Prawn Ying Yang (from S$13) — a unique combination of succulent prawns, fried bee hoon and hor fun.\xa0While these items may seem like run-of-the-mill zi char staples, Peh takes pride in ensuring each dish is prepared with quality ingredients. For example, GoodYear’s assam sauce is made from scratch every two weeks. Her customers sing praises of the savoury dressing, complimenting its “gao-ness” (thick consistency) and good mix of spice and tanginess.\xa0Recently, Peh has brought back the charcoal fish head steamboat (from S$28). If you’re popping by GoodYear Seafood Village at Tampines on the weekends, you’ll see her parents busy manning the charcoal in the kitchen. To best savour the dishes at the restaurant, Peh recommends dining at the al fresco area, which comes with a gorgeous outdoor view.\xa0These are the best seats in the house, with rustic, old-school kampung vibes. It’s a tranquil setting that’s hard to come by in our bustling concrete jungle.\xa0GoodYear Seafood Village is also pet-friendly, so feel free to bring along your furry friends to dine in with you. For now, Peh doesn’t have any plans to expand the menu further. Her main priority is to maintain the current standards of the dishes on the menu and attract a steady flow of customers.\xa0When asked if she had any words of advice for aspiring entrepreneurs, she encourages them to never give up. “If there’s a will, there’s a way,” she muses. “You’ll figure it out.”For more eastside eats, check out So Lemak or Oni Kimbap.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/magg-by-royz-et-vous/:["\xa0Here in Singapore, most of us are partial to a piping hot bowl of instant noodles as our go-to comfort meal. Simple, quick, yet wholly satisfying, it doesn’t get much better than that.\xa0Putting a creative spin on an already widely beloved food item might seem like quite the challenge, although that doesn’t faze newcomer Magg by Royz Et Vous. In fact, most of Magg by Royz Et Vous’ menu is Maggi-based, but with an elevated, fusion twist for that extra oomph.\xa0Needless to say, I was very much curious about this concept, so I decided I had to check this place out for myself.\xa0\xa0Magg by Royz Et Vous may have only opened its doors along Sultan Gate on Sept 18, but its owner, Widyanty Yusope, is no stranger to the local F&B scene. With Royz Et Vous, IndoBowl and The Pancake Place under her belt, it’s safe to say her halal food empire is going strong.\xa0The restaurant uses the iconic Maggi brand instant noodles in four flavours — curry, tom yum, chicken, and assam laksa — to whip up different versions of the dish in a variety of styles.\xa0These range from the Korean-inspired kimchi beef ribs (S$19.90) to Thai green curry chicken (S$12.90), Western-style chicken and cheese arrabbiata (S$15.90), and of course more local flavours such as Maggi goreng basah (S$18.90).If you’re dining in a group, the XXL Seafood or Meat and Chicken platters (S$159.90 each) come with a generous amount of meat or seafood and can feed a party of four to six.\xa0Sides, desserts and beverages are all part of the menu as well, so there’s a good variety of options to choose from.\xa0Honestly, I didn’t know what to expect before coming here. As someone who typically relies on Google reviews and word-of-mouth for food recommendations, there weren’t a lot of reviews online —\xa0this is a fledgling establishment after all.But when we were finishing our meal, I clearly remember thinking to myself: “I’m definitely coming back here to try the other dishes.” My companions were also very pleased with our dinner.\xa0Even though it seems steeply priced for Maggi noodles, the execution and food portions definitely made up for the mid-range prices, which ranged from S$12.90 to S$28.90 across all the main dishes, with the exception of the sharing platters. The restaurant itself is also very clean, spacious and comfortable, and I really like that the staff were friendly and attentive.\xa0A note for diners though — once the food arrives, you’ve got to start eating it straightaway because, as you know, when soaked in broth for too long, Maggi noodles will become soggy.\xa0\xa0We ordered three noodle dishes, all of which were executed very well. We had one of its signature dishes, the ayam bakar garlic white sauce (S$13.90), which was very unique in itself.\xa0Comprising a grilled chicken thigh, half an egg and Maggi noodles served in a creamy garlic broth, it was an explosion of flavour with every mouthful.The chicken was tender and well-seasoned in a milky broth, and care was put into how the food was presented. The Korean-style rabokki (S$26.90) was reminiscent of Korean army stew, and came with a decent amount of ingredients — tteokbokki (Korean rice cakes), Korean fishcakes, quail eggs, beef shabu slices, and cheese slices.\xa0It was flavourful and spicy enough, and the ingredients meshed well together. The beef slices were tender and the tteokbokki had just the right amount of bounce. We liked that the dish provided multi-textures with every bite.However we did wish there was just a little more beef and cheese (then again, this portion would be just right for two to three diners, and we were a party of four).\xa0My favourite had to be the tom yum cream (S$19.90). Even though it’s the priciest individual dish on the menu, it came with an incredibly generous amount of seafood.\xa0Unlike many seafood dishes, which can sometimes come with cheaper ingredients, this one had quality seafood. The squid, especially, was fantastic and cooked just right — it was firm and chewy, yet not tough.The tom yum soup had just the right amount of sourness to it, although it’s not as spicy as expected of a tom yum dish.\xa0We also ordered a side of white clams with dashi (S$8.90). This dish was well-executed, with the clams sufficiently seasoned and served in a delicious soup stock.\xa0The only thing that could have made it better was if there were some garlic in the dish for extra kick, but even then this was a great appetiser.\xa0\xa0\xa0Our entire party had Thai milk tea as it was such a hot evening, although we found it to be too sweet.\xa0For dessert, we went with the fried mantou with pandan custard (S$8.90). While the bright green pandan custard had a distinct pandan taste and wasn’t too sweet, it wasn’t as thick or creamy as we would have liked. The mantou, too, was somewhat underwhelming, and wasn’t crispy or light enough.\xa0Overall, we enjoyed our time there — although not blow-your-mind-amazing, we were pleased that Magg by Royz Et Vous delivered its key concept well without being pretentious or expensive. Coupled with good service, it was a very pleasant dining experience.Is it conducive to conversation? Yes, although it’s likely to get busy over the weekends given its central location near a tourist hotspot. Tables were comfortably spaced, with plush, clean seats.\xa0Is a reservation necessary? Not for now, especially since most diners don’t stay at the casual eatery for too long.How to get there? It’s a seven-minute walk from Nicoll Highway MRT station near Haji Lane.

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/omakase-singapore/:['Omakase in Singapore has earned a reputation among diners here for being as delicious as it is expensive. A Japanese phrase that means “I’ll leave it up to you”, omakase involves leaving your meal entirely in the hands of the chef.This Japanese culinary tradition promises a unique dining experience with the finest ingredients, meticulously prepared by a chef who’s skilled and pays attention to detail.\xa0Freshness is the linchpin of omakase. Many good omakase restaurants in Singapore fly their ingredients directly from Japan multiple times a week to guarantee they are fresh and tasty.\xa0But that’s only part of the puzzle. Only a skilful chef is able to use his creativity and artistry to elevate every component of the meal into a symphony of flavours.As a Singaporean foodie, who wouldn’t want to go on such a gastronomic journey that only a masterful chef can offer? Even better if it’s at low prices. If you’re on a hunt for a bargain, yet do not want to compromise on the experience, fret not — we’ve curated a list of 15 omakase experiences for you that are below S$100.Do note that most of these are lunch-only exclusives — unsurprisingly, that’s where you’d find the more affordable options. So gather up your colleagues one day and try one of these affordable Japanese omakases in Singapore.74 Duxton Road\nOpen: Monday to Saturday (12pm to 2.30pm, 6.30pm to 10.30pm)\xa0\xa0Why visit? Miyu’s kitchen is led by executive chef-owner, Chef Kwan, who has spent over 20 years perfecting the craft of Japanese cuisine. The restaurant sources its ingredients directly from Japan, based on seasonality, to bring the freshest ingredients to your table.\xa0The experience is priced from S$98 onwards. While it’s not the most affordable omakase in Singapore, you’re getting a bang for your buck here. Miyu’s most economical choice, Hana (S$98), consists of an appetiser, chawanmushi (Japanese steamed egg), 10 pieces of premium sushi, a mini chirashi rice bowl, the chef’s signature roll, tamago, miso soup and dessert.\xa0Price range: $$$Crowd favourites: Those on a tighter budget or a smaller stomach can opt for its set lunch or sharing menu. Try the toro taku maki (Japanese bluefin tuna sushi, S$38), which allows you a taste of Miyu’s premium ingredients at a lower price. You can also opt for the wagyu beef cheek set (S$28), which comes with rice, salad and miso soup.Forum The Shopping Mall, 01-17, 583 Orchard Road\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (12pm to 3pm, 6pm to 10pm)Why visit? If you’re looking for a really affordable omakase lunch in Singapore, you might want to give Hana Restaurant a shot. The restaurant is best known for its 15-course omakase that is priced at S$38, S$58 and S$88.\xa0There is a clear contrast between the lower priced meals and the higher priced ones. If you’re seeking a more indulgent meal with premium ingredients, opt for the S$88 meal instead.\xa0Price range: $$Crowd favourites: Aside from serving affordable omakases, Hana Restaurant has an extensive a la carte menu. It’s most well-known for its flying noodles that come in unique different flavours. If you’re adventurous, you could always give the flying salted egg yolk udon (S$18) a try. There are also luxurious chirashi bowls (from S$28) and specialty makis (from S$15), if that’s what you prefer.58 Seng Poh Road, 01-15\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (12pm to 3pm, 6pm to 10.30pm)Why visit? You’d be hard pressed to find an omakase dinner in Singapore that costs below a hundred dollars. That is what makes Sevens Kappo Japanese Dining such a rare find – its cheapest dinner omakase, Sakura, is priced at S$78. That’s about the price of a regular omakase lunch in Singapore.\xa0Like Hana Restaurant, the lunch set here starts from S$38 but goes up to S$178. The six-course meal retains elements of its dinner offerings, such as the Mushimono (a steam dish), while other dishes such as the tempura moriawase are only available on the lunch menu. We say just make a beeline for the Sakura dinner set, which comes with a seasonal theme platter, two kinds of sashimi, a steam dish, a fried item and a claypot rice dish.The quiet and modern Japanese restaurant has the perfect ambience for a relaxing lunch alone or a romantic dinner with your partner. Those who enjoy Japanese liqueur can Indulge in the restaurant’s niche sake list, which features artisan brewers curated to complement the menu.Price range: $$Crowd favourites: If you’re still peckish, try the wagyu katsu sando (S$38) or five kinds of assorted kushiage (deep-fried skewered meat or vegetables, S$18).9 Circular Road\nOpen: Monday (5pm to 10.30 pm), Tuesday to Saturday (12pm to 3pm, 5pm to 10.30pm)Why visit? There aren’t many French-Japanese fusion omakases in Singapore. If you’re tired of the typical omakase set-up, venture to Jidai Restaurant for your meal.\xa0Some of its dishes combine Japanese seafood with popular French dishes, such as its Hokkaido scallop and sake leek soup. It makes Jidai Restaurant perfect for those seeking a uniquely Singaporean omakase experience.\xa0The beauty of the restaurant lies in its simplicity. There are only two omakase choices available: The eight-course meal (S$88) or the 10-course meal (S$108).\xa0Both are nearly identical, with the 10-course option including seared seafood and yakitori as one of its courses. The best part? Prices are the same during lunch and dinner, making Jidai a great option for a nice omakase dinner in Singapore with your partner.\xa0Price range: $$$Crowd favourites: The menu changes, but dishes it has served include slices of Challans duck with charred corn and lime miso dashi, and a seared red snapper with sweet crawfish that’s topped with uni creme.Intercontinental Singapore Robertson Quay, 02-06, 1 Nanson Road\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (12pm to 2.30pm, 6.30pm to 10.30pm)Why visit? Prefer a more traditional omakase experience reminiscent of your time in Japan? Ishi is a reasonably priced option.\xa0With a cost of around S$200 for its dinner sets, Ishi Restaurant’s lunch set, Ulala (S$90), is a real steal.

What started as a humble stall next to a public bath turned into a full-fledged Edo-style sushi restaurant that has made its first overseas venture into Singapore.\xa0\xa0It’s almost a given that restaurants serving omakase are flying in fresh ingredients on a weekly basis to get the freshest seasonal ingredients.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/pui-pui-heng-hot-cold-dessert/:['Pui Pui Heng Hot & Cold Dessert is a relatively new name to the famous ABC Brickworks Food Centre.Opened just a few months ago, the old-school desserts stall has an interesting crew: It’s run by a second-gen hawker and his family.The man at the helm is 59-year-old Seah Boon Chuan and despite the youth of the hawker stall, this is not his first foray into the business. Rather, it marks a return to the industry after a 20-year hiatus.The “Pui Pui Heng Hot & Cold Dessert” name is new to ABC Brickworks, but the little-known brand has existed for the longest time: It was originally located at the now-demolished Lakeview Hawker Centre and run by Boon Chuan’s father. Boon Chuan started helping out at the stall at the young age of nine in 1973.His father handed him the operations in 1995 when he retired, but Boon Chuan eventually decided to wind things up in 2000. His own family had grown and he wanted to spend more time with them.\xa0As his kids grew older, he then took on a job as a freight truck driver, before eventually setting up another stall from 2008 to 2010 selling soya bean and sugarcane juice at Whampoa Food Centre.The new stall meant less volatile working hours and a more forgiving schedule as compared to his prior trade in desserts. This was especially so because soya bean and sugarcane requires less preparation time.The arrangement afforded him more quality family time, especially with the addition of his youngest son to the family.Today, Boon Chuan runs Pui Pui Heng at ABC Brickworks with his wife and eldest son. His wife, 43-year-old Akie, is usually there to help him out with daily operations.\xa0His son, 22-year-old Seah Chin Wei, helps out whenever he can. He is also studying full-time and splits his time between the stall and school. But when not at the stall, the tech-savvy young man also helps his parents to spread the word on the internet — almost like a marketing specialist.When asked why he decided to return to the hawker life and how it’s been treating him after a long two decades, Boon Chuan says it’s definitely tougher than before.“Now that my children are grown up and can take care of themselves, I thought of returning, since it’s the trade I’m most familiar with. At our age, it’s a bit tougher, especially with the long hours, but I can still take it.”Alas, business has been patchy, as the Seah family works on trying to win the hearts of the lunch crowds and residents who frequent the hawker centre.Boon Chuan hopes that business will pick up, especially since he set up the stall first and foremost as a means to provide for his family.\xa0At the same time, he also sees it as a potential fallback plan for his children if needed, or if they show interest in F&B.Referring to the current incarnation of Pui Pui Heng, Chin Wei quips: “Truthfully, my parents opened this shop to earn money, but they also saw (the business) as something my younger brother — who isn’t the best at studying — could potentially take over.”At present, Chin Wei is the only child helping out at the stall, while his two siblings, a younger brother and sister, focus on school — at his parents’ insistence.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThree Little Coconut: Mr Coconut launches coconut-themed cafe in Punggol with croffles, tang shui & more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew places to eat in Singapore: October 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7 best cafes at Joo Chiat for brunch, coffee & cakes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Their goal is for us to study because they want a better future for us,” he adds.While the hawker life is not for most youngsters, the environment is not exactly foreign to Chin Wei — he had helped out at his parents’ previous stall when he was still a kid. Back then, he was responsible for bringing orders to customers’ tables.Here at ABC Brickworks, he is doing more of the same and taking orders from customers. His parents handle the more labour-intensive tasks, such as preparing the ingredients and whipping up the actual desserts. Still, running a hawker stall is a far cry from the usual air-conditioned schooling environment and also comes with more daily pressures. It’s evident that the reticent elder Seah appreciates his son’s help.“Working in the hawker setting for long hours is not for the younger generation. Not everyone can come into this line but if he can take it, I don’t mind. My children have their own lives, but I’m very happy that he’s willing to (help out),” the patriarch confesses, shyly.The recipes here have all been passed down from Boon Chuan’s father, but were ultimately tweaked with his own experience. One impressive thing about Pui Pui Heng is the insistence on making the ingredients from scratch, from its green cendol jelly to sweet potato chunks.\xa0Boon Chuan strongly believes in serving only the best to his customers — a principle he has abided by since young. “You must remember what standard of ingredients you serve your customer, and not just any subpar ingredients,” he says.\xa0Pui Pui Heng’s menu ranges from the more rustic cheng tng and longan ice to the more ubiquitous cendol and ice kachang.Prices here float around S$2 to S$2.50, which are reasonable prices for a well-crafted bowl of dessert made with a helping of handmade ingredients. And even more so, if you think about rising hawker rental costs.\xa0In particular, Chin Wei strongly recommends the burbur cha cha (S$2.50), which is delightfully rich and perfumed with coconut aroma, without being cloying at all.More importantly, it comes generously loaded with a glut of goodies including our favourites — wonderfully tender chunks of sweet potato and yam.Similarly, we found Pui Pui Heng’s cendol (S$2.50) very enjoyable as well, particularly with its delicate, fluffy and thinly shaved ice providing a plusher\xa0 mouthfeel.\xa0At the same time, the key ingredients of gula melaka and green pandan jelly also complements the base well — the former is pronounced and fragrant but well balanced, while the squiggles of jelly are silky and pillowy soft.One thing’s for certain after we tried the desserts: It’s all very solid and comfortingly nostalgic.\xa0In fact, while we were there, one elderly lady told us she has frequented the stall more than once.“I stay nearby and I’ve been back a few times.

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/my-must-eats-korean-oppa-from-sg-eric-youn/:['My Must-Eats is a HungryGoWhere series featuring Singapore’s public figures and their favourite food haunts. This week, we speak to Eric Youn, the Korean Oppa from SG, as he’s known on social media, on his must-eats in Singapore. I first chanced upon a reel by Eric Youn (@esyfilms), who calls himself ‘Korean Oppa from SG’ when I was looking for new Korean food places to dine at in Singapore.\xa0You’re probably used to seeing Korean oppas (a term used by females to address older males) from Korea, but what exactly was a Korean Oppa from SG? I knew I had to find out.\xa0Youn, 35, who was born in Seoul, tells us that he didn’t exactly start off with the moniker. The native Korean moved to Singapore right before the pandemic in 2020 for a job opportunity — he currently works as a senior technical account executive.\xa0He then started to gain a following for his food-related content recommending places to eat whenever he went back to Korea. In particular, his review of a honeycomb spot in Gangnam, Seoul went viral on TikTok.\xa0Youn wanted to create a catchier and more memorable introductory term as he made more videos. He decided to go for Korean Oppa from SG, surmising that “(the term) oppa has a caring side”, and he adopted the ‘from SG’ bit as most of his audience then was from Singapore.On his time here, Youn tells us over email: “Coming to Singapore has been an eye-opener to how many different cultures can exist and live together harmoniously. This is important to me because it paves the way for my interest in food. I’m spoiled for choice with the many different types of food available here.”In fact, Youn doesn’t subscribe to the common notion that “Singapore is very small and can be quite monotonous”, adding that “if you really look, there is so much to see and do”.We speak to him to find out just what attracts this Korean oppa to Singapore and our local food scene:\xa0When I was in middle school, I loved having gimmari (deep-fried fritters made from glass noodles wrapped in seaweed) from a Korean street food stall with my schoolmates. I remember the aunty would coat it with a delicious sweet and spicy sauce.\xa0Another dish I remember eating as a child is hotteok (sweet pancakes) from a stall near the church I went to in Seoul. The ahjussi (old Korean uncle) who makes the hotteok there was still around when I visited one to two years ago — it’s the best hotteok ever! It’s not the usual wet and oily kind, but it’s dry and crispy. My family and I would always get that when we visited even if the wait was long.\xa0I usually go somewhere that is filling, economical and fast. I really like Stuff’d. It’s one of the best bang-for-your-buck places in Singapore, and it’s super simple to eat without making a lot of mess. My go-tos are the daily bowl or the kebab.When I’m in my office in the CBD, I usually have my lunch at a salad place called Omnivore. Despite it’s location, it’s very affordable and has a wide variety of options and toppings to choose from. Plus it’s the nearest salad spot to my office! My favourite item to get there is the basic salad set with roasted duck, salad, beansprouts, corn, chickpeas, and furikake, with sesame sauce.\xa0If I’m feeling something Korean, I’ll usually go to a Korean barbecue place in Tanjong Pagar, though this really depends on what I’m craving at the moment.\xa0Different K-restaurants are good at certain foods. For example, for Korean noodles, I usually go to Noodle Star K; for gopchang (innards) I go to Singkoba; and my favourite Korean barbecue this year has been Sodeng. So depending on my mood, I’ll head to these places if I’m craving these dishes.\xa0\xa0Hainanese chicken rice. I always make sure that I have a plate of it the day after I return.\xa0The simplicity of it just makes it super yummy, and the rice is just ‘chef’s kiss’ savoury. My friend (@thepantryboy on Instagram) once made chicken rice from scratch for me, and from that, I realised that it may seem like a simple dish but the cooking process is very complex. To get that consistent flavour takes a lot of effort, and it made me appreciate it more.\xa0This is a hard question, but I want to try authentic Greek food in Greece. In particular, I want to dine in Santorini, looking at the skies, with the white and blue houses in the background, watching the sunset, and feasting while seeing the blue ocean. Am I too idealistic?\xa0The last thing I ate that really opened my eyes was a Korean barbecue place in Gangnam, Seoul called Shinbujasikdang. The restaurant is known for its 3cm-thick pork belly cuts. I didn’t bring a measuring stick, but I can tell you it was definitely thick!\xa0Apparently, the pork is also wet-aged so the texture is crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. If you wrap it with myeong-inamul (wild garlic leaf), you won’t stop eating it. I usually eat meat with Naengmyeon (cold noodles), which are very complementary items.\xa0\xa0For more eats in town, check out our review of Magg by Royz Et Vous, which serves atas maggi mee, and the new food openings in October 2023.\xa0Do explore the new GrabFood Dine-in service for awesome deals.\xa0You can also book a ride to the food places recommended by Eric.\xa0AuthorSarah is constantly seeking out new coffee spots and cocktail bars around the world, and should probably drink more water while at it.© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']
https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/three-little-coconut-mr-coconut-punggol/:['Obsessed with Mr Coconut’s best-selling coconut shakes and wished there were more coconut-focused food items from the brand?Well, your prayers have been answered with the launch of Three Little Coconut, a coconut-themed cafe in Punggol.The new concept can be found in the under-the-radar One Punggol and is slated for official launch on Nov 11.Unlike your regular Mr Coconut stalls, which are for takeaway only, Three Little Coconut is a full-fledged cafe that comes with seating. It also features a plethora of desserts that come with coconut twists that fans would enjoy.The name is a callback to the journey of the founding trio — Lucas Lin, Vivian Yeo and Andrew Cai — who first started the brand from a single, small outlet in 2016.With the trio’s perseverance, the brand now has 50 locations islandwide — including this new concept, which will also carry Mr. Coconut’s existing lineup of signature coconut drinks — as well as a legion of fans.We expect the outlet-exclusive desserts to drum up the most fanfare, though. Three Little Coconut’s menu will contain everything from coconut cheesecakes and croffles, to coconut tang shui (traditional desserts).One highlight is the cafe’s spins on the classic burnt cheesecake: Think ondeh ondeh burnt cheesecake, cendol burnt cheesecake and even a mango sticky rice cheesecake that features a coconut milk-infused sticky rice base and mango cubes.Sweet-toothed cafe hoppers who prefer trendier treats would also be interested in the coconut croffles, where the Korean-inspired dessert is drizzled with gula melaka or chocolate sauce and can be topped with a scoop of silky coconut ice cream.\xa0\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTalad Thai Banana opens at AMK Hub with S$2 opening promotion for the first 100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Korean-Chinese chain selling jajangmyeon, Paik’s Noodle opens at Suntec City\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPui Pui Heng Hot & Cold Dessert: Old-school desserts stall run by second-gen hawker after 20-year hiatus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the most unique creation on Three Little Coconut’s menu has got to be the coconut juice tang shui, which puts a tropical twist on some of the most nostalgic classic desserts.That means items such as the peach gum coconut tang shui, which features a medley of peach gum, sweet coconut soup, red dates and goji berries. But you can also find creamier alternatives, such as coconut avocado tang shui and coconut mao shan wang tang shui, where the fruits are added into the soup base directly. These feature creamy coconut milk sauce topped with snowy milk-shaved ice.For the iciest, most refreshing desserts, there’s also Three Little Coconut’s coconut snowy ice selection, where soft shaved ice is jazzed up with comforting sauces. You can look forward to permutations such as kopi (coffee)and burbur chacha (coconut and sweet potato sauce).For more ideas on what to eat, read our stories on the hottest new places in Singapore to visit and the wholesome family-run traditional dessert shop at ABC Brickworks.Mr Coconut is on the GrabFood delivery service and offers free delivery (up to S$3 off) with GrabUnlimited.\xa0Do explore the new GrabFood Dine-in service for awesome deals.Alternatively, you can book a ride to Three Little Coconut at One Punggol when it opens, or any of Mr Coconut’s outlets for a refreshing coconut shake.One Punggol 01-03, 1 Punggol Drive\nNearest MRT station: Punggol\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (11am to 11pm) One Punggol 01-03, 1 Punggol Drive\nNearest MRT station: Punggol\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (11am to 11pm) AuthorEvan started off writing about food on Instagram, before joining outlets such as Buro and Confirm Good to pursue his passion.

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/geylang-serai/:['There is no better place for an all-in-one slice of Malay culture. After all, Geylang Serai is one of the oldest Malay enclaves in Singapore. Here, walk into shopping malls circa 1980s selling Malay textiles, crafts, traditional clothing, markets for fresh produce, spices and of course, some of the best Muslim/Indian food in Singapore.The best eats are concentrated at two food centres here, at Geylang Serai Market and Food Centre and Haig Road Market & Food Centre, though there are some gems to be found in coffee shops and along the side streets south of Geylang Road.Here is an assortment of the best local foods that Geylang Serai has to offer:Chendol\nA classic dessert in its best light\nAt first glance, Cendol Geylang Serai’s chendol (S$1.50 a bowl) might seem lacking – no fancy toppings like durian or ice cream and not even red beans or chin chow (grass jelly). They simply add gula Melaka, coconut cream, ice shavings and homemade soft chendol slivers that are not garishly green. On its own, this slightly sweet bowl it might be too delicate, even watery (they don’t overdo the coconut cream), but eat it after a meal and it fits the definition of ‘refreshing’.\nCendol Geylang Serai | Address: #02-107 Geylang Serai Market and Food Centre, 1 Geylang Serai | Tel: 90909605 | Opening hours: Daily 9am-7pm\xa0Fried chicken\nSingapore’s very own southern-style fried chicken\nThis locally-owned fast food-style fried chicken joint has been operating since 1984. The herbs and spices in Arnold’s Fried Chicken’s batter mix are not as robust as, say, KFC’s, but the chain more than makes up for it with its crispy and tender fried chicken ($6.60 for a two-piece meal). The best thing about it being local is that you get extras you would never find in a typical fast food joint – in this case – drinks like iced bandung (condensed milk and rose water), iced Milo and ice kachang as a dessert option.\nArnold’s Fried Chicken | Address: 810 Geylang Road, #02-99/101 City Plaza | Tel: 67462372 | Opening hours: Daily 11.30am-9.45pm\n\xa0Nasi biryani\nMalay yellow rice cooked with meticulousnessHardcore fans will say that the spices have tamed over the years but no one will disagree that Geylang Briyani Stall still holds one of the top spots for biryani ($5). Special attention has been paid to every aspect of the dish: the meat (especially the mutton) is tender, the basmati rice is fluffy and buttery, and the masala gravy is robust with flavour. The achar (pickled vegetables) – made without colouring – has a nice crunch and freshness to it. The accompanying thick lentil curry with its almost melting potato pieces is not watered down like many other stalls do it.\nGeylang Biryani Stall| Address: 1 Geylang Serai, #02-146 Geylang Serai Market and Food Centre | Opening hours: Tue-Sun 9am-5pm\xa0WE ORDERED THE SAME ITEMS FROM THREE NASI PADANG STALLS AND TOOK NOTES:Sinar Pagi: The most expensive of the three. Serves out the least amount of rice. The longest queues at lunchtime.HJH Maimunah: The cheapest of the three food places, considering you dine in air-conditioned comfort. Good classic flavours can be found here, but not necessarily the most adventurous.Hajjah Mona Nasi Padang: The least patronised of the three, but has, quite possibly, the most distinctive style.CRITICS’ PICK Nasi Padang\nRendang that stands out\nThere are plenty of nasi padang stalls around Geylang Serai, two of which have consistently gotten all the media attention: Sinar Pagi Nasi Padang and\xa0HJ. Maimunah Restaurant & Catering. Hajjah Mona Nasi Padang has always been in the shadow, though it should not be.Hajjah Mona does its nasi Padang differently: their beef rendang is rich and extremely soft and their dry-fried tempeh is dry, crunchy with a more intense flavour because they do not add a lot, if any, water. The vegetables in their urap salad – tossed with serundeng (sautéed coconut shavings) – is barely cooked for that raw and fresh bite. Other stalls make the dish more like a stir fry.Whether you like their this different approach boils down to how you like your rendang done, but their boldness earns Hajjah Mona a recommendation above the other two.\nHajjah Mona Nasi Padang | Address: 1 Geylang Serai, #02-166 Geylang Serai Market and Food Centre | Tel: 82826902 | Opening hours: Thu-Tue 8am-7pm\xa0Mee rebus\nShrimps, mutton and crabs go into the thick sauceThe mee rebus (Malay for “boiled noodles”, $2.50) at Afandi Hawa & Family is stewed with dried shrimps, mutton scraps and flower crabs, resulting in a rich, not too sweet sauce with a distinct stock and curry flavour. The texture of the sauce is thick and smooth and a serving comes with a whole egg (unheard of these days!) and a prawn. A pity that they do not ladle mutton scraps into the dish anymore.\nAfandi Hawa & Family | Address: 14 Haig Road, #01-21 Haig Road Cooked Food Centre | Opening hours: Thu-Tue 10am-10pmPutu piring\nA nearly-lost sweet dish in Singapore\nThese days, finding putu piring in Singapore is akin to striking lottery. No wonder Traditional Haig Road Putu Piring is so popular that they have had to open a second outlet to cater to demand (this is it). The kueh is soft and fluffy (five for $2) – due to the fact that the flour is not pressed into the mould. The intense and rich filling is made with top grade gula Melaka straight from Malacca, and they are generous with their salted coconut shavings.\nTraditional Haig Road Putu Piring | Address: 970 Geylang Rd, #01-02 Mr Teh Tarik (Food Court) and one other location | Tel:\xa094229017 | Opening hours: Daily noon-10.30pm, closed every second Tues of the month\xa0Roti John\nA Singaporean invention done well\nNot many stalls do this well. Rosy & Nora is one of the few who do it spot-on. The crusty side of the bread ($3.30) is dry-fried for a crispy bite and the omelette mixture with soft onions is nicely salted. The spiced mutton mince is adequate with a satisfying hint of curry flavour. It is also refreshing that they do not jazz it up with mayonnaise or cheese on top (thank goodness). The chilli sauce that’s served alongside has a nice balance of sweet, sour and spicy. They also sell halal popiahs. \nRosy & Nora | Address: 14 Haig Road, #01-15 Haig Road Cooked Food Centre | Opening hours: Daily 2pm-10pm.Satay\nAlmost perfect Malay-style satay\nThe charcoal-grilled satay ($0.50 per stick, minimum of ten sticks) at Warong Sudi Mampir is smoky, not too sweet and is marinated lightly so you can still taste the flavour of the meat. The rich and creamy chunky satay sauce also reins in the sweetness. The soft, yet firm ketupat (rice cake) in the sauce melts in your mouth. Their chicken satay uses breast meat which can be a tad dry, and Warong also serves hati (liver) and babat (tripe) – both beef – but their mutton satay is definitely the star here.\nWarong Sudi Mampir| Address: 14 Haig Road, #01-19 Haig Road Cooked Food Centre | Opening hours: Mon, Tue & Fri 10.30am-7pm; Sat & Sun 10.30am-5pm A journalist since 2001, Gregory Leow took a break from his job at Singapore Press Holdings to pursue music.

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/geylang-serai-food-centre/:['For many years, Geylang Serai market and food centre operated on makeshift stalls. It wasn’t until 2006 when hawkers were housed in the two-storey kampung-house-inspired building. A trip to Geylang Serai is a foodie’s dream. At the wet market, imported goods for Malay cooking are found. The food centre on the second floor houses some of the best halal Muslim food in town, from nasi padang to Indian rojak. These stalls close early, so the best time to go is from morning until lunch hours when the place is bustling. Grab a cup of teh tarik and enjoy the vibe.Geylang Serai Market and Food Centre | Address: 1 Geylang Serai\xa0\xa0Hajjah Mona\nHajjah Mona is inevitably the most decorated stall in Geylang Serai – \xa0the bright neon sign, the display of scrumptious dishes and the media reports dishing out accolades of the cooks’ culinary excellence. While there is a great variety of food items, from rendang to opor (lemongrass and coconut chicken curry), it is the rice sets ($5 onwards) that caught our eyes. For beginners, go for nasi rames, a rice set of beef rendang, fried chicken with serundeng (caramelised grated coconut), sambal goreng (spicy stir-fried beancurd and tempeh) and sayur lodeh (mixed vegetables curry). Flavours are mild in this dish, dominated by the sweetness from the caramelisation in rendang and serundeng. For the adventurous ones, go for the nasi rawon, rice drenched in black-coloured gravy made with buah keluak\xa0(candlenut paste) and beef stock, served with your choice of meat. The buah keluak\xa0gives an earthy flavour, with a faint hint of sweetness, best to spice it up with some sambal.\nHajjah Mona, #02-166 | Tel: 82826902 | Opening hours: Sun-Tues, Thu-Sat 8am-7pm\xa0Otak-otak Kampong Wak Murset\nThis stall right next to Hajjah Mona runs like a tiny otak factory, with a family forming a systematical production line. The owner, Wak (“uncle” in Malay) Murset himself, is often spotted grilling otak (minced fish meat in spices), while his children prep the ingredients at the back and his wife packs the otak for customers. There is only one type of otak here, the “original kampung style” (five for $2). His pride in his product is shown with the tagline “life is not complete without trying this otah” running across the stall’s signboard. Instead of fish paste, he uses coarse minced fish meat with a hint of rempah (spices), lemongrass and a significant amount of serundeng (sauteed grated coconut). This last ingredient not only adds sweetness to the fish mixture, it also gives the otak a unique gritty texture. There is usually a queue at this stall.\nOtak-otak Kampong Wak Murset | #02-165 | Opening hours: Daily 10am-8pmMuhabbat Setia Hati Roti Chapati\nChapati, which is made with whole wheat flour and cooked with no oil, is considered the healthiest option among different types of Indian bread. This stall offers just that, and each chapati is made fresh upon order. It is soft and doughy with slightly crispy edges. The extra wheat flour, that is dusted on the dough upon pan-frying, gives the bread a nice floury edge, like what salt does to french fries. The stall offers different types of gravy to go with the chapati (a set comes with two pieces), and we went for the vegetarian dhal set ($3.50). It is flavourful with a hint of masala that complements the bread well. Other gravy include the vegetarian stew and mutton keema (minced). The couple has been running this stall since the days when Geylang Serai was just a makeshift market. The stall closes on certain days of the week on an ad-hoc basis, usually on Mondays.\nMuhabbat Setia Hati Roti Chapati | #02-162 | Opening hours: Daily 2pm-6pm\xa0Rojak & Mee Siam\nThe notorious food poisoning case that involved the owner’s father of this stall does not deter their loyal followers. The two sons have made a comeback, and the food is as good, if not better than how their father prepared it. They are generous with the gravy, which is the key attraction here. Only sweet potato is used to create this thick gravy, which has a hint of chilli, just enough for a pleasant kick. Customers may ask for a top-up of gravy, which is the owners’ way of showing their appreciation. To go with that gravy, choose from the variety of fritters (50 cents onwards per piece), such as fried beancurd, coconut balls, shrimp fritters, vegetable fritters,\xa0limpa (spleen) and braised squid, which have a different flavour and texture compared to the typical fritters. To complete the plate of carbohydrates are some fresh lettuce, cucumbers and shallots.\nRojak & Mee Siam | #02-126 | Opening hours: Tue-Sun 9am-4pmIqbal Soup Kambing\nThe signboard shows a range of Muslim fare, such as the sinful soup tulang (bone marrow soup), and kampung-style fried rice and noodles. But the huge pot of soup displayed at the store-front steals the show. The aroma of spices and mutton that smells slightly gamey lured us in further. Iqbal’s mutton soup is robust and balanced with a spicy kick. Order the campur (mix, $10/$12) version for the complete experience. It comes with chunks of mutton with bones and various cuts of the animal. The meat is tender with the fatty cartilages just enough to hold it together. The combination of the cuts give it layers of texture: chewy, tender and crunchy, all in one. The portion is huge, so do share with a friend or two. Iqbal Soup Kambing is also one of the very few stalls that are still open in the food centre after 8pm.\nIqbal Soup Kambing | #02-128 | Opening hours: Daily 9am-9pmSinar Pagi Nasi Padang\nThere are many different styles of nasi padang, from those in Indonesia style to Singapore Peranakan style. Sinar Pagi does it Kapau style, inspired from the same region in west Sumatra, Indonesia. The rendang, for example, has a more intense flavour, it has been caramelised longer, and the meat looks almost jerky-like. However, with excellent knife skill and control of fire, the meat remains juicy and not chewy. Other must-try items are the\xa0ayam panggang (smoky grilled chicken with sambal), dendeng balado (beef jerky with fresh grounded chillies and shallot) and nangka lemak (jackfruit stew with coconut). The dishes have just enough kick without being too overwhelming for the palate. Sinar Pagi has been around since the late 1960s, and today, it has two other outlets at Circular Road and ABC Brickworks Food Centre. Note that the dishes are pricier than other nasi padang stalls, with a plate with a choice of meat and a vegetable cost around $6.\nSinar Pagi Nasi Padang, #02-137 | Opening hours: Daily 9am-8pm (closed on alternate Mondays and Thursdays)Geylang Serai Chee Kong\nThe best way to end a meal at Geylang Serai will be with a refreshing bowl of cheng tng. The family that runs this stall has been in the business for 40 years, and they are related to the famous Ye Lai Xiang Cheng Tng in Bedok. Their version ($2) has the usual mix of dried longan, ginko nuts, sweet potato, barley and green beans, but with extras of sago balls and bits of candied coconut. The candied coconut remains crunchy in the broth, and the sugar coating does not dilute in the cool dessert to over-sweeten it. But it is sweeter than the usual ones sold elsewhere, so ask for less sugar if that is your preference.\nGeylang Serai Chee Kong | Address: #02-149 | Opening hours: Daily 9am-7.30pm\xa0Author© 2023 HungryGoWhere.com']

The cheese ring, a metal plate shaped like a donut, fits around the circumference of the hotpot and keeps a moat of melted mozzarella cheese warm.\xa0How you want to eat that gooey cheese is up to you, but it’s recommended that you mix it in with some of the rice, which is given to mop up any hotpot sauce or soup that’s left over.What to order: Sweet potato tteokbokki; fish cake; double cheese ring (extra S$9.80)\xa0The Centrepoint, 03-43, 176 Orchard Road\nNearest MRT station: Somerset\nOpen: Monday to Thursday (11.30am to 3.30pm, 5.30pm to 10pm); Friday to Sunday (11.30am to 3.30pm, 5.30pm to 10.30pm)Although a steamboat and Korean BBQ joint, GoroGoro is not a name derived from the Korean language. It’s a cheeky play on the sound a hungry stomach might make or the sound of soup boiling.There are seven types of soup to cook your meat, seafood and vegetables in, such as pepper bak kut teh, ginseng, beauty collagen and mala. Do note that the menu differs for lunch and dinner; seafood is offered only during dinner.The Korean slant comes as side dishes, which are included in the buffet for S$17.90 and upwards, with the likes of tteokbokki, Korean pancake, japchae (stir-fried glass noodles and vegetables), and Korean chicken wings.\xa0What to order: Korean chicken wings, sweet potato\xa0\xa0West Mall, 01-38, 1 Bukit Batok Central Link\nNearest MRT station: Bukit Batok\nOpen: Sunday to Friday (11.30am to 10pm); Saturday (11.30am to 10.30pm)Offering a separate griddle with a hotpot, Pot Addiction is where you can truly get the best of both worlds.\xa0This means you’ll get twice as many options to cook 16 types of meat as well as a pick from seven hotpot soup bases.

Run by a husband-and-wife team, you’ll get not only an authentic laksa soup base, but a rotating selection of fresh ingredients.\xa0Taking up to eight hours to prepare, the laksa soup is best paired with a milder soup base (you get to choose two soup bases). Our recommendation: Get the fried mantou to mop up the laksa soup on your plate or dunk it in the hotpot.\xa0With finger food such as mini ngoh hiang and prawn paste chicken alongside the typical steamboat fare, the starting price of S$24.80 for this steamboat buffet is definitely justified.\xa0What to order: Signature laksa broth, fried mantou, prawn paste chickenCity Hot Pot, Shi Li Fang, Ting Yuan Hotpot, Dookki, GoroGoro Steamboat and Korean Buffet, Pot Addiction, Suki-Ya, and Shabu Sai are on the GrabFood delivery service.

You don’t often find claypot rice readily available at air-conditioned food courts, so having it with such ease at Malaysia Boleh! is a treat.\xa0\xa0Bugis Junction, 01-88/89, 200 Victoria Street\xa0\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (11am to 10.30pm)Why visit? This is a Bugis Junction restaurant for those who really love to eat fish. Fu Xiao Xian prides itself on using a Yunan-style cooking method to serve its diners healthy steamed fish that nourishes the body. Supposedly, a bamboo hat is used as a lid to cover the work while the fish is cooking — a rather interesting method indeed.\xa0Price range: $$Crowd favourites: The paper wrapped fish (for two to three persons, from S$33.10) is a signature you should try. It has different flavours and spice levels to choose from, ranging from garlic (mild spicy) to mala (extra spicy).\xa0Bugis Junction, 03-30A, 200 Victoria Street\xa0\nOpen: Sunday to Thursday (11am to 9pm), Friday and Saturday (11am to 9.30pm)\xa0Bedok Mall, B1-40, 311 New Upper Changi Road\xa0\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (11am to 9pm)\xa0Thomson Plaza, 01-122/123, 301 Upper Thomson Road\xa0\nOpen: Monday to Thursday (11am to 3pm, 5pm to 9pm), Friday and Saturday (11am to 4pm, 5pm to 9.30pm), Sunday (11am to 4pm, 5pm to 9pm) Why visit?

It’s packed with seafood such as clams and prawns, which is rather value-for-money, in our opinion.\xa0Bugis Junction, B1-K04, 200 Victoria Street\xa0\nOpen: Sunday to Thursday (9.30am to 9.30pm), Friday and Saturday (9.30am to 10pm)Why visit?

Who doesn’t love freshly made pasta? Something about the texture is just superior to store bought ones. Thankfully, you don’t have to lift a finger or pay an arm and a leg for it anymore.

It exists in Bugis Junction as a food stand, so no dine-in is available.\xa0Its pastas come in a range of shapes, sizes and colours. Tangled emphasises that these are made with natural ingredients, which makes it a healthier option.

It was planned for 10 different countries across the region, each with their own specials.For example, the campaign was launched in Malaysia in September with a spicy crispy chicken wrap. For Singapore’s collab, we’re getting something a bit more decadent: The K–Sweet & Spicy McCrispy (S$7.05 a la carte, from S$9.25 for extra value meal with medium crisscut fries and small drink)!\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFree hashbrowns & coffee with KFC's breakfast Original Recipe Riser deal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMcDonald’s Ninja burger returns with 50% off deal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTexas Chicken now 24/7 in Singapore & launches two new breakfast burgers, available from 4am\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new creation is built on the popular fried chicken recipe but slicked in a layer of sweet and spicy sauce — a la saucy Korean fried chicken — and orders will come in a combo of one drumstick and one thigh.And it’ll be served in special packaging too, emblazoned with the group’s iconic bunny and other McDonald’s items in pixel art style.Besides that, there will also be a brand-new dark chocolate sea salt frappé (upgrade your meal for S$1.20) for chocolate lovers, featuring decadent dark chocolate that’s contrasted with a splash of salinity.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/two-men-rice-bar-tanjong-pagar/:['Wholesome and healthy grain bowls remain as popular as ever since their introduction to the CBD about a decade ago, but rice bowls that’s not chap chai png from the economical rice stall and at three times the price?\xa0It’s a risky venture — is it what the CBD crowd wants? — and whether Two Men Rice Bar is putting everything onto a winning or losing ticket remains to be seen.Name sound familiar? This is the latest concept by Two Men Bagel House, which has been dishing up some hefty bagelwiches from its Tanjong Pagar — and later Novena, Holland Village and Joo Chiat — outlets since 2014.\xa0As you’ll surely guess from the name, it specialises in rice bowls, though you’ll find some other delicious grub here as well.Like its big brother, the restaurant design and Two Men Rice Bar‘s menu adopt a cheeky maximalist style that’s full of street cred.There’s plenty of strong colours, fun neon lighting, and a layout that takes a cue from Japanese standing noodle bars — that’s right, there are no seats here, only tall (and some shorter) red tables for customers to grab a quick bite before heading back to their desk.Two Men Rice Bar’s concept is interesting with great design and a fun menu. There are seven rice bowls with prices starting at S$12 for a half portion or S$15 for a full tank, which are acceptable prices for its very central location.\xa0The wholesome bowls filled with fluffy carbs, well-cooked proteins, and yummy greens make for a good alternative to the all-too-common salad bowls, particularly with their various rice options. Japanese short grain is typical, but you can also pick turmeric rice and a mixed 16-grain rice.Having said that, part of me feels the food still lacks a bit in terms of execution and finesse, especially when compared to Two Men Bagel House.\xa0There’s the variety too: Each rice bowl comes with more or less the same six accompaniments — sous vide egg, tenkasu (tempura crumbs), pickled cucumber, cherry tomatoes, salad slaw, and a glass noodle salad. Everything is tasty, but can get repetitive. Each bowl has the potential to be much better.“Ladies and gentlemen, this is Gumbo No. 5”, or so goes the chart-topping mambo track. At S$18 for half or S$20 for a full tank, this is the priciest dish offered here, as seafood dishes usually go.\xa0The mussels, squid rings, shrimp, and seabass are relatively fresh and firm, slathered in a creamy coconut turmeric sauce that’s fragrant and sweet, yet doesn’t overpower the natural seafood flavour. The butternut squash is tender, sweet, and nutty, and the sous vide egg adds even more creaminess to the dish.\xa0I wish there was a bit more sauce to make it a seafood stew of sorts, but it’s good this way as well. A half portion is enough to fill most people up.My choice of 16-grain rice (with additional grains such as pearl barley, beans and millet) goes pretty well with the Gumbo No. 5 because of its harder and more distinct texture, easily soaking up the sauce without becoming mush. I prefer the black rock (S$17/S$20), a meaty bowl of roast chuck roll with a black-garlic demi glace sauce. For a cut that usually requires a lot of braising or stewing to tenderise, the beef is mostly soft, with a nice beefy taste and good char on the outside.\xa0Traditional demi-glace is already rich and meaty, but using black garlic adds a slightly sweet, umami tang to the mix — it’s an immediate win when stirred in with the sous vide egg, crunchy veggies, and earthy and spice-rich turmeric rice.\xa0Again, a half portion is plenty, but otherwise, each bowl here also comes with\xa0 housemade soup in a metal cup. Inside is plenty of soft radish cubes in a really tasty chicken soup with a light hint of coconut. It’s nicely seasoned and pleasant to drink.And feel free to help yourself to the various condiments at the counter. There’s a citrus chilli there’s not unlike those you’d find at chicken rice stalls, but less garlicky and a tad tangier; a coarser Cantonese-style scallion-ginger-garlic dip fragrant with aromatic oil, and a stronger hoisin-type sauce with sesame oil, soya sauce, and peanut butter, like a chee cheong fun or yong tau foo sauce.On to the sides. I’ll say it first, rice-battered chicken is genius. I’m so used to eating batter that’s made using regular wheat flour that I forgot that many Eastern recipes use rice flour in their deep fry dishes, which results in a weightless but very crunchy batter that stays crispy for a longer time. Its thinness means it’s easier to get wrong and burn, which could be why we don’t see it everywhere.Back to the dish – Two Men’s rice pops (S$12) takes chicken lollipops (the drumette) and fries them to a glorious brown. Combined with honey butter sauce, it’s slightly sticky and absolutely crunchy outside, tender and well-marinated inside.One of just three drinks available here, the plum lemonade fizz (S$6) doubles as a palate cleanser and one heck of a refresher, with a tart sour plum flavour that’s balanced out by a little bit of syrup without being overpowered by sugar.\xa0Lemon juice adds that extra zing, while a splash of soda water means you get a gentle fizziness that’s not so carbonated so you don’t burp too much. The accompanying wooden stick is a bit perplexing as there’s nothing inside besides ice, so it’s no more than decoration.Ironically, the least likable dish here is the one that most resembles the Two Men group’s signature bagels. The rice side (S$8) is a steamed rice flour bagel (complete with a hole in the middle) stuffed with kong bak, or braised pork belly. I love myself a good kong bak pau, but this one disappoints on several levels.Kong bak pao usually features a thick slab of pork belly, but the version here comes with a few thinner slices of fatty pork, which isn’t too much of an issue. The steamed bagel is dense but soft, and the slightly creamy leek slaw at the bottom tastes okay.\xa0However, the deal breakers are the relatively dry meat (perhaps the braise time was a little short) and a sauce so salty I had to add some citrus chilli to cut away from the brackishness.Still, it’s worth noting that the eatery only opened weeks ago and is probably ironing out the kinks in its offerings. If all goes well, Two Men Rice Bar could be a gamechanger for the CBD food scene.Is it conducive to conversation? You’ll likely be standing right alongside strangers during peak hours, so probably not.Is a reservation necessary? First come first served!How to get there?

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/paiks-noodle-suntec-singapore/:['Jajangmyeon (black bean sauce noodles) lovers have one more spot in Singapore to add to their list — Paik’s Noodle, a popular Korean-Chinese chain from Korea has just opened its first outlet at Suntec City.Known as ‘Hong Kong Banjeom 0410’ in Korea, the brand has landed on our shores with a snappier name but with the same well-loved Korean-Chinese favourites.If the name Paik’s rings a bell, you might have also heard of Paik’s Bibim, a casual bibimbap concept that has been in Singapore since 2013.Both Paik’s Noodle and Paik’s Bibim are the brainchild of Paik Jong-won, a well-known Korean celebrity chef, with dozens of other F&B concepts in Korea and worldwide to his name.In case you’re wondering, ‘banjeom’ simply means restaurant and we hear that the numbers ‘0410’ are the last 4-digits of chef Paik’s former phone number.\xa0Ask any local in Korea and they’d probably have eaten at a Paik’s Noodle or Hong Kong Banjeom 0410 recently — trust us, it’s that popular.\xa0Paik’s Noodle in Singapore opened officially on October 15 to much anticipation and it’s been commanding a healthy crowd since.We had an early dinner on a weekday and it didn’t take long before the restaurant filled up with a queue forming even at 6pm.\xa0Similar to Paik’s Noodle’s menu in Korea, its Singapore outlet has all the quintessential Korean-Chinese dishes — jajangmyeon (S$11), tangsuyuk (sweet and sour pork, S$21), and jjamppong (spicy seafood noodle soup, S$14).\xa0\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50% off at picturesque date spots, including Wildseed Cafe at The Alkaff Mansion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTalad Thai Banana opens at AMK Hub with S$2 opening promotion for the first 100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpice lovers will also love that it has gochu jajang noodle (S$13) — black bean noodles but with chilli peppers.\xa0As someone that’s been to HK Banjeom 0410 one too many times in Seoul — plus the social media hype surrounding it — there was a certain anticipation that came with my first visit.Unfortunately, the star items — the jajangmyeon and the jjamppong — didn’t quite measure up.While the noodles were al dente and the right amount of chewy, both the black bean sauce and jjampong soup base lacked depth and flavour and most importantly, wok hei.The black bean sauce could have also been starchier to coat the noodles better.\xa0We were however surprised by the bokkeum jjamppong (stir-fried pork and seafood noodles, S$17), also known as the dry, stir-fried version of jjamppong — is something we hadn’t tried before.The bokkeum jjamppong had a good dose of wok hei, was adequately seasoned and had a generous serving of seafood.\xa0Another highlight for us was Paik’s tangsuyuk, which you can request for the sauce on the side for. It was also disarmingly addictive.\xa0I personally like my tangsuyuk with thicker batter, but Paik’s version, which had a thin layer of batter coated over its well-marinated pork, grew on me over the meal.\xa0We also liked that though we had opted for the sauce to be served with the pork, the pork slices didn’t get soggy.\xa0If you’re looking to try this hot, new spot, be prepared for a slight wait — we hear the wait can be upwards of 30 minutes at a time — and to take note of the short operating hours for both lunch and dinner.\xa0Want to check out more interesting Suntec City eats?

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/patisserie-cle-river-valley/:['How often do you find a place where you can get pastries from Michelin-starred pastry chefs at affordable prices?\xa0Founded in September 2018, Patisserie Cle (clé means “key” in French) is a homegrown brand known for its humble beginnings.It was started by two aspiring young pastry chefs, Germaine Li and Joy Chiam, who were striking out on their own after separate stints at two of Singapore’s Michelin-starred heavyweights. Li worked at French fine-dining outfit Les Amis while Chiam cut her teeth at the now-defunct Joel Robuchon Restaurant, a concept by the eponymous legendary French restaurateur.The first physical Patisserie Cle outlet — which has since closed — was opened in Paya Lebar in 2020, followed by a second takeaway-only space at Lucky Heights that’s located in the east of Singapore, near Siglap.To mark its fifth anniversary, pastry lovers will be treated to two new outlets from Patisserie Cle: A new takeaway venue at River Valley and a dine-in cafe concept at Dairy Farm. Flagship operations will be moved to the new River Valley location, which is slated for a Nov 25 opening. The Dairy Farm outlet is tentatively set for a mid-December opening.Both of these outlets will offer the brand’s iconic classics, and each will have its own outlet-exclusive item on the menu.For the Dairy Farm outlet, guests will be treated to an adorable Moo (S$10), a delicate treat enrobed in vanilla mousse that’s shaped to resemble a cow — a cute homage to the heritage of Dairy Farm. The dessert contains chocolate cremeux, hazelnut praline and a chocolate and almond disc layered on a chocolate sponge cake.On the other hand, Patisserie Cle’s flagship at River Valley will play host to the apple nutmeg cake (S$10), due to the area’s 19th-century roots as a nutmeg plantation.This entremet is made to guilefully resemble an apple.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/martins-kitchen-sg/:['Food enthusiasts who revel in fusion fare should check out Martin’s Kitchen, the latest outfit by Armenor Collective. The group is behind other contemporary European concepts such as Armenor and Chapter 3.\xa0Nestled along Zion Road, Martin’s Kitchen is a newer entrant on the scene, having opened its doors four months ago.At its helm is chef Cheng Wei Liang, who boasts more than a decade of culinary experience. He has graced the kitchens of various prestigious establishments, such as Super Loco, Ce La Vi and the now-defunct Brasserie Wolf.The swanky joint caught our attention because it professes to offer a gastronomic experience that blends three very different cuisines — namely the rich and vivid flavours of Hakka, European and Mexican food. Each dish is crafted to highlight the vibrant tapestry of ingredients from these cultures.\xa0When we asked chef Cheng what prompted him to focus on Hakka-inspired cuisine at Martin’s Kitchen, he shared that he wanted to pay homage to his late aunt, who was Hakka.\xa0While drawing inspiration from the heritage cuisine, chef Cheng’s creations are modern reinterpretations of traditional Hakka classics.The first round of appetisers arrived at our table, and we immediately tucked into the Hakka “lei cha” chopped salad (S$19). It’s a refreshing rendition of the ubiquitous lei cha (thunder tea) rice dish, which is accompanied by greens, tofu and pickled radish. The dish is usually doused with an aromatic soup comprising tea leaves and herbs.At Martin’s Kitchen, a fragrant matcha vinaigrette is favoured over the tea soup. The creamy dressing carries mellow herbaceous notes and a welcome sweetness that lifts the savouriness of the salad. Spiced peanuts are also tossed into the mix of freshly chopped greens and tofu for added crunch.The Hakka ravioli (S$19) is one of our favourite items on Martin Kitchen’s menu. These six ingot-shaped dumplings are an innovative take on the traditional ravioli. Sitting in a bath of spicy Szechuan sauce and Habanero oil, chewy dumplings hug an umami-laden pork and fish filling. For the final touch, a smattering of crispy yam fritters nest on the dish. The hallmark dish of Hakka cuisine is suan pan zi, also known as abacus seeds. Made with simple ingredients such as taro and flour, this dimpled, disc-shaped delicacy symbolises wealth and prosperity.\xa0Martin’s Kitchen has spun its creative twist to the nostalgic treat. Aptly named “abacus seed” gnocchi (S$26), yam is the star ingredient in the dish — and it perfectly replicates the chewy texture of Italian gnocchi.\xa0An amalgamation of leek, shimeiji mushroom, sakura ebi and dried cep adorn the platter, adding a variety of textures and flavours. A creamy in-house sauce also complements the gnocchi, though we think it’s a tad surfeiting. The “thunder tea” barramundi (S$29) is a drool-worthy dish that we’d return for. Tender and succulent Kuhlbarra barramundi take centre stage with its crispy, golden-brown skin. It sits on a robust thunder tea broth and is decorated with crispy silver fish, shimeiji mushroom and wakame.\xa0Chef Cheng recommends that we dip the fish into the sauce to best savour the tea’s earthy flavours. The portion is generous enough for two, so we’d order this as a sharing plate. Spice lovers will be enthralled by the Hakka noodles (S$27). It features housemade noodles made from premium flour for a buoyant, QQ texture. This is paired with red fermented pork that’s marinated in a nan ru (fermented tofu) paste, which imbues a salty, umami-rich depth into the meat.\xa0But the punchline is an accompanying fiery dip that’s a concoction of red habanero, jalapenos habanero and chipotle hot sauce. While it lends a red-hot kick of spice, it’s definitely not for the faint of heart — so use it sparingly.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50% off at picturesque date spots, including Wildseed Cafe at The Alkaff Mansion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatisserie Cle brings its well-crafted pastries to new River Valley flagship for fifth anniversary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Dessert is an indulgent affair with the Hakka mochi “qiba” (S$15).

This is one of the best desserts that we’ve tried thus far, and we gobbled up the dish in no time.You may have seen recreations of the classic thunder tea salad, but we bet you haven’t tried a Hakka-inspired thunder tea cocktail (S$18).\xa0It’s a decadent beverage comprising a harmonious blend of whiskey, artisanal rice milk, vibrant matcha and rich black tea.\xa0The final garnishes are silverfish and crunchy peanuts. The former is quite an acquired taste, and we did find the drink more palatable without it.\xa0Other bestselling alcoholic beverages on the menu include the full-bodied Martin’s negroni (S$20) and Flor de Sauco (S$18).

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/nasi-lemak-singapore/:['If there’s one dish that captures the essence of our local flavours, it’s nasi lemak in Singapore. Roughly translated to “fatty rice” from Malay, this iconic dish is known for its richness, which comes from the rice being cooked in creamy coconut milk.\xa0The perfect plate consists of fluffy aromatic rice (nasi) infused with coconut and pandan flavours that’s accompanied by a sweet potent chilli paste, sambal. Served with an array of sides such as crispy anchovies (ikan bilis), chicken, fried fish, egg and cucumber, this breakfast dish is a delectable marriage of sweet, savoury and spicy.\xa0From the unassuming hawker stalls to upscale restaurant offerings, Singapore is not shy of nasi lemak options for every budget and appetite.\xa0Whether you’re a seasoned nasi lemak connoisseur or an occasional indulger, we’ve compiled a list of 30 stalls for nasi lemak in Singapore, complete with our reviews and ratings, to guide your culinary exploration of this quintessential Singaporean dish.Adam Road Food Centre,\xa0 01-14, 2 Adam Road\nOpen: Friday to Tuesday (hours vary)What’s it about: Situated within the bustling Adam Road Food Centre, this stall draws a crowd seeking classic Muslim breakfast foods such as mee siam, lontong and nasi lemak. In the afternoon, the menu expands to include dishes such as mee hailam (Malaysian noodles with Hainanese influences), mee rebus and maggi goreng.Do note that Adam Road Food Centre is closed for renovation until Dec 31.\xa0Rating: 3/5Our thoughts: The nasi lemak set B (S$4), which included the basic components and a fried chicken wing, was reasonably priced for the area, but ultimately left much to be desired. We liked the rice, which carried a subtle coconut flavour, and the crispy ikan bilis, which brought texture to the dish.\xa0However, it fell short by not including some roasted nuts to provide a balance. The chicken was somewhat dry and under-seasoned, and the sambal, though moderately spiced, was rather sweet.\xa0\xa0Adam Road Food Centre, 01-02, 2 Adam Road\nOpen: Monday to Thursday (7am to 5pm), Saturday and Sunday (7am to 3pm)What’s it about: This stall could very well be the primary allure of Adam Road Food Centre, with some claiming it is one of the best nasi lemak in Singapore. Selera Rasa Nasi Lemak has forged quite a legacy since its establishment in 1998. Now run by second generation owner Abdul Malik Hassan, it offers only one thing on its menu — nasi lemak — with varying protein options such as otah and fish, so you can be sure it does this dish really well.\xa0Such is its acclaim that the Sultan of Brunei requested it when visiting Singapore. In addition, one of its loyal customers liked its dish so much, he approached Mr Malik for a partnership, and Crave was born.\xa0Rating: 4.5/5Our thoughts: The sambal was the star of the show — it’s a gritty, subtly sweet sensation that packed a powerful punch. It was in perfect harmony with the fluffy and fragrant basmati rice, and this combination had me craving seconds.\xa0The chicken wing meal only set me back S$5, a small price to pay for such big returns. The verdict? Almost perfect, but just shy of the full rating. Why? I wish the marinade had permeated the chicken beyond its thick batter.\xa0\xa0Adam Road Food Centre, 01-01, 2 Adam Road\nOpen: Wednesday to Monday (8am to 6pm) What’s it about: Sharing a space with the famed Selera Rasa, No. 1 Adam’s Nasi Lemak may be lowkey in comparison, but holds its own against strong competition. It’s run by a mother-son duo and only offers nasi lemak on its menu, too. Protein options here include the likes of fish, chicken, otah and beef rendang.Rating: 4/5Our thoughts: The chicken set (S$5) did not disappoint. The basmati rice began with a rich coconut note and transitioned to a more savoury profile with each bite. While enjoyable, the sambal delivered a fiery kick to the back of my throat, so approach it with care.\xa0The interplay between the crunchy ikan bilis and fluffy omelette created an unbeatable combination. However, the chicken, though crispy, fell short in terms of juiciness.\xa0\xa0Bugis Cube, 03-21, 470 North Bridge Road\nOpen: Monday to Friday (11am to 9pm), Saturday and Sunday (11am to 7pm)What’s it about: Tucked away in Bugis Cube is a cosy eatery headed by chef Gideon Tan. Drawing from his experience in Balinese and Western cuisine, he has created a unique fusion nasi lemak. What started out as a cloud kitchen eventually turned into a physical storefront, boasting a trendy tropical theme and restaurant-worthy plating. Husk Nasi Lemak’s menu features an array of protein options, including a signature chicken cutlet, sous vide beef rendang and fried tilapia fish.Rating: 4.8/5Our thoughts: The nasi lemak served here is a dish you’d be proud to share with your international friends. The chicken was incredibly tender and had a sweetness reminiscent of prawn paste chicken. The savoury rice was fragrant, and the crispy batter bits on top added a satisfying crunch.\xa0Paired with the mildly spicy chilli padi sauce, which offered an unexpected hint of lemongrass, this chicken wing set (S$8.80) was a perfect harmony of flavours and textures, even if it deviated from tradition. The gooey hanjuku egg and refreshing achar more than compensated for the soggy ikan bilis. It’s worth the occasional splurge.\xa0\xa0Fortune Centre, 02-23, 190 Middle Road\xa0\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (10.30am to 8.30pm)What’s it about: Marked by a vibrant neon sign board, Those Days Yong Tau Foo & Nasi Lemak, as its name suggests, is famed amongst patrons for its yong tau foo, but\xa0 also offers a number of a selection of nasi lemak sets. Some of them feature yong tau foo ingredients as accompaniments, a nod to the Chinese influence on the beloved dish.Rating: 3/5Our thoughts: The nasi lemak original (S$4.90) started out strong with an aromatic base of coconutty basmati rice. However, it starts to underwhelm with each component. The chicken, thinly battered, offered vague hints of curry powder and pepper.\xa0The sambal was smooth and had a prominent shallot taste, but leaned towards sweetness, which might be for some palates but not mine. Though it came with an extra tofu, it was not enough to make a lasting impression.\xa0\xa0Capitol Singapore, B1-36/36A, 13 Stamford Road\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (11am to 8.30pm)What’s it about: It’s nearly impossible to talk about nasi lemak without mentioning this iconic heritage brand. Ponggol Nasi Lemak, or sometimes known as Kovan nasi lemak , has been around since 1979, maintaining its status as the go-to nasi lemak spot for Singaporeans. With locations in Kovan, Tanjong Katong and Jalan Besar, the Capitol Piazza outlet stands out with its charming retro interior and an extensive menu, featuring desserts such as home-baked tapioca cakes.Rating: 4.5/5Our thoughts: As expected, Cafe Ponggol Nasi Lemak lived up to its reputation. I opted for the nasi lemak set 2 (S$7.50), which came with two wings that were deep-fried to crisp perfection. The sambal achieved a nice balance between sweet and savoury, and left a lingering spice.\xa0Dolloped onto the fluffy coconut-infused rice with a couple of sugary ikan bilis, this made for an addictive combination. The runny yolk of the fried egg was the cherry on top. Though it’s on the pricier side, the extra dollar or two is worth the guarantee.\xa0\xa0Multiple outlets islandwide\xa0\nOperating hours vary across storesWhat’s it about: Originating from a humble stall along Old Airport Road, Lee Wee & Brothers now boasts seven outlets islandwide. It serves up local favourites such as mee siam, curry chicken and of course, nasi lemak, using recipes passed down from Lee Wee’s mother. A beloved brand that prepares its ingredients, down to the chilli pastes and assam sauce, from scratch, it has been sharing a taste of its family recipes with diners for the past 20 years.Rating: 3/5Our thoughts: Despite the generous selection of ingredients such as otah and fishcake, the fried 3-joint wing nasi lemak (S$5.90) didn’t quite hit the mark for me. The rice was soft and flavourful, but lacked the coconutty goodness that is essential to a good base.\xa0The sambal had a saccharine-like sweetness, which I was not a fan of, and the chicken was the biggest letdown, with a thin and soggy breading that overshadowed its flavour. I also tried the honey chicken 3-joint wing (S$1.80), which had a decent marinade, but failed to redeem the dish.\xa0City Gate, 01-27, 371 Beach Road\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (11am to 8pm)121 Telok Ayer Street\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (10am to 2.30pm)What’s it about: Hailing from the vibrant neighbourhood of Damansara Uptown in Malaysia, food enthusiasts Mervyn and Simon are the creators of this authentic Malaysian nasi lemak establishment. With outlets at Beach Road and Telok Ayer, Uptown Nasi Lemak is the duo’s heartfelt homage to their beloved hometown flavours. Besides its classic nasi lemak, the pair also serve up local favourites such as kapitan chicken, rendang beef, and sambal sotong.Rating: 5/5Our thoughts: Its signature dish, the nasi lemak with ayam goreng berempah (S$8.70) — a kind of spiced fried chicken — was one of my personal favourites on this list. The coconut rice, delicately fragrant, served as the perfect canvas for the more robust flavours, especially the sambal, which delivered a gradual crescendo of spiciness.\xa0Its spiced chicken, generously seasoned and pleasantly infused with lemongrass, was a standout — succulent and substantial. With high expectations given the price point, the stall managed to exceed every one of them.\xa0\xa012 Sixth Avenue\nOpen: Monday to Saturday (6am to 1pm), Sunday (6.30am to 12.30pm)What’s it about: Founded in 1986, this unpretentious stall finds home within a coffee shop, making a name for itself as a hidden gem for nasi lemak. You can also find other local breakfast fare at Sixth Avenue Nasi Lemak, such as mee goreng, mee siam and lontong. As it often sells out before closing time, it’s wise to arrive early to avoid the potential disappointment.Rating: 4.5/5Our thoughts: The stall uses basmati rice, which imparts a nice nutty flavour to the creamy rice, and its homemade sambal boasted a unique semi-sweet, roasted flavour. My only qualm with it was the portion size, but for just S$0.30 more, you can indulge in an extra spoonful — a worthy investment, in my opinion.\xa0It also features turmeric fried chicken, a nasi lemak essential, enveloped in a beautifully golden batter. The ikan bilis however, leaned towards saltiness rather than flavour. All in all, the chicken nasi lemak set ($5.50) made for an incredibly satisfying breakfast.\xa0498 Jurong West Street 41, 01-426\nOpen: Tuesday to Saturday (6am to 1pm)What’s it about: West-siders flock to this no-frills nasi lemak spot located in Jurong West, that has been a stalwart in the area for more than 20 years. It’s said to be a strong rival to the much-lauded Boon Lay Power Nasi Lemak, another stall for famous nasi lemak in Singapore. While Latiffa Huri’s menu features a number of familiar Muslim fare such as lontong and mee rebus, what draws the crowd is the budget-friendly nasi lemak — it has a dedicated queue that can extend beyond an hour of waiting time.\xa0Rating: 4/5Our thoughts: My appetite was whet from the aroma of the sambal as I walked through the back alley. Fortunately, it did not disappoint. The sambal, a gritty and slightly sweet paste with fiery chilli seeds that came with its nasi lemak (S$3), stole the show. Though the rice had a decent coconut presence, it erred on the softer side.\xa0I added on the chicken wing (S$1.50), which took around 20 minutes due to the large number of orders, and found it to be satisfactory. While the meat lacked marination, the skin was perfectly crisp. The rest of the plate was decently packed with a fish and fried egg, but it was a pity that the ikan bilis was missing. Nevertheless, it was worth a try.\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0PDSS Coffeeshop, 318 Jurong East Street 31\nOpen: Thursday to Tuesday (6am to 2pm)What’s it about: Jumi’s Kitchen is a Muslim-owned eatery in the west dishing out an extensive menu of Malay breakfast classics such as nasi sambal goreng, mee soto and prata. It is loved among regulars for its affordable pricing and diverse selection of dishes, and is sure to satisfy any craving.Rating:\xa03/5Our thoughts: The basmati rice exuded fragrance, but missed the crucial coconut element, resulting in a predominantly savoury rice. The saccharine-like sambal also failed to fully satisfy.\xa0However its nasi lemak (S$3.50) managed to present an intriguing balance with contrasting flavour profiles. The chicken wing featured a surprisingly tasty turmeric marinade that permeated its meat, although it could have been heartier. Overall, the dish was okay, offering good value for money.\xa0Boon Lay Place Market and Food Village, 01-106, 221A Boon Lay Place\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (10.30am to 4pm, 5pm to 3.30am)What’s it about: What’s a nasi lemak list without the Boon Lay Power Nasi Lemak? Starting as a humble food centre stall in the west in 1971, Boon Lay Power Nasi Lemak has seen remarkable growth. Today, the third generation helms this family-run business, which boasts five outlets across the island and offers award-winning nasi lemak for both dine-in and delivery from a central kitchen. It’s known for its warm and fresh ingredients that deliver a flavourful punch.Rating: 4.5/5Our thoughts: The coconut flavour is prominent in the rice, yet the grains are overly soft due to the richness of the milk. They clump together, bordering on mush. The sambal, marked by the sweetness of the shallots, carries a mild spiciness that invites you to go back for more.\xa0The freshly fried chicken is crispy with just the right amount of batter, though the meat could use a little more marination. While each element in the nasi lemak chicken set (S$4) had some room for improvement, this was a plate that left me feeling satisfied.\xa0\xa0Boon Lay Place Market and Food Village, 01-126, 221B Boon Lay Place\nOpen: Sunday to Friday (7.30am to 2pm)What’s it about: Located in Boon Lay Place food centre, Xiang Feng Nasi Lemak has been serving up Chinese-style nasi lemak for more than three decades. Take your pick from more than 25 side dishes here, with crowd favourites such as mixed vegetables or crispy fried chicken cutlet, all offered at reasonable prices.Rating: 3/5Our thoughts: I searched hard for the coconut and pandan notes in the rice, but came up empty-handed. The sambal, disappointingly, underperforms with an off-putting sourness that left me uncertain. The chicken was decent and had a prawn-paste sweetness to it.\xa0Surprisingly, the ikan bilis saved this plate. Priced at an additional S$0.80, it comes coated in a glistening layer of sweet sauce while retaining a crunch. This nasi lemak (S$4) won some with its side offerings, but its foundation was its Achilles heel.\xa0\xa0413 Bukit Batok West Avenue 4, 01-208\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (6.30am to 10pm)What’s it about: Tucked away in an inconspicuous Bukit Batok coffeeshop, Nurul Delights Nasi Lemak is an extension of its original outlet located just 3km away. It’s well-loved among residents in the area, presenting generous portions of everyday staples such as mee rebus and lontong, all while maintaining wallet-friendly prices.Rating: 4.8/5Our thoughts: Though it was a little soft, the infusion of coconut and pandan flavours into the rice of its nasi lemak (S$3.50) impressed me. The sambal elevated the dish with its unique smoky sweetness and a lingering spice. The chicken was well-seasoned and had a lovely crisp, sharing the same charred smokiness as the sambal.\xa0If I were to nitpick, the meat was slightly tough, and the dish lacked the essential ikan bilis. However, the nasi lemak here is another personal favourite for its unique flavours and unbeatable value.\xa0Bukit Timah Plaza, B1-17, 1 Jalan Anak Bukit\nOpen: Monday to Friday (11am to 6pm)What’s it about: Despite its name, Nasi Lemak House.com is a nasi padang stall nestled within Bukit Timah Plaza. Here, you can savour a variety of comfort dishes, such as beef rendang, curry chicken and sambal goreng.Rating: 2.5/5Our thoughts: The rice in its nasi lemak (S$4) was fluffy and decently flavoured with coconut, but the sambal veered towards the sweeter and more liquid side, lacking the expected spiciness. Funnily enough, it complemented the chicken, which was salty and dry, but that’s about it. Adding on to the fact that portions were modest, the nasi lemak here was a bit of a bummer.\xa0\xa0\xa0Bukit Canberra Hawker Centre, 01-17, 21 Canberra Link\xa0\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (8.30am to 7pm)What’s it about: As its name suggests, the nasi lemak at Pangkor Island Nasi Lemak takes inspiration from Malaysian-style coconut rice. There are various protein options you can pick for your nasi lemak, which comes with light blue-hued rice tinged with blue pea flower. These include turmeric chicken, lemongrass chicken and seafood such as lemon satay fish.Rating: 3.5/5Our thoughts: While the beautiful pastel blue-pea rice in the nonya nasi lemak lemongrass chicken set (S$6.90) was soft and tasty, the essential coconut and pandan flavours were sadly a little too subtle.\xa0What it lacked in the base it made up with the lemongrass chicken — it was juicy, and aromatic. I also tried the turmeric chicken (S$4.50), which proved similarly tender and flavourful. The ikan bilis sambal, containing onion slices, provided a complementary sweetness to the salty anchovies. However, although the dish was visually appealing, overall the chicken was the only thing worth praise.\xa0\xa0156 Yishun Street 11, 01-106\nOpen: Wednesday to Monday (8am to 7.15pm)What’s it about: Coba Coba, meaning try try in Bahasa Indonesia, is an authentic Indonesian food stall by a father-son duo, drawing crowds for its affordable nasi padang and nasi ambeng. It dishes out more than 30 sides, with signatures such as tahu telur and sotong sumbat, and celebrates the togetherness of old-school communal dining among family and friends.Rating: 4/5Our thoughts: The paste-like sambal in its simple nasi lemak (S$3.80) offered a delightful kick that paired perfectly with the basmati rice, which remained fluffy despite being generously infused with coconut. The thickly battered fried chicken carried aromatic hints of prawn paste. Unfortunately, there was no ikan bilis, which we would have appreciated. While the dish didn’t look particularly appetising, it nevertheless delivered a commendable offering.Read our critics’ review on Coba Coba.\xa0\xa0Yishun Park Hawker Centre, 01-33, 51 Yishun Avenue 11\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (6.30am to 7pm)What’s it about: A Michelin-recommended nasi lemak establishment that was born at Yishun Park Hawker Centre in 2017, Nasi Lemak Ayam Taliwang has since grown a strong presence with 12 branches across the island. It’s a Muslim-owned eatery influenced by nasi uduk, Indonesia’s equivalent of nasi lemak, and showcases traditional sambal, chicken, and a unique sauce from the town of Taliwang.Rating: 4.8/5Our thoughts: The sambal was a hit — semi-sweet with a faint shrimp undertone and a touch of lemongrass, it delivered an impressive robust flavour. Combining it with the coconut-infused savoury rice and the ikan bilis nut mix created the perfect bite.\xa0I got the chicken wing set (S$4.20), and found the chicken to be well-marinated, delightfully crisp, and coated with the perfect amount of batter. Every component came together seamlessly. It’s the perfect everyday meal.\xa0645 Yishun Street 61, 01-320\nOpen: Saturday to Thursday (7.30am to 1pm)What’s it about: This Muslim-owned Yishun nasi lemak stall may not be widely recognised beyond the neighbourhood, but consistently draws lengthy queues from residents eager for a humble plate of nasi lemak in Singapore. The rice comes in a pandan-reminiscent pastel green hue, accompanied by the classic components, along with side choices including chicken patty, sausage and begedil.Rating: 4/5Our thoughts: While the rice in its nasi lemak ayam (S$3.50) was flavourful with pandan and coconut, it leaned towards a glutinous texture. The sambal offered a slight sweetness and tang, with a fleeting spice, which was balanced by the salty crunch of the ikan bilis. The chicken, which came in an appetising shade of turmeric orange, was flavourful, though its meat was modest. For its price, the dish is an exceptionally economical option, and well worth the 15-minute wait.\xa0\xa0504 Yishun Street 51, 01-01\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (8am to 8pm)What’s it about: This eatery offers a one-of-a-kind Thai-inspired nasi lemak in Singapore, an idea conceived by chef Nolee, who ran a food stall in Chiang Rai, Thailand, for 25 years. Now living in Singapore, she decided to serve a unique twist to the classic nasi lemak dish. While it does comprise the usual ikan bilis and omelette, Lavender Nasi Lemak includes Thai side dishes such as mango salad and Thai chilli sauce to balance out its richness.\xa0Rating: 3/5Our thoughts: The vibrant blue rice in my lavender rice with chicken wing (S$5), dyed by the blue pea flower, was undeniably coconut-rich. It however, lacked the necessary savoury flavours as a counterbalance. The chilli sauce and tangy mango salad contributed a lightness, but failed to make an impression. The marinade on the crispy chicken wing, though, is deserving of a mention. While I could appreciate its concept, the dish did not impress.\xa0\xa0Kaki Bukit 511 Market & Food Centre, 01-19, 511 Bedok North Street 3\nOpen: Saturday to Thursday (7am to 7pm)Serangoon Garden Market & Food Centre, 01-27, 49A Serangoon Garden Way\nOpen: Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday (7.30am to 3pm)What’s it about: Founded in 1996, this down-to-earth stall is famous among east-siders. Aliff Nasi Lemak also has an additional outlet at Serangoon Gardens, and both locations consistently attract a queue for a good plate of affordable nasi lemak, complete with a generous serving of sambal.Rating: 4.5/5Our thoughts: The rice in its nasi lemak (S$4) leaned heavily toward the savoury side, almost bordering on salty, but the sambal was a classic — sweet from the shallots, umami with belachan, and gradually building a pleasant spiciness.\xa0The turmeric flavours of the vibrantly yellow chicken came through strong, but erred slightly on the salty side. The ikan bilis provided a nice chew, but its saltiness felt somewhat redundant in an already savoury dish. If you prefer those flavours, the dish here would do it for you.\xa0\xa0Kaki Bukit 511 Market & Food Centre, 01-16, 511 Bedok North Street 3\nOpen: NAWhat’s it about: This old-school nasi padang stall, which has been serving its comforting fare for more than 20 years, offers a menu of timeless dishes such as asam pedas, mee siam, nasi rawon, and nasi lemak. Despite being in competition with the famed Aliff Nasi Lemak, located just a few stalls away, it draws its own loyal following with its reliable nostalgic flavours.Rating: 3.5/5Our thoughts: The richly infused coconut rice in my nasi lemak (S$3.50) was a little dry but paired nicely with the fluidic savoury sambal and the salty ikan bilis. The chicken was a tad tough and lacked the marination that was promised on its skin.\xa0 While it would do for an everyday fuss-free meal, it did not reach the heights of something extraordinary.\xa0\xa0122 Bedok North Street 2\nOpen: Wednesday to Sunday (9am to 2pm)What’s it about: This treasure of a nasi lemak spot lies tucked beneath a block of HDB flats in Bedok. Many residents and discerning foodies flock to this joint to get their nasi lemak fix at a low cost. While its menu includes other items such as mee rebus and mee soto, Azme Corner’s claim to fame lies in the nasi lemak sets, which offer every combination of ingredients to suit every appetite. As with all good food, there’s a queue that forms quickly the moment it opens.Rating: 4/5Our thoughts: I got Set B (S$3.50), which consisted of rice, chicken, ikan bilis and an egg. The rice here takes the cake — it was fragrant, fluffy and brimming with coconut flavours. The sambal, however, was a little too sweet for my liking. The chicken meat was soft and tender, with most of its flavour originating from the batter. Overall, the dish here offered exceptional value, and delivered a hearty plate.\xa0\xa09008 Tampines Street 93\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (9am to 2pm)What’s it about: Hidden in Tampines Industrial Park is Lawa Bintang, the stall that has transformed the ordinary nasi lemak into a luxury treat. Beyond the usual chicken and fish options, its protein selection includes the likes of decadent seafood such as squid, salmon and even lobster. Located at its nondescript venue since 2017, it has delighted many a lunch crowd with its unique offerings.Rating: 4/5Our thoughts: As the most expensive one on the list, the viral lobster nasi lemak (S$23) had high expectations to meet. After a 20 minute wait, the lobster was served in the shell with a bubbling layer of cheese. Its meat was fresh, succulent and pleasantly sweet. The sambal, mingling with the fragrant basmati rice, grew subtly in heat with each mouthful.\xa0I also had a side of fried chicken (S$1.80), but understandably, it couldn’t quite compete with the lobster. The only drawback was the ikan bilis, which was rather fishy, but this dish was an overall delight. Although it does have a hefty price tag, it’s worth the occasional indulgence.Explore other Tampines favourites here.\xa0\xa0Tampines Round Market, 01-14, 137 Tampines Street 11\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (7.30am to 1pm)What’s it about: As one of the more popular nasi lemak spots in Tampines, Nasi Lemak Specialist draws persistent lines throughout its operating hours. This family-run business made its debut in Tampines Round Market in 2017 and has been a beloved dining spot in the east since, offering both budget and value sets featuring beloved classics such as the begedil, otah and beef rendang.Rating: 3.8/5Our thoughts: The fragrant basmati rice absorbed a decent amount of coconut, although its texture suffered from some broken grains. The sambal bore a resemblance to bottled chilli sauce, leaning toward sweetness without much complexity.\xa0Thankfully, the fried chicken salvaged my chicken wing set (S$4). The distinctive turmeric seasoning infiltrated the meat beyond its crispy skin and momentarily erased my disappointment in the sambal, earning it kudos.\xa0\xa059 Marine Terrace\nOpen: NAWhat’s it about: This little family-run stall is a lesser known spot for Malay-style nasi lemak in the east, but it’s popular among its regulars. Besides nasi lemak, it also offers a decent selection of traditional desserts and snacks such as kuih-muih and epok epok.Rating: 4.5/5Our thoughts: The nasi lemak (S$4.50) here is an underrated gem. While a little clumpy, the coconut rice was flavourful, and the sambal elevates it to another level with an intense spice and smoky sweetness. The well-marinated fried chicken had an ideal amount of batter that maintains its crisp. An overall stunner.\xa0Changi Village Hawker Centre, 01-23/26, 2 Changi Village Road\xa0\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (24 hours)What’s it about: This super popular nasi lemak stall in Changi Village food centre needs no introduction, for it is often touted as one of the more well-regarded nasi lemak spots in Singapore. In operation since 1997, Mizzy Corner even occupies two stalls within the food centre, serving up authentic nasi lemak with a variety of add-ons.Rating: 4/5Our thoughts: I got Set A (S$4.50), which came with basmati rice. Fluffy and aromatic with coconut and pandan, the rice was the highlight. The sambal was mild and slightly tangy, and came with onion slices and ikan bilis, which created a harmonious blend of sweet and salty. The chicken was flavourful but nothing spectacular. Nevertheless, the dish, when complete with an egg, was a dependable and recommendable plate.\xa0\xa0Changi Village Hawker Centre, 01-04, 2 Changi Village Road\nOpen: NAWhat’s it about: This traditional nasi padang stall may not have a social media presence, but manages to attract a brisk-moving queue of patrons. It’s one of the more popular names in the hawker centre, known for dishes such as beef rendang and black ink sotong. The nasi lemak is also well-loved, often selling out before the day’s end.Rating: 4.5/5Our thoughts: The sambal in my nasi lemak (S$4) was unlike any other I’ve tried. With a dry and flaky texture reminiscent of finely chopped radish, it surprised with a nice combination of sweetness and spice and provided additional texture to the long grain coconut rice. A tender juicy wing completed this dish. The nasi lemak here proved to be a powerhouse in both taste and price in the Changi Village nasi lemak scene.\xa0\xa0Changi Village Hawker Centre, 01-28, 2 Changi Village Road\nOpen: Monday to Friday (11am to 9pm), Saturday and Sunday (11am to 7pm)What’s it about: In spite of its name, this stall is ironically less renowned than Mizzy Corner, but stands as one of the contenders for the best nasi lemak in the food centre. It only serves nasi lemak, and you can take your pick from a variety of sets depending on your appetite for the day.Rating: 2/5Our thoughts: The flavour of the rice could not hide how overcooked and clumpy the basmati rice was, and the sambal was just sort of sweet without any depth of flavour. The chicken was dry and spiced simply, while the ikan bilis were stale and inedible. Despite its bold claims, the nasi lemak set 3 (S$4.50) was a disappointing one.\xa0320 Joo Chiat Road\nOpen: Thursday to Tuesday (8.30am to 10.30am, 11.45am to 3.30pm)What’s it about: Located in the heart of Joo Chiat, this quaint takeaway stall offers a Malaysian-style rendition of the beloved dish, and is one of the go-tos if you’re looking for Katong nasi lemak. Everything, from its 18-ingredient sambal to its in-housemade coconut milk used for triple-steaming the rice, is crafted fresh on-site. Opened by the same folks behind Champion Bolo Bun, Dickson Nasi Lemak has been gaining popularity and is a must-try.Rating: 4/5Our thoughts: The coconut rice of our ayam goreng berampah nasi lemak (S$10.80) was soft and had a sweetness to it that was not entirely unpleasant when balanced with the salty ikan bilis. The chicken stole the show with its crispy and flavourful skin, tender meat, and the added texture from the crumbs.\xa0The sambal, on the other hand, was a letdown. It came mingled with onion and ikan bilis, and though the individual flavours were obvious, they were rather disjointed. Completed with a crispy fried egg, the nasi lemak was enjoyable — although a little too pricey for something that isn’t quite perfect.\xa0HungryGoWhere paid for its meals at these eateries.

Hoshino Coffee is a Japanese coffee brand that’s known for its hand drip coffee. The roasted Arabica coffee beans are carefully selected by the brand’s coffee blend specialist, Master Kanno, then delicately hand-dripped for you to enjoy. It’s not just about the coffee here, though. It is also known for its souffle pancakes — creamy and fluffy creations that are served with homemade whipped butter and your choice of syrup.Price range: $$Crowd favourites: Get the Hoshino blend (S$6.90) and savour its sweet chestnut flavour, or opt for the orihime blend (S$6.90), which has a savoury butter-biscuit flavour.

Lunch sets are available if you want to make it a complete meal, with each main coming with a mini soup and drink.\xa027 Lorong Mambong\nOpen: Tuesday to Thursday (3pm to 11pm), Friday (3pm to 1am), Saturday (1pm to 2am)Why visit? You might think of Drinks&Co as a place to go to get bottles of alcohol for a party, but did you know you can also dine at its outlets? Each of its branches offer a different concept and Drinks&Co Kitchen at Holland Village is a casual wine bar with an alfresco area for fun, laid-back dining.

But we do hope it keeps its popular Dalgona latte (S$6), a creamy whipped coffee that’s highly recommended for anyone who loves anything fluffy. Its cold brews (from S$5) were always a treat on scorching days and the matcha latte (from S$4.50) scored bonus points as it oozed a thick, earthy flavour.Still hungry?

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/redhill-food-centre/:['Singapore’s hawker culture is something that is familiar to all Singaporeans. Hawker centres, such as Redhill Food Centre, are a melting pot of diversity where people from different walks of life gather to dine and bond over well-loved local fare.\xa0Redhill Food Centre is a great place to enjoy a wide variety of hidden gems at economical prices while not getting shortchanged on quality and flavours.\xa0This neighbourhood hawker centre and market located at 85 Redhill Lane, also colloquially known as 85 Redhill Market, \xa0is just a short walk from Redhill MRT station — located not too far away from town, and yet still retaining its old-school charm. Think elderly hawkers who have been honing their craft for years, snaking queues for favourite stalls, and soya bean milk and grass jelly drinks in big plastic containers. How nostalgic.Here, we’ve compiled a list of the top 15 hawkers at this beloved Redhill hawker centre that is an ode to Singapore’s hawker culture for as long as it continues to serve both locals and tourists alike.\xa0Redhill Food Centre, 01-49, 85 Redhill Lane\xa0\nOpen: Wednesday to Saturday (12.30pm to 7.30pm), Sunday (7.30am to 1.30pm)Why visit? If someone were to mention “Redhill food centre carrot cake”, Fu Ming Cooked Food is the stall that immediately comes to mind. And deservedly so, given its claim to fame as a consistent recipient of the Michelin Bib Gourmand award since 2019.\xa0Specialising in fried carrot cake, the radish is handmade onsite and steamed from scratch, such that it’s extremely flavourful and soft — so soft that it melts in your mouth. Each plate of carrot cake is fried upon order, and topped with a glorious egg fried to perfection before it is served. The slight char on the pieces of radish say it all, and the wok hei is definitely on point. As a bonus, this stall also sells rice dumplings (bak zhangs) at S$2 a piece that will give any other bak zhang a run for its money.\xa0Price range: $Crowd favourites: The battle between black carrot cake and white carrot cake (from S$3) rages on — it’s hard to decide which one is better because both versions are delish in their own distinctive ways and have their own loyal camps. You just have to try both to decide which camp you belong to.\xa0\xa0Redhill Food Centre, 01-40, 85 Redhill Lane\nOpen: Monday to Friday (7am to 7.45pm), Saturday (7am to 6pm)Why visit? Satay bee hoon is now a dish that is an increasingly rare find in Singapore. But Redhill Food Centre boasts one of the best satay bee hoons in Singapore. A plate from Bak Kee Teochew Satay Bee Hoon comes with generous slices of lean pork, pig liver, cuttlefish, tau pok, cockles, and kang kong — all deliciously drenched with a rich, flavoursome sauce.Run by a young hawker named Samuel Lee, the stall was started by his grandfather, who got his start as a street hawker in the 1950s. This Redhill food stall was opened in the 1960s. Sam started learning how to prepare the dish from his grandfather when he was in his teens before taking over the stall recently.Price range: $Crowd favourites: Hands down the satay bee hoon (from S$4.50) for sure! The rich peanut sauce gravy is the star of the show, striking the perfect balance between sweet and savoury. The sauce is oozing thick, creamy and bursting with flavour, pairing superbly with the bee hoon when you mix everything up. The stall’s cuttlefish kang kong (from S$4.50) is also very appetising and deserves a mention!\xa0Redhill Food Centre, 01-35, 85 Redhill Lane\nOpen: Thursday to Sunday (11am to 8pm), Monday (11.30am to 6pm), Tuesday and Wednesday (11am to 6pm)Why visit? Run by Madam Chen Mei Ying and her son, Jia Xiang Mee Siam has been at Redhill Food Centre for more than 50 years, ever since Mdm Chen started helping her mother out at a young age.The winner at this stall is its mee siam broth — it’s an explosion of sweet, savoury, sour and spice all combined into one mouthful. The other item on the menu worth a mention is its lontong (S$3.50), with a coconut curry broth that is equally rich and flavourful. Paired with soft rice cakes, a good crunch of vegetables, and a whole boiled egg, it’s another bowl of tasty, umami goodness.\xa0\xa0Price range: $Crowd favourites: Its mee siam boasts a rich broth served with bee hoon, tau kwa, tau pok, and a whole boiled egg, alongside crunchy croutons that soak up the broth, and topped with a fresh lime. Combined with its special sambal chilli (done two ways!) that rewards spice lovers with that extra kick, this old school dish certainly stands out. And when priced so reasonably at S$3.50 a bowl, it’s virtually impossible to say no to this dish.\xa0Redhill Food Centre, 01-74, 85 Redhill Lane\nOpen: Monday to Friday (10am to 10.30pm), Sunday (9am to 10.30pm)Why visit? Hainanese curry rice is always a plate of beautiful mess, and Hong Seng Curry Rice at Redhill Food Centre does not fail to deliver. The 28-year-old stall serves a thick curry gravy that has a tinge of sweetness to it and is not too spicy, reminiscent of a Japanese curry.\xa0Each plate of rice with curry is generously topped with your protein of choice, such as a deep fried pork chop, chicken chop, char siew, pork belly or prawn fritters, among others. There is a wide variety of vegetables to select from as well, and of course this includes the cabbage chap chye that is a signature dish in Hainanese curry rice.Price range: $Crowd favourite: You can’t go wrong with the aptly named ‘4 heavenly kings’ meal (S$7.50) that comes with pork chop, chicken, braised pork, chap chye and a sunny side up — it offers a taste of the four main dishes of Hainanese curry rice. The pork chop has a nice crunch encasing juicy meat within, and the braised bork belly is tender, all of which makes for a satisfying meal.\xa0Redhill Food Centre, 01-07, 85 Redhill Lane\nOpen: Sunday to Tuesday, Friday and Saturday (6am to 2pm)Why visit? Have you ever heard of a pretty bowl of lor mee? If you haven’t, this is it. Shun Li Ah Ma Lor Mee’s bowl of lor mee is not only hearty and flavourful, but also IG-worthy. Each ingredient is expertly and neatly laid atop a large portion of noodles and gravy, then beautifully garnished.\xa0The other wonderful thing is how generous the stall is — a bowl includes thick and tender braised pork belly slices, freshly fried fish and ngoh hiang as well as half a braised egg. Pile on its chilli, minced garlic and vinegar and this is truly something special. If that isn’t enough, you can even request for more noodles for free.\xa0Price range: $Crowd favourites: What we love about many of these hawkers is that when they specialise in just one dish, it must mean that they do it superbly. This gooey bowl of lor mee (S$4.80) proves this point — it boasts a flavourful broth that is just the right viscosity (not too thick and not too watery) and the ingredients complement it well. A must-try.\xa0Redhill Food Centre, 01-19, 85 Redhill Lane\nOpen: Monday to Friday (11.30am to 8pm), Saturday (9am to 6pm)Why visit? As its name suggests, Yan Fried Bee Hoon is a stall that specialises in fried bee hoon but in fact it is most well-known for its fried chicken wings. In fact, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong was once spotted personally queuing a good 30 minutes for these chicken wings.\xa0While the original owner stopped selling here for a few years now, Eng Kee Chicken Wings has taken over the stall and its wings are just as good — well marinated and fried to perfection, boasting a mouthfeel that’s crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside.\xa0Have the wings alongside the tasty fried bee hoon (or go for fried mee or kway teow if you prefer), add a few more items such as luncheon meat, fishcakes and otah among others, and you have yourself a quintessential plate of local economic bee hoon.\xa0Price range: $Crowd favourite: The fried chicken wings (S$1.50 per piece) are the stall’s bestsellers. Don’t be surprised to see people ordering plates and plates of them! Oh yes, don’t forget to dip those wings into its special sweet chilli sauce as well.\xa0Redhill Food Centre, 01-92, 85 Redhill Lane\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (10.30am to 8.30pm)Why visit? Fei Zai Xiang Shao La Wanton Mee might look like a typical roast meat stall selling a combination of different meats, such as roast duck, roast pork and char siew alongside rice or noodles. Regulars will know, though, that this stalls serves a mean char siew that has just the right amount of fat and meat, as well as a lovely caramelisation. The result is a roast meat that leaves us with a tender, juicy bite, and a taste of smokiness.\xa0As the shop name suggests, wonton noodles is also one of its main offerings. Its version comes with springy and tasty egg noodles that are served with a savoury sauce, succulent char siew slices and plump, bouncy wontons.\xa0Price range: $Crowd favourites: As mentioned, the char siew at this stall has received rave reviews, so be sure not to miss this out when ordering! The wonton mee (S$4) comes with a nice portion of char siew, or you could go with char siew rice (S$4) as well.\xa0Redhill Food Centre, 01-66, 85 Redhill Lane\nOpen: Tuesday and Wednesday, Friday to Sunday (10am to 10pm)Why visit? Piping hot curry served in an old-school claypot that keeps the curry warm through the course of the entire meal — now this is a curry lover’s dream and it can be found right here at Redhill Food Centre.\xa0The menu at Hock Shun Traditional Homemade Curry comprises five different curries that you can choose from — chicken drumstick, chicken wing, vegetable, assam fish or yong tau foo — with a choice to have it with the usual white rice, its special turmeric rice or warm toasted bread.\xa0While each curry has its own specific flavour depending on the selected dish, one thing that is consistent across all the aromatic curries is that they are comfortingly homey and boast a thick, creamy texture with a good ol’ spice punch.Price range: $Crowd favourites: We recommend its homemade claypot curry chicken drumstick (S$5). The drumstick is chunky and the meat is fall-off-the-bone tender. The carbs are available at S$0.80 each, and if you would like some greens, there is also the option of adding a serving of curry vegetables at S$1.\xa0\xa0\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Junction Westgate opening with promos; will house 23 tenants, including new halal teppanyaki\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHawker Hustlers: Hipster hawker Ray Yeo of Bei-Ing Dimsum Club on reinventing dim sum and his love for all things Japan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xa0Redhill Food Centre, 01-77, 85 Redhill Lane\nOpen: Monday (10am to 8pm), Tuesday to Sunday (10am to 9pm)Why visit? While everyone knows that authentic xiao long baos are readily sold at several large restaurant chains, authentic mainland Chinese food can also be found in this heartland hawker centre at a fraction of restaurant prices.\xa0At Rong Xing La Mian Xiao Long Bao, we find freshly made xiao long baos each with their delicate skin housing a generous dollop of pork soaking in a delectable broth. The stall also offers other classics such as guo tie (pan-fried dumplings) and chilli oil dumplings. All dumplings are hand-wrapped onsite.There are some solid ramen noodle offerings, too, with a rather extensive menu of 18 unique and different types to choose from. What a treat!Price range: $Crowd favourites: Dumpling lovers, this place is for you. Its Shanghai xiao long baos come in a basket of six for S$4, but we don’t think that will be enough. Fortunately, it also offers a basket of 10 for S$6.50. While you’re at it, do also give the tomato lor mee (S$4) a try since it’s not a dish commonly found elsewhere. It’s simple but immensely hearty.\xa0Redhill Food Centre, 01-60, 85 Redhill Lane\nOpen: Thursday to Sunday (11am to 8pm)Why visit? What’s an old-school hawker centre without an old-school dessert stall? Qing Tian Desserts is just that, selling nostalgic hot and cold desserts such as cheng tng, tau suan and pulut hitam, among many others. The desserts here are easy on the pocket and perfect for a post-meal indulgence. With such a huge variety of desserts to choose from, there will be something for everyone.Price range: $Crowd favourites: On a hot day, any shaved ice dessert such as the classic ice kacang or its delicious ice mango milk (approximately S$2 and up) will be such a treat. If you prefer it warm, its tau suan (S$1.80) is a hot (pun intended!) favourite that is a bowl of sticky goodness, yet not overly sweet.\xa0Redhill Food Centre, 01-01, 85 Redhill Lane\nOpen: Monday to Wednesday (10pm to 9am), Friday to Sunday (5.30am to 10am) Why visit? Ali Fatimah Food Stall specialises in prata, whether you fancy kosong, egg, onion, cheese or plaster. And with its rather unique opening hours, you can be sure whatever it serves is really really good prata! Open only late in the night and often selling out before 9am, this stall certainly embodies the phrase “the early bird catches the worm.”\xa0Its pratas are beloved by so many for good reason — they have the perfect crisp on the outside, while the insides are chewy and fluffy. You can choose to have them either with their flavoursome mutton curry or a side of sugar.Price range: $Crowd favourites: Good prata should always be eaten as is, so you can enjoy the original flavours of the dough. Go for the kosong prata (S$1 each, with a minimum order of two). You can never go wrong with the egg prata (S$1.50 each) as well.\xa0Redhill Food Centre, 01-90, 85 Redhill Lane\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (6am to 1pm)Why visit? Start your morning with thick and velvety smooth porridge here at Redhill Food Centre. The warm bowl of pork porridge from Redhill Pork Porridge is filled with generous and fresh ingredients, which include tender pork slices, delicious minced pork balls, buttery-soft pork liver, and crispy fried you tiao.\xa0Catering to those who are more health-conscious, the porridge is tasty, yet not too salty. For those who prefer more flavour in their porridge, soya sauce and sesame oil may be added to your liking. Either way, this is certainly one bowl of porridge that is worth getting out of bed early for.Price range: $Crowd favourites: As the stall name suggests, pork porridge (from S$3.50) is the only item on the menu. Add an egg at just S$0.50 for added richness to the flavour and texture to the porridge!\xa0Redhill Food Centre, 01-25, 85 Redhill Lane\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (6.30am to 1pm)Why visit? One of four outlets in Singapore, Ru Ji Kitchen at 85 Redhill market is well-known for its handmade fishballs and fishcakes. This is what sets the stall apart from the many other fishball noodle stalls in Singapore. Its OG stall at Holland Drive received a Michelin recommendation, but the food at Redhill is comparable, too.The quality of the fishballs is apparent from the beautiful bounce you get from each bite. The texture of the noodles is great as well, and when coated with its sambal chilli sauce that packs a serious spice punch, along with a dash of vinegar, this is truly a tasty bowl of noodles.\xa0Price range: $Crowd favourites: A bowl of mee pok ta (from S$3.50) is always a Singaporean favourite. And if you are as much of a fan of its fishballs as we are, we’d say go for more!\xa0\xa0Redhill Food Centre, 01-28, Blk 85 Redhill Lane\nOpen: Monday and Tuesday (7.30am to 9.30am), Wednesday and Friday (7.30am to 10.30am), Saturday (7am to 10.30am)Why visit? Here’s another place that’s for the early birds. Its popularity is apparent from how the queue starts well before the stall even opens, and then it sells out in just a few hours. There is the option of either soup or dry noodles. The soup version is a bowl of warm goodness, with a herbal broth that is not too heavy on the palette. The dry version is a mix of its special chilli blend, shallot oil, fried shallot bits and coriander — simple yet flavour-packed.Now, what the stall is really known for is its duck. The meat is marinated and braised beautifully, such that the end result is a satisfying and tender bite alongside a hint of herbs. Gizzard lovers will be happy to know that they can order some as add-ons, too.Price range: $Crowd favourites: We’d go for the dry braised duck noodles (from S$4) since it comes with its own bowl of herbal soup. Remember to go early before it sells out!\xa0Redhill Food Centre, 01-41, 85 Redhill Lane\nOpen: Sunday to Saturday (10.30am to 2.30pm)Why visit? Teochew porridge has always been a comforting meal that is reminiscent of homecooked food. The warm bowl of plain white porridge is served alongside dishes of your choice — fish, pork, chicken, vegetables, tofu, egg — basically anything and everything.\xa0The wide variety of Teochew dishes offered at Shi Le Yuan Teochew Porridge are simple yet fresh, and more importantly, tasty and authentic. It’s the perfect meal for anyone looking for something lighter and more balanced, and it’s great to be able to pick and choose specific dishes that you know you’d enjoy for sure.\xa0*Do note that there is a kway chap store with the same name Shi Le Yuan (01-82) in the same hawker centre.\xa0Price range: $Crowd favourites: Teochew porridge stalls are always known for their fish, and here, the different types of fish offered are all fresh and well-cooked. Its minced pork with fermented black bean is also a popular choice. Pricing differs based on the dishes selected, but you can be guaranteed good value and honest pricing here — its loyal following is a testament to that.For more hawker eats, check out our guides on the best oyster omelette and fishball noodles in Singapore.Hong Seng Curry Rice, Ru Ji Kitchen’s Holland Village outlet, Shi Le Yuan Teochew Porridge and Redhill Food Centre are on the GrabFood Delivery Service and offer free delivery (up to S$3 off) with GrabUnlimited.\xa0\xa0Do explore the new GrabFood Dine-in for awesome deals.Alternatively, you can book a ride to stalls in Redhill Food Centre.AuthorCelestine has a few big loves in life — family, writing and good yet value-for-money food.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/nowafter-cafe-orchard/:['\xa0Korean-style cafes are kind of a different beast from Western brunch places, and both have a place of their own in the brunch circuit.\xa0While the latter typically brings larger groups together to socialise over food such as avocado toast, eggs benedict and smoked salmon bagels, the Korean cafes tend to focus on unique and photogenic aesthetics.Minimalist and industrial designs are the current trend, and the food and drinks must, if anything else, be Instagram-able.One of the most popular names in Seoul is Nudake — a group of cafes run by the Korean eyewear brand Gentle Monster — with its stunning interiors and photogenic pastries and desserts.\xa0Its flagship in Gangnam, in particular, is all decked out in a minimalist industrial grey with concrete walls, black metal tables, and yes, black and white-themed bakes.So when I heard about a monochrome-themed cafe called Nowafter Cafe\xa0taking over the gorgeous rooftop space on top of Design Orchard (it was previously occupied by Alchemist for more than three years before it moved to The Heeren this May), my first thought was: “Y’know, that’s kind of familiar.”Despite the similarities, Nowafter Cafe doesn’t overtly describe itself as a Korean-style cafe, preferring to stand out on the merit of its food and drink offerings.\xa0Not much is known about the owners (though word on the street is that they used to run an Airbnb and cafe in Korea).The venue hasn’t changed much from the Alchemist days, with the same concrete columns, walls, and grungy flooring, with the only noticeable changes being the seating, tables, and counter — now all in black, metal, and white.The menu is intentionally kept small — it doesn’t have a proper kitchen here, anyway — to concentrate on a few bakes, desserts and coffee- and tea-based beverages.\xa0Apparently, the cafe team was absolutely floored during the first two months of opening since August, with many items running out well before closing time, though things seem to have mellowed out during my weekend visit in October.In general, Nowafter Cafe does its drinks a tad better than its bakes, so if you’re looking for a place to read, work, or people-watch over an einspanner, it’s a good place for that. There’s, of course, also the possibility of better dishes that I hadn’t tried.The cosy space and soothing music in the background (from lofi favourites to Laufey) combined with lush greenery outside, makes for an attractive atmosphere to soak in, and it’s one I’ve loved since its previous incarnation as Alchemist.Having said that, the prices here are a tad steep.The Charkey bun (S$13) is the best bake of the lot, even if a charcoal black bun with white cream oozing out isn’t the most appetising-looking thing ever.\xa0A take on the once-viral Korean garlic cheese bread, the middle is supposedly filled with truffle sour cream, though I can hardly taste any truffle. In true pull-apart bread style, it’s shaped like a flower so you can pluck out the ‘petals’ to eat each segment slowly.\xa0While soft and light, the crumb structure is surprisingly tight and chewy like a pau, rather than fluffy, with a strong butter and garlic taste. There are slightly tough bits of mozzarella cheese embedded inside for extra savouriness.It’s a pleasant combination of tangy garlicky savouriness in an aesthetic package — no wonder it’s the most Instagram-ed dish here.The uji matcha einspanner (S$9.50) is deliciously earthy, bittersweet, and complex. For the uninitiated, uji matcha is the highest grade of matcha made from only the best tea leaves with none of the astringency.\xa0Nowafter Cafe adds virtually no sugar (I’ve never really liked the sugar-packed einspanners in Korea) so as not to disturb the rich matcha flavour, with the only sweetness coming from the velvety thick cream itself.\xa0One thing to note is that the einspanners here comprise whipped cream on top of a latte, rather than on an espresso or americano. For the espresso einspanner (S$9.50), we added oat milk (+S$1 for Oatside) hoping to balance out the milky taste that might otherwise bury the taste of the coffee. The result is a medium-bodied fruity and nutty coffee that goes great with the lightly sweet whipped cream.Spinach strata (S$10) is an interesting choice to put on a cafe menu, because strata is essentially a bread and egg casserole that, while can be made ahead of time, takes a bit of reheating in the oven to get to a nice texture.\xa0Too short, and it tastes greasy and mushy, and too long, and it can get a bit dry.\xa0Mine was the former, which is a little disappointing because the fillings are quite decent: Spinach, caramelised onions and honey baked ham soaked in eggy goodness, with a cheddar crust on top that could have been crispier. The dark cocoa meringue brownie (S$8) looks pretty but tastes… okay. The meringue is crispy and light with a hint of vanilla, but lacks the delicate airiness and melt-on-the-tongue texture that you’d expect of a really good hard meringue.\xa0The dense brownie as well, is served barely warm and takes a bit of muscle to push the fork through the tough fudge.\xa0Taste wise, the black Dutch-process cocoa has a pronounced deep chocolate flavour that’s not really bitter, and there are what looks like small bits of milk chocolate scattered throughout the brownie, adding sweetness here and there.I was also looking forward to the Blackmisu (S$13) but found it just average. It’s not so much a tiramisu (where’s the mascarpone?) as it is a mega crumbly cake layered with a soft coffee liqueur cream.\xa0I say crumbly, because the moment you remove the plastic covering, the whole thing collapses onto the plate, and if you’re not careful, the table.The cake itself is moist and airy, and the use of alkalised cocoa powder again means a rich chocolate flavour that’s accentuated with a tinge of sweetness.The lightly-whipped cream has a tiny hint of coffee-flavoured liqueur but it’s not much. It’s overall a very simple dessert that lacks complexity and depth for the price.Is it conducive to conversation? Only during less busy periods — otherwise, the echo makes the space rather loud.Is a reservation necessary? First come, first served.How to get there? Nowafter Cafe is on the third floor of Design Orchard, a three-minute walk away from Somerset MRT station.HungryGoWhere paid for its meal at this restaurant for this review. Still hungry?

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/cheng-mun-chee-kee-vs-authentic-mun-chee-kee/:['In our new series Food Feuds, we visit competing local food stalls known for their rivalry and try to find out which one does it better.Pig’s organ soup is one of those dishes that you either enjoy or don’t. Those who don’t eat pork , dislike porkier dishes, or barf at the thought of eating innards are clearly out.\xa0Even then, there’s a much higher chance of stumbling across an average or even subpar bowl of the tangy offal soup at food courts and coffee shops, for two reasons.\xa0One: This Teochew classic, which combines more ‘acceptable’ ingredients such as meat balls, pork belly, and liver with adventurous ones ranging from tripe and kidney to intestines, is not easy to master; and two: The better ones usually require a trip across the island.\xa0Interestingly, two of the more famous pig’s organ soup in Singapore, Cheng Mun Chee Kee and Authentic Mun Chee Kee, sit within walking distance of each other in Jalan Besar.\xa0Another family feud, it seems! There’s been a bit of debate as to which is the better one, and you might have guessed from similarities in their names, both originate from the same place but eventually parted ways.The original recipe creator, Chow Mun Chee, started the business in 1973 with his family before the business was bought over in 2010 by David and Derek Tan, who hoped to ride on the eatery’s success.\xa0While some of Uncle Chow’s family members continued running the Foch Road stall in the Cheng Mun Chee Kee brand, the main man himself moved on to help start Authentic Mun Chee Kee with the entrepreneurs.\xa0A bunch of new dishes such as claypot liver and black vinegar pig trotters were also added to the new brand, while Cheng Mun Chee Kee kept to its pig’s organ mainstay along with a few extra sides.24 Foch Road\nOpen: Sunday to Thursday (10am to 3.30am), Friday and Saturday (10am to 4am)With queues pretty much every hour of the day, this popular stall has two units to themselves, one of them being a dedicated seating area — though I always prefer dining at the tables right next to the streets.\xa0Remember to get a table before making your payment at the counter, as the staff will ask for it. Note that you can select your desired pork cuts or innards if you don’t feel up for trying everything.The service is extremely fast, with both my pig’s organ soup and steamed minced pork (the signature staple at both brands) arriving almost immediately.Soup: 4/5I’ve had this soup plenty of times, mostly because it’s more closely situated to me. It’s darker, cloudier, and porkier than Authentic’s with a slight herbal and peppery flavour, and tanginess from generous amounts of salted mustard leaves.\xa0It’s rich and robust, and not because it’s laden with MSG, but how long the soup has been simmered. Ingredients: 3.5/5What a delicious pork belly, which comes with a good proportion of fat to lean meat, sliced just thin enough to still provide a satisfying bite. The kidney was tender with a smooth, chewy texture, as were the stomach pieces. However, not everything was exceptional. The meat balls were well-formed and firm, but not spectacular. While the liver was well-cleaned, the smaller pieces still had a bit of that undesirable powdery texture that comes with being a tad overcooked.\xa0The lean meat, too, was on the tough side with a rough texture. The small intestine as well, had a bit of gaminess, though I can only imagine how difficult this part is to clean.Chilli: 4.5/5Fabulous, fabulous chilli — so good that there’s even a sign requesting customers not to bring their own containers to take it home. Cheng Mun Chee Kee’s chilli is not too spicy, but has strong sour notes with a hint of sweetness that also helps to cut off any lingering offal taste. One saucer isn’t enough!Steamed minced pork with salted fish: 3.5/5Both brands have their own version of this Teochew favourite, which goes great with rice. Cheng Mun Chee Kee’s take is wet and soft, bordering on the salty side because of the copious amount of salted fish.\xa0The crunchy chestnuts and soft braised peanuts help balance this out, though. While very tasty, I find this version to be a bit weak texture-wise, and the wetness makes it a little mushy.\xa0Value: 4/5\xa0The large pig’s organ soup (S$7) comes chock-full of ingredients, and will definitely fill you up. It’s definitely good value for what you’re paying. The soup is refillable — simply bring your bowl to the side of the kitchen for a quick top up. The minced meat patty is cheaper than Authentic Mun Chee Kee’s at just S$3, but is smaller in size.Final score: 78%\xa0207 Jalan Besar Road\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (10.30am to 2am)With Cheng Mun Chee Kee fresh in my mind, I took a mere 500m stroll to Authentic Mun Chee Kee for my second meal. Both stalls were equally packed with people, and I can understand why they each have a loyal following.\xa0Each offers a relatively different bowl of pig’s organ soup, and this one also has an expanded menu of claypot dishes.The stall is a tad more modernised than Cheng Mun Chee Kee, with photos of the original stall and Uncle Chow plastered as wallpaper at the sides. Efficiency-wise, they were just as fast, though the service is quite lacklustre — don’t be surprised if they’re a little rude and loud.\xa0Plus, it’s cash terms only, so be sure to come prepared or like me, you’ll have to walk a few minutes down to Berseh Food Centre to withdraw money.Soup: 4.5/5Authentic Mun Chee Kee has a clearer and lighter soup that focuses on savouriness rather than a strong porky flavour. It has just the right amount of umami and tanginess from the crunchy mustard greens without burying the flavour of the pork meats or innards, which is refreshing.\xa0It’s the kind of subtle, clean soup you can keep drinking without feeling jelak, and yes, I finished every drop.Ingredients: 4.5/5If Cheng Mun Chee Kee is good at removing the offal taste from the innards, Authentic is even better.\xa0The liver was cooked perfectly (by that, I mean barely at all) with a very soft and slightly more bouncy texture — and none of the aggressive grainy taste. The sliced lean meat is cut larger and was very tender and juicy to the bite, while the belly was also soft and flavourful. The stomach slices and intestines are also bigger, so I could taste their chewiness, which adds more dimension to the bowl of soup. The pork balls were firm and tasty but nothing too special. Otherwise, I much prefer the ingredients here.Another thing — even though I had asked for all parts to be included in the soup, there was no kidney to be found inside, so I can’t comment on that.Chilli: 3.5/5Authentic has a more spicy chilli that’s quite balanced between savoury and sourness, and goes well with the meats. While still very good, I would say Cheng Mun Chee Kee has the better chilli.Steamed minced pork with salted fish: 4/5Authentic Mun Chee Kee does a very different version that has a higher ratio of pork to salted fish, as well as using leaner minced meat. The result is a dense patty that’s still full of moist and tender pork, the flavour balanced out by small bits of salted fish.\xa0I like the consistency and mouthfeel of this version more, and even the braised peanuts seem to be done a little better — it provides a natural nutty flavour and is braised soft enough to chew with little effort.\xa0Value: 4/5Like Cheng Mun Chee Kee, the soup is refillable. The large pig organ’s soup (S$7) is very similar in size to Cheng Mun Chee Kee — only there seems to be more liver and less lean meat, which I like. The minced meat patty here is more expensive at S$5.50, but it’s almost twice the size as the one we had at Cheng Mun Chee Kee, justifying its price.Final score: 82%The winner: Authentic Mun Chee KeeThis was a hard one. Both places offer great value when you take into account portion sizes and quality, but Authentic Mun Chee Kee ultimately wins for having more consistency and a touch more finesse for all components.\xa0It still boils down to your personal taste and preferences on what makes a good pig’s organ soup. I prefer a cleaner well-balanced broth, which together with their comparatively more tender meat, makes for a very satisfying bowl.This was my conclusion, as full as I was from eating at Cheng Mun Chee Kee just 30 minutes earlier, though I know others will prefer the punchier, porkier, version there.\xa0If you can get past the lack of service at Authentic Mun Chee Kee, then you’re in for a very satisfying and hearty bowl that won’t disappoint.HungryGoWhere paid for its meals at both stalls for this article.Cheng Mun Chee Kee and Authentic Mun Chee Kee are on the GrabFood delivery service and offer free delivery (up to S$3 off) with GrabUnlimited.Alternatively, you can book a ride to Cheng Mun Chee Kee and Authentic Mun Chee Kee.\xa0Do explore the new GrabFood Dine-in service for awesome deals.AuthorGary eats and knows things, which he attributes to over 30 years of eating and drinking — surely that must count for something, he surmises.

https://hungrygowhere.com/critics-reviews/saizeriya-vs-milan-shokudo/:['In our new series Food Feuds, we visit competing local food stalls known for their rivalry and try to find out which one does it better.Let’s get this out of the way: Saizeriya isn’t fancy food. It’s that trusty pal we go to when we’re looking for a cheap and filling ‘Italian’ meal (how can you beat escargot for S$5.90?) and that’s likely all it’ll ever be.\xa0It’s convenient for families with small kids and people who want to eat a variety of things at low prices — mostly because it’s conveniently located in many shopping malls around Singapore.\xa0Twelve years have passed since the first Saizeriya opened here in Liang Court, and the brand has enjoyed virtually zero competition in that unique category of low-cost Japanese-Italian food — till this quarter, that is.In September, Japan Foods Holding — the group behind brands such as Afuri, Extra Virgin Pizza, Menya Musashi, and the Shokudo range of restaurants — launched Milan Shokudo in Junction 8.\xa0It’s a restaurant with an uncanny resemblance to Saizeriya, its menu comprising familiar dishes such as doria, hamburgs, pasta, and pizza. Reviews of the restaurant have constantly compared it to Saizeriya, so naturally we had to put that to the test.“Saizeriya dupe”, “Saizeriya killer” are just some names the online community has used to describe Milan Shokudo. To be fair, the new restaurant has never tried to compare itself to Saizeriya.\xa0Its essence is Japanese-Italian food, or itameshi as it’s known in Japan. Saizeriya, founded in 1997 and now boasting more than 400 outlets in Japan, just happens to be the largest chain for this style of food.\xa0It’s quite possible that Milan Shokudo referenced Saizeriya for its menu (down to the suspiciously similar free-flow drinks bar) and brand design — it’s just a suspicion; there’s otherwise no direct connection that I’m aware of.\xa0Milan Shokudo brings its own unique twist and a fresh take on familiar dishes. Plus, the restaurant uses no pork or lard in its food, having received its halal certification last month.\xa0Multiple outlets islandwide\xa0\nOperating hours vary across storesOne thing about Saizeriya is that every outlet is very consistent, from the modest ‘traditional’ decor and lighting fixtures to the tight leatherette booth seats and tiled flooring supposedly inspired by Milan’s trattorias. The food is just as dependable, with little to no difference between the different locations. The large laminated menu is extensively filled with cold and hot Italian staples and other fusion dishes, from pasta and pizza to grilled steaks and fish, as well as plenty of appetisers and desserts. The fact that you can get a massive variety of food at low, low prices is what makes this place so incredible.Getting into the restaurant was a breeze and the food arrived very promptly, even during dinner time. There’s not much in the way of service, but then again, all prices listed here are nett. In this economy? We’re not complaining.For the sake of this article, we tried dishes that are the same, or very similar, across both restaurants.Corn soup (S$2.90): 3/5The soup here has a light sweet corn flavour with some depth, but it could do with a bit more salt. The corn kernels inside are not very plump and don’t have much flavour though, like they’ve been cooked for too long. Garlic focaccia (S$2.30): 2/5I was looking forward to this one, but the focaccia is not as good as I remember. The bread looks good, but is actually cold and limp. There’s not much in the way of garlic or salt. Underseasoning seems to be a trend so far.Milanese doria (S$4.90): 3.5/5Saizeriya’s doria is a classic. Japanese short-grain rice is topped by a white cream and Bolognese sauce, then topped with cheese and baked till everything is melted and soaked in. The rice is a tad hard, and could have been soaked longer, but it’s otherwise a decent dish.Carbonara (S$5.90): 2.5/5Saizeriya’s pasta is always reliably al dente, but the sauce is hugely lacking in this dish. The carbonara sauce is more like a watery nacho cheese soup so even if you try to mix it together with the spaghetti, it’s too wet to cling on properly.\xa0The thin pieces of bacon are nothing to shout about, and the saving grace is the onsen egg on top, which helps to emulsify the sauce a bit better. There are better pasta dishes at Saizeriya.Cheese pizza (S$7.90): 3.5/5It doesn’t get more simple than this mozzarella and cheddar cheese pizza, which tastes exactly how it sounds: Sharp, salty and umami. It’s a very commercial taste but we can’t complain when it’s this cheap. The crust (if you can call it that) is thin and crispy. Hamburg (S$6.50): 2.5/5The beef hamburg patty is on the leaner side, and is a bit more dense and dry than the one from Milan Shokudo, though the sauce is nice and rich with umami, giving this a more Japanese taste. Like the corn soup, the corn kernels are tough and bland rather than soft and buttery, and the wedges are pale and soft — both are not so tasty.Pudding (S$3.90): 3/5The pudding here isn’t too bad — slightly delicate and custard-y but not until it melts in the mouth. It is extremely sweet when it first hits the tongue, but mellows out to offer a bit of toasty caramel notes.Value: 3/5It’s great to know that Saizeriya’s prices have barely increased over the years and are still nett. I can’t think of another air-conditioned and full-service restaurant at this price range, which is cheaper than many coffee shops. The food is just passable, but it’s really the price that keeps people, especially families with kids, coming back.Final score: 58%\xa0Junction 8, 02-34/35, 9 Bishan Place\nOpen: Daily (11.30am to 10pm)Northpoint City, 02-128/129, 1 North Point Drive\nOpen: Daily (11.30am to 10pm)Westgate, 02-07, 3 Gateway Drive\nOpen: Daily (11.30am to 10pm)While Saizeriya tries to replicate the vibes of a classic Italian trattoria, Milan Shokudo’s interior feels a bit more commercial and upscale, with bright strip lighting and rattan panellings.\xa0The booth seats have patterns in stripes of red, green, and white (like the Italian flag) and there are vintage-style lamps and pictures of famous Italian landmarks strewn on the walls.\xa0It’s still a warm and inviting ambience, with adequate spacing between tables so you can mostly converse without being overheard, though it can get loud during peak hours. Arriving on a weekday evening, we queued for a good 15 minutes before entering, but service was prompt and cordial once we got in.Milan Shokudo’s menu is generally smaller than Saizeriya’s but you’ll find many of the same core items here, with several differences in ingredients and presentation. Muslim friends will be pleased to know that the Junction 8 outlet was recently issued its halal certification in October, with the other two expected to follow suit in coming months.Corn soup (S$3.90++): 2/5Interestingly, Milan Shokudo’s corn soup is the opposite of Saizeriya’s: It’s pale in colour and taste diluted, with not much in the way of corn flavour. The corn kernels inside are plump and sweet, but doesn’t really make up for how lacking in flavour the soup is.Garlic focaccia (S$3.90++): 3.5/5\xa0Milan Shokudo serves its garlic focaccia in slices, and it’s more fragrant and served partially warm, indicating that it’s been recently baked. There are decent air pockets from fermentation and the dough is only slightly chewy. I didn’t get much garlic flavour from this, even from the little bits of chopped up garlic spread around the focaccia.Milanese doria (S$8.90++): 4/5The doria here is quite different from Saizeriya’s. For one, the rice used appears to be arborio or carnaroli, which is rice normally used for risotto. It’s similar to Japanese short-grain rice, but has a more toothsome centre. The rice also has a creamier texture.There’s a more distinct separation between the different layers — a tangy tomato paste, white bechamel sauce, and little bits of nicely browned minced beef — and is less cheesy. We prefer this version.Smoked duck carbonara (S$12.90++): 4/5Did you know Milan Shokudo uses handmade pasta? That’s really good value. The pasta is firm and bouncy, and frankly a lot tastier than the one from Saizeriya — the sleek carbonara sauce coats around each strand.\xa0But if we’re being strict, it’s not so much cheesy and peppery (as a traditional carbonara should be) as it is garlicky. The poached egg is cooked perfectly, and the lean smoked duck adds good flavour to the dish. Cheese pizza (S$8.90++): 4/5The quattro cheese pizza is a lot more interesting than Saizeriya’s basic cheese pizza. Using four cheeses — a sharp cheddar, a rich-umami parmesan and melty mozzarella form the base, while several pieces of camembert are strewn around — means you get a whole lot more dimension of flavours.\xa0There’s also a small tub of syrup on the side that balances out the salty and slightly tart flavours with its complementary sweetness. We’re docking some points for the lacklustre crust, which is flat and rather biscuit-like.Hamburg (S$10.90++): 4/5Milan Shokudo’s demi glace hamburg puts the spotlight on a very juicy chicken and beef patty that’s chunky and well-balanced between lean and fat. The demiglace sauce is quite typical though, like what you’d get at coffee shop Western stalls. The accompanying sides are so much better: Sweet corn that’s soft and buttery, and crispy fries that are fluffy inside.Pudding (S$6.90++): 2/5I’ve had pudding in Japan, but this supposedly housemade Japanese pudding is not it. Rather than bouncy, the texture is firm and dense. The pudding itself is also sweeter than the syrup, which tastes watered-down and lacks complexity (plain sugary taste rather than caramel notes).Value: 3/5It’s not as cheap as Saizeriya, but there’s no doubt that Milan Shokudo offers great-tasting casual Italian fare at affordable prices. I think it’s great value for the quality and portion of food you get.Final score: 66%The winner: Milan ShokudoIt’s a clear win for the ‘Saizeriya-killer’, though it remains to be seen whether the taste and quality will drop in a few months — something that’s common among new restaurants.To be fair, Milan Shokudo commands relatively higher price tags compared to Saizeriya, with many of the dishes going for almost double what you’d pay at the latter. Is that higher level of cooking worth the extra dollars?\xa0While a meal at Milan Shokudo won’t break the bank, there’s no doubt Saizeriya is still much cheaper, so it really depends on what you’re looking for.\xa0Saizeriya is the cheaper, more fuss-free fix, while you could perhaps, just maybe, bring a new date to Milan Shokudo (no guarantees though, this is definitely not love advice). Now, if only it could open an outlet in the east, I’d surely pay it a few more visits.HungryGoWhere paid for its meals at both restaurants for this article.Saizeriya and Milan Shokudo are on the GrabFood delivery service and offer free delivery (up to S$3 off) with GrabUnlimited.Do explore the new GrabFood Dine-in service for awesome deals.\xa0You can book a ride to Saizeriya and Milan Shokudo.AuthorGary eats and knows things, which he attributes to over 30 years of eating and drinking — surely that must count for something, he surmises.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/running-man-singapore-filming/:['Have you heard the news? Korean variety show sensation Running Man was filming an episode in Singapore!The popular series first started in July 2010 and is centred around an array of challenging missions and games held at various landmarks, carried out by its beloved cast and revolving guest stars.Thanks to the charming chemistry between its main cast, charming banter and shenanigans, the show inadvertently became an international hit, boasting countless fans all over the globe and a whopping 678 episodes to date.The cast has been in Singapore for fan meets in the past, but this is the first time the show is being filmed here.The first Running Man Singapore excursion saw the cast touching down on Saturday, Nov 4, with devoted fans all abuzz on social media and internet forums discussing their latest whereabouts, and speculations on where they would appear next.Over the next two days, the team made several stops around town, including three food-focused locations. Filming has since wrapped and speculation on fan forums is rife that the episode is slated to air as early as Nov 19.Curious to know where Running Man visited in Singapore before the episode drops? Here’s what we found out! 18 Raffles Quay\nOpen: 24 hoursWhat went down: Everyone would be familiar with the legendary Lau Pa Sat. Opened in 1824, the heritage site is probably one of the most famous tourist attractions when it comes to hawker centres.\xa0This was Running Man’s first Singapore filming location, where the cast were treated to satay sticks and other familiar hawker goodies as starstruck diners looked on.\xa0Price range: $Crowd favourites: There is no shortage of comforting hawker classics at this storied hawker centre, including the Klang-style herbal bak kut teh of Feng Xiang Herbal Bak Kut Teh and Michelin-affirmed Nasi Lemak Ayam Taliwang.With as many as 10 satay carts grilling up smoky skewers in the open air, a reliable choice is stall 7 and 8, aptly named “Best Satay”, which many local foodies swear by — the most commonly ordered Set A sets you back S$28 for 10 chicken, 10 beef or mutton and six prawn skewers!\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeylang food: 15 top spots for bak kut teh, Hokkien mee, frog porridge and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Junction Westgate opening with promos; will house 23 tenants, including new halal teppanyaki\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHawker Hustlers: Hipster hawker Ray Yeo of Bei-Ing Dimsum Club on reinventing dim sum and his love for all things Japan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n243 Beach Road, 01-01\nOpen: Monday, Wednesday to Sunday (7.30am to 4pm)What went down: The second location of the Running Man Singapore visit was Haji Lane, the iconic and vibrant enclave best known for its buzzing nightlife.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/little-teahouse-bugis/:['Dim sum lovers, add this new dim sum house to your list: Little Teahouse at Bugis.\xa0Opened by the same people behind Soup Restaurant, the best part about this new eatery is that it will be serving up 35 handmade dim sum varieties from S$2.90.This new opening is part of Soup Restaurant’s 32nd anniversary celebrations. The Chinese restaurant chain, known for its nourishing broths, poached chicken and stir-fried vegetables, has been a comforting and nostalgic dining spot for many Singaporeans since its opening in 1991.What started out as a humble unit in Chinatown is now a popular household name; outlets can be found all over the island, along with a slew of spin-off concepts.This includes Cafe O, a concept focused on traditional coffee shop flavours, which has also opened a new outlet right beside Little Teahouse. Both are located at a corner unit at Bugis Village, right across Bugis+ mall.Cafe O’s Bugis outlet is clad in a rustic white-and-blue palette while the dim sum eatery Little Teahouse comes trimmed with modish retro tiles reminiscent of an old-school cha chaan teng.As its cosy decor suggests, Little Teahouse is a casual and fuss-free eatery that specialises in a myriad of comforting and familiar dim sum dishes.Psst, to celebrate its new opening, there will be a promotion running from Nov 1 to 30, where diners get to enjoy 20% off all dim sum items!Classics are done well here, with items such as the crispy prawn cheong fun (S$6.90) impressing with a well-balanced medley of crunch and silkiness.\xa0The unassuming beancurd skin roll with prawn (S$6 for three) turned out to be exceptionally crunchy with a bouncy and flavourful filling.There’s also the steamed carrot cake with special XO sauce (S$5.90), which sees the classic dish steamed in a bowl.The dish arrives softer and plusher than the usual carrot cake, and is bolstered with the addictive umami of XO sauce — a very satisfying dish.Similarly, while still a familiar sight, Little Teahouse’s signature egg tart (S$4.60 for two) sports a slightly different appearance, with the crumbly pastry skin taller and compactly wrapped around a rich and creamy egg custard filling.Little Teahouse’s diverse menu also contains a few creative spins on tried-and-tested classics.\xa0One good example is the Samsui ginger chicken bao (S$4.60), where Soup Restaurant’s signature chicken is packed into a bao. The flavour-packed morsel retains the chicken’s succulence and is loaded with a sharp ginger note.Other Insta-worthy dim sum creations include the lychee prawn ball with mozzarella cheese (S$6) and assorted mushroom truffle bao (S$5.40), both quirkily shaped into their respective hero ingredients.The former is a savoury and zesty — which might be a bit of an acquired taste for most — whereas the latter greets your tastebuds with an earthy richness mixed with a hint of truffle perfume.If you can’t get enough of the creatively moulded creations, Little Teahouse’s menu also contains an assortment of adorable animal-themed baos.\xa0Though looking rather snazzy, these are actually simple classics with rejigged presentation — the panda bao (S$4 for two) is filled with red bean, the chick-a-boo (S$4 for two) contains sweet corn, and the hedgehog bao (S$4 for two) is fried and packed with lotus paste.Those who are curious to try all of them can opt for the happy animal farm, a platter that’s available at S$6 with one of each or S$11.70 with two of each.For more ideas on what to eat, read our stories on the stalls with the best bak chor mee in Singapore and our ratings after trying 30 nasi lemak stalls.Do explore the new GrabFood Dine-in service for awesome deals.You can also book a ride to Little Teahouse for a dim sum feast.Bugis Village, 229 Victoria Street\nNearest MRT station:\xa0Bugis\nOpen: Sunday to Thursday (10am to 11pm), Friday and Saturday (10am to 11.30pm)Bugis Village, 229 Victoria Street\nNearest MRT station:\xa0Bugis\nOpen: Sunday to Thursday (10am to 11pm), Friday and Saturday (10am to 11.30pm)AuthorEvan started off writing about food on Instagram, before joining outlets such as Buro and Confirm Good to pursue his passion.

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/fish-head-curry-singapore/:['The fish head curry is an iconic dish that’s unique to Singapore — its origins a symbol of the country’s rich cultural melting pot.\xa0Created in the 1940s in an Indian restaurant, the owner, who was from the state of Kerala, decided to cater to the tastebuds of its Chinese customers by combining Indian curry with fish head, a Chinese favourite. The Singapore curry fish head was born.This dish is now well-loved by the many ethnic and cultural communities in Singapore, such as Indian, Chinese, Malay and Peranakan, with many restaurants even coming up with their own spin on it by varying the spices and ingredients used.\xa0If you’re a spice lover, there’s really nothing more comforting and enticing than a piping, hot bowl of bright turmeric-coloured broth, seasoned with a special mix of fragrant spices and cooked with assorted vegetables alongside the star of the dish — a generous fish head, bubbling away in an earthen claypot.\xa0Today, fish head curry is found all over Singapore, from little hidden gems in our heartlands to larger well-known restaurants. With options all over our island, I thought it would be good to create a list of the best curry fish head near me (and you).\xa0Without further ado, here’s where you can find 15 of the best curry fish heads in Singapore.253 Jurong East Street 24, 01-205\nOpen: Thursday to Tuesday (7am to 3pm)Why visit? Zai Shun Curry Fish Head is a Michelin Bib Gourmand stall selling chap chye png (economic mixed vegetable rice) and zi char, located at a coffee shop within a neighbourhood estate in the west. Here, you can find restaurant standard fare at affordable prices.\xa0Fresh fish is brought in daily; the owner Ong Cheng Kee has been in the business of cooking and selling fish for more than 40 years, and hence ensures that his fish supply is of the freshest quality.\xa0As such, you can expect extremely fresh fish head cooked in a fragrant and tangy assam curry broth here. For this dish, Zai Shun uses wild caught red snapper that has soft, sweet and tender flesh. Not only is it rich and flavourful, portions are also very generous.\xa0Price range: $$Crowd favourites: The eatery serves up a great bowl of fish head curry (from S$25), but do note that this is only available after 11am. It is also well known for its steamed fish, which is always steamed to perfection and never overcooked. Fish connoisseurs will love this extra bit — you get the option of choosing the type of fish you’d like to have.\xa0Multiple outlets islandwide\xa0\xa0\nOperating hours vary across storesWhy visit?.Well-known for its Peranakan-inspired curry that comes bubbling in a large claypot, Ocean Curry Fish Head is quite the household name and has been serving fish head curry since 1983. The curry gravy at this popular cai png stall is of a good consistency — not too thin or thick. There’s always a long snaking queue during lunch, so make sure you come early.Price range: $$Crowd favourites: Cooked only upon order and served in a claypot, the curry fish head (S$42 for a serving that’s good for three to four persons) here may be on the pricier side but the crowd and queue is testament to its worth. Starring fresh, succulent anggoli (sea bream) meat and accompanied with a generous amount of vegetables such as brinjal, lady’s finger, onion, tomato, and pineapple, it’s a rich and creamy concoction that will have you wanting more (and eating more rice than you intended to).\xa0\xa0138 Race Course Road, 01-01\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (10.30am to 10.30pm)Why visit? Muthu’s Curry is a Michelin Bib Gourmand restaurant championing South Indian-style fish head curry that was pioneered by its founder back in 1969. The special recipe has now been passed down to the next generation and is a closely guarded secret.\xa0Cooked with its tantalising blend of aromatic spices, chunks of pineapple, lady’s finger and a hint of tamarind, there is a depth of flavour to its curry. For the fish head, there is a choice of red snapper, sea bass or sea bream depending on seasonal availability.\xa0Price range: $$Crowd favourites: For sure, it would be its rich and flavourful fish head curry (S$35), which has an amazing balance of curry spices. Regardless of your fish selection, you can be assured of a good-sized fish head with succulent, fleshy meat that has absorbed all the flavours of the curry. Prices here may be on the higher side but the superb food, convivial ambience and impeccable service makes up for it.\xa0147 Upper Paya Lebar Road\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (11.30am to 10pm)Why visit? Yu Cun Curry Fish Head in Paya Lebar is a huge favourite among diners here when it comes to fish head curry. You can tell from the long lines during peak hours! We hear the owner used to have experience running zi char stalls, and eventually decided to open a full-service restaurant with his children. Known for being a family-friendly spot, you can’t miss the restaurant’s prominent sign when you drive along Upper Paya Lebar Road.The curry here is really fragrant, boasting a lovely balance between being rich and creamy, yet not being overly heavy on the palate. The spice level is perfect for those who enjoy a kick of heat to their taste buds, but thankfully for those who are not fans of spice, the eatery also offers a less spicy version.\xa0Price range: $$Crowd favourites: The claypot curry fish head (S$36) is more similar to Indian-styled curry, while the claypot nyonya fish head (S$38) is a touch sour and tangy. Between the two, we’d go for the former, which has bolder and deeper flavours.

https://hungrygowhere.com/food-news/bei-ing-dimsum-club-hawker-hustlers/:['Hawker Hustlers is a HungryGoWhere series spotlighting young and emerging hawkers with compelling stories. Read through all the way for an exclusive GrabFood promo so you can try their food, too.You could say that hawker Ray Yeo, 30, is something of a Japanophile.\xa0At his vibey hawker stall along East Coast Road, you’ll see dozens of maneki-neko (fortune cats), Bearbrick figurines, Japanese paper red lanterns and neon light sign boards that wouldn’t look out of place in a modern izakaya.\n\nA frequent traveller to Japan, he enjoys going restaurant-hopping in search of the finest ramen spots and hidden culinary gems, especially the quieter, less touristy places.Naturally, this love for all things Japanese has translated into the food he serves at Bei-Ing Wanton Noodle and Bei-Ing Dim Sum Club at the Bullion Hawker Bar, a modern coffee shop in the East Coast. If you’re an eastie, you’d probably recognise the name — Yeo’s stall is the offshoot of the renowned Bei-Ing Wanton Noodle, a stall that has been operating in the basement kopitiam of Roxy Square 1 since 1984. Run by his parents, the noodle stall often sees crowds thronging to Katong for its famed wonton mee.\nIf you’re a regular patron, you’d probably know that you’re more likely to hear it before you see it — Yeo’s father calls out order numbers in his now-iconic booming voice, rather than relying on modern buzzers or digital displays.The original wonton noodle stall was founded by Yeo’s great-aunt and his father, Yeo Oh Song Khoon, took over after she retired. Based on suggestions from multiple Malaysian tourists, the elder Yeo decided to launch another version with a dark soy sauce-base. With this new dish, Bei-Ing’s noodles gained unprecedented traction. The elder Yeo’s wife later came on board to help out with the cooking. With her talent and natural instinct for cooking, business has flourished ever since.Ray Yeo started helping out with the family business at age 15. After being so immersed in the F&B scene at a young age, his interest in food and cooking was naturally piqued.He enrolled in a culinary course at ITE College West and subsequently pursued a diploma in restaurant and culinary operations at Republic Polytechnic.\xa0However, he dropped out as he found it difficult to concentrate on theoretical lessons, being more inclined towards practical, hands-on learning. At the age of 21, he joined his family business full-time.\n\nHe began working on adapting the menu to cater to modern taste buds.Starting his own business was somewhat of a serendipitous affair, he tells us.In 2021, Yeo stepped out of his comfort zone to expand Bei-Ing’s presence with a new outlet and a more extensive menu — with the help of his close friend Jean Ong, 30, who was his classmate at Republic Polytechnic.\xa0Ong has had stints at cocktail bar Atlas making pastry and worked at the 24-hour Hello Kitty Cafe at Changi Airport, before she began working part-time at Bei-Ing’s Roxy outlet in 2017.Ong eventually became his business partner. During his search for a suitable stall, Yeo thought of The Bullion hawker bar, which he often frequented for its “cool vibes”. Unlike most coffee shops, it has a laid-back atmosphere and is home to other popular stalls such as Bruce Lee Chicken Rice, Geylang 29 Charcoal Fried Hokkien Mee (which has since moved). It serves up craft beer, too.Yeo casually floated the idea of opening his own stall to the coffee shop owner, and a month later, he was told that one stall was vacant and open for rental. He jumped at the chance, opening the second branch of Bei-Ing Wanton Noodle in September 2022 — with the support of his parents — but offering other dishes that showcase his unique perspective. Beyond the signature wonton mee of the original stall, you’ll find other exclusive fusion items such as mentaiko chicken katsu (S$8-$10) and mentaiko fried wontons (S$7-$9) — Japanese-style riffs on the family recipe.Coincidentally in the same month of September, their neighbour ceased operations.\xa0 Yeo and Ong decided to take over the space as they felt their current stall was too small.\xa0They reasoned that it would not be easy to sustain two stalls serving up just wonton mee, and decided to come up with a new concept for the second stall.\n\n“Originally our plan was to do Western cuisine, given Jean’s excellent skills in that area. But the heavy workload required and the cost of equipment proved too high for our new startup, we couldn’t afford to take that risk… and I didn’t want to deviate too far from our wonton mee concept (which is a Chinese cuisine),” explains Yeo. \n\nThat was when Yeo had a brainwave to do a dim sum concept, also one of his favourite foods. What more, he could tap on his brother’s expertise as a dim sum chef\xa0 specialising in fine-dining Asian cuisine in London, allowing him “access to recipes and expert opinions”.\n\nThus, that same month, Bei-Ing Dimsum Club was born, along with a catchy tagline: “Chinese Tapas Theory”. Why this line? The stall’s dim sum offerings are distinctly modern, blending different culinary influences to produce uniquely fusion morsels of food.The quality of the food, however, is not compromised, as Yeo hired a Hong Kong chef to assist in their dim sum and congee offerings, as well as the mise en place.Yeo and Ong also decided to experiment with some innovative flavours to avoid being a run-of-the-mill dim sum spot. They traded tips, improvised and did R&D to see what would work. “We tried to see what’s trending… In the past, it used to be salted egg, then mentaiko, and now we think it’s mala,” says Yeo.Diners now have more than 20 items to choose from on the menu — most of them one of a kind and can’t be found elsewhere.You can rest assured however, that when you’re at the stall for wonton noodles, you’d get a plate that’s largely similar to the OG at Roxy Square — with just a touch of Yeo’s personal flair.We had the signature wanton mee (S$6 to $8), drenched in dark soya sauce and a dollop of fiery chilli.\xa0Everything is prepared the same way, but what sets it apart from his family’s version is you get the option of either lean or fatty char siew slices (the Roxy outlet only serves lean meat). Each plate also comes with a bold Japanese-inspired stroke of dark soy sauce across the plate.\n\n“I added the brushstroke primarily for its aesthetic appeal and some customers prefer their wanton mee to be darker, enabling them to spread the sauce along the sides for richer flavour,” explains Yeo.For dim sum, we tried the aburi-mentai sotong bomb topped with bonito flakes (S$4.90), teriyaki-glazed siew mai with fried wonton skin and teriyaki sauce (S$4.90), fried shrimp dumpling with truffle mayo and fried mee kia (S$6-$8), and handmade chee cheong fun with specialty you tiao shrimp paste (S$6.40).You’ll find the dishes are plated artistically as a way to enhance the overall dining experience, whether it is in the arrangement of components, or their way of chopping ingredients such as the spring onion (they julienne it instead).“We also try to achieve the best colour contrast for our dish, such as the amount of reds we have in our char siew, to incorporate with the other ingredients. We also choose unconventional looking plates for the premium dishes to complement and enhance its visual appeal,” explains Yeo.Looking at Yeo, you’d think he would be boisterous — like his father. In person, however, Yeo appears more quiet and earnest, preferring to stay behind the scenes while Ong is a lot chattier. “Normally he cannot really talk,” she whispers.It has been challenging running the business on his own, even without his expanded dim sum repertoire, acknowledges Yeo.\n\nWhen he was working at the Roxy Square stall, most of the items such as the wonton, chilli and char siew were prepared by his mother, while he focused on cooking the noodles.\n\n“When we started we didn’t even know how to make the char siew, so we really learnt on the job. In the first few days after our stall opened, my parents even closed the shop at Roxy Square to come down and help us… They’re really wonderful!” says Yeo.These days, the stall attracts a largely younger crowd and even foreigners as well. It also gets orders via WhatsApp and other delivery platforms. Today, for instance, it received an order for 50 packets of wonton mee — a testament to its popularity.Yeo also started an all-you-can-eat dim sum buffet (S$25.90), which allows customers to dine on some of the stall’s signature dishes. However, customers have a limit of four items per order.\xa0Asked about this restriction, Yeo says a lot of customers would typically over-order and that resulted in a lot of food wastage. The stall doesn’t impose charges for food wastage, though, he adds.Cooking talent aside, you’ll be surprised to find that Yeo is equally proficient with branding and design as well. The main sign board features a hipster dumpling and wonton mee duo, meant to symbolise Yeo and Ong.Yeo’s dream is to one day be able to open a shophouse and work together with his family, and perhaps earn a Michelin star as well. “I’m already manifesting,” he jokes.\xa0And when he’s not at the stall, you can be sure to find him playing with his dog Marshall — well, a Japanese Shiba, of course.Good news for our readers who scrolled all the way to the end!Here’s your exclusive GrabFood delivery promo for Bei-Ing Dim Sum Club, valid from November 12 to December 12, 2023:How it works:Craving other hawker eats?

https://hungrygowhere.com/what-to-eat/geylang-food/:['Yes, we all know Geylang has a reputation for being Singapore’s bustling red-light district. However, beyond this infamous status, did you know that Geylang also holds another honour — that of being a bonafide foodie paradise with an array of amazing food options available round the clock?While the buzzy district is known for coming alive at night with a myriad of supper haunts for late-night cravings, there are actually numerous hawker options, zi char stalls and eateries offering international cuisines, which you can visit during daylight. And these foodie gems are not just in Geylang Serai market.From authentic Hong Kong dim sum and traditional herbal bak kut teh to a nourishing bowl of frog porridge, no matter what you are craving, Geylang’s good food will satisfy you — there’s always a dish out there for you, no matter what time of the day.Here are HungryGoWhere’s top 15 picks for the best food in Geylang that you can find.\xa0323 Geylang Road\nOpen: Sunday to Monday, Wednesday and Thursday (4pm to 3.30am), Friday and Saturday (4pm to 4am)Why visit? An iconic Singaporean delicacy, frog porridge is known for being low-fat and rich in protein, making for a healthy and delicious dish. Featured on the Michelin Bib Gourmand’s recommendation list in 2018, Eminent Frog Porridge is a long-standing household name that sees hour-long queues on the weekends.Alongside white congee cooked in earthen pots, Eminent serves its frog leg dishes cooked to perfection in different sauces, from gong bao and spring onion to chicken essence and Chinese herb soup.\xa0It also features two store-exclusive flavours, garlic and white pepper and special home-made chilli. But no matter what flavour you opt for, the frog meat is cooked to perfection, succulent and tender, the perfect vessel for the fragrance of the different herbs and spices. This is the best place to go for frog leg porridge in Geylang.Price range: $$Crowd favourites: Frog meat dishes start from S$8 per portion, and its gong bao flavour is a bestseller, a perennial favourite that lands with a bold and spicy kick harmonised by the comforting congee (from S$2).\xa0Get your money’s worth with the restaurant’s famous “buy two get one free” store promotion for frog meat portions, and if you’re looking for other side dishes to accompany the porridge, the restaurant also does well with the typical zi char dishes on its menu, such as sweet and sour pork (from S$10) and a variety of crab dishes (based on seasonal pricing).Do note that the restaurant only accepts cash, so remember to bring your wallet along and pay the old-fashioned way!\xa0251 Geylang Road\nOpen: Monday to Sunday (11.30am to 11.30pm)Why visit? Some people like their bak kut teh peppery, and some love Malaysia’s herbal bak kut teh. The latter is a pretty rare find in Singapore, but Leong Kee Bak Kut Teh does a great rendition, with a robust pork stock and fork-tender ribs infused in an aromatic but light herbal broth.Most regulars swear by this Geylang bak kut teh spot, which often attracts a long line during peak hours.Price range: $Crowd favourites: If you’re a fan of herbal bak kut teh, you should try its signature Leong Kee bak kut teh (S$8.80), which oozes a light herbal flavour. Order some beancurd skin and fried youtiao (dough fritters) (S$1) on the side for the perfect balance of crispy texture and rich flavour.\xa0Its dry bak kut teh (S$12) comes highly recommended, too. The restaurant’s true must-try “hidden gem”, however, is its stewed pork leg (S$8.80). Braised just right with the perfect amount of fat over tender pork meat, it is the perfect vessel for its richly aromatic broth.\xa05 Lorong 29 Geylang\nOpen: Thursday to Tuesday (4pm to 10pm)\nWhy visit? Located at a coffee shop that’s a seven minute walk from Aljunied MRT station, Swee Guan Hokkien Mee first opened in 1968, and is now run by a second-generation chef who took over the stall from his father. Known for its unique charcoal-fried hokkien mee, Swee Guan has crowds that start way before dinner, with snaking queues by the time the store opens at 4pm. The wait is well worth it, as the owner fries the Hokkien mee one serving at a time. Each plate comes perfectly charred with a generous amount of egg and seafood, its umami, smoky broth coating each strand of yellow noodle. You can’t go wrong with this Geylang Hokkien mee.Price range: $Crowd favourites: Each batch of hokkien mee (from S$8) is evenly soaked in seafood stock before it is cooked to the perfect consistency, and the charcoal imbues the dish with a smoky barbeque aroma. The prawns are also taut and fresh, and along with bite-sized sotong rings, these lend a chewy texture to the plate of Hokkien mee.We would recommend a S$10 portion for a filling dinner that hits the spot.\xa0\u200b\u200b217 Geylang Road\nOpen: Daily (10am to 2am)Why visit? Open from morning until late at night, Gong He Guan is the perfect midnight Geylang dessert spot. Designed like a traditional Hong Kong dessert joint, it serves 17 different varieties of traditional Chinese desserts within its humble space. From traditional pastes such as black sesame, almond and peanut paste, to the authentic gui ling gao and popular mango pudding and rock melon with sago, Gong He Guan is the perfect late-night supper spot to satisfy your sweet tooth.Price range: $$Crowd favourites: Gong He Guan is known for its signature gui ling gao (tortoise jelly, S$8.60), which comes in generous portions and boasts an authentic herbal flavour. Other in-house favourites include its mixed pastes (S$3), which give you the option to try two different flavours of paste in a single bowl. For an additional S$1.20, you have the option to add three tang yuan (glutinous rice balls) to go with your dessert paste.And if you’re looking to give yourself a big treat, the most expensive item on the menu is its fresh top grade bird’s nest with rock sugar (S$33), which is boiled for hours with premium-grade ingredients to justify its hefty price tag.\xa0\xa0214 Geylang Road\nOpen: 24 hoursWhy visit? If you’re craving Geylang dim sum at an ungodly hour, Mongkok is open 24 hours a day, so dedicated dim sum lovers never have to go without their fix. Named after the buzzing district in Kowloon, Hong Kong, Mongkok Dim Sum serves up authentic quality dimsum dishes in generous portions and at wallet-friendly prices.Price range: $$\n\nCrowd favourites: Mongkok Dim Sum does well with the typical dim sum dishes you would find on a regular dim sum menu. From the perfectly sweet and salty flowing custard of its liu sha bao (custard bun) to its crispy deep-fried yam pastry with meat filling, Mongkok Dim Sum serves up consistently good quality when it comes to dim sum. It also does a mean xia jiao (har gow or prawn dumpling, S$3.50) with delicately thin crystal dumpling skin wrapped around fresh prawns.The three yolk crab porridge (S$9) is the highlight here, boiled to the consistency of Cantonese congee and topped with chopped century egg, soft-boiled egg yolks and crumbly salted egg yolk. A turn of your spoon will reveal generous portions of fresh crab meat, which adds a natural sweetness to the congee.\xa056/58 Lorong 25A Geylang\xa0\nOpen: Daily (11am to 10pm)Why visit? Serving up affordable classical Japanese meals, Donburi Maruya prides itself on specializing in donburi, using only the freshest and finest cuts of pork and chicken. Apart from the usual rice bowls such as tonkatsu don and beef donburi, Donburi Maruya also has a wide variety of options available, such as udon, ramen and curry rice sets.While the Japanese eatery has a few outlets around the island, the Geylang branch, tucked away in Foodloft coffeeshop near Aljunied MRT station, has arguably, one of the cheapest prices of the bunch, making it a must-visit for foodies in Geylang.Price range: $Crowd favourites: Donburi Maruya is best known for its traditional teishoku tonkatsu, a crispy breaded pork cutlet propped up by a metal grill served with shredded cabbage. It goes for S$7.50 a la carte and S$10 for a meal with rice and miso soup — a hearty lunch sorted.Its menu also boasts of the deluxe unagi don (S$14.50), which comes in an extra-large portion and a cut of Japanese eel that is well-marinated and full of umami. Well-grilled to a light crispy char, the unagi is plump and fresh and wrapped in a blanket of egg and onions over rice.\xa0237 Geylang Road\nOpen: \xa0Daily (11am to 12.30am)Why visit? An iconic hawker spot in Singapore, Lor 9 Beef Kway Teow is known for its signature Geylang beef hor fun, and was at one point, awarded a Michelin plate for the dish. Characterised by its generous helping of succulent beef slices and wide silky smooth kway teow mixed in soy sauce and bean paste gravy, the dish is perfectly stir-fried and comes with slight peppery notes and an aromatic wok hei.\nPrice range: $$Crowd favourites: Lor 9’s beef hor fun comes in various sizes, starting from an S$8 portion that is good for solo dining. The S$14 portion is best for a pair, while its largest S$30 plate can feed up to four people. Either way, the tender beef slices in gooey sauce will make for a satisfying meal. Contrary to its name, the stall also serves a solid seafood hor fun (from S$6) and zi char dishes.\xa032 Aljunied Road\nOpen: Daily (11am to 12am)Why visit? Known for its vibrant street food culture, Penang Seafood Restaurant is every foodie’s paradise. Offering an array of tantalising dishes, from crispy prawn rolls to the amazing wok hei of its char kway teow and the spicy kick of its assam laksa, Penang Seafood Restaurant is the closest we’ve come to getting a taste of authentic Penang cuisine in Singapore.Price range: $$$Crowd favourites: Our top recommendation would be the assam laksa (S$8). Painstakingly simmered for a minimum of four hours each day, a deep, rich fish broth envelopes the noodles together with fresh vegetables and spices, producing a refreshing sour and spicy palate. Infused in a smoky wok hei flavour and boasting a more savoury taste than the Singaporean version, the Penang char kway teow (from S$8) is a must-try dish.\xa0Apart from representative dishes that speak to Penang’s rich gastronomic culture, the restaurant is also popular for its wide variety of fresh seafood dishes cooked to perfection and available at reasonable prices. It does a brilliant job with its crab dishes, offered in a series of delectable flavours, including the nation’s favourite chilli crab, the ever-popular salted egg crab and the classic black and white pepper crab (all available at seasonal prices).\xa0\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Junction Westgate opening with promos; will house 23 tenants, including new halal teppanyaki\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHawker Hustlers: Hipster hawker Ray Yeo of Bei-Ing Dimsum Club on reinventing dim sum and his love for all things Japan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle Teahouse: Handmade dim sum from S$2.90 at new Soup Restaurant opening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xa029 Lorong Bachok\nOpen: Daily (11am to 8.30pm)\nWhy visit? Originally reserved for royal feasts in China, turtle soup quickly established itself as a nutritional dish with many health benefits in Singapore. Tan Ah Sai, the founder of Tan Ser Seng Herbs Restaurant had brought his unique trade of turtle soup from China in 1946, and began peddling his herbal broth along Orchard Road and later, Mei Shi Jie (Beauty World). The founder then continuously improved his recipe before passing it down to his family’s younger generation.Price range: $$$Crowd favourites: Simmered in more than 20 different herbs, the claypot turtle soup (from S$31.10) is the star of the menu. The soup is sweet and full-bodied but with a light and smooth texture, boasting a refreshing tinge of fresh herbs and a faint aftertaste of rice wine.If the thought of eating turtle meat makes you uneasy, rest assured that Tan Ser Seng does not use endangered or wild turtles in its soup. Instead, the meat comes from a local company that imports softshell turtles from Indonesian farms and is prepared exclusively for consumption.But as an alternative for those who are not adventurous enough to try turtle soup in Geylang, the restaurant also sells other nourishing soup options such as its cordyceps chicken soup (S$16.80) and black chicken soup (S$16.80).\xa026 Lorong 11 Geylang\nOpen: Daily (12pm to 12am)Why visit? If you’re looking for a late-night dinner or supper spot where you can catch up with some friends, Liu Da Ma BBQ offers a plethora of authentic Chinese barbequed delicacies at affordable prices. Whether you crave the succulence of lamb skewers seasoned with cumin and chilli, the smoky notes of perfectly charred beef, or the irresistible aroma of chicken wings glazed with sweet and savoury sauces, Liu Da Ma BBQ caters to every preference.Price range: $$Crowd favourites: While the beef and pork skewers (S$6.80 for five) are great, the place is known for serving great lamb dishes. The grilled lamb shoulder (S$78 to S$88) and lamb leg (S$78) are the house speciality, or you can go for a more affordable bite-sized option with its lamb skewers (S$6.80 for five), which are a standout. Lightly charred to a smoky barbecued crisp on the surface, the meat is plenty succulent and tender, instead of being too gamey or dry on the inside.\xa0134 Geylang East Avenue 1, 01-217\nOpen: Thursday to Tuesday (5.30am to 3.30pm)Why visit? First opened in 1985, Hong Qin Fish and Duck Porridge has had a long history of whipping up tasty Teochew-style porridge and dishes. It’s already a pretty rare sight to see one stall specialising in both duck and fish porridge, and Hong Qin Fish and Duck Porridge goes a level higher by selling three different types of meat (fish, duck and pork).\xa0Its signature fish soup is cooked in a rich flavourful pork shank soup for four hours before fish bones are added and further brewed into a rich broth, resulting in a sweet and savoury taste. The soup is then served Teochew-style, with a side of steamed rice to be mixed in the soup.Price range: $$Crowd favourites: The sliced fish soup (S$8) comes highly recommended, with its hefty portion of thick-cut boneless mackerel fish fillets, both fried and boiled slices, garnished with lettuce, seaweed and crisp coriander that lend the soup a grainy and earthy sweet flavour. Its braised pig trotters (S$8) are also perfectly stewed in a rich braised pork gravy that penetrates deep into the collagen-rich trotters, leaving meat moist and tender on the inside.\xa0558 Geylang Road, Lorong 32 Geylang\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (11.30am to 9.30pm)Why visit? A bowl of ban mian from L32 Handmade Noodles is the ultimate comfort food experience. Run by a couple, the noodles here are al dente, firm and bouncy, setting them apart from the commonplace factory-made noodles you can find in many stalls. The use of fresh ingredients is enveloped in a rich but not greasy broth, which makes digging into this bowl an utter pleasure from first bite to last sip.Price range: $Crowd favourites: Customers can choose from ban mian, you mian or mee hoon kueh for their noodles and opt to have the noodles dry or in soup. But apart from its freshly hand-made noodles, L32 Handmade Noodles’ ban mian (from S$7) stands out for its wide range of options for toppings.\xa0Apart from the usual minced pork and egg, the dish features additional ingredients such as meatballs, fishballs, seafood and chicken slices. Its housemade ikan bilis is super crispy, and so popular that customers often top up a dollar to have more added to their bowl for an extra dash of umami.\xa0543 Geylang Road\nOpen: Tuesday to Sunday (10am to 9pm)Why visit? In recent years, the banh mi (a Vietnamese sandwich comprising a baguette filled with meat and vegetables) has risen in popularity as a favourite Vietnamese dish among diners here. But good banh mi is not easy to come by. Banh Mi Thit, however, is as close as we can get to authentic Vietnamese banh mi in Singapore, all available at a wallet-friendly price. Many now make a beeline for it when searching for Geylang food.Price range: $Crowd favourites: Sandwiches at Banh Mi Thit are priced at S$5 across the board. Customers get to choose the ingredients filling the sandwich, from chicken, beef or egg to fresh vegetables, finished with a special sauce. To wash it all down, the humble eatery also sells Vietnamese coffee (S$1.50).\xa0659 to 661 Lorong 35 Geylang\nOpen: Sunday to Friday (11.30am to 4.30pm)Why visit? Founded in 1979 by Oh Kim Seng, who had over a decade of experience at a Teochew braised duck stall, Sia Kee Duck Rice is a staple in the neighbourhood and a top spot when looking for good Geylang food. Known to be home to Singapore’s best boneless braised duck rice, the famous stall has been handed to the second generation and is now being run by the founder’s sons, Albert, Lawrence and Ron. While the stall’s name is listed as Sean Kee Duck Rice online and on their storefront, Sia Kee is the accurate pronunciation of the stall’s name in dialect.\n\nPrice range: $\n\nCrowd favourites: A good old-fashioned plate of Sia Kee duck rice boasts tenderly marinated duck meat that has a delicate balance of sweet, savoury and herbal notes, enveloped in a tantalising crispy skin. Topped off with fragrant rice and a generous drizzle of special braised gravy sauce, the dish is served with a herbal soup made in fresh batches daily. If you are dining in a group, try the mixed duck platter (S$18), which comes with bountiful servings of duck meat, egg, and fishcake, topped with peanuts and beansprouts.\xa02 Lorong 15 Geylang\nOpen: Monday to Saturday (5.30pm to 3am)Why visit? Bali Nasi Lemak is a renowned restaurant helmed by Madam Susan Koh, who has been peddling nasi lemak since 1985. A plate of Bali nasi lemak is easily recognisable from its Thai basmati rice seeped in the light fragrance of coconut milk and pandan leaves. And true to its name, Bali Nasi Lemak lends a unique Indonesian influence to its dishes, standing out with a sambal that delivers a slow, addictive burn and ikan kunning (yellowstripe scad) that is fried to be crispy on the outside, but tender on the inside.Regulars will be sad to know that it’s moving to a swanky new location at 142 Sims Avenue come mid-November, after close to 30 years at 2 Lorong 15 Geylang. However, the eatery has reassured us that prices, thankfully, will remain the same.Price range: $Crowd favourites: While pre-selected sets are available, the a la carte option drives a bigger crowd because it allows patrons to choose each element according to their preferences. Each meal starts from S$2 for a decent portion of rice, and while vegetable side dishes cost S$1 per portion, meat side dishes range from S$2 for an ikan kunning or chicken wing add-on, to S$3 for a chicken drumstick.Still hungry?
