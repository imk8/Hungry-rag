Where can i buy hokkien mee near me

I’m sorry, but I don’t have access to your location information. However, I can provide you with a list of some of the best Hokkien Mee stalls in Singapore. Here are some of them:

1. Kim Keat Hokkien Mee: Located at Blk 92 Toa Payoh Lorong 4, #01-264, Singapore 310092, this stall is known for its claypot Hokkien Mee and deep-fried pork belly. A portion is priced at $10 and feeds two 1.

Come Daily Hokkien Mee: Located at Blk 127 Toa Payoh Lorong 1, #02-27, Toa Payoh Lorong 1 Food Centre, Singapore 310127, this stall has made it onto the Michelin Guide’s list of top Hokkien Mee in Singapore. The plate of Hokkien Mee served here tends on the wetter side of things, and they are extra generous with lard and pork belly, which might make it a little too porky for some tastes. A plate is priced from $5 1.
3. Nam Sing Hokkien Fried Mee: Located at Toa Payoh Lor 4, Blk 92 #01-264, Singapore 310092, this stall has been around since 1963. Nam Sing is known for only using thin bee hoon in their Hokkien Mee (from $5), and for serving it only with slices of fresh red chilli on the side 1.

1. Mr and Mrs Mohgan’s: This place is famous for its handmade dough and freshly made prata that is crispy on the outside and fluffy inside. Prices start at $1.20 for a Plain Prata, but fans truly love their Coin Prata ($5) 1.
Casuarina Curry: This eatery has earned a dear place in the hearts of diners all across Singapore, and for good reason too—their serving size is larger than average and their prata has the most amazing soft, crispy texture to it. The best news is they do catering—check out their website to find out more! 1.
