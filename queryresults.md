Simply enter your current location and the destination (Flora Road), and the app will provide you with a walking route along with an estimated walking time based on your walking speed.

## Query 7

What should my average speed be to reach Vivo City in less than 20 minutes from Simei MRT

### Response
The walking distance from Simei MRT station to VivoCity in Singapore is approximately 4.5 kilometers (about 2.8 miles), and the time it takes to walk this distance will depend on your walking speed. To reach VivoCity from Simei MRT in less than 20 minutes, you would need to maintain a brisk walking pace.

Here's a rough estimation of walking speeds:

Casual walking speed: 4 to 5 kilometers per hour (about 2.5 to 3.1 miles per hour)
Brisk walking speed: 6 to 7 kilometers per hour (about 3.7 to 4.3 miles per hour)
To reach VivoCity in less than 20 minutes, you would likely need to walk at a brisk pace, which means maintaining a speed of approximately 6 to 7 kilometers per hour. Keep in mind that walking speed can vary from person to person, so it's essential to walk at a pace that you're comfortable with and that ensures your safety. Additionally, factors such as pedestrian traffic, terrain, and weather conditions can affect your walking speed.

## Query 8
What restaurants are there on Pulau Bin that are Halal

### Response
> The following response is not a complete failure, but is an interesting case, because there are no resorts in Pulau Bin. 
As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, Pulau Bin (also known as Pulau Bintan) is a small island off the southern coast of Singapore known for its natural beauty and outdoor activities. While there may not be a wide range of dining options on the island, some restaurants and food establishments may offer halal food to cater to Muslim visitors. However, the availability of halal dining options may vary, and it's advisable to check with the specific restaurants or accommodations on the island for the most up-to-date information. Here are a few places that may offer halal food:

Resorts and Hotels: Some resorts and hotels on Pulau Bin may have in-house restaurants that offer halal options. Check with the accommodation where you plan to stay for information on their dining facilities.

Local Eateries: There may be local eateries or stalls on the island that serve halal food. These could include small restaurants or street food vendors. Keep an eye out for signs indicating halal offerings.

Seafood Restaurants: Pulau Bin is known for its seafood, and some seafood restaurants on the island may offer halal seafood options. Again, it's a good idea to inquire with the specific restaurant about their menu.

Cafes and Snack Shops: Some cafes or snack shops may offer halal snacks, beverages, and light meals.

Since the availability of halal options can change over time, it's essential to check with the local businesses or accommodations on Pulau Bin directly or visit their websites for current information on halal dining choices. Additionally, consider bringing some food with you or checking for nearby halal restaurants on the mainland before taking the ferry to the island if you have specific dietary preferences or restrictions.
