Thick ties often necessitate the use of smaller knots like the\\n                Four-in-Hand or the Simple knot. Thin ties generally benefit from larger knots like the Pratt or\\n                Windsor. Every knot has a distinct character. The Prince Albert swaggers with a refined elegance.\\n                The Kelvin throws caution to the wind. The Murrell grins like a Cheshire Cat. The Van Wijk winks\\n                like a scoundrel with a secret. The Eldredge and Trinity knots twirl and fold like futuristic\\n                necktie origami. Every knot serves its master differently. Try a few knots. Experiment. Play. Your\\n                necktie will thank you.\\n                \\n\\n                If you're looking for the easiest knot for beginners start here.\\n            \\n                Seeing necktie knots laid out side-by-side is the fastest way to grasp how they differ from one\\n                another. In order to play fair, we tied each knot using neckties of the same material, thickness and\\n                width (3 ½ inches). We also made sure to photograph them to scale. This way you can appreciate the\\n                unique characteristics of each knot and discern the differences between them.\\n            \\n                Of the knots we tied, the smallest is the Simple knot, sometimes known as the Oriental. If there is\\n                a way to tie a necktie smaller we haven't found it. The monstrous Balthus knot is the largest of the\\n                knots we tied but in theory you could make a knot even larger if you had a long enough necktie. Take\\n                note of the overall shape of each knot. The Windsor is almost a perfect triangle. The Four-in-Hand\\n                is much more narrow. The Prince Albert has a second fold that peeks out at the bottom. Some knots,\\n                like the Kelvin and Four-in-Hand lean noticeably to one side. The Trinity delivers a rounded\\n                silhouette while the Van Wijk is cylindrical and the longest of the knots.\\n            \\n                Happy knotting!

Hell, it’s right there in the name. But getting it right? It matters. Pairing the right knot with the right occasion – and shirt collar – is crucial for a well-executed finishing touch. No, a fist-sized power knot won’t pair with your slim-cut shirt and blazer.A man of style has more than a single go-to knot. Luckily, the three knots below can handle almost any sartorial situation.\\xa0\\xa0AKA the schoolboy knot - it’s most likely the first knot you were taught. This four-in-hand knot might be the simplest way to tie a tie but it’s undoubtedly versatile and more than does the job. It pairs especially well with slim collars, shirts with a slightly playful edge (hello floral) and for outfits that toe the line between smart and casual.\\xa0\\xa0Place the tie around the neck. Make sure the wide end is about 1/3 longer than the narrow end.Cross the wide end over the narrow end.Loop the wide end back underneath the narrow end.Bring the wide end over the narrow end once more.You'll have to loop now to knot the tie with. Hold the front of the loop you've created with your index finger and thumb, and bring the wide end up behind through the neck loop.Pass the wide end down through the loop in front. To tighten, pull the wide end of the tie downwards and slide the knot up towards your neck.\\xa0Think of the Half Windsor knot as your Monday to Friday go-to. It’s classic triangular shape pairs with a semi-spread collar in perfect proportion. It’s also a clever option for taller, lankier guys since it uses a little less fabric to knot letting your tie hang longer.\\xa0\\xa0Place the tie around the neck and make sure the wide end is 1/3 longer than the narrow end.Cross the wide end over the narrow end and back around from behind.Lift the wide end up and feed it down through the neck loop.Pull the wide end to the right so that it's inside out.Cross the wide end over to the other side and up thrrough the neck loop.Feed down through the loop you've just created in the front. To tighten, pull down on the wide end and slide the knot up with your other hand.\\xa0You want the power option? Here it is. The Full Windsor is one of the trickiest knots to learn, but it makes the most impact. Best paired with a wide, spread collar shirt and a suit jacket with a slightly thicker lapel. Also, the Full Windsor is a smart weapon for the gent with a thicker neck to keep everything in proportion.\\xa0Place the tie around the neck and make sure the wide end is 1/3 longer than the narrow end.Cross the wide end over the narrow end and pass up through the neck from underneath.Pull down to the left.Cross over to the right from behind.Pull up towards the neck loop.Feed through the neck and pull down to the right.Cross over to the front to the left and back up through the neck.Feed through the front loop that you've just created at the front. Tighten by pulling down on the wide end and sliding the knot with your other hand to adjust.\\xa0Looking to elevate your tie game and already have a tie bar? Try adding a dimple to your knot for a subtle finishing touch. It’s dead simple. Put your index finger just below your loosely tied knot then tighten up as usual.
