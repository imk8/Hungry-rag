Boasting top-class international chefs and armfuls of dining awards, Singapore is home to hundreds of must-visit restaurants that represent pretty much every cuisine you can think of, all with their own army of drool-worthy signature dishes.So to give you a solid lay of the culinary land and steer you in the right direction, Urban List has rounded up the best Singapore restaurants every foodie needs to try.\\nImage credit: Tilly's East Coast |\\xa0SuppliedAlthough Tilly’s East Coast\\xa0is technically more of an Irish pub than it is a restaurant, the food is seriously next level and should definitely be on you radar next time you’re craving some good old-fashioned comfort food. The menu, which was created by Michelin-starred Chef-Owner Andrew Walsh, combines the soulful flavours of Irish cuisine with modern fusion inspirations.Expect to find classics such as their signature beef and Guinness pot pie with mash, beer batter fish and chips with tartare sauce and mushy peas, and chicken schnitzel served with horseradish cream and sage and lemon butter. But if you ask us, it’s their Sunday roast that really takes the cake. We recommend the roast beef which comes with gravy, duck fat roast potatoes, sprouts, carrot mash and Yorkshire puddings. If you fancy something sweet, finish with the sticky toffee pudding and clotted cream.\\nImage credit: FURA | SuppliedHelmed by power couple Christina Rasmussen and Sasha Wijidessa, FURA (which means pine in Swedish) aims to change the way we eat and drink by making sustainable dining more approachable. This is done by using ingredients that have a low carbon footprint that are either abundant in nature or out of balance in its ecosystem.FURA’s Journal of Future Food menu offers a range of planet-friendly options like insects, cell-cultured milk and coffee made from burdock root and hemp seeds. It also features familiar ingredients such as jellyfish, corn and banana, which are either invasive species or available in abundance. FURA also makes an effort to use ingredients widely available in Asia such as gongura, fish leaf and borage grown by hydroponic farmers like GreenLoop Farms in Singapore. The duo\\xa0have also recently introduced a new six-course pairing menu which is a great way to try a little bit of everything.\\nImage credit: Marcy's | SuppliedIf you’re a fan of seafood and grandma chic interiors, Marcy’s is the place for you. Founded in 2020, the seafood bistro on Duxton Road takes familiar ideas and presents them in new, satisfying ways. Drawing on the similarities between Latin American and Southeast Asian ingredients, Head Chef Ryan Nile Choo showcases the best local and regional herbs, spices and aromatics, paired with seafood in bold new ways. Highlights include the octopus rigatoni and red prawn mafaldine. For those of you who don’t eat seafood, fear not, the iberico pork chop is a delicious alternative.\"},\n",

Apart from sourcing fully traceable seafood, you won’t find the creatures on full display in tanks here either. To maintain the quality of the ingredients, the kitchen team controls and monitors the living conditions down at the micro-ecosystem level as a sign of respect and appreciation not just to guests to dine here, but to the produce as well. We particularly enjoyed the White Pepper Alaskan King Crab, a meaty dish with a nuanced, floral spice that comes from the white pepper-infused stock.Long Beach Seafood Restaurant is best known for being the original creators of the Black Pepper Crab. Here, guests also enjoy servings of their Deep Fried Flat Noodles with La La King, a stir-fried hor fun dish with generous portions of clams and a fresh topping of fried hor fun. Dining with guests that aren’t a fan of seafood? The tender pork ribs are a must-try too.(Image credit: @longbeachseafood via Instagram)Palm Beach Seafood is perennially ranked amongst the city’s best offerings, and is not hard to see why. The King Prawn Soup is a comforting dish comprising vermicelli and tiger prawns that sit in a flavourful superior chicken stock made with evaporated milk, dried orange peel, Jin Hua ham, chilli oil, and lime juice. For a more unique take on the crowd-favourite crustacean, order the Crab Ala Singapura — it’s charcoal-grilled with melted mozzarella, aged parmesan cheese, creamy French butter, salt and pepper that’ll sit well with younger diners.(Image credit: @palmbeachsg via Instagram)Jumbo Seafood is almost synonymous with chilli crab here in Singapore. The household name prides itself on the classic rendition of this dish — sweet, savoury, and spicy all at once — that’s best had with a basket or two of crispy golden brown buns to lick up all of the sauce. The outlet at East Coast is popular for its alfresco dining situation complete with a cooling sea breeze on good days, and the Dempsey outlet, fashioned with a slightly more upscale interior is great for special occasions.(Image credit: @jumboseafoodsg via Instagram)'},\n",

Talk about setting. It presents a Japanese-European inspired menu that is all things modern and meatless.\\xa0It boldly innovates in its specially curated dishes, such as the Vegetable Sashimi on Ice with Oyster-Leaf Shooter Glass.

Admittedly, it’s difficult to picture Indonesian cuisine without the likes of ayam panggang and rendang. Yet, that is precisely what this humble eatery seeks to achieve with their vegetarian offerings. If you’re still unconvinced, just take a look at their Rendang Fried Rice (S$9.90).Featuring lion’s mane mushroom in place of meat, the rendang sauce here is equal parts smoky and heavy with the fragrance of coconut. It comes with an oozy egg yolk as well, so the whole dish is made even more satisfying and sumptuous.
